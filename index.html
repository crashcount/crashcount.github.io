Prosecutors allege Huiracocha recruited participants and Murillo drove in the staged collisions, including one where he switched seats with a passenger under a tarp. The plot unraveled when a victim provided dashcam footage of a crash on the Belt Parkway. Queens DA Melinda Katz said, "The prevalence of staged auto crimes has outraged New Yorkers." The case highlights reckless driver actions and exposes gaps in oversight that allowed repeated, orchestrated danger on public roads.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
