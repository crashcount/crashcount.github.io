A: A 32-year-old pedestrian, identified as Dilmania Lopez de Rodriguez, was fatally struck just after midnight at Bruckner Blvd and Leggett Ave, according to police and press reports. NYC Open Data also records a fatal crash involving vulnerable road users at that intersection around 12 AM on Aug 26, 2025. Sources: ABC7 and NYC Open Data.</li><li>Q: How many people have been hurt or killed in AD 84 since 2022?
A: According to NYC Open Data, there have been 1,096 crashes, with 7 people killed and 752 injured, including 16 serious injuries, from Jan 1, 2022 through Sep 3, 2025.</li><li>Q: Where are the worst danger spots?
A: District data point to Bruckner Blvd (3 deaths, 78 injuries) and E 149 St (1 death, 54 injuries) as hotspots since 2022. Source: NYC Open Data.</li><li>Q: What are officials doing about repeat speeders?
A: Assembly Member Amanda Septimo is recorded as a co-sponsor of A 2299, which would require intelligent speed assistance for repeat offenders. On June 17, S 8344 to extend and fix school speed zones advanced while Septimo was marked excused on that vote. Sources: Open States A 2299 and S 8344.</li><li>Q: How were these numbers calculated?
A: We used NYC Open Data’s Motor Vehicle Collisions datasets: Crashes (h9gi-nx95), Persons (f55k-p6yu), and Vehicles (bm4k-52h4). We filtered records from 2022-01-01 to 2025-09-03 and mapped crash locations to Assembly District 84 (covering NTAs BX0101, BX0102, BX0201, BX0401, BX0491). We counted total crashes, people killed, injured, and serious injuries, and tallied corridor-level hotspots and hourly counts from those filtered records. Data were extracted Sep 3, 2025. You can start from the Crashes dataset <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>here</a> and apply the same date and geography filters.</li><li>Q: What is CrashCount?
A: We&rsquo;re a tool for helping hold local politicians and other actors accountable for their failure to protect you when you&rsquo;re walking or cycling in NYC. We update our site constantly to provide you with up to date information on what&rsquo;s happening in your neighborhood.</li></ul><h4 id=citations>Citations</h4><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

A: We used NYC Open Data’s Motor Vehicle Collisions datasets (Crashes h9gi-nx95, Persons f55k-p6yu, Vehicles bm4k-52h4). We filtered for incidents in New York City between 2022-01-01 and 2025-09-03 and used the latest site snapshot (Open Data as of Sep 3, 2025). Citywide totals over the last 12 months (crashes, fatalities, injuries, serious injuries) and pedestrian harm by vehicle type come from these datasets. You can open the base datasets <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>here</a>, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>here</a>, and <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Vehicles/bm4k-52h4>here</a>.</li><li>Q: Why focus on pedestrians in these examples?
A: Both recent fatal crashes involved pedestrians, and pedestrian deaths and injuries are a large share of the city’s traffic violence burden, as shown in the Persons dataset and the last‑12‑months roll‑ups from NYC Open Data.</li><li>Q: What policies could reduce these deaths now?
A: Two citywide steps are on the table: lower NYC’s default speed limit using the authority described in Sammy’s Law, and pass the Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045C/A2299C) to mandate intelligent speed assistance for repeat offenders.

We update our site constantly to provide you with up to date information on what&rsquo;s happening in your neighborhood.</li><li>Q: Are police chases part of the risk on city streets?
A: Yes. New York’s attorney general has warned that police vehicle pursuits and high‑speed chases &ldquo;can be dangerous and even fatal,&rdquo; calling for change. This is documented by the Times Union report we cite.</li></ul><h4 id=citations-2>Citations</h4><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-link-45deg mr2"></i>

A: In the last 12 months, crash records list 789 crashes, 397 injuries, and 2 deaths within Brooklyn CB6. Source: NYC Open Data collision datasets, accessed Sep 3, 2025.</li><li>Q: Where are the worst trouble spots?
A: The BQE through CB6 and its ramps near Atlantic Ave rank highest for combined harm. Flatbush Ave and 7 Ave also see repeated turning crashes. Source: NYC Open Data crash records, accessed Sep 3, 2025.</li><li>Q: Which policies could reduce repeats and speeds?

A: Brooklyn Community Board 6, which includes the Carroll Gardens–Cobble Hill–Gowanus–Red Hook and Park Slope neighborhoods.</li><li>Q: How many people have been hurt or killed here since 2022?
A: According to NYC’s crash database, there have been 789 crashes causing 397 injuries and 2 deaths in Brooklyn CB6 from Jan 1, 2022 to Sep 3, 2025 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>source</a>).</li><li>Q: Where are the worst spots?
A: The BQE near Atlantic Avenue and its ramp are the top local hotspots for harm in this period.

A: Daylighting intersections to improve visibility, hardening turns and adding signal lead times where turning drivers hit pedestrians, and passing speed‑limiter requirements for repeat speeders (S4045/A2299).

Left turns show up again and again in pedestrian harm here: a 68‑year‑old crossing with the signal at Flatlands Ave and E 84 St was hit by a turning sedan on May 1 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4809832</a>).

The 4–8 PM stretch carries the most injuries in this neighborhood’s record, and the lone death in the last year hit in the 6 PM hour (small‑area rollup of <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). That is school let‑out, commutes, groceries. It is also when a missed yield becomes a broken body.</p><p>What leaders have done — and not done</p><p>Some steps are real. State Senator <a href=/senate-district/19/>Roxanne Persaud</a> voted yes in committee on the <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (S 4045)</strong> to require intelligent speed limiters for repeat violators (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). Assembly Member <a href=/assembly-district/59/>Jaime Williams</a> backed an extension of school speed zones (S 8344) in committee, aimed at child safety (timeline stance).</p><p>At City Hall, Council Member <a href=/council-district/46/>Mercedes Narcisse</a> has moved bills on parking‑ticket fee relief and commuter van enforcement (committee items), and she sponsored legalizing jaywalking to end biased stops (hearing and vote coverage in context). But the crashes on Glenwood, Remsen, and Flatlands keep coming.</p><p>What will actually cut the bloodshed</p><ul><li>Harden the turns. At Glenwood and Flatlands, where left‑turn strikes recur, install daylighting, leading pedestrian intervals, and hardened centerlines to slow turns and open sightlines (supported by local crash details above and small‑area injury patterns from <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>Protect the crosswalks. Use barriers and no‑parking zones near crosswalks on Remsen Ave and Avenue J — a listed hotspot — to keep people visible (small‑area rollup of <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>Tame the speed. Citywide fixes are on the table. Lower the default limit using Sammy’s Law and pass the speed‑limiter bill’s Assembly companion. Our step‑by‑step actions are <a href=/take_action/>here</a>.</li></ul><p>One corner. One rider on the pavement. It keeps repeating until someone slows the cars and hardens the turns.</p><p>Act: Tell City Hall to lower speeds and Albany to rein in repeat speeders.

Source: NYC Open Data crash table and CrashCount’s small‑area analysis.</li><li>Q: What can officials do now?
A: State lawmakers can pass S 4045 to require intelligent speed assistance for repeat violators. The City can lower default speeds and install daylighting and LPIs at hotspots. Sen.
