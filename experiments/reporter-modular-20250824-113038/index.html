A: Police said a driver hit a 52-year-old man crossing 155th Street and South Conduit Avenue around 2:30 a.m., then fled. The man was taken to Jamaica Hospital and pronounced dead. Detectives from the NYPD’s Collision Investigation Squad are investigating, according to Gothamist’s report.</li><li>Q: What do we know about the Astoria food truck crash?
A: Police and press reports say an 84-year-old Toyota driver lost control at 19th Avenue and 42nd Street, killing himself and two men at a food cart: Joaquin Venancio‑Mendez, 41, and Santiago Baires, 70. Witnesses told CBS the car “slammed into the men.”</li><li>Q: What types of vehicles caused injuries and deaths to pedestrians in New York City?
A: Cars and Trucks: SUVs and cars caused 69 pedestrian deaths and 4,689 injuries; trucks and buses caused 15 deaths and 424 injuries. Motorcycles and Mopeds: motorcycles and mopeds caused 3 deaths and 158 injuries. Bikes: bicycles caused 2 deaths and 230 injuries. Figures are from the current period rollup in the data.</li><li>Q: What does it take to change traffic laws here?
A: Real change takes both city and state. Local street redesigns and speed-limit choices need the City Council and the mayor. State tools like automated enforcement and broader mandates require bills to pass the State Assembly and Senate and be signed by the Governor. Local officials can push, but they can’t act alone.</li><li>Q: What is CrashCount?
A: We&rsquo;re a tool for helping hold local politicians and other actors accountable for their failure to protect you when you&rsquo;re walking or cycling in NYC.

A Queens judge heard a different kind of wreckage: a man who turned his car into a weapon on the Clearview. “Joseph Lee terrorized other drivers as he purposefully drove the wrong way,” the Queens DA said. Lee told police he “entered the Clearview Expressway in the wrong direction because I wanted to hurt people and I felt ‘liberated’ by what I had done.” <a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY reported the quotes and the eight-year sentence</a>.

A: Two pedestrians—Joaquin Venancio-Mendez, 41, and Santiago Baires, 70—were killed when a car slammed into a food truck in Queens. amNY reported the car “careened at a high speed” into the cart, and CBS New York said witnesses called it a “speeding car” that “slammed into the men.” Sources: amNY and CBS New York.</li><li>Q: What do we know about the JFK hit-and-run?
A: A 52-year-old man crossing near 155th Street and South Conduit Avenue was struck and killed around 2:30 a.m. The driver fled. “The operator of the vehicle fled the scene after hitting the man,” ABC7 reported. Gothamist said detectives were investigating and the man died at Jamaica Hospital. Sources: ABC7 and Gothamist.</li><li>Q: What types of vehicles caused injuries and deaths to pedestrians in qn0602?
A: According to current data provided, there are 0 total deaths and injuries recorded in this period breakdown. By group: Cars and Trucks: 0; Motorcycles and Mopeds: 0; Bikes: 0.</li><li>Q: What does it take to change traffic laws here?
A: Real change often needs both city and state. Street redesigns and local rules need backing from your council member, passage by the City Council, and the mayor’s signature. State tools like automated enforcement and speed limiters require Albany: a bill must pass the State Assembly and Senate and be signed by the Governor, as with S 4045 and A 7979. Local officials can push, but they can’t act alone.</li><li>Q: What is CrashCount?
A: We&rsquo;re a tool for helping hold local politicians and other actors accountable for their failure to protect you when you&rsquo;re walking or cycling in NYC. We update our site constantly to provide you with up to date information on what&rsquo;s happening in your neighborhood.</li></ul><h4 id=citations-5>Citations</h4><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A: Start with Council Member Kamillah Hanks and Assembly Member Sam Pirozzolo. Ask them to back a citywide 20 mph default and to support state action on speed limiters. Then press your State Senator to pass <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>.</li><li>Q: What types of vehicles caused injuries and deaths to pedestrians in SD 23?

Bikes: 5 pedestrian injuries, no deaths. These totals come from the district rollup for the current period.</li><li>Q: What does it take to change traffic laws here?
A: Street fixes like redesigns need backing from your council member (in SD 23, that’s <a href=/council-district/49/>Kamillah Hanks</a>), a City Council vote, and the mayor’s signature. State tools like speed cameras or speed limiters need Albany: a bill must pass the State Assembly and Senate and be signed by the Governor, like with <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>. Local officials can advocate, but they can’t act alone. Real change takes both City Hall and the Capitol working in tandem.</li><li>Q: What is CrashCount?
