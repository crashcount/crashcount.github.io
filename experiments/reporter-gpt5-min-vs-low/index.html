A: We used NYC Open Data’s Motor Vehicle Collisions datasets (Crashes h9gi-nx95; Persons f55k-p6yu; Vehicles bm4k-52h4). We filtered for New York City crashes from Jan 1, 2022 through Aug 28, 2025, then summed deaths, injuries, and serious injuries citywide. Data was accessed Aug 28, 2025.

A: We used NYC Open Data’s Motor Vehicle Collisions datasets (Crashes h9gi-nx95, Persons f55k-p6yu, Vehicles bm4k-52h4). Filters: geography = New York City; date window = 2022-01-01 to 2025-08-28; modes/roles as listed in the records. We summed crashes, injuries, and deaths as reported in the dataset’s fields and used the portal’s export as of Aug 27–28, 2025.

A: We used the NYC Open Data Motor Vehicle Collisions datasets (Crashes: h9gi-nx95; Persons: f55k-p6yu; Vehicles: bm4k-52h4). We filtered for the period 2022-01-01 to 2025-08-28 and geographically to Senate District 23 via a spatial join to the district boundary. Counts include all modes. Data were accessed Aug 28, 2025. Base datasets are linked <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>here</a>. The Open Data portal does not provide a native SD 23 filter URL; reproducing our totals requires the same spatial join.</li><li>Q: What is CrashCount?
A: We&rsquo;re a tool for helping hold local politicians and other actors accountable for their failure to protect you when you&rsquo;re walking or cycling in NYC.
