Three city senators, including Scarcella‑Spanton, voted no on renewing school‑zone cameras, which later passed (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><h3 id=what-would-stop-the-next-one>What would stop the next one?</h3><p>Lower the default speed citywide. Use the law we have. Fit the worst repeat offenders with speed‑limiters. Both steps are on the table now.
