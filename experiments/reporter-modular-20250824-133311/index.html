Police said he died at Jamaica Hospital. Detectives are investigating the hit-and-run <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-in-hit-and-run-near-jfk-airport-police-say>near JFK</a>. The city’s own record lists the same spot and time, with the pedestrian killed and the driver gone (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYPD crash data, CrashID 4834786</a>).</p></li><li><p>In Astoria, a Toyota jumped the curb and slammed a food cart. Two men were killed. The 84-year-old driver also died. Police told reporters the car “careened at a high speed into a nearby food truck” and that the driver had suffered a stroke two weeks earlier and was told not to drive (<a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/queens/carnage-queens-senior-driver-stroke-crash/>amNY</a>). A broadcast the next day echoed it: “Two pedestrians were hit and killed while ordering from a food truck in Queens” (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-pedestrians-1-driver-killed-when-car-slams-into-food-truck-in-queens/>CBS New York</a>).</p></li><li><p>On Macombs Road at West 174th, the record says “Driver Inattention/Distraction.” A 44-year-old woman, not in the roadway, was struck and killed. The vehicle’s “center front end” did the damage. <strong>Apparent death.</strong> That is the line in the city file (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4833327</a>).</p></li></ul><p>Wrong way. Wrong speed. Wrong city.</p><p>Queens prosecutors said it plain after a separate case on the Clearview: “Joseph Lee terrorized other drivers as he purposefully drove the wrong way on a busy Queens highway and crashed into multiple cars.” A jury convicted him; a judge gave him eight years. Lee told police, “I entered the Clearview Expressway in the wrong direction because I wanted to hurt people” (<a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY</a>). The terror spreads far beyond highways. It waits at corners, bus stops, food carts.</p><p>The counts do not blink.</p><ul><li><p>In the last 12 months, NYC recorded <strong>182 dead</strong> and <strong>32,764 injured</strong> on its streets, across <strong>52,671 crashes</strong>. SUVs and cars killed most pedestrians: <strong>69 deaths</strong> and thousands hurt (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data rollup</a>).</p></li><li><p>Pedestrian fatalities in this period include people of every age. The city’s table lists deaths among seniors, workers, teens, and children. The columns keep going; the names do not appear (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data rollup</a>).</p></li></ul><p>Officials know what works — do they?</p><p>City Hall says it will redesign 14th Street “to improve the pedestrian experience,” with a $3 million design funded by the city and two BIDs next year (<a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/15/redesign-of-14th-street-to-kick-off-next-year>NY1</a>). It’s one street.</p><p>Albany has already renewed 24/7 school‑zone speed cameras through 2030, and the law now lets NYC set lower limits on its own. The fix is simple: <strong>lower speeds save lives</strong>. Make 20 mph the norm and make it stick. Mandate intelligent speed assistance for the worst repeat offenders. Those are the steps that cut the harm. Take them.</p><p>Three corners. One fix.</p><ul><li>South Conduit at 155th. A man left in the road while a driver fled (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-in-hit-and-run-near-jfk-airport-police-say>Gothamist</a>).</li><li>19th Avenue at 42nd Street.
