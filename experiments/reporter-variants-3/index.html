In City Hall, Council Member Shahana K. Hanif is the primary sponsor of a bill to force curb extensions at dangerous corners (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 0285‑2024</a>). She also co‑sponsors a bill to ban parking near crosswalks and harden daylighting at 1,000 intersections a year (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1138‑2024</a>).</p><p>At the state level, lawmakers rallied for the <strong>Stop Super Speeders</strong> bill to require repeat speeders to install speed limiters after a pattern of violations. “The speed limiter technology is available to us. Let’s use it. It will save lives,” Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon said at Borough Hall (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/stop-super-speeders-brooklyn-borough-hall/>Brooklyn Paper</a>).</p><p>Hanif has pressed for stronger safety policy citywide. “We need to have the political courage across all levels of government to create a city that is walkable, prioritizes pedestrians, and ends these senseless murders,” she said in 2023 (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/08/18/its-22-another-cyclist-has-been-killed-by-another-driver-who-has-not-been-charged>Streetsblog</a>).</p><p>Locally, the Assembly seat for this district is <a href=/assembly-district/44/>AD 44</a>, held by Robert Carroll in our lookup, and the State Senate seat is <a href=/senate-district/17/>SD 17</a>. The record here shows Hanif sponsoring daylighting and curb extensions. For the state speed‑limiter bill, the sponsors are in Albany; the question for our local delegation is simple: Will they put their names on it and push it across the line?

A: Four. NYC Open Data shows 1,003 crashes, 589 injuries, and 4 deaths in this period for District 39.</li><li>Q: Where are the worst hotspots right now?
A: Segments of the BQE, Ocean Parkway, and Center Drive inside Prospect Park show up among top injury and fatal sites in the district’s data.</li><li>Q: What policies could cut these crashes?
A: City bills Int 0285‑2024 (curb extensions at dangerous intersections) and Int 1138‑2024 (universal daylighting build‑out) are live. State lawmakers are pushing the Stop Super Speeders bill to force speed limiters on repeat offenders.</li><li>Q: Which local officials are responsible here?
A: Council Member Shahana K. Hanif sponsors the two Council bills. Our lookup places this area in AD 44 (Assembly Member Robert Carroll) and SD 17 (State Sen. Steve Chan). The state speed‑limiter bill needs action in Albany.</li><li>Q: What is CrashCount?
