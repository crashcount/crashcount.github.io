A: We used NYC Open Data’s Motor Vehicle Collisions datasets (Crashes: h9gi-nx95; Persons: f55k-p6yu; Vehicles: bm4k-52h4). We filtered records to New York City crashes dated 2022-01-01 through 2025-08-26 and counted fatalities from the Persons table and crashes from the Crashes table. You can reproduce our crash/death totals by applying the same date filter <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/h9gi-nx95.csv?$select=count(*)&$where=crash_date%20between%20%272022-01-01T00:00:00.000%27%20and%20%272025-08-26T23:59:59.000%27">here</a> for crashes and <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/f55k-p6yu.csv?$select=count(*)&$where=crash_date%20between%20%272022-01-01T00:00:00.000%27%20and%20%272025-08-26T23:59:59.000%27%20and%20involved_persons_injured%20is%20not%20null">here</a>.

A bike. A pickup. A body in the road.</h3><p>Just after 8 PM on Oct 30, 2024, at 4th Ave and Sackett Street, a 24-year-old bicyclist was struck and killed in a crash with a pickup truck. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a> lists the death under CrashID 4767852.</p><p>They were one of <strong>15 people killed</strong> on District 39 streets since Jan 1, 2022, alongside 2,555 injured and 24 seriously hurt, in 5,002 crashes. The record is public. It sits in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC’s crash files</a>.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-does-not-let-up>The pattern does not let up</h3><p>This year’s toll in the district is rising: crashes are up 25.6% year to date, with 1,019 crashes and 597 injuries through Aug 26, compared with 811 crashes and 414 injuries at this point last year. Deaths rose from 3 to 4. These figures come from the same <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a> series.</p><p>The afternoon hour around 3 PM is the deadliest in the district’s ledger over the period, with three deaths recorded then. The numbers are drawn from district-level crash timestamps in the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city dataset</a>.</p><h3 id=corners-with-names-and-blood>Corners with names and blood</h3><p>Ocean Parkway at Avenue C is in the file too: a woman was killed crossing outside an intersection by an SUV driver on Aug 9, 2025. The death is logged at that corner in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>The district’s worst sites read like a map you learn by heart: the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, Union Street, Caton Avenue, Flatbush Avenue, Ocean Parkway. They are flagged as top injury and death locations in the district rollup of the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city’s crash data</a>.</p><p>Across the period, the ledger attributes one district death to a driver who disregarded a traffic control, and one to alcohol involvement, with “other” listed most often. These categories come straight from the contributing-factor fields in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=bikes-and-feet-meet-steel>Bikes and feet meet steel</h3><p>Since 2022, four people on bikes and four people on foot were killed here; seven motor-vehicle occupants also died. Mode and outcome are drawn from the district’s crash/person records in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Trucks took lives in this span, and so did SUVs and sedans. Among pedestrians, trucks are linked to one death, while SUVs and cars appear most often in the injury counts. These tallies come from vehicle types recorded in the district’s <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Vehicles/bm4k-52h4>person and vehicle tables</a>.</p><h3 id=promises-and-paperwork>Promises and paperwork</h3><p>On Fourth Avenue, officials were warned. Electeds pressed DOT after the agency removed a protected bike lane during construction and opened a second car lane. The demand was simple: restore the protection and harden the space. The agency did not act then, according to <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/18/dot-continues-to-ignore-dangers-it-created-on-brooklyns-4th-ave>Streetsblog’s account of the letter</a>.</p><p>Council Member Shahana K.

She is the primary sponsor of a bill to install curb extensions at crash-heavy corners, five per borough each year (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 0285-2024</a>). She also co-sponsors a measure to ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and build out daylighting barriers at scale (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1138-2024</a>). On rising cyclist deaths, she said, “We need to have the political courage… to create a city that is walkable, prioritizes pedestrians, and ends these senseless murders.” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/08/18/its-22-another-cyclist-has-been-killed-by-another-driver-who-has-not-been-charged>Streetsblog, Aug 18, 2023</a>.</p><p>Assembly Member Robert Carroll joined a letter with six other Brooklyn officials urging universal daylighting with hardened materials at corners, and for the city to opt into the 20‑foot parking ban statewide. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/17/seven-brooklyn-electeds-join-growing-calls-for-universal-daylighting>Streetsblog, Jan 17, 2024</a>.</p><h3 id=what-would-actually-cut-the-body-count>What would actually cut the body count?</h3><p>Start on the worst blocks. Harden daylighting at Union Street and other flagged sites; build concrete curb extensions; add truck-calming and protected space where bikes and feet already flow.

A small group of repeat violators does the most harm. Lawmakers gathered this spring to back the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force serial violators to use speed limiters. Council Member Hanif stood with them at Borough Hall. <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/stop-super-speeders-brooklyn-borough-hall/>Brooklyn Paper, Apr 1, 2025</a>.</p><p>The street files from this district already show what speed and size do to a human body.

The City can lower default speeds on local streets; see our steps at <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</li><li>Q: How were these numbers calculated?
A: We pulled crash, person, and vehicle records from NYC Open Data’s Motor Vehicle Collisions datasets and filtered them to the Williamsbridge‑Olinville NTA for the period 2022‑01‑01 through 2025‑08‑26. We used crash timestamps, on‑/off‑street fields, and a spatial filter to the NTA boundary to produce totals (deaths, injuries), hourly distributions, and location tallies.

A: Your State Senator is Leroy Comrie; your Assembly Member is Alicia Hyndman; your Council Member is Nantasha Williams. This report uses their official districts as defined in the context.</li><li>Q: How were these numbers calculated?
A: We used the NYPD’s NYC Open Data crash datasets: Motor Vehicle Collisions – Crashes (h9gi‑nx95), Persons (f55k‑p6yu), and Vehicles (bm4k‑52h4). We filtered records to the date range 2022‑01‑01 through 2025‑08‑26 and assigned crashes to Senate District 14 using our district boundary overlay. Counts of crashes, injuries, serious injuries, and deaths come directly from those fields. Data were accessed Aug 26, 2025.
