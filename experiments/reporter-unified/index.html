A: We&rsquo;re a tool for helping hold local politicians and other actors accountable for their failure to protect you when you&rsquo;re walking or cycling in NYC. We update our site constantly to provide you with up to date information on what&rsquo;s happening in your neighborhood.</li><li>Q: How were these numbers calculated?
A: We used NYC Open Data’s Motor Vehicle Collisions datasets — Crashes (h9gi-nx95), Persons (f55k-p6yu), and Vehicles (bm4k-52h4) — filtered to New York City for the period covered by this report (2022-01-01 to 2025-08-29) and the latest 12-month window reported in our source extract (as of Aug 27, 2025). We counted total crashes, injuries, and deaths from the Crashes table, and pedestrian outcomes by vehicle type by joining the Persons and Vehicles tables.

A: This report covers New York State Senate District 23, which includes parts of Staten Island and southern Brooklyn. It belongs to borough Staten Island, city council district District 49 and assembly district AD 63.</li><li>Q: How many people have been hurt or killed here?
A: From Jan 1, 2022 through Aug 29, 2025, there were 2,086 crashes, 1,280 injuries, 12 serious injuries, and 5 deaths in SD 23, based on NYC Open Data crash records.</li><li>Q: What policies are on the table now?
A: The State Senate advanced S 4045 to require intelligent speed assistance for repeat violators (eleven or more points in 24 months, or six camera tickets in a year). Albany also renewed NYC’s 24‑hour school‑zone speed‑camera program.</li><li>Q: Who are my local officials?
A: Your Assembly Member is Sam Pirozzolo (AD 63). Your City Council Member is Kamillah Hanks (District 49). Your State Senator is Jessica Scarcella‑Spanton (SD 23).</li><li>Q: How were these numbers calculated?

We filtered records from 2022‑01‑01 to 2025‑08‑29 that fall within State Senate District 23 using district boundaries. Totals reflect all crash records in that window. You can view the base datasets <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>here</a>, with related tables linked from that page.
