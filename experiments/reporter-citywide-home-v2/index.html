A: We pulled NYC’s Motor Vehicle Collisions data (Crashes, Persons, Vehicles) from NYC Open Data on Aug 26, 2025. We filtered crashes citywide between 2022-01-01 and 2025-08-26 and counted deaths and injuries using the dataset’s crash_date and person injury fields. You can reproduce totals with Socrata queries: all deaths since 2022-01-01 <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/h9gi-nx95.json?$select=count(*)&$where=crash_date%20between%20'2022-01-01T00:00:00'%20and%20'2025-08-26T23:59:59'">here</a>, and year-to-date 2025 deaths <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/h9gi-nx95.json?$select=count(*)&$where=crash_date%20between%20'2025-01-01T00:00:00'%20and%20'2025-08-26T23:59:59'">here</a>. Pedestrian deaths by vehicle type are from the same period using the Persons and Vehicles tables joined by collision_id; our rollup corresponds to the SUV and sedan counts shown in our analysis.</li><li>Q: What happened near JFK on Aug 13, 2025?
A: Police said a driver struck a 52-year-old man crossing at 155th Street and South Conduit Avenue around 2:30 AM and fled. The man died at Jamaica Hospital. “The operator of the vehicle fled the scene after hitting the man,” ABC7 reported. Sources: <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/police-investigate-hit-run-death-springfield-gardens-queens-john-kennedy-international-airport/17524816/>ABC7</a>, <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-in-hit-and-run-near-jfk-airport-police-say>Gothamist</a>.</li><li>Q: What is CrashCount?
A: We&rsquo;re a tool for helping hold local politicians and other actors accountable for their failure to protect you when you&rsquo;re walking or cycling in NYC. We update our site constantly to provide you with up to date information on what&rsquo;s happening in your neighborhood.</li><li>Q: Why highlight SUVs and sedans?
A: From Jan 1, 2022 through Aug 26, 2025, NYC records attribute pedestrian fatalities to SUVs (204) and sedans (95) more than other vehicle types. Source: NYC Open Data crash datasets, period totals reflected in our analysis (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>dataset</a>).</li><li>Q: What can I do right now?
A: Push the city to slow speeds and rein in repeat speeders. We list contacts and scripts to lower the default limit and require speed limiters for habitual offenders <a href=/take_action/>here</a>.</li></ul><h4 id=citations>Citations</h4><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

A: We&rsquo;re a tool for helping hold local politicians and other actors accountable for their failure to protect you when you&rsquo;re walking or cycling in NYC. We update our site constantly to provide you with up to date information on what&rsquo;s happening in your neighborhood.</li><li>Q: How were these numbers calculated?
A: We pulled records from NYC Open Data’s Motor Vehicle Collisions datasets: Crashes (h9gi-nx95), Persons (f55k-p6yu), and Vehicles (bm4k-52h4). We filtered for crash_date between 2022-01-01 and 2025-08-26, all NYC geographies. We counted totals for deaths, injuries, and serious injuries from the Persons table (fields: person_type, injury_severity) and matched to overall crash counts in the Crashes table. Data was accessed Aug 26, 2025. You can reproduce the pull using a date filter <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95?$where=crash_date%20between%20'2022-01-01T00:00:00'%20and%20'2025-08-26T23:59:59'">here</a> and the Persons table <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu?$where=crash_date%20between%20'2022-01-01T00:00:00'%20and%20'2025-08-26T23:59:59'">here</a>.</li><li>Q: Where did the JFK hit-and-run details come from?
A: They come from local outlets citing NYPD: Gothamist and ABC7 report the man was struck near 155th Street and South Conduit Avenue around 2:30 AM on Aug 13, 2025, and that the driver fled. See Gothamist and ABC7 in the citations.</li><li>Q: Why mention wrong-way driving?
A: Queens prosecutors secured an eight-year sentence after a driver went the wrong way on the Clearview Expressway, crashing into multiple cars and injuring motorists. The DA’s quote and the driver’s own words are in the amNY report cited above.</li><li>Q: What can I do right now?
A: Ask City Hall to lower the default residential speed limit and press Albany to pass speed limiters for repeat speeders. We keep phone numbers and scripts here: /take_action/.</li></ul><h4 id=citations-1>Citations</h4><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-link-45deg mr2"></i>
