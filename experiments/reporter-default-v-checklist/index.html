The NYPD’s Collision Investigation Squad is on it. The city’s crash log lists an improper turn and a rider ejection at Bay and Norwood minutes earlier that day. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City data shows the fatal crash</a>.</p></li><li><p>On March 7 at Hylan Boulevard and Benton Avenue, an 80‑year‑old man was struck at the intersection and died of head wounds. The SUV kept straight. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City records mark the death</a>.</p></li><li><p>On May 17 at Targee and Pierce, a 58‑year‑old man was killed outside a crosswalk. A moped rider was ejected and survived. Two parked cars were hit. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The crash file names a pedestrian death and crush injuries</a>.</p></li></ul><p>Hylan’s mixed signals</p><ul><li><p>This year on Hylan Boulevard, right turns from the middle lane have become a crash script. Borough President Vito Fossella put it like this: “That’s one accident every four days where somebody perhaps unwittingly thinks they must turn from the middle lane in order to make a right‑hand turn.” He added, “But other than those hours of 6 to 9 a.m. going toward the Verrazzano Bridge and 3 to 7 p.m. going toward Tottenville, the bus lane is open for use.” <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/bus-lanes-staten-island-hylan-boulevard/>amNY tallied the confusion and collisions</a>.</p></li><li><p>March and May brought more sirens. A man pinned under a city bus at East 12th Street and Avenue Z in Sheepshead Bay, left‑turn hit, critical. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-87-is-critically-injured-after-mta-bus-driver-strikes-him-in-brooklyn-nypd>Gothamist reported the NYPD’s early findings</a>.</p></li></ul><p>A boy on a moped at 1 a.m.</p><ul><li>August 5, Port Richmond. A 13‑year‑old on a moped hit an eastbound MTA bus at Castleton and Park. He was ejected and suffered a severe head injury. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/13-year-old-boy-injured-port-richmond-staten-island-moped-collides-bus/17438785/>ABC7 said he was critical at Richmond University</a>. The MTA said the moped “went through a stop sign without stopping and hit the bus.” <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/moped-bus-collision-staten-island/>amNY published the statement</a>. DMV rules are blunt: “You must have a driver license and register your moped to drive it on streets and highways.” <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/moped-bus-collision-staten-island/>amNY cited the DMV page</a>. The Highway District is investigating. No arrests.</li></ul><p>What the ledger says</p><ul><li><p>In this district, the last year holds <strong>2,057 crashes</strong>, <strong>1,259 injuries</strong>, <strong>12 serious injuries</strong>, and <strong>5 dead</strong>. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Those counts come from the city’s database</a>. Most pedestrian injuries here involve sedans and SUVs.

The pain does not stop at the Narrows.</p></li></ul><p>Who moves to slow this down?</p><ul><li><p>Albany advanced one tool. The Senate moved S 4045, to force speed‑limiting tech on repeat violators. The vote was yes in committee here. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States logs the bill and the vote</a>.</p></li><li><p>Another tool is already on the streets: school‑zone speed cameras. But when the city sought to renew and expand them, some city lawmakers fought it. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>Streetsblog named the city pols who voted no</a>.</p></li></ul><p>What must change</p><ul><li>Lower the default speed. Fewer names added to the list.</li><li>Stop the worst repeat speeders with <strong>intelligent speed assistance</strong>. S 4045 is the path on paper. Lives are the stake.</li></ul><p>If you want it to stop, say so. Start here: <strong><a href=/take_action/>Take action</a></strong>.</p><h4 id=faq-4>FAQ</h4><ul><li>Q: Where did these crashes happen?

A: amNY reported 32 crashes tied to drivers making right turns from the middle lane amid inconsistent bus-lane signs. Borough President Vito Fossella said that’s “one accident every four days.” Source: amNY.</li><li>Q: What is CrashCount?
