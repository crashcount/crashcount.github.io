A: We used NYC Open Data’s Motor Vehicle Collisions datasets for Crashes (h9gi‑nx95), Persons (f55k‑p6yu), and Vehicles (bm4k‑52h4). We filtered for all NYC records with crash dates from 2022‑01‑01 through 2025‑08‑28. We counted total crashes, total deaths, injuries, and serious injuries from the fields provided (e.g., injury severity in the Persons table). Data were extracted as of Aug 27, 2025.

A: We&rsquo;re a tool for helping hold local politicians and other actors accountable for their failure to protect you when you&rsquo;re walking or cycling in NYC. We update our site constantly to provide you with up to date information on what&rsquo;s happening in your neighborhood.</li></ul><h4 id=citations>Citations</h4><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The city and the Legislature can act now.</p><p>A plain next step</p><p>One clear move stands out. The City can lower the default speed limit in residential streets and expand 20 MPH places now. The State and City can require intelligent speed‑assistance devices for habitual camera offenders or high‑point drivers. The bills and fixes named in our coverage map this path. See S 8344 for one recent state action on school speed zones (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Open States, S 8344</a>).

A: We used NYC Open Data’s Motor Vehicle Collisions datasets (Crashes h9gi-nx95, Persons f55k-p6yu, Vehicles bm4k-52h4). We filtered records to the coverage window (2022-01-01 to 2025-08-28) and to Senate District 23 using the platform’s geographic tags. We counted totals for crashes, injuries, deaths, and serious injuries. Data last extracted Aug 27, 2025.
