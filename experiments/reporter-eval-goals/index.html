A: Police said a driver struck a 52-year-old man crossing 155th Street and South Conduit Avenue in Queens about 2:30 AM and fled. The man was taken to Jamaica Hospital and pronounced dead.

A: Our analysis of city crash records shows 1,107 traffic deaths from Jan 1, 2022 through Aug 26, 2025. Source: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash portal</a>.</li><li>Q: How were these numbers calculated?
A: We used NYC Open Data’s Motor Vehicle Collisions datasets: Crashes (h9gi-nx95), Persons (f55k-p6yu), and Vehicles (bm4k-52h4). Filters: crash_date between 2022-01-01 and 2025-08-26; geography: New York City; modes: all. Death counts come from the Persons table where injury_severity = 5 (fatal). You can run similar filtered queries starting <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>here</a>. Data accessed Aug 26, 2025.</li><li>Q: What can change this now?
A: Lower the citywide speed limit and force repeat speeders to slow down with mandatory speed limiters. See concrete steps and call scripts <a href=/take_action/>here</a>.</li><li>Q: What is CrashCount?
A: We&rsquo;re a tool for helping hold local politicians and other actors accountable for their failure to protect you when you&rsquo;re walking or cycling in NYC. We update our site constantly to provide you with up to date information on what&rsquo;s happening in your neighborhood.</li></ul><h4 id=citations>Citations</h4><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-link-45deg mr2"></i>

A: On Aug 12, 2025, two pedestrians and an 84‑year‑old driver were killed in a multi‑vehicle crash that involved a turning SUV at 42nd St and 19th Ave in Astoria, Queens. Details come from the NYC Open Data crash record for CrashID 4834594 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>source</a>).</li><li>Q: How many people have been killed on NYC streets since 2022?
A: From Jan 1, 2022 through Aug 26, 2025, 1,107 people were killed in traffic crashes citywide, based on NYC’s collisions datasets as of Aug 26, 2025 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>source</a>).</li><li>Q: What do we know about the JFK hit‑and‑run?
A: Around 2:30 AM on Aug 13, 2025, a driver hit a 52‑year‑old man crossing 155th St at South Conduit Ave near JFK and fled. Police said, “The operator of the vehicle fled the scene after hitting the man.” No arrests were reported that day (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/police-investigate-hit-run-death-springfield-gardens-queens-john-kennedy-international-airport/17524816/>ABC7</a>; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-in-hit-and-run-near-jfk-airport-police-say>Gothamist</a>).</li><li>Q: How were these numbers calculated?
A: We used NYC’s Motor Vehicle Collisions datasets (Crashes h9gi-nx95, Persons f55k-p6yu, Vehicles bm4k-52h4) for NYC, covering 2022‑01‑01 to 2025‑08‑26, as available on Aug 26, 2025. We counted citywide fatalities using the Persons table’s injury severity field (“Killed”) and cross‑checked crash locations and times in the Crashes table. You can browse the base datasets <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>here</a> and the related <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>Persons</a> and <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Vehicles/bm4k-52h4>Vehicles</a> tables.</li><li>Q: What is CrashCount?
A: We&rsquo;re a tool for helping hold local politicians and other actors accountable for their failure to protect you when you&rsquo;re walking or cycling in NYC. We update our site constantly to provide you with up to date information on what&rsquo;s happening in your neighborhood.</li></ul><h4 id=citations-1>Citations</h4><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

A: CrashCount analyzed NYC’s Motor Vehicle Collisions datasets for Crashes (h9gi‑nx95), Persons (f55k‑p6yu), and Vehicles (bm4k‑52h4), filtered to Council District 39 and the window 2022‑01‑01 to 2025‑08‑26. We used injury severity, person type, street names, and crash timestamps to count deaths, injuries, and highlight locations and hours. You can start from the Crashes dataset <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>here</a> and apply those filters. Data accessed Aug 26, 2025.</li><li>Q: What is CrashCount?
A: We&rsquo;re a tool for helping hold local politicians and other actors accountable for their failure to protect you when you&rsquo;re walking or cycling in NYC.
