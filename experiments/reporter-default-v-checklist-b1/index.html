A: Police said a driver struck a 52‑year‑old man at 155th Street and South Conduit Avenue around 2:30 a.m. and fled. The man was taken to Jamaica Hospital and pronounced dead. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-in-hit-and-run-near-jfk-airport-police-say>Gothamist</a>.</li><li>Q: How many people has traffic violence killed in NYC since 2022?
A: From Jan. 1, 2022, through Aug. 26, 2025, NYC recorded 182 traffic deaths, with 32,764 injuries and 491 serious injuries across 52,671 crashes. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</li><li>Q: Are there recent examples that show the pattern?
A: Yes. Two men were killed at a Queens food cart on Aug. 12, 2025, in a crash that also killed the driver, according to <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/queens/carnage-queens-senior-driver-stroke-crash/>amNY</a> and <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-pedestrians-1-driver-killed-when-car-slams-into-food-truck-in-queens/>CBS New York</a>.

A: We used NYC’s Motor Vehicle Collisions datasets for Crashes, Persons, and Vehicles, filtered to 2022‑01‑01 through 2025‑08‑26, citywide. Deaths are rows in the Persons dataset where es=&lsquo;Apparent Death&rsquo;. Example reproducible query: Persons count of deaths — <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/f55k-p6yu.json?$select=count(1)&$where=es=%27Apparent%20Death%27%20AND%20crash_date%20between%20%272022-01-01T00:00:00%27%20and%20%272025-08-26T23:59:59%27">https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/f55k-p6yu.json?$select=count(1)&$where=es=%27Apparent%20Death%27%20AND%20crash_date%20between%20%272022-01-01T00:00:00%27%20and%20%272025-08-26T23:59:59%27</a>. Crash totals come from the Crashes dataset with the same date filter — <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/h9gi-nx95.json?$select=count(1)&$where=crash_date%20between%20%272022-01-01T00:00:00%27%20and%20%272025-08-26T23:59:59%27">https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/h9gi-nx95.json?$select=count(1)&$where=crash_date%20between%20%272022-01-01T00:00:00%27%20and%20%272025-08-26T23:59:59%27</a>. Data accessed Aug. 26, 2025.</li><li>Q: What is CrashCount?
A: We&rsquo;re a tool for helping hold local politicians and other actors accountable for their failure to protect you when you&rsquo;re walking or cycling in NYC. We update our site constantly to provide you with up to date information on what&rsquo;s happening in your neighborhood.</li><li>Q: What policies can stop repeat harm now?
A: NYC can lower speed limits under Sammy’s Law and Albany can pass the Stop Super Speeders Act to require intelligent speed assistance for habitual violators. Learn more and take action at <a href=/take_action/>/take_action/</a>.</li><li>Q: Did officials interfere with a street safety plan?
A: Prosecutors allege a former mayoral adviser meddled in the McGuinness Boulevard redesign while taking favors; the adviser pleaded not guilty. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/vision-12500-how-suspected-corruption-spilled-into-battle-over-the-mcguinness-blvd-bike-lane>Gothamist</a> <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/mayor-adams-former-top-adviser-accused-of-wide-ranging-bribery-schemes>Gothamist</a>.</li></ul><h4 id=citations>Citations</h4><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-link-45deg mr2"></i>

A: We&rsquo;re a tool for helping hold local politicians and other actors accountable for their failure to protect you when you&rsquo;re walking or cycling in NYC. We update our site constantly to provide you with up to date information on what&rsquo;s happening in your neighborhood.</li><li>Q: How many people were killed on NYC streets in this period?
A: City data show 182 people killed on NYC streets between Jan 1, 2022 and Aug 26, 2025. Source: NYC Open Data Motor Vehicle Collisions.</li><li>Q: Where did the Ocean Parkway death come from?
A: From NYC Open Data’s Motor Vehicle Collisions dataset (CrashID 4833650). The record lists a 45-year-old pedestrian killed at Ocean Parkway and Avenue C at 1:02 a.m. by a southbound SUV that was merging.</li><li>Q: How were these numbers calculated?
A: We used NYC’s Motor Vehicle Collisions datasets (Crashes: h9gi-nx95; Persons: f55k-p6yu; Vehicles: bm4k-52h4). We filtered for crash_date between 2022-01-01 and 2025-08-26 across all NYC and summed number_of_persons_killed. Extracted Aug 26, 2025. Reproduce it here: <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/h9gi-nx95.json?$select=sum(number_of_persons_killed)&$where=crash_date%20between%20'2022-01-01T00:00:00'%20and%20'2025-08-26T23:59:59'">https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/h9gi-nx95.json?$select=sum(number_of_persons_killed)&$where=crash_date%20between%20'2022-01-01T00:00:00'%20and%20'2025-08-26T23:59:59'</a>.</li><li>Q: What can stop repeat speeders and high-speed crashes?
A: Two steps are on the table now: 1) Use Sammy’s Law to set NYC’s default residential speed limit at 20 mph. 2) Pass the Stop Super Speeders Act to require speed limiters for drivers with repeated violations.
