The bodies keep falling. In the last twelve months, <strong>259 people died</strong> on New York City streets. <strong>733 were left with serious injuries</strong>. Each number is a name, a family, a life cut short or broken. In the same year, more than <strong>51,000 were hurt</strong>. The city’s roads do not forgive.</p><p>Just days ago, a driver in the Bronx failed a left turn and <strong>plowed into six people</strong>, sending them to the hospital. The driver ran. The sidewalk was not safe. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/driver-plows-into-six-people-after-botching-left-turn-in-the-bronx/>&ldquo;Cops are looking for a man who rammed into six people after botching a turn at an intersection in the Bronx,&rdquo;</a> the report said. The victims survived. This time.</p><p>In Brooklyn, a young woman sat on a curb. Her boyfriend spun his car in circles. The car lost control. She died. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>&ldquo;He lost control when he was doing donuts with the vehicle,&rdquo;</a> he told police. The tire marks stayed for days. The loss will last longer.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Older adults and children are not spared.</strong> In the past year, 25 people over 75 died. Eleven children under 18 died. The city’s most vulnerable are the first to bleed. Cars and SUVs do most of the killing—<strong>311 deaths</strong> since 2022. Trucks and buses, another <strong>95</strong>. Motorcycles and mopeds, <strong>10</strong>. Bikes, <strong>11</strong>. The street is a gauntlet.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>The city has started to act. Speed cameras now watch day and night. The law lets the city lower speed limits. But the default is still too high. Leaders talk about Vision Zero. The dead keep coming. The city can set a <strong>20 mph limit</strong> now. It has not. The cameras catch the reckless, but the worst repeat offenders keep driving. The council and the mayor have the power. They need to use it.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph citywide speed limit. Demand real consequences for repeat speeders.</strong> Every day of delay is another life at risk. The city will not change unless you force it.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
