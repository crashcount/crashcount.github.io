A car keeps going. The man does not get up. In the last twelve months, <strong>241 people died</strong> on New York City streets. <strong>700 were left with serious injuries</strong>—the kind that do not heal. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>More than 48,000 were hurt</a>. The city counts the bodies. The city moves on.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians, cyclists, children</strong>—the most fragile—take the worst of it. In the past year, <strong>12 children died</strong>. The old are not spared. <strong>24 people over 75</strong> did not survive the year. Every age, every borough, every block. The numbers do not flinch.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-the-blood-does-not-dry>Recent Crashes: The Blood Does Not Dry</h3><p>Just last week, a pedestrian was killed at Broadway and East New York Avenue. A moped rider died on Clarendon Road. A 22-year-old woman was ejected and killed on the Belt Parkway. The city’s map of grief grows by the day. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the full list of recent crashes</a>.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>Speed kills.</strong> Albany gave New York City the power to lower speed limits. The city has started to drop some zones to 20 mph. But the default speed is still too high. The law lets the city act. The city waits. Speed cameras are renewed. Red-light cameras will multiply. Streets are being redesigned, but not fast enough. Enforcement cracks down on the wrong targets—cyclists and delivery workers—while the deadliest drivers keep driving. <a href=../../take_action/>Review recent policy moves</a>.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs</strong> are the main killers. In three years, they caused <strong>301 deaths</strong> and over <strong>26,000 injuries</strong> to pedestrians. <strong>Trucks and buses</strong> killed 93. <strong>Motorcycles and mopeds</strong> killed 10. <strong>Bikes</strong> killed 11. The city blames the vulnerable. The city protects the powerful.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every death is a policy choice. <strong>Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph limit. Demand action against repeat speeders. Join the fight.</strong> <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
