Police said, <strong>“The driver sped off without stopping. No arrests have been made.”</strong> <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/13/queens-hit-and-run-driver-kills-52-year-old-man-near-jfk-airport/>source</a>. The city data logs it at South Conduit Ave and 155th St. A man walking. A car’s front end. One life gone.</p><p>The next morning in Astoria, an 84‑year‑old in a Toyota jumped the curb and crushed two men ordering food. A witness said, <strong>“I have never seen anything like this.”</strong> <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/queens/carnage-queens-senior-driver-stroke-crash/>amNY</a>. <strong>Two pedestrians died.</strong> The driver died too. The block filled with wreckage and sirens. Another family waited at a hospital that could not help.</p><p>Days earlier in the Bronx, a 44‑year‑old woman was struck on Macombs Rd at W 174 St. City records list <strong>driver distraction</strong> and <strong>“crush injuries.”</strong> She died there. A sidewalk. A body bag. Quiet after the tape comes down.</p><h3 id=the-system-talks-streets-dont-wait>The System Talks. Streets Don’t Wait.</h3><p>At City Hall, plans move at a designer’s pace. A <strong>14th Street redesign</strong> will “aim to improve the pedestrian experience,” NY1 reported <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/15/redesign-of-14th-street-to-kick-off-next-year>here</a>. Good, but the funerals are now. On the highways, the courts speak after the blood dries. After a 2023 wrong‑way rampage, the Queens DA said, <strong>“[He] terrorized other drivers as he purposefully drove the wrong way… and crashed into multiple cars.”</strong> <a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY</a>. <strong>Two motorists were badly hurt</strong> and, she added, <strong>“still have not fully recovered.”</strong> <a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY</a>.</p><h3 id=the-count-that-wont-stop>The Count That Won’t Stop</h3><p>Since 2022, NYC has logged <strong>1,105 deaths</strong> and <strong>194,320 injuries</strong> in crashes [city data]. Pedestrians keep taking the hit. Cars and SUVs have killed <strong>334</strong> pedestrians; trucks and buses, <strong>100</strong>; bikes, mopeds, and motorcycles, <strong>22</strong> combined. The file grows. The names don’t.</p><h3 id=what-works-whats-next>What Works.
