Streetsblog NYC reported the event, quoting riders: "I don’t think he cares if we die." No bill number or council committee is attached; this is a public action, not legislation. Council member Yoshi Omi-Jarrett responded with public comment, echoing outrage and fear. Cyclists say the mayor caved to a small voting bloc, ignoring the real threat from drivers. The city failed to add robust safety measures, like bus boarding islands, citing reluctance to remove parking. According to the safety analyst, the event text reflects a cyclist's perception of safety but does not describe a specific policy or legislative change; therefore, no direct safety impact can be assessed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Their proposal: turn Monitor Street into a cul-de-sac with a pedestrian plaza, add mid-block crossings, ban corner parking, and close a slip lane at Meeker Avenue.

The system failed again.</p><p class=mb3>On June 9, 2025, Amy Sohn reported on advocacy for the Stop Super Speeders bill. The bill, which failed to pass this session, would require drivers with six speeding tickets in a year to install speed-limiting devices. The matter, titled 'In His Own Words: Albany Dysfunction Through The Eyes of One Road Violence Victim,' centers on Darnell Sealy-McCrorey, who lost his daughter to traffic violence. Sealy-McCrorey, backed by Families for Safe Streets, lobbied lawmakers and voiced his frustration: 'If Stop Super Speeders had been passed before, it could have saved my daughter's life.' Despite his efforts, Albany did not act. The safety analyst notes that this event describes tragedy and disappointment, but no policy change or legislative action affecting pedestrian or cyclist safety occurred.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cohen, whose son Sammy was killed by a reckless driver, said, 'Sammy’s Law has never been intended to be used in this way.' She criticized the administration for failing to lower speed limits for cars—the main source of traffic deaths and injuries. Cohen supports safe e-bike speeds but insists regulation should happen at the point of sale, not through police enforcement. The safety analyst notes this move undermines established safe streets efforts, likely reducing protections for pedestrians and cyclists and discouraging mode shift and street equity. No council bill or committee action is attached; this is a forceful advocacy statement, not legislation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, presented by DOT Director Chris Brunson to the Brooklyn Community Board 2 Transportation Committee, removes a travel lane and 59 parking spots to add a protected bike lane, pedestrian islands, curb extensions, and commercial loading zones. The committee supported the plan with five votes in favor, three abstentions, and none opposed. The DOT aims to install the lane this summer, pending further presentations. Brunson called the redesign 'essential for fixing Court Street, a pedestrian and cyclist-heavy street dominated by vehicle infrastructure.' Safety analysts note that road diets like this reduce vehicle speeds, shorten crossing distances, and create space for bike lanes or wider sidewalks, improving safety and comfort for pedestrians and cyclists at the population level. Council member Dave Colon supports the move.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists would treat red lights as stop signs, stop signs as yields. The change cuts needless stops, reduces police targeting, and matches law to street reality. Safety improves for all.</p><p class=mb3>On June 6, 2025, Neile Weissman issued a public statement backing the Stop as Yield (SAY) bill—also known as the Idaho Stop—for cyclists in New York. The proposal, now before the State Legislature, would 'let cyclists treat red lights as stop signs, and stop signs as yields.' Weissman’s statement, published in Streetsblog NYC, highlights the urgent need to end overzealous enforcement and racial targeting of cyclists. He writes, 'SAY would make roads safer for cyclists, safer for pedestrians and, by spurring transition to sustainable modes of travel, better for the planet.' The bill is not yet law and has no listed committee or vote. Weissman’s advocacy draws on safety data: allowing cyclists to yield at stop signs and proceed on red reduces time spent in intersections, cuts crash risk, and encourages cycling. States like Idaho have seen no rise in cyclist injuries after similar laws. The measure aligns law with how cyclists ride and protects vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
