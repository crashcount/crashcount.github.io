Barriers, granite blocks, and planters will block cars from corners. Sightlines will open. Pedestrians and cyclists get space. Trucks and cars lose ground. The city targets danger, not people.</p><p class=mb3>On June 11, 2025, the New York City Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, announced intersection redesigns for six high-crash Brooklyn sites. No council bill number or committee is attached; this is a direct DOT action. Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' The plan uses hardened daylighting—barriers, granite blocks, planters—to keep cars away from corners. Each site will get a tailored design, focusing on visibility and reducing conflicts, especially where trucks turn. A safety analyst notes: redesigning high-traffic intersections to improve visibility addresses systemic risk factors and is likely to reduce conflicts and crashes involving pedestrians and cyclists, supporting safer mode shift and street equity.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal, approved unanimously by Community Board 6's Transportation Committee, removes car lanes for a protected bike lane, a dedicated bus lane, and pedestrian improvements. The DOT will install parking-protected bike lanes, painted sidewalk extensions, and pedestrian islands. The official matter summary states: 'The proposal will reduce the roadway from six or seven lanes for cars to three moving lanes, two parking lanes, plus a bus lane and a bike lane.' DOT Project Manager Esteban Doyle said the plan reallocates space to match actual use. Community members praised the move. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not specify what design was implemented or how it affected pedestrians and cyclists, so no safety impact can be determined.' Installation is set for summer or fall 2025.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, which failed to pass this session, would require drivers with six speeding tickets in a year to install speed-limiting devices. The matter, titled 'In His Own Words: Albany Dysfunction Through The Eyes of One Road Violence Victim,' centers on Darnell Sealy-McCrorey, who lost his daughter to traffic violence. Sealy-McCrorey, backed by Families for Safe Streets, lobbied lawmakers and voiced his frustration: 'If Stop Super Speeders had been passed before, it could have saved my daughter's life.' Despite his efforts, Albany did not act.

Cohen, whose son Sammy was killed by a reckless driver, said, 'Sammy’s Law has never been intended to be used in this way.' She criticized the administration for failing to lower speed limits for cars—the main source of traffic deaths and injuries. Cohen supports safe e-bike speeds but insists regulation should happen at the point of sale, not through police enforcement.

The plan, presented by DOT Director Chris Brunson to the Brooklyn Community Board 2 Transportation Committee, removes a travel lane and 59 parking spots to add a protected bike lane, pedestrian islands, curb extensions, and commercial loading zones. The committee supported the plan with five votes in favor, three abstentions, and none opposed. The DOT aims to install the lane this summer, pending further presentations. Brunson called the redesign 'essential for fixing Court Street, a pedestrian and cyclist-heavy street dominated by vehicle infrastructure.' Safety analysts note that road diets like this reduce vehicle speeds, shorten crossing distances, and create space for bike lanes or wider sidewalks, improving safety and comfort for pedestrians and cyclists at the population level. Council member Dave Colon supports the move.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
