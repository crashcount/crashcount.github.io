The plan, detailed by Streetsblog NYC, 'features mini-protected bike lanes at corners, aiming to improve safety by "daylighting" intersections—removing parked cars to increase visibility.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' Advocates Jon Orcutt and Jackson Chabot praised the use of real infrastructure but called for faster rollout. DOT opposes a Council bill for universal daylighting without hard barriers, warning it could make turns more dangerous.

Their proposal: turn Monitor Street into a cul-de-sac with a pedestrian plaza, add mid-block crossings, ban corner parking, and close a slip lane at Meeker Avenue. The push follows deadly crashes involving children and a cyclist. Chris Roberti, a parent, said, "The tradeoff right now is [we] prioritize cut-through traffic, big trucks and parking, [but] we are risking the lives of our kids." The Department of Transportation has not responded. Safety analysts note that restricting cut-through traffic near schools prioritizes vulnerable road users, reduces vehicle volumes and speeds, and creates a safer environment for pedestrians and cyclists, especially children.

The bill is not yet law and has no listed committee or vote. Weissman’s advocacy draws on safety data: allowing cyclists to yield at stop signs and proceed on red reduces time spent in intersections, cuts crash risk, and encourages cycling.

He reflected on the city’s transformation: 'If we restore valuable public space to the people, the result will be a healthier, happier, and more humane city.' Schwartz condemned the loss of sidewalks and transit space to cars, recalling when streets were safe for children and transit moved the masses. He supports the Adams administration’s plan to restore sidewalk widths on Fifth Avenue. Schwartz’s advocacy highlights the harm of auto-dependency and the urgent need to reclaim streets for vulnerable road users. Safety analysts note that restoring public space to people reallocates space from cars to pedestrians and cyclists, encouraging active transportation, reducing vehicle dominance, and improving safety for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
