Local residents and cyclists praise the lane, which links the Kosciuszko and Greenpoint Avenue bridges. Some business owners opposed it, but their lawsuit failed. A safety analyst notes: the new lane gives cyclists dedicated space, encourages mode shift, and boosts safety in numbers for both cyclists and pedestrians.

The plan, detailed by Streetsblog NYC, 'features mini-protected bike lanes at corners, aiming to improve safety by "daylighting" intersections—removing parked cars to increase visibility.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' Advocates Jon Orcutt and Jackson Chabot praised the use of real infrastructure but called for faster rollout.

Their proposal: turn Monitor Street into a cul-de-sac with a pedestrian plaza, add mid-block crossings, ban corner parking, and close a slip lane at Meeker Avenue. The push follows deadly crashes involving children and a cyclist. Chris Roberti, a parent, said, "The tradeoff right now is [we] prioritize cut-through traffic, big trucks and parking, [but] we are risking the lives of our kids." The Department of Transportation has not responded. Safety analysts note that restricting cut-through traffic near schools prioritizes vulnerable road users, reduces vehicle volumes and speeds, and creates a safer environment for pedestrians and cyclists, especially children. No council bill or committee action yet—just urgent voices demanding streets for kids, not cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Corners will not kill.</p><p class=mb3>On June 11, 2025, the NYC Department of Transportation announced a citywide intersection daylighting redesign. The plan, reported by Brooklyn Paper, aims to 'improve pedestrian and cyclist safety' by installing hardened daylighting—physical barriers like granite blocks and planters—to stop cars from parking near corners. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' No council member sponsored this; it is a DOT initiative. Safety advocates, including Jackson Chabot of Open Plans, support the move but urge faster, broader action. According to safety analysts, hardened daylighting physically prevents vehicles from blocking sightlines, reducing conflicts and crashes involving pedestrians and cyclists, and supports system-wide safety improvements without burdening vulnerable users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city targets danger, not people.</p><p class=mb3>On June 11, 2025, the New York City Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, announced intersection redesigns for six high-crash Brooklyn sites. No council bill number or committee is attached; this is a direct DOT action. Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' The plan uses hardened daylighting—barriers, granite blocks, planters—to keep cars away from corners. Each site will get a tailored design, focusing on visibility and reducing conflicts, especially where trucks turn. A safety analyst notes: redesigning high-traffic intersections to improve visibility addresses systemic risk factors and is likely to reduce conflicts and crashes involving pedestrians and cyclists, supporting safer mode shift and street equity.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A protected bike lane and bus lane will take their place. Pedestrian islands and wider sidewalks will rise. Community Board 6 backed the plan. The city aims to calm deadly traffic and give space to people.</p><p class=mb3>On June 10, 2025, the Department of Transportation unveiled its plan to extend the Third Avenue Complete Street project from E. 59th to E. 24th Street. The proposal, approved unanimously by Community Board 6's Transportation Committee, removes car lanes for a protected bike lane, a dedicated bus lane, and pedestrian improvements. The DOT will install parking-protected bike lanes, painted sidewalk extensions, and pedestrian islands. The official matter summary states: 'The proposal will reduce the roadway from six or seven lanes for cars to three moving lanes, two parking lanes, plus a bus lane and a bike lane.' DOT Project Manager Esteban Doyle said the plan reallocates space to match actual use. Community members praised the move. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not specify what design was implemented or how it affected pedestrians and cyclists, so no safety impact can be determined.' Installation is set for summer or fall 2025.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
