Just last week, an eight-year-old boy was killed crossing Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights. His sister watched. His mother grieves. “He was a boy who loved life,” <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>said his mother</a>.</p><p>Scooter riders, teens on mopeds, and cyclists have all fallen.

DOT stated, "Removing the protected bike lane won't remove cyclists—it will only make the street less safe." The agency warned the city risks legal liability for knowingly reducing safety on a Vision Zero priority corridor. No council member sponsored this; it was direct agency testimony. DOT’s analysis shows protected lanes cut injuries for all. Removing protection increases exposure to traffic, discourages cycling, and endangers every vulnerable road user.

Streetsblog NYC reported the event, quoting riders: "I don’t think he cares if we die." No bill number or council committee is attached; this is a public action, not legislation. Council member Yoshi Omi-Jarrett responded with public comment, echoing outrage and fear. Cyclists say the mayor caved to a small voting bloc, ignoring the real threat from drivers. The city failed to add robust safety measures, like bus boarding islands, citing reluctance to remove parking. According to the safety analyst, the event text reflects a cyclist's perception of safety but does not describe a specific policy or legislative change; therefore, no direct safety impact can be assessed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danger loses ground. Lives get a shot.</p><p class=mb3>On June 12, 2025, the Department of Transportation launched a new intersection safety design in southern Brooklyn. The plan, detailed by Streetsblog NYC, 'features mini-protected bike lanes at corners, aiming to improve safety by "daylighting" intersections—removing parked cars to increase visibility.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' Advocates Jon Orcutt and Jackson Chabot praised the use of real infrastructure but called for faster rollout. DOT opposes a Council bill for universal daylighting without hard barriers, warning it could make turns more dangerous. Safety analysts note: daylighting and targeted cycling infrastructure cut crashes and protect vulnerable road users citywide.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
