The article states: 'the rate of people injured by drivers on school days was 43 percent higher outside school buildings where a majority of students were brown or Black.' These disparities have persisted for years. The council has not acted to address these systemic dangers.

The film, featuring Streetsblog reporter Jesse Coburn, documents that during the 8 a.m. hour, streets near schools see 57 percent more crashes and 25 percent more injuries per mile than other city streets. The matter summary states, 'School zones don’t have to be danger zones.' The city’s open streets for schools program, meant to keep cars away from children, is failing. Only 38 schools participate, down from 101, and most are in wealthier, whiter neighborhoods. The application process is burdensome, requiring schools to opt in rather than providing universal protection. Former DOT Commissioner Janette Sadik-Khan and StreetopiaUWS Director Carl Mahaney criticize the system.

DOT will cut traffic lanes from six to two, add a parking-protected bike lane, and expand pedestrian space. The plan also includes daylighting at intersections and improved markings. According to DOT, 'the project will improve safety for all users, providing connections to existing bike infrastructure and the reduction of a vehicle lane encouraging safer speeds.' Queens Borough President Donovan Richards praised the move, saying, 'Far too many people are killed and injured on our city’s streets, especially people of color, who are disproportionately impacted by traffic violence.' Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives added, 'DOT's move to turn car space into protected bike lanes on Seagirt Boulevard, while shortening crossings and expanding median space, will prevent speeding and make it safer to walk, bike, and take transit.' The redesign targets a stretch with 222 crashes and 87 injuries since 2019, aiming to end the long-standing danger for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The area is notorious for traffic violence, especially against students of color. The incident highlights a deadly trend: July saw 38 crash deaths citywide, including 11 pedestrians—the highest since Vision Zero began in 2014. A new bill in the New York State Senate would require vehicles over 3,000 pounds to provide direct visibility of pedestrians and cyclists. Streetsblog quotes, 'The spread of such vehicles is among the chief factors driving the pedestrian death crisis.' Mayor Eric Adams admitted, 'We need to do more,' but concrete steps remain unclear. The bill aims to curb the danger posed by large vehicles and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Langenkamp denounces 'paint-only' bike lanes and wide, fast arterials, stating, 'We're luring bicyclists to their deaths.' He urges lawmakers to require truck safety sensors and direct vision standards, questioning why such laws do not exist. Langenkamp’s push highlights the deadly gap in infrastructure and vehicle safety, demanding urgent policy change to prevent more families from suffering.

The incident, covered by Streetsblog NYC, highlights ongoing failures in Council District 42, where more people have died or been injured in traffic since 2020 than anywhere else in the city. Council Member Charles Barron called for urgent DOT action, stating, 'More needs to be done, especially if you designate this area a priority zone.' Transportation Alternatives condemned the lack of turn-calming, leading pedestrian intervals, and bike lanes, calling the crash 'the result of inequitable street design.' Community Board 5’s Wilfredo Florentino demanded a full review of major corridors. DOT claims deaths have dropped and points to a $900 million street redesign investment, but crashes persist. The city’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed to daily danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
