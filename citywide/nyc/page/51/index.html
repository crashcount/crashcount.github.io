Delay means more injuries.</p><p class=mb3>This advocacy opinion, published August 26, 2022, calls for immediate action on a Central Harlem Bikeway along Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard. The piece highlights that 83.2% of local residents bike, walk, or use transit, yet the boulevard lacks protected lanes and sees high injury rates. The matter is framed as urgent: 'Pedestrian and cyclist safety should be a higher priority than parking. Harlem is not a parking lot. People live here!' Council Member Kristen Richardson Jordan supports the campaign, stating, 'Black people ride, too, and delivery workers deserve better. Protected bike lanes belong uptown.' The article urges city officials to invest in safety infrastructure without waiting for community board approval, stressing that delays harm Black and other communities of color. The proposal centers justice and the right to safe streets for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill would require all new cars registered in the state to have speed-limiting technology by 2024. It also directs the Department of Motor Vehicles to set visibility rules for vehicles over 3,000 pounds, like SUVs and pickups, to ensure drivers can see pedestrians and cyclists. The bill summary states: 'A new bill in the New York State Senate would require all new cars registered in the state to have speed-limiting technology by 2024.' Senator Hoylman sponsored the bill, citing the 'failure of the promise of Vision Zero.' Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives praised the measure, calling it 'common-sense.' The bill comes as pedestrian deaths hit a 40-year high. If passed, it would force automakers to include safety tech and could make some monster trucks illegal on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocacy leader Juan Restrepo of Transportation Alternatives called for ending placard abuse and repurposing parking for people, not cars.
