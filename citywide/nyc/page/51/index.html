A black SUV hit him. He died on the street. The driver stayed. Police said, &ldquo;They were walking, he was crossing the street with his sister&rdquo; (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>police said</a>). No arrest. The street is still open. The danger is still there.</p><p>The day before, in the Bronx, a man ran a red light. His car jumped the curb and crushed three people on the sidewalk. One is still fighting for life. The driver ran but police caught him. He faces charges for assault, fleeing, and driving without a license (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/driver-flees-bronx-car-stop-crash/>faces charges</a>).</p><p><strong>In the last 12 months, 244 people have died on New York City streets. 713 were seriously hurt.</strong> Thirteen of the dead were children.

The mayor ripped out a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue after crashes involving children. He said he was listening to the community.

The city put back paint. Paint does not stop cars.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Department of Transportation built a new protected bike lane in Queens. A commuter said, &ldquo;The old street was very dangerous&mldr; the new path is definitely safer because he&rsquo;s no longer competing with trucks and cars for road space&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/27/eyes-on-the-street-new-bike-lane-puts-the-bliss-in-blissville>A commuter said</a>).

The city debates.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes and daylighted corners. Demand action, not words. The blood on the street is not an accident.

The film, featuring Streetsblog reporter Jesse Coburn, documents that during the 8 a.m. hour, streets near schools see 57 percent more crashes and 25 percent more injuries per mile than other city streets. The matter summary states, 'School zones don’t have to be danger zones.' The city’s open streets for schools program, meant to keep cars away from children, is failing. Only 38 schools participate, down from 101, and most are in wealthier, whiter neighborhoods. The application process is burdensome, requiring schools to opt in rather than providing universal protection. Former DOT Commissioner Janette Sadik-Khan and StreetopiaUWS Director Carl Mahaney criticize the system. The film exposes how the city’s approach leaves children in Black and brown communities at greater risk, both from crashes and pollution.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, not a council bill but a city action, follows years of neglect and repeated crashes. DOT will cut traffic lanes from six to two, add a parking-protected bike lane, and expand pedestrian space. The plan also includes daylighting at intersections and improved markings. According to DOT, 'the project will improve safety for all users, providing connections to existing bike infrastructure and the reduction of a vehicle lane encouraging safer speeds.' Queens Borough President Donovan Richards praised the move, saying, 'Far too many people are killed and injured on our city’s streets, especially people of color, who are disproportionately impacted by traffic violence.' Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives added, 'DOT's move to turn car space into protected bike lanes on Seagirt Boulevard, while shortening crossings and expanding median space, will prevent speeding and make it safer to walk, bike, and take transit.' The redesign targets a stretch with 222 crashes and 87 injuries since 2019, aiming to end the long-standing danger for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No arrest. This marks the second death at the site this year. Advocates and officials slam the city’s failure to fix deadly roads. Urgent action demanded.</p><p class=mb3>On September 1, 2022, a truck driver struck and killed cyclist Jarrod Little at a dangerous intersection in East New York. The incident, covered by Streetsblog NYC, highlights ongoing failures in Council District 42, where more people have died or been injured in traffic since 2020 than anywhere else in the city. Council Member Charles Barron called for urgent DOT action, stating, 'More needs to be done, especially if you designate this area a priority zone.' Transportation Alternatives condemned the lack of turn-calming, leading pedestrian intervals, and bike lanes, calling the crash 'the result of inequitable street design.' Community Board 5’s Wilfredo Florentino demanded a full review of major corridors. DOT claims deaths have dropped and points to a $900 million street redesign investment, but crashes persist. The city’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed to daily danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
