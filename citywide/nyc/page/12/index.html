The report details that the pedestrian suffered fatal head trauma and internal bleeding, dying at the scene. The driver’s actions are cited as 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' in both the vehicle and person records. The sedan’s center front end collided with the pedestrian, and the driver remained at the scene. The police report lists no contributing factors related to the victim’s behavior beyond her location in the roadway.
