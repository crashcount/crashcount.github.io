In the last twelve months, <strong>243 people died</strong> on New York streets. <strong>708 were left with serious injuries</strong>. Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—none are spared. Just last week, an eight-year-old boy was killed crossing Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights. His sister watched. His mother grieves. “He was a boy who loved life,” <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>said his mother</a>.</p><p>Scooter riders, teens on mopeds, and cyclists have all fallen. On June 26, a 39-year-old man was thrown from his scooter and died on 116th Avenue. No arrests. No comfort. The street is unchanged.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> In the last three years, they took <strong>299 lives</strong> and left thousands more broken. Trucks and buses killed <strong>93</strong>. Motorcycles and mopeds, <strong>10</strong>. Bikes, <strong>11</strong>. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not. Every crash is a family torn open.</p><h3 id=leaders-actbut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Act—But Not Fast Enough</h3><p>The city has moved, but the pace is slow. Speed cameras in school zones are now extended through 2030. “It’s simple: speed cameras save lives and keep New Yorkers safe,” <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>said Governor Hochul</a>. But cameras alone are not enough. Streets need to be rebuilt. Speed limits must drop. The city has the power to set a 20 mph limit. It has not used it.</p><p>Some leaders speak plain. “At this point, there are no questions, just facts: speeding kills, and speed cameras save lives,” <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>said State Senator Gounardes</a>. But others drag their feet, or worse, rip out bike lanes and leave riders exposed.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand that repeat speeders are stopped. Do not wait for another child’s name to be written in chalk on the street.</p><p><strong>Act now.

Instead, it padded numbers, counting old sites and weak fixes. Signs went up, but cars still block sight lines. Advocates demand real barriers, not empty promises. Corners stay deadly. The city stalls.</p><p class=mb3>This report covers the Adams administration's 2024 pledge to 'add daylighting to 1,000 locations,' a promise made after a fatal crash killed a 7-year-old. The Department of Transportation (DOT) claimed progress, but counted multiple corners per intersection and included sites predating the mayor's vow. The article states: 'the city is overstating its progress while installing ineffective measures to keep corners clear.' Council members and advocates, including Philip Miatkowski of Transportation Alternatives and Emily Chingay of Open Plans, criticized the city for relying on unenforced 'No Standing' signs instead of physical barriers. Experts argue only infrastructure like curb extensions or flex posts can protect sight lines. Community boards and local politicians call for universal daylighting at every intersection. The gap between promises and action leaves vulnerable road users exposed. Advocates urge the city to stop 'fudging the numbers' and install real protections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article, titled 'It’s Past Time to Daylight Every Corner in New York City,' criticizes Mayor Adams’s pledge to daylight 1,000 intersections per year as inadequate and misleading. Morano references the death of Kamari Hughes as a tragic example of the city’s failure. He writes, 'New York City should no longer be an exception when it comes to intersection safety.' Morano urges state lawmakers to enforce daylighting standards citywide, arguing that the current exemption leaves pedestrians at risk. He calls for universal daylighting, citing benefits like stormwater mitigation and safer community spaces. The piece is a direct challenge to City Hall’s slow pace and lack of legal accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident follows a rise in police chases since Mayor Adams took office. The black Dodge Ram involved had 80 camera-issued speeding or red-light tickets since mid-2022, but the owner never faced a mandated safety course because the city’s program expired and was not renewed. Residents and advocates, including Chong Bretillon and Elizabeth Adams, condemned the NYPD’s pursuit tactics. Bretillon demanded accountability from the 114th Precinct, calling the chase 'completely unacceptable.' Adams stated, 'It’s time for the city to ban police chases in writing and in practice.' Calls for a ban on police chases and renewal of the DOT safety course program have intensified as the death toll mounts.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Activists blame city inaction.</p><p class=mb3>On October 11, 2024, a hit-and-run driver fatally struck Felix Mendez, 49, as he crossed Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn. The incident occurred just hours before the Department of Transportation (DOT) implemented a long-stalled safety redesign. The redesign narrowed the roadway to one lane and added a protected bike lane—a 'road diet' proven to improve safety. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives condemned the city's delay, stating, 'delaying projects has a real cost.' The matter highlights the deadly impact of bureaucratic inaction. Between January and early October, there were 86 reported crashes on this mile-long stretch, injuring cyclists, pedestrians, and motorists, and killing one pedestrian. The city faces a pedestrian death crisis, with fatalities rising. DOT claims the redesign will make the street safer, but for Mendez, the fix came too late.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The board’s Transportation Committee, led by Vice Chair Barak Friedman and Chair Jason Froimowitz, called the current setup 'really dangerous' and 'horrible for pedestrians and cyclists.' The resolution states opening the path 'must take priority over the convenience of drivers.' DOT has delayed the project repeatedly, citing unrelated upper deck construction. Former Mayor de Blasio promised a fix in 2021, but the Adams administration has not delivered. Cyclists and pedestrians remain forced to share a cramped, unsafe lane while motorists enjoy up to nine. Advocates and board members say the city’s excuses put lives at risk.
