The narrative underscores that 'the drivers missed the signs,' highlighting systemic failures in driver compliance with traffic controls.

The narrative states, 'A bus struck a 60-year-old man in the roadway. Head crushed. Bones broken. He died there, on the pavement. The bus rolled on, untouched.' The report lists the pedestrian as being in the roadway, not at an intersection, and describes his action as 'Other Actions in Roadway.' Both contributing factors for the driver and pedestrian are marked as 'Unspecified.' The point of impact was the center front end of the bus, which continued on without damage. The police report does not cite any specific driver errors or violations, but the fatal impact underscores the systemic danger faced by pedestrians in the roadway, especially when large vehicles are involved.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the driver failed to yield the right-of-way and was inattentive or distracted at the time of the crash. The report states, 'Steel met flesh. She dropped, broken. The driver did not yield.' The impact occurred at the left front quarter panel of the SUV, causing fatal crush injuries to the pedestrian's entire body. The woman was not at an intersection and was crossing without a signal or crosswalk, as noted in the report, but the primary contributing factors remain 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction.' The driver was licensed and operating a 2023 SUV.
