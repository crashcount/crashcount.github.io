The narrative states, 'A 31-year-old man stood in the roadway. Two SUVs struck him, one after the other. His body broke beneath the steel. No intersection. No chance.' The crash occurred away from any intersection, with the pedestrian listed as 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Not at Intersection' and engaged in 'Other Actions in Roadway.' The first SUV, a 2023 Nissan, was 'Changing Lanes' before its right front bumper struck the man. The second SUV, a 2018 Jaguar, was described as 'Parked' with impact to its center back end. The police report lists both driver contributing factors as 'Unspecified.' The report does not attribute any contributing factors to the pedestrian's behavior. The sequence and violence of the impacts underscore the vulnerability of people on foot in high-speed corridors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The incident occurred just hours before the Department of Transportation (DOT) implemented a long-stalled safety redesign. The redesign narrowed the roadway to one lane and added a protected bike lane—a 'road diet' proven to improve safety. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives condemned the city's delay, stating, 'delaying projects has a real cost.' The matter highlights the deadly impact of bureaucratic inaction. Between January and early October, there were 86 reported crashes on this mile-long stretch, injuring cyclists, pedestrians, and motorists, and killing one pedestrian. The city faces a pedestrian death crisis, with fatalities rising. DOT claims the redesign will make the street safer, but for Mendez, the fix came too late.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The resolution states opening the path 'must take priority over the convenience of drivers.' DOT has delayed the project repeatedly, citing unrelated upper deck construction.
