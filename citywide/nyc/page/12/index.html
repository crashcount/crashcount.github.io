Over 52,000 were injured. Seven hundred sixty-two suffered wounds so grave they will not walk the same again. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old. Fourteen children died. Forty-eight people aged 55 to 64. No one is spared. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p><strong>Just last week, the carnage continued.</strong> A woman crossing 174th Street in the Bronx was struck and killed. The driver fled. Police said, <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/driver-kills-bronx-pedestrian-flees-the-scene-nypd-says>&ldquo;they&rsquo;re looking for the driver&rdquo;</a> but gave no name, no face, only a void where a person once stood. In Morris Heights, another woman died after a hit-and-run. The news was blunt: <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/woman-killed-in-bronx-hit-and-run/>&ldquo;A Bronx woman is dead after a hit-and-run in Morris Heights.&rdquo;</a></p><p>On Canal Street, two more lives ended when a driver sped off the Manhattan Bridge at 109 mph. The city moved to <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>add barriers and lower speed limits</a>, but as one official said, <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>&ldquo;Canal Street is only as safe as its most dangerous block, and even after these changes, the vast majority of the corridor will remain deadly.&rdquo;</a></p><h2 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h2><p><strong>Some leaders speak.

Seven dead since 2011. The city schedules meetings. The street keeps killing.</p><p><strong>Speed is the killer.</strong> In the Bronx, a cab driver died when an SUV hit him at 77 mph in a 25 mph zone. The District Attorney said, <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/08/08/us-news/bronx-woman-driving-77-mph-in-25-mph-zone-indicted-for-killing-cab-driver-da/>&ldquo;This defendant was allegedly driving three times the speed limit when her SUV slammed into a livery cab, and she fled the scene without checking on the driver&rsquo;s condition or waiting for first responders to arrive.&rdquo;</a></p><h2 id=what-must-change>What Must Change</h2><p><strong>The system is broken.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits. It can redesign streets. It can end the reign of repeat offenders. But every day of delay is another day of blood on the asphalt.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat speeders.</strong> Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p><p><strong>The dead cannot speak.

The pedestrian was found in the roadway with fatal head trauma and crush injuries. The report notes, 'No skid marks. No damage to the truck.' The police narrative describes the aftermath: 'Only silence where a life had been.' The vehicle, a 2020 INTL-TRUCK/BUS registered in Indiana, showed no visible damage. The driver was licensed in Pennsylvania. The report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified' for both the driver and the pedestrian. The police report does not cite any pedestrian actions as contributing to the crash. The absence of skid marks and damage underscores the brutal efficiency of the impact. The systemic danger remains: a human body, no match for a truck rolling through city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The victim died beneath the vehicle’s left front bumper, his head crushed on the pavement. The report notes the absence of a crosswalk at the location. The narrative states, 'No crosswalk.

The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified' for both the driver and the pedestrian. The victim was not at an intersection and was engaged in 'Other Actions in Roadway' at the time of the crash. The report does not cite any specific driver error, but the impact location and fatal outcome underscore the lethal consequences of vehicle-pedestrian collisions on high-speed roadways.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
