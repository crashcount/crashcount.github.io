Deaths up 28 percent from last year. Cars and trucks are the main killers. Not e-bikes. Not mopeds. City pushes plazas, daylighting, and enforcement. Streets remain deadly. Drivers escape blame. Victims pay.</p><p class=mb3>This report, published September 26, 2024, details a surge in pedestrian deaths: 87 killed in NYC between January 1 and September 23, up from 68 in the same period last year—a 28 percent jump. The NYPD and DOT confirm a double-digit rise in deaths and injuries, with 23 pedestrians hurt daily. The matter summary states, 'The 2024 Pedestrian Death Crisis is Due to Driving.' Jon Orcutt, former DOT official, calls for targeted enforcement against drivers, especially those dodging accountability. DOT spokesman Vin Barone says, 'Cars are heavier and faster and still pose a far greater risk.' The Adams administration is expanding pedestrian plazas, daylighting intersections, and cracking down on reckless driving. Data show cars and trucks cause most deaths, not micromobility. Only 5.5% of injuries involve e-bikes or mopeds. The city focuses on driver accountability and infrastructure, but the toll climbs. Vulnerable road users remain at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Chris Hartmann, in a Streetsblog NYC opinion, opposes the bill. He says it imposes harsh deadlines on citizen reporters, lets the Department of Environmental Protection ban complainants for vague reasons, and undermines school bus idling limits. The bill also allows retroactive fine reductions for polluters. Hartmann urges Speaker Adrienne Adams and all Council members to reject Intro 941.

New rules target deadly SUV fronts. Pedestrian deaths soared 75 percent since 2009. The agency wants safer hoods, fewer fatal head injuries. Change could save dozens of lives each year.</p><p class=mb3>On September 10, 2024, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) proposed new federal safety standards for vehicles, aiming to "reduce fatalities and serious injuries among pedestrians struck by vehicles." The rules would apply to all new passenger vehicles under 10,000 pounds, including most SUVs and light trucks. The proposal comes after a 75 percent rise in pedestrian deaths since 2009, much of it linked to the high, blocky fronts of modern vehicles. The new standard would require carmakers to design hoods and grilles to reduce the risk of serious or fatal head injuries in crashes up to 25 mph. NHTSA estimates the rule could save 67 lives per year at a cost of about $3 per vehicle. Deputy Administrator Sophie Shulman said, "We have a crisis of roadway deaths, and it’s even worse among vulnerable road users like pedestrians." The move could finally force U.S. automakers to prioritize people outside the car.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states the man was 'walking along the highway with traffic' when a southbound car struck him. The narrative details, 'His head crushed. Body broken. No crosswalk. No name. Just the dark, the engine’s howl, and a man who didn’t make it home.' The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified.' The victim was not at an intersection at the time of the crash. The vehicle was traveling straight ahead, southbound. The report does not specify any driver actions or errors, but the impact left the pedestrian dead at the scene. The focus remains on the deadly interaction between car and pedestrian in a place built for speed, not for people.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
