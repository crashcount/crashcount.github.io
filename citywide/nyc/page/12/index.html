Police later arrested a driver and charged him with leaving the scene resulting in death. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/truck-driver-charged-off-duty-nypd-officer-killed-hit-run-crash-home-84th-precinct-brooklyn/17676103/>That’s per ABC7’s report.</a></p><p>A name, an arraignment, a charge.

As Attorney General Letitia James put it, <a href=https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/attorney-general-says-police-chases-mostly-banned-20392396.php>“the evidence is clear: police vehicle pursuits and high-speed car chases can be dangerous and even fatal, and it is time for a change.”</a> Policy shifts like this save lives when they are followed, measured, and kept.</p><h3 id=slow-it-down-stop-the-repeat-offenders>Slow it down. Stop the repeat offenders.</h3><p>Tools sit on the shelf. NYC now has the power to set safer default speeds on local streets. Albany renewed 24/7 school‑zone speed cameras through 2030. And a bill in Albany would force the worst repeat speeders to install speed limiters after a set number of violations.

The impact killed a 51-year-old woman and left a baby boy with broken legs. Both victims were pedestrians and, as the report states, 'not in the roadway' at the time of the crash. The police report cites 'Traffic Control Disregarded' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as contributing factors for both drivers. The narrative underscores that 'the drivers missed the signs,' highlighting systemic failures in driver compliance with traffic controls. The collision’s violence—'metal screamed'—left one woman dead from crush injuries and a child with severe leg trauma. The report does not list any victim behavior as a contributing factor.
