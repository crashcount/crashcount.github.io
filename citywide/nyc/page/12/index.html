A car slammed into them. Both died. The driver died too. The street was left with bodies and wreckage.

Police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/13/queens-hit-and-run-driver-kills-52-year-old-man-near-jfk-airport/>reported, &ldquo;The driver sped off without stopping.

Children, elders, workers—all caught in the path of metal and speed.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs killed 329 people.</strong> Trucks and buses killed 100. Motorcycles and mopeds, 11. Bikes, 11.

The city can set a 20 mph limit now. But the default is still 25. The city has started to sprinkle 20 mph zones, but not everywhere.</p><p>Speed cameras have been renewed. Cameras catch speeders day and night. But the worst drivers rack up tickets and keep driving. One bill—the Stop Super Speeders Act—would force repeat offenders to slow down.

A 64-year-old woman stepped into the street. An SUV turned left, failed to yield, struck her down. She died in the cold air, her body broken. Driver inattention and failure to yield sealed her fate.</p><p class=mb3>A 64-year-old woman was killed near 242 Mason Avenue in Staten Island when a westbound SUV, making a left turn, struck her as she crossed the street. According to the police report, the driver failed to yield the right-of-way and was inattentive or distracted at the time of the crash. The report states, 'Steel met flesh. She dropped, broken. The driver did not yield.' The impact occurred at the left front quarter panel of the SUV, causing fatal crush injuries to the pedestrian's entire body. The woman was not at an intersection and was crossing without a signal or crosswalk, as noted in the report, but the primary contributing factors remain 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction.' The driver was licensed and operating a 2023 SUV. The collision underscores the lethal consequences of driver error on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The incident occurred at 9:49 a.m. The narrative states, 'A 65-year-old man lay still in the road. A southbound box truck passed. No screech, no crash, no damage. Just the crack of bone.
