Seven hundred thirty-four suffered wounds so grave they will never be the same. The dead are not numbers. A 76-year-old woman, struck by an SUV while crossing White Plains Road. A 32-year-old woman, crushed by a Jeep on Marcus Garvey Boulevard. A 79-year-old man, found dead in a parked car on West 77th.

The crash occurred as the truck was making a left turn. The report states, 'A flatbed truck turned left. A 64-year-old man crossed with the light. The front end struck him. His body crushed beneath steel.' The pedestrian was crossing with the signal at the intersection, as explicitly noted in the police data. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified,' but the narrative and vehicle data confirm the truck's left turn and the pedestrian's lawful crossing. The man suffered fatal crush injuries to his entire body. No driver errors beyond the left turn are specified, but the sequence underscores the lethal risk posed by turning vehicles to people in crosswalks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Chris Hartmann, in a Streetsblog NYC opinion, opposes the bill. He says it imposes harsh deadlines on citizen reporters, lets the Department of Environmental Protection ban complainants for vague reasons, and undermines school bus idling limits. The bill also allows retroactive fine reductions for polluters. Hartmann urges Speaker Adrienne Adams and all Council members to reject Intro 941.

Change could save dozens of lives each year.</p><p class=mb3>On September 10, 2024, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) proposed new federal safety standards for vehicles, aiming to "reduce fatalities and serious injuries among pedestrians struck by vehicles." The rules would apply to all new passenger vehicles under 10,000 pounds, including most SUVs and light trucks. The proposal comes after a 75 percent rise in pedestrian deaths since 2009, much of it linked to the high, blocky fronts of modern vehicles. The new standard would require carmakers to design hoods and grilles to reduce the risk of serious or fatal head injuries in crashes up to 25 mph. NHTSA estimates the rule could save 67 lives per year at a cost of about $3 per vehicle. Deputy Administrator Sophie Shulman said, "We have a crisis of roadway deaths, and it’s even worse among vulnerable road users like pedestrians." The move could finally force U.S. automakers to prioritize people outside the car.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
