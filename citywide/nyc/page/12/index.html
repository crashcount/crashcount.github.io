The right front bumper hit with force. The man, not in the roadway, died at the scene. Steel and speed left no chance. The city’s danger is relentless.</p><p class=mb3>A 39-year-old man was killed when a southbound bus struck him near Fifth Avenue and East 51st Street in Manhattan, according to the police report. The incident occurred at 21:34. The report states, 'A southbound bus struck a 39-year-old man who was not in the roadway. The right front bumper hit him. He died at the scene. His body bore the full weight of steel and speed.' The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified.' The bus was traveling straight ahead when its right front bumper made contact with the pedestrian. The victim was not in the roadway at the time of impact. No driver errors are specified in the report, but the lethal outcome underscores the ever-present risk posed by large vehicles in dense urban environments.
