Police said, &ldquo;The men were ejected from their scooters and fatally injured in the collision. Both were pronounced dead at the hospital&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/bronx-river-parkway-accident-east-gun-hill-road/>CBS New York</a>). The driver faces charges of vehicular manslaughter and driving while intoxicated. The highway closed for hours. The city kept moving.</p><p>Elsewhere, a 76-year-old woman was killed crossing 86th Street in Brooklyn. A 46-year-old man died under the wheels of a box truck in Queens. A 22-year-old lost his life on the Belt Parkway. These are not rare events. They are the drumbeat of life and death on New York’s streets.</p><p><strong>In the last 12 months, 286 people have died and 762 have been seriously injured in crashes across the city.</strong> The numbers do not rest. They do not lie.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p>The dead are not just numbers. They are children, elders, workers. In the last year, 13 children under 18 were killed. Forty-eight people aged 55–64. The city’s most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, scooter riders—pay the highest price. A recent crash report reads like a ledger of loss: “The two men who died were ejected from mopeds during the crash, which also involved two cars” (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/2-killed-1-taken-into-custody-in-multivehicle-bronx-river-parkway-crash-nypd-says>Gothamist</a>).</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>City Hall and Albany have taken steps. <strong>Speed cameras in school zones are renewed through 2030.</strong> The city can now set its own speed limits, thanks to Sammy’s Law. But the default speed remains 25 mph. The power to lower it to 20 mph sits unused. The Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force the worst repeat offenders to slow down, waits in committee. The city redesigns a few streets, but the carnage continues.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of blood on the street.</strong> Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand action on repeat offenders. Join the fight. The dead cannot speak. You can.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

According to the police report, the crash occurred just after midnight, and the street was dark. The report states the driver was inattentive or distracted at the time of the collision. The impact was so forceful that parked cars were damaged. The pedestrian was not in a crosswalk when struck, but the police report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor. The driver’s permit status is noted in the narrative, underscoring a lack of full licensure. The report does not cite any pedestrian actions as contributing factors. The focus remains on the driver’s distraction and permit status, which led to fatal consequences for the man in the roadway.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The report states, "A van veered, struck a station wagon. The SUV’s driver, 54, died belted in place. The airbag burst. His body broke inside."
