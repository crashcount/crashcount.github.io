He was not at an intersection. He did not make it home. The city recorded <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>281 deaths and 766 serious injuries in the last 12 months</a>. The numbers do not slow. They do not care who you are.</p><p>A 13-year-old boy now lies in a hospital bed, his head split open after a moped collided with an MTA bus in Staten Island. It happened at 1 a.m. The street was quiet. The boy was not. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/13-year-old-boy-injured-port-richmond-staten-island-moped-collides-bus/17438785/>&ldquo;He was taken to Richmond University Medical Center in critical condition with a head injury.&rdquo;</a></p><p>In Queens, two police cruisers crashed while racing to a call.

Forty-five people aged 55-64. Thirty-six aged 65-74. The city’s streets do not forgive mistakes. They do not give second chances.</p><p>The killers are familiar: <strong>cars, SUVs, trucks, buses</strong>. Sedans alone took 93 pedestrian lives. SUVs killed 200 more. Trucks, buses, motorcycles, mopeds, and even bikes left families broken. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The city’s data is a ledger of loss.</a></p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>The city has tools. Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The Council can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. They have not. Speed cameras were renewed, but the most dangerous drivers still roam free. The Stop Super Speeders Act sits in Albany, waiting for a vote. Every day of delay is another risk, another name on the list.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit.

Video shows the vehicles touching in a V shape. Investigator Nelson Yu, a retired NYPD detective, confronted the woman, demanding identification and handcuffing her after she failed to produce ID. Yu ordered, 'Get out of the car and show some ID,' and later, 'Get in the car! You're not going anywhere!' The woman was placed in the back seat of Yu’s vehicle. The arrest was later voided. The Attorney General’s office stated, 'OAG is investigating this matter internally and will not have further comment at this time.'
