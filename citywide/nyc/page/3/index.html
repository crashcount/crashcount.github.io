Police said the sedan “careened at a high speed into a nearby food truck” and named the dead: Joaquin Venancio‑Mendez, 41, and Santiago Baires, 70 (<a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/queens/carnage-queens-senior-driver-stroke-crash/>amNY</a>). A TV crew said simply: “Two pedestrians were hit and killed while ordering from a food truck” (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-pedestrians-1-driver-killed-when-car-slams-into-food-truck-in-queens/>CBS New York</a>).</p><p>Around JFK at 2:30 a.m. the next day, a driver hit a 52‑year‑old man and fled. Police said the man died at Jamaica Hospital.

Queens prosecutors did their job in another case: a wrong‑way driver who “terrorized other drivers” was sentenced to eight years, and told police he felt “liberated” by it (<a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY</a>).
