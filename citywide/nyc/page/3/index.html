The city’s streets are a slow-moving disaster. Every week brings new names. A 21-year-old woman, Madison Ruiz, killed as her boyfriend spun donuts in a Brooklyn parking lot. Her nephews, ages 12 and 17, left bleeding by the curb. Days later, the tire marks still scarred the pavement. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating. It&rsquo;s affecting everyone in our family, especially (Ruiz&rsquo;s) mom.

The numbers are cold. The bodies are not. The city’s most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, children—pay the price.</p><h2 id=leaders-movebut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Move—But Not Fast Enough</h2><p>City Hall claims progress. Speed cameras renewed. New 20 mph zones near schools. But the citywide speed limit remains 25 mph. The law lets leaders drop it to 20 mph now. They have not. Each day of delay risks another life. The city touts record bike lanes and intersection daylighting. But the crackdowns fall hardest on cyclists and e-bike delivery workers, not the drivers who do the most harm. Community boards <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/cart-before-horse-upper-west-siders-demand-nypd-halt-bike-crackdown>call it out</a>: &ldquo;It sends the wrong message about the actual danger on our streets.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph citywide limit. Demand real action against repeat speeders. Join the fight.

Streets stay lethal.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC reported on June 13, 2025, that Mayor Adams will remove the protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue, a corridor known for high crash rates. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'before this bike lane from 2018 to 2022 this is the area that had the second largest numbers of pedestrian fatalities and crashes in the city.' The lane faced opposition from some Hasidic leaders, citing children running into the lane from illegally parked cars and buses. Despite tweaks—school bus zones, daylighted corners, no standing areas—drivers kept parking illegally, blocking sightlines and endangering children. The city rarely removes protected lanes, but Adams acted after political pressure. Moving the lane to Classon Avenue, as some demand, would force cyclists onto a chaotic BQE ramp. The decision highlights persistent driver violations and policy gaps that leave vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Nearly half of city traffic deaths happen at intersections. The new design will first appear at high-crash sites in Brooklyn, including Ocean Avenue at Church Avenue and several others.
