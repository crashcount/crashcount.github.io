Are these crashes just 'accidents'?</summary><div class="mt2 lh-copy">No. Crashes are not random. They happen again and again in the same ways, on the same streets.

What can local politicians do to stop traffic violence?</summary><div class="mt2 lh-copy">They can lower the citywide speed limit to 20 mph, crack down on repeat speeders, redesign dangerous streets, and enforce laws that protect people walking and biking. They have the power. They must use it.</div></details><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
What has the city done lately to address traffic violence?</summary><div class="mt2 lh-copy">The city has lowered speed limits in some areas, expanded speed cameras to run 24/7, and started redesigning more streets.

Steel and stone replace painted lines.</p><p class=mb3>The Brooklyn Paper reported on June 11, 2025, that NYC DOT will redesign intersections to protect cyclists and pedestrians. The plan uses 'hardened daylighting'—physical barriers, granite blocks, and planters—to stop cars from parking near corners. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' Nearly half of city traffic deaths happen at intersections, often due to blocked sightlines and turning vehicles. The redesign targets high-crash Brooklyn intersections first, including Ocean Avenue at Church Avenue. The move highlights the city's shift from painted lines to physical infrastructure, aiming to reduce systemic risk for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Tourists and workers crowd the street. Mayor Adams pledges $400 million. Some push back. The avenue stays dangerous for those on foot. Space for people, not just cars, hangs in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>NY1 reported on May 22, 2025, that Mayor Eric Adams will allocate over $400 million to a pedestrian-focused redesign of Fifth Avenue, stretching from Bryant Park to Central Park. The plan aims to double sidewalk widths, making room for the heavy foot traffic from both tourists and local workers. The article quotes a local worker: 'When you're walking around and getting from one place to another, yeah, it does get kind of annoying.' The proposal faces backlash, highlighting the tension between pedestrian needs and existing street design. No specific driver errors are cited, but the move underscores the city's ongoing struggle to prioritize vulnerable road users over vehicle flow.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
