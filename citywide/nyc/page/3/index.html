The project follows urgent requests in 2023 from Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "Brooklyn and Queens deserve a Conduit Boulevard that improves daily life, not a roadway that puts pedestrians and drivers at risk and physically divides entire neighborhoods." The corridor has seen five deaths and 40 severe injuries in five years. The median’s dirt paths show heavy pedestrian use, but only 15 crosswalks span the stretch.

The policy, announced without clear data or complaint channels, targets actions like running red lights or reckless cycling. Komanoff’s statement, titled 'Tsk, Tsk, Tisch — Criminal Summonses for Cyclists Will Backfire,' warns that the crackdown will make streets less safe and hit immigrant delivery workers hardest, exposing them to risks like detainment or deportation. He urges rescinding the policy, pledging not to share citation data with ICE, and redirecting enforcement toward car and truck drivers, who inflict most harm on pedestrians. Komanoff calls for city officials to experience cycling firsthand before making policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets grow tense. Advocates call it obscene. The crackdown lands hardest on people of color and immigrants. Safety takes a back seat. Punishment rises. Fear spreads.</p><p class=mb3>On May 5, 2025, Streetsblog NYC reported a major NYPD policy shift. The department now issues criminal court summonses to cyclists and e-bike riders for low-level violations—red lights, stop signs, wrong-way riding. The article, 'NYPD’s Red Light Criminalization Marks ‘Obscene’ Escalation: Advocates,' details the move. Kevin Duggan covered the story. Transportation Alternatives’s Ben Furnas called the change 'an obscene escalation.' Legal experts like Daniel Lambright warned it will amplify racially biased policing, especially against immigrant workers. More than 90% of such summonses in 2024 went to New Yorkers of color. The new policy reverses a decade of decriminalization, exposing thousands to harsh penalties for minor acts. Safety analysts note: 'A quiet change in police practices often signals increased enforcement or surveillance that can disproportionately burden pedestrians and cyclists, potentially discouraging active transportation and undermining safety in numbers.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
