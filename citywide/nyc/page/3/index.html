The policy, announced without clear data or complaint channels, targets actions like running red lights or reckless cycling. Komanoff’s statement, titled 'Tsk, Tsk, Tisch — Criminal Summonses for Cyclists Will Backfire,' warns that the crackdown will make streets less safe and hit immigrant delivery workers hardest, exposing them to risks like detainment or deportation. He urges rescinding the policy, pledging not to share citation data with ICE, and redirecting enforcement toward car and truck drivers, who inflict most harm on pedestrians. Komanoff calls for city officials to experience cycling firsthand before making policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets grow tense. Advocates call it obscene. The crackdown lands hardest on people of color and immigrants. Safety takes a back seat. Punishment rises. Fear spreads.</p><p class=mb3>On May 5, 2025, Streetsblog NYC reported a major NYPD policy shift. The department now issues criminal court summonses to cyclists and e-bike riders for low-level violations—red lights, stop signs, wrong-way riding. The article, 'NYPD’s Red Light Criminalization Marks ‘Obscene’ Escalation: Advocates,' details the move. Kevin Duggan covered the story. Transportation Alternatives’s Ben Furnas called the change 'an obscene escalation.' Legal experts like Daniel Lambright warned it will amplify racially biased policing, especially against immigrant workers. More than 90% of such summonses in 2024 went to New Yorkers of color. The new policy reverses a decade of decriminalization, exposing thousands to harsh penalties for minor acts. Safety analysts note: 'A quiet change in police practices often signals increased enforcement or surveillance that can disproportionately burden pedestrians and cyclists, potentially discouraging active transportation and undermining safety in numbers.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cars, which kill and injure most, get less scrutiny. Cyclists and advocates call this unjust. Enforcement targets the least dangerous, not the deadliest.</p><p class=mb3>On April 18, 2025, Streetsblog NYC reported that NYPD officers issued 15 percent of red-light tickets to cyclists, who account for less than 2 percent of city street trips. The article, titled 'Exclusive: Cops Writing 15% of Their Red Light Tix to Cyclists, Who are Just 2% of Road Users,' highlights a stark enforcement imbalance. Activists like Corey Hannigan and Sara Lind criticize the NYPD for targeting cyclists instead of drivers, who cause most crashes and deaths. Cyclist Lee calls the practice 'unjust.' Kate Brockwehl, injured by a car, says the policy shows 'windshield bias.' The Department of Transportation has proposed legalizing the 'Idaho Stop' for cyclists, but City Hall has blocked it. Cyclists like John Surico and George Calderaro say most tickets come from coordinated police actions, not real safety concerns. The data shows enforcement priorities ignore who poses real danger on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A 61-year-old man was standing in the roadway when the truck struck him head-on. The report states, 'His body crushed. He died there, in the Bronx morning, as the city stirred.' The point of impact was the center front end of the truck. The police report lists 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a contributing factor. The pedestrian was not at an intersection and was engaged in 'Other Actions in Roadway' at the time. No driver errors are cited in the report. The focus remains on the deadly consequences of a truck pulling out as a person stood in the street.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Lander stressed his record: 'By the time I'm done, you're going to have a lot more bus and bike infrastructure, more of the neighborhood loading zones that use the curb, more of those shared containers, especially in denser areas.' He contrasted his approach with the Adams administration, calling out backroom deals and broken promises. Lander cited his support for protected bike lanes, even when facing opposition. He pledged to make it easier for families to use e-cargo bikes by building safer routes. Lander committed to expanding the Fourth Avenue bike lane to Bay Ridge and reducing car space citywide. He promised 'world-class DOT and transportation leadership.' No formal safety analysis was provided, but Lander’s stance centers vulnerable road users and systemic change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danger stays on the street.</p><p class=mb3>On April 16, 2025, Mayor Adams’s administration postponed the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) Third Avenue safety redesign in Brooklyn. The plan, not yet assigned a council bill number, aimed to cut car lanes, add a protected bike lane, and install pedestrian islands. The DOT cited the need for more public input after business leaders, led by the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce, protested. The matter summary reads: 'The Department of Transportation (DOT) planned to reduce car lanes and add a protected bike lane and pedestrian islands, but business leaders...protested.' Community board support was strong. Streetsblog NYC reported that 68 percent of locals backed the changes. Council members were not named, but business owners and advocates like Jon Orcutt and Jim of Bagels By the Park spoke out. The administration’s delay leaves proven safety measures on hold, exposing vulnerable road users to continued risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
