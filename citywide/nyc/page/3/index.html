Seven hundred twenty-seven suffered injuries so severe they will never be the same. These are not numbers. They are lives cut short, bodies broken, families left to mourn.</p><p>Just days ago, a cyclist and a pedestrian were killed at Bowery and Canal. A stolen car, driven fast, jumped the curb. Kevin Cruickshank was out for a morning ride. May Kwok was sitting on a bench. Both are gone. Police said, &ldquo;It appears to be excessive speed. Two people are in custody, unfortunate incident. No one should lose their life in that manner.&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/man-morning-bike-ride-killed-among-victims-chinatown-crash-2-women-arrested/17215969/>police said</a></p><p><strong>This is not rare. It is routine.</strong></p><h2 id=the-faces-behind-the-numbers>The Faces Behind the Numbers</h2><p>A 23-year-old driver, unlicensed, was out on the street after a previous hit-and-run. Three months before the Chinatown crash, she &ldquo;clipped a woman stepping out of an Uber in Brooklyn, causing serious injuries, and fled.&rdquo; She was released without bail. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/20/driver-who-killed-2-in-chinatown-crash-was-out-without-bail-for-april-hit-run-nypd-sources/>released without bail</a></p><p>On McGuinness Boulevard, a cyclist was struck where the city left a painted lane instead of protection. The road diet was promised, then watered down. &ldquo;The fact is that this wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem if Mayor Adams had just done what he had promised to do, which was, make all of McGuinness safe. The road diet works where it&rsquo;s been installed and it&rsquo;s needed for the entire corridor before this happens again,&rdquo; said Kevin LaCherra. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/20/cyclist-badly-hurt-on-segment-of-mcguinness-blvd-that-mayor-adams-refused-to-make-safe>said Kevin LaCherra</a></p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h2><p><strong>Leaders have tools. They do not always use them.</strong> Sammy’s Law lets the city set its own speed limits. The Council could drop the default to 20 mph. They have not. Speed cameras are renewed, but the most dangerous drivers—those with dozens of violations—still keep their keys. Promises to redesign streets stall or shrink. Each delay is another risk, another life lost.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your Council Member. Demand a 20 mph citywide speed limit. Demand real street redesigns, not watered-down paint. Demand that repeat dangerous drivers are taken off the road.

The city links these vehicles to traffic violations and crimes, including robberies and reckless riding.

The plan uses 'hardened daylighting'—physical barriers, granite blocks, and planters—to stop cars from parking near corners. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' Nearly half of city traffic deaths happen at intersections, often due to blocked sightlines and turning vehicles. The redesign targets high-crash Brooklyn intersections first, including Ocean Avenue at Church Avenue.
