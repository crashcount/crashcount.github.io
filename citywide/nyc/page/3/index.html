Seven hundred thirty-four suffered wounds so grave they will never be the same. The dead are not numbers. A 76-year-old woman, struck by an SUV while crossing White Plains Road. A 32-year-old woman, crushed by a Jeep on Marcus Garvey Boulevard. A 79-year-old man, found dead in a parked car on West 77th.

Danger stays on the street.</p><p class=mb3>On April 16, 2025, Mayor Adams’s administration postponed the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) Third Avenue safety redesign in Brooklyn. The plan, not yet assigned a council bill number, aimed to cut car lanes, add a protected bike lane, and install pedestrian islands. The DOT cited the need for more public input after business leaders, led by the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce, protested. The matter summary reads: 'The Department of Transportation (DOT) planned to reduce car lanes and add a protected bike lane and pedestrian islands, but business leaders...protested.' Community board support was strong. Streetsblog NYC reported that 68 percent of locals backed the changes. Council members were not named, but business owners and advocates like Jon Orcutt and Jim of Bagels By the Park spoke out. The administration’s delay leaves proven safety measures on hold, exposing vulnerable road users to continued risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It would require speed limiter technology for drivers with six or more automated enforcement tickets in a year. The bill is supported by Amber Adler of Families for Safe Streets and Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives, who call out the deadly pattern of repeat offenders. Furnas says, 'These results point to a small population with a shocking pattern of recidivism, resistance to traditional deterrents, and disregard for human life.' Adler points to a recent fatal crash by a repeat offender as proof of legislative failure. Assembly Member Michael Novakhov opposes the bill, claiming six tickets is not excessive. The NYPD withholds license plate data, blocking public scrutiny. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program has expired, leaving no replacement. Advocates say the bill is urgent to stop the next tragedy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, not a council bill but a DOT action, targets a stretch ranked in the top 10 percent for severe injuries and deaths. DOT will add eight-foot-wide bike lanes with three-foot buffers, painted pedestrian islands, and daylighting at corners. The plan does not remove driving or parking lanes but reorganizes car storage to align with track columns. DOT planner Rachael Metz called the roadbed chaotic, with frequent illegal double-parking and blocked sight lines. Community board member Nas Magoutas said, 'I feel like I’ve been waiting 30 years for it.' The project follows similar redesigns in the Bronx and will begin after July 1, 2025, taking about two months to complete.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states that a mother and her three children were crossing in the crosswalk with the pedestrian signal when the vehicle struck them. The impact killed the 34-year-old woman and two of her children, ages five and eight. A four-year-old boy was left unconscious and severely injured. The police report lists 'Traffic Control Disregarded' and 'Unsafe Speed' as contributing factors for the driver. The pedestrians were crossing with the signal, as documented in the report. The sedan's center front end struck the victims, underscoring the lethal consequences of ignoring traffic controls. The driver’s unlicensed status and disregard for the signal are central to this tragedy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The van's right front bumper struck a 65-year-old man who was crossing the intersection with the pedestrian signal. The report states the man suffered fatal head injuries and died at the scene. The van sustained no damage. Police cite 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as the primary contributing factor. The victim's action—'Crossing With Signal'—is noted in the report, but only after the driver's failure to yield. The crash underscores the lethal consequences when drivers fail to respect pedestrian priority at intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Lives lost.</p><p class=mb3>On March 29, 2025, a driver with a suspended license and over 90 violations—including 15 school zone speeding tickets—killed three pedestrians and injured a fourth in Brooklyn. The incident has reignited debate over pending Albany legislation that would require drivers with more than six speed-camera or red-light tickets to install speed limiters, capping their speed to five miles per hour above the limit. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said, "This was a horrific tragedy caused by someone who should not have been on the road," but did not address the bill. Transportation Alternatives Executive Director Ben Furnas condemned the status quo, stating, "There is legislation up in Albany that would have required a speed limiter in this very car." The bill has not yet advanced. The crash exposes deep flaws in enforcement and legislative inaction, leaving vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
