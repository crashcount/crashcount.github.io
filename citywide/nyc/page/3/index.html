Just last week, an eight-year-old boy was killed crossing Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights. His sister watched. His mother grieves. “He was a boy who loved life,” <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>said his mother</a>.</p><p>Scooter riders, teens on mopeds, and cyclists have all fallen.

Seven pedestrians and seven cyclists have died since 2011. The call for change is urgent.</p><p class=mb3>On May 22, 2025, a public workshop on the redesign of Route 9A (West Side Highway) drew dozens to the Javits Center. Hosted by NYS DOT, the event focused on the need to widen the Hudson River Greenway by reclaiming car lanes for pedestrians and cyclists. The matter: 'the proposed redesign of the Hudson River Greenway seize adjacent space currently devoted to cars in order to widen the crowded bike and pedestrian path.' Christine Berthet, co-chair of CB4's Transportation Planning Committee, said, '[Taking some space from cars] to give space to pedestrians and bikes is necessary.' Jeffrey LeFrancois, executive director of the Meatpacking District BID, called the current allocation 'disproportionate.' Attendees supported eliminating a vehicle lane, adding bus lanes, and improving crossings. Safety analysts note that expanding bike and pedestrian paths reduces conflicts with cars and encourages walking and cycling, boosting safety through mode shift and numbers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The committee voted five in favor, one against, and three abstained. The resolution, described as calling on the NYPD to 'immediately end the policy ... and find another way to mitigate bad behavior,' targets the Adams administration’s escalation of traffic tickets to criminal court for minor cycling infractions. Members, including Ken Coughlin and Howard Yaruss, questioned the evidence and fairness, highlighting risks to immigrant delivery workers. The crackdown, led by Commissioner Jessica Tisch, lacked supporting data. The safety analyst notes no specific policy change or measurable impact on vulnerable road users, so no population-level safety effect can be assessed.

No council bill or committee is attached; this is advocacy, not legislation. Boenau writes: 'There isn't enough physical space for every single household to store its fleet of personal vehicles in front of the home, nor is there space for everyone to drive at the same time.' He opposes minimum parking mandates and car-centric design, and supports bus priority, bike infrastructure, and pedestrian space. Boenau urges the city to reclaim streets for people. A safety analyst notes: Recognizing the spatial limits of car storage and use can lead to policies that prioritize more efficient, equitable street use, encouraging mode shift to walking and cycling and reducing car dominance, which improves safety for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The old highway’s days are numbered. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On May 13, 2025, the Department of Transportation (DOT) announced a city-funded public engagement process for a major safety redesign of Conduit Boulevard, a three-mile corridor linking Atlantic Avenue to the Belt Parkway and JFK Airport. The project follows urgent requests in 2023 from Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "Brooklyn and Queens deserve a Conduit Boulevard that improves daily life, not a roadway that puts pedestrians and drivers at risk and physically divides entire neighborhoods." The corridor has seen five deaths and 40 severe injuries in five years. The median’s dirt paths show heavy pedestrian use, but only 15 crosswalks span the stretch. The public process begins in June and may run into 2026. The redesign aims to end decades of danger for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The policy, announced without clear data or complaint channels, targets actions like running red lights or reckless cycling. Komanoff’s statement, titled 'Tsk, Tsk, Tisch — Criminal Summonses for Cyclists Will Backfire,' warns that the crackdown will make streets less safe and hit immigrant delivery workers hardest, exposing them to risks like detainment or deportation. He urges rescinding the policy, pledging not to share citation data with ICE, and redirecting enforcement toward car and truck drivers, who inflict most harm on pedestrians.

Streets grow tense. Advocates call it obscene. The crackdown lands hardest on people of color and immigrants. Safety takes a back seat. Punishment rises. Fear spreads.</p><p class=mb3>On May 5, 2025, Streetsblog NYC reported a major NYPD policy shift. The department now issues criminal court summonses to cyclists and e-bike riders for low-level violations—red lights, stop signs, wrong-way riding. The article, 'NYPD’s Red Light Criminalization Marks ‘Obscene’ Escalation: Advocates,' details the move. Kevin Duggan covered the story. Transportation Alternatives’s Ben Furnas called the change 'an obscene escalation.' Legal experts like Daniel Lambright warned it will amplify racially biased policing, especially against immigrant workers. More than 90% of such summonses in 2024 went to New Yorkers of color. The new policy reverses a decade of decriminalization, exposing thousands to harsh penalties for minor acts. Safety analysts note: 'A quiet change in police practices often signals increased enforcement or surveillance that can disproportionately burden pedestrians and cyclists, potentially discouraging active transportation and undermining safety in numbers.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
