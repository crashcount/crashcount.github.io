Seven hundred thirty-four suffered wounds so grave they will never be the same. The dead are not numbers. A 76-year-old woman, struck by an SUV while crossing White Plains Road. A 32-year-old woman, crushed by a Jeep on Marcus Garvey Boulevard. A 79-year-old man, found dead in a parked car on West 77th.

The bill summary states it 'would require drivers of motor vehicles to maintain a minimum distance of three feet when overtaking a bicycle.' Rodriguez sponsored the bill. Legal experts Daniel Flanzig and Steve Vaccaro criticized the lack of enforcement and the absence of a defined safe passing law, noting that most of the country already has such protections. Flanzig called the law essential to prevent tragedies like the death of Kala Santiago, who was killed by a truck driver on Parkside Avenue.

The NYPD reported both were heading eastbound when the collision occurred. No tickets were issued to the driver. Parkside Avenue, recently outfitted with a protected bike lane, is not a designated truck route, but large trucks often use it. Liz Denys, campaign lead for Flatbush Streets for People, said, "Massive tractor trailers simply do not fit on streets in Flatbush. They regularly endanger people walking and biking." Advocates demand stronger measures to keep trucks off local streets and call for a comprehensive network of protected bike lanes.
