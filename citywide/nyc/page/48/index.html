A black SUV hit him. He died on the street. The driver stayed. Police said, &ldquo;They were walking, he was crossing the street with his sister&rdquo; (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>police said</a>). No arrest. The street is still open. The danger is still there.</p><p>The day before, in the Bronx, a man ran a red light. His car jumped the curb and crushed three people on the sidewalk. One is still fighting for life. The driver ran but police caught him. He faces charges for assault, fleeing, and driving without a license (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/driver-flees-bronx-car-stop-crash/>faces charges</a>).</p><p><strong>In the last 12 months, 244 people have died on New York City streets. 713 were seriously hurt.</strong> Thirteen of the dead were children. The city logs over 81,000 crashes a year. Each number is a name, a family, a future gone.</p><h3 id=the-policy-that-wasnt>The Policy That Wasn&rsquo;t</h3><p>Leaders talk. Streets stay the same. The mayor ripped out a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue after crashes involving children. He said he was listening to the community. Cyclists said, &ldquo;I don’t think he cares if we die&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/cyclists-fuming-over-mayor-adamss-removal-of-bedford-avenue-protected-bike-lane>Cyclists said</a>). The city put back paint. Paint does not stop cars.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Department of Transportation built a new protected bike lane in Queens. A commuter said, &ldquo;The old street was very dangerous&mldr; the new path is definitely safer because he&rsquo;s no longer competing with trucks and cars for road space&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/27/eyes-on-the-street-new-bike-lane-puts-the-bliss-in-blissville>A commuter said</a>). But these changes come slow. Too slow for the dead.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-that-dont-lie>The Numbers That Don&rsquo;t Lie</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks killed 299 people.</strong> Motorcycles and mopeds killed 21. Bikes killed 11. The city counts 182,570 injuries since 2022. The bodies pile up. The city debates.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call your council member. Call the mayor.

Cyclists and bus riders get space. Pedestrians breathe easier. Community board backs the plan. Car drivers lose parking. The city moves to fix a deadly gap.</p><p class=mb3>On November 9, 2022, the Department of Transportation proposed repurposing two car lanes on the Washington Bridge for a two-way protected bike lane and a dedicated bus lane. The plan was presented to Manhattan Community Board 12's Traffic and Transportation committee, which gave unanimous advisory support. The DOT aims to install the changes by summer or early fall 2023. The proposal states: 'The city wants to repurpose a pair of car lanes on the Washington Bridge uptown for a two-way bike lane and a bus lane next year, giving a dedicated space to cyclists who are currently forced to share extremely narrow paths with pedestrians.' Lucia Deng, a Transportation Alternatives activist, called the move 'huge,' noting the Bronx and Upper Manhattan have long been neglected. DOT planner Patrick Kennedy said, 'We try to maintain the protected connections as much as possible. They really only work if they’re continuous.' The plan removes 20 parking spaces but connects vital bike and bus routes, giving thousands of non-drivers safer passage.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Parks Department closed 1.4 miles of the greenway for repairs, pushing cyclists onto Dyckman, Broadway, and W. 181st—hilly streets with scant bike infrastructure. The city rejected calls for a protected bike lane on the adjacent Henry Hudson Parkway, citing cost and an eight-month traffic study. The detour, mostly unprotected, violates city law requiring safe routes during construction. Streetsblog reports 102 crashes and 36 injuries on the detour this year. Locals and cyclists, including Allegra LeGrande, say the route is unsafe, especially for children and inexperienced riders. The city’s refusal to reallocate a car lane for a protected bike path left vulnerable road users exposed to daily danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The SUV carried three occupants, including a 1-year-old and a 49-year-old passenger, who were not seriously hurt. The police report lists 'Traffic Control Disregarded' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as contributing factors for both drivers. The crash shows the lethal consequences when drivers ignore traffic signals and lose focus. Helmet use was noted only after the drivers' failures.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Forty-six thousand dead last year. Pedestrians and cyclists bear the brunt. The ballot box shapes the streets. Candidates must answer for safety. Leadership, not talk, saves lives. Voters hold the power. Streets demand action.</p><p class=mb3>On October 27, 2022, Streetsblog NYC published an opinion piece urging voters to make road safety a litmus test for candidates. The article, titled 'Opinion: Candidates’ Commitment to Road Safety Should Be a Litmus Test For Voters,' calls the current state of U.S. roads a crisis, citing over 46,000 deaths last year and record fatalities among people walking and biking. Mark Chung, executive vice president of roadway practice at the National Safety Council, authored the piece. He demands that candidates prioritize safe mobility, experience active transportation, and show a real track record on safety measures. The article stresses that policy decisions at every level—from speed limits to funding—shape daily danger for vulnerable road users. It urges voters to demand action, not words, from those seeking office.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

New York’s 24/7 school-zone network is a start. More cameras, lower speed limits, and road redesigns would save lives. Cameras work. They change driver behavior. The city needs more, not less. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>This editorial, published October 25, 2022, urges New York City to expand its speed camera program beyond school zones and pair it with traffic-calming measures. The piece states: “New York City's network of school-zone speed-enforcement cameras—which now operate 24/7—is a good start for reducing the epidemic of traffic deaths of the last 20 years.” The authors, including researchers from Columbia University, cite evidence that doubling the number of speed cameras would save hundreds of lives and over $1 billion in health and productivity costs. They call for cameras on more dangerous roads, not just near schools, and for lower speed limits, road diets, and pedestrian infrastructure. The editorial notes that cameras enforce the law without bias and at lower cost than police, but warns that fines alone may not deter wealthy repeat offenders. Sharing violation data with insurers is suggested as a fix. The message is clear: more cameras and safer streets mean fewer deaths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
