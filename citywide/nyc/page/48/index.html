His son stands over him, waiting for his eyes to open. They never do. Just days ago, Pasqual Tziquin was killed crossing New Utrecht Avenue in Brooklyn. The driver did not stop. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t stop. He just kept going,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/06/hit-and-run-driver-kills-brooklyn-restaurant-worker-in-front-of-son/>said Henry Tziquin</a>. Eight days later, Pasqual was dead. His family waits for justice.</p><p>Across the city, the violence does not let up. On the Belt Parkway, a BMW vaulted the median and slammed into oncoming cars. Six people were hurt, two left fighting for their lives. Police said, &ldquo;speed may have been an issue&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/05/us-news/six-hurt-when-car-barrels-into-oncoming-nyc-traffic/>in the crash</a>. In Crown Heights, an eight-year-old boy was struck and killed by an SUV. The street is a main road, built for speed. The boy is gone.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-behind-the-blood>The Numbers Behind the Blood</h3><p>In the last twelve months, 236 people have died on New York City streets. Another 704 suffered serious injuries. Children, elders, cyclists, pedestrians—no one is spared. SUVs and cars do the most harm: SUVs and cars killed 300 people, seriously injured 509, and hurt over 26,000 more in the last three years. Trucks and buses killed 93. Motorcycles and mopeds killed 10. Bikes killed 11. The numbers do not lie. The bodies pile up.</p><h3 id=leaders-actbut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Act—But Not Fast Enough</h3><p>Some leaders move. The city has started to lower speed limits, install more speed cameras, and build protected bike lanes. But too often, safety is ripped out as fast as it is built. When the city tried to remove the Bedford Avenue bike lane, the Department of Transportation warned: &ldquo;Removing the protected bike lane won&rsquo;t remove cyclists—it will only make the street less safe&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/dot-testimony-removing-bedford-ave-bike-lane-will-reduce-safety>testified DOT</a>.</p><p>Others push policies that punish the vulnerable. A 15 mph e-bike speed cap is on the table. Michael Replogle, former DOT official, calls it &ldquo;an ill-considered idea to improve safety which will be counterproductive&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/03/ex-dot-official-warns-nycs-counterproductive-e-bike-speed-limit-will-curb-biking-safety>said Replogle</a>. The city debates, the streets bleed.</p><h3 id=act-nowor-count-the-dead>Act Now—Or Count the Dead</h3><p>Every day of delay is another day of loss. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Tell them to protect bike lanes, not rip them out. Tell them to stop blaming the people on foot and on bikes. The bodies in the street are not statistics. They are your neighbors. They are your children. Act now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Parks Department closed 1.4 miles of the greenway for repairs, pushing cyclists onto Dyckman, Broadway, and W. 181st—hilly streets with scant bike infrastructure. The city rejected calls for a protected bike lane on the adjacent Henry Hudson Parkway, citing cost and an eight-month traffic study. The detour, mostly unprotected, violates city law requiring safe routes during construction. Streetsblog reports 102 crashes and 36 injuries on the detour this year. Locals and cyclists, including Allegra LeGrande, say the route is unsafe, especially for children and inexperienced riders. The city’s refusal to reallocate a car lane for a protected bike path left vulnerable road users exposed to daily danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Langenkamp says, 'It's just so unfair to her and to everyone that by using a bike lane, she's been ripped from us in this way.' He calls out unsafe, unprotected bike lanes and poor driver education. The conversation pushes for protected bike lanes, smarter street design, and less car dependency.

New York’s 24/7 school-zone network is a start. More cameras, lower speed limits, and road redesigns would save lives. Cameras work. They change driver behavior. The city needs more, not less. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>This editorial, published October 25, 2022, urges New York City to expand its speed camera program beyond school zones and pair it with traffic-calming measures. The piece states: “New York City's network of school-zone speed-enforcement cameras—which now operate 24/7—is a good start for reducing the epidemic of traffic deaths of the last 20 years.” The authors, including researchers from Columbia University, cite evidence that doubling the number of speed cameras would save hundreds of lives and over $1 billion in health and productivity costs. They call for cameras on more dangerous roads, not just near schools, and for lower speed limits, road diets, and pedestrian infrastructure. The editorial notes that cameras enforce the law without bias and at lower cost than police, but warns that fines alone may not deter wealthy repeat offenders. Sharing violation data with insurers is suggested as a fix. The message is clear: more cameras and safer streets mean fewer deaths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
