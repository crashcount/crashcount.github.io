She never makes it. In Astoria, Amanda Servedio is struck and killed by a driver fleeing police. She is thrown from her bike, her body coming to rest against a parked car. The chase lasts ten minutes through crowded streets.

Host Kea Wilson speaks with Dan Langenkamp, whose wife Sarah—a diplomat and mother—was killed by a right-turning truck while biking home. The episode, titled 'What It’s Really Like to Lose Someone to Traffic Violence,' exposes the raw pain and anger survivors face. Langenkamp says, 'It's just so unfair to her and to everyone that by using a bike lane, she's been ripped from us in this way.' He calls out unsafe, unprotected bike lanes and poor driver education. The conversation pushes for protected bike lanes, smarter street design, and less car dependency. Langenkamp’s advocacy turns mourning into a demand for systemic change, echoing the urgent need for streets that do not kill.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The piece states: “New York City's network of school-zone speed-enforcement cameras—which now operate 24/7—is a good start for reducing the epidemic of traffic deaths of the last 20 years.” The authors, including researchers from Columbia University, cite evidence that doubling the number of speed cameras would save hundreds of lives and over $1 billion in health and productivity costs. They call for cameras on more dangerous roads, not just near schools, and for lower speed limits, road diets, and pedestrian infrastructure. The editorial notes that cameras enforce the law without bias and at lower cost than police, but warns that fines alone may not deter wealthy repeat offenders. Sharing violation data with insurers is suggested as a fix. The message is clear: more cameras and safer streets mean fewer deaths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

States, not feds, must act.</p><p class=mb3>On October 20, 2022, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Acting Administrator Ann Carlson publicly supported legalizing the 'Idaho Stop' at the Vision Zero Cities conference. The Idaho Stop lets cyclists treat stop signs as yield signs and red lights as stop signs. Carlson stated, 'The Idaho stop allows cyclists to manage risks to their advantage. It increases their visibility to drivers and reduces their exposure.' She cited data showing no increase in conflicts with pedestrians or other cyclists. Carlson emphasized, 'Safety and equity has to go hand in hand.' The NHTSA fact sheet noted that stop-as-yield laws decriminalize common cycling behavior and may boost ridership. Carlson highlighted the need for a holistic, equitable 'safe system' approach. Despite federal support, only states can enact these changes. Efforts in New York have stalled.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Their size crushes, their height blinds. A tax on these machines would slow the arms race. Money raised could build safer streets. Fewer SUVs, fewer deaths. The danger is clear. The fix is simple. Lawmakers must act.</p><p class=mb3>This policy advocacy, highlighted at the 2022 Vision Zero Cities conference, calls for taxing large vehicles to protect vulnerable road users. The proposal, supported by Transportation Alternatives and Streetsblog NYC, urges policymakers to use tax revenue to fund safer infrastructure. The article states, 'one efficient policy would be to tax large vehicles and use the revenue to build the infrastructure needed for safer streets.' The analysis draws a direct line between the rise of SUVs and pickups and the surge in pedestrian deaths. It notes that the largest vehicles are the deadliest, especially for those on foot or bike. The piece argues that taxing these vehicles would not only discourage their use but also shift the burden of their societal costs back onto their owners. The model follows Washington, D.C.'s recent move to scale registration fees by vehicle size and dedicate funds to safety programs. The message is blunt: fewer giant vehicles, more lives saved.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
