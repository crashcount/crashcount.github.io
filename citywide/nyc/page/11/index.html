The street has only a painted bike lane, lacking physical protection. The driver, responding to an emergency, remained at the scene. Hidalgo is survived by his wife and son. His aunt, Tomasa Hidalgo, said, "The streets are not safe. The drivers don't respect the lives of the cyclists." Ligia Guallpa of the Worker's Justice Project called on the city and app delivery companies to do more, urging investment in infrastructure, regulatory frameworks, and worker protections. This marks the 22nd cyclist death and adds to a rising toll of vulnerable road users in 2024.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The agency called it 'an added safety benefit on a night when more children [are] expected out on our streets.' But the measure is fleeting. Streetsblog’s op-ed slams the city for failing to protect kids year-round. Since 2014, drivers have killed 116 children—an average of 12 per year. Tens of thousands more have been injured. The piece urges permanent pedestrianization, especially near schools, where crash rates spike during drop-off. Paris has closed over 200 school streets since 2000. New York lags behind.

The study analyzed 558 illegal parking complaints submitted to 311 over five days, using AI and city traffic cameras. The matter title states: 'A study of NYPD responses to 311 complaints found "inconsistent, and in some cases non-existent" enforcement of safety-related parking rules.' NYPD issued tickets in only 2.87% of cases, often closing complaints in under nine minutes—faster than responses to critical crimes. The report documents police dismissing complaints without proper checks and even harassing complainants. Arnav and Ensari found that at the 21 locations studied, there were two deaths, 257 injuries, and 2,319 crashes since 2014.

No one stopped the carnage.</p><p class=mb3>On October 23, 2024, a cyclist was killed by a hit-and-run driver fleeing NYPD in Astoria. The incident follows a rise in police chases since Mayor Adams took office. The black Dodge Ram involved had 80 camera-issued speeding or red-light tickets since mid-2022, but the owner never faced a mandated safety course because the city’s program expired and was not renewed. Residents and advocates, including Chong Bretillon and Elizabeth Adams, condemned the NYPD’s pursuit tactics. Bretillon demanded accountability from the 114th Precinct, calling the chase 'completely unacceptable.' Adams stated, 'It’s time for the city to ban police chases in writing and in practice.' Calls for a ban on police chases and renewal of the DOT safety course program have intensified as the death toll mounts.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The impact shattered her pelvis, causing fatal crush injuries. The report states the victim 'died on the pavement.' The SUV showed no damage. Critically, the police report notes the driver was unlicensed at the time of the crash. No license, no right to drive, yet the vehicle continued straight ahead, ending a life. The report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified,' but the narrative centers the unlicensed driver as a key element. No mention is made of any victim behavior contributing to the crash.
