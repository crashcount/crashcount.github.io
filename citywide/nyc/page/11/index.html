The danger stays.</p><p class=mb3>According to the New York Post (February 27, 2025), off-duty FDNY firefighter Michael Pena drove through a red light at Northern Boulevard and 107th Street in Queens, striking Justin Diaz’s car. Surveillance video captured Pena’s Mercedes “passing a red light on Northern Boulevard and T-boning Diaz’s 2022 BMW.” Diaz, 23, died at Elmhurst Hospital. Pena faces charges of vehicular manslaughter, DWI, and refusal to take a breath test. Two passengers in Pena’s car were hospitalized. The FDNY suspended Pena for 28 days without pay. The crash highlights the lethal consequences of red-light running and impaired driving, raising questions about enforcement and accountability on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The narrative describes a scene where 'a taxi's side [was] torn open' and 'a Ford SUV's front [was] crushed,' both vehicles traveling south. The report states the pedestrian was 'outside the crosswalk' and engaged in 'other actions in roadway,' but does not list any pedestrian behavior as a contributing factor. Both vehicle drivers were licensed and headed straight, with the taxi sustaining damage to its left side and the SUV to its center front end. According to the police report, contributing factors are 'unspecified.' The focus remains on the lethal interaction between two large vehicles and a vulnerable pedestrian, with no evidence cited of pedestrian error. The street, speed, and vehicle mass combined to end a life.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
