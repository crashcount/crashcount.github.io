Lauren Pine, a crash survivor, pleads, 'We can't wait another day to enforce truck safety requirements.' Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso warns, 'The city's goal right now should be to prevent bad implementation from undermining a good bill.' Delays keep streets deadly for workers, pedestrians, and cyclists. The law’s promise remains unfulfilled. Vulnerable New Yorkers remain at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The police report lists the contributing factor as 'Unspecified' for the drivers involved.

The system fails vulnerable people.</p><p class=mb3>On October 29, 2024, researchers Benjamin Arnav and Elif Ensari released a report exposing NYPD’s 'systemic failure' to enforce safety-related parking violations. The study analyzed 558 illegal parking complaints submitted to 311 over five days, using AI and city traffic cameras. The matter title states: 'A study of NYPD responses to 311 complaints found "inconsistent, and in some cases non-existent" enforcement of safety-related parking rules.' NYPD issued tickets in only 2.87% of cases, often closing complaints in under nine minutes—faster than responses to critical crimes. The report documents police dismissing complaints without proper checks and even harassing complainants. Arnav and Ensari found that at the 21 locations studied, there were two deaths, 257 injuries, and 2,319 crashes since 2014. The findings echo past investigations and highlight a city government at odds with itself: one agency builds safe streets, another lets cars block them.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Bretillon demanded accountability from the 114th Precinct, calling the chase 'completely unacceptable.' Adams stated, 'It’s time for the city to ban police chases in writing and in practice.'
