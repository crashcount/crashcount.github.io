Seven hundred thirty-four suffered wounds so grave they will never be the same. The dead are not numbers. A 76-year-old woman, struck by an SUV while crossing White Plains Road. A 32-year-old woman, crushed by a Jeep on Marcus Garvey Boulevard. A 79-year-old man, found dead in a parked car on West 77th.

The city left the southernmost block, between Hanson Place and Lafayette Avenue, without a protected bike lane. As activists from Transportation Alternatives wrote, this block 'does not work for anyone on the street and is the missing link in an otherwise protected bike lane.' Council members are not named, but the campaign targets Mayor Adams and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. Residents supported the full plan, but the city caved to real estate and institutional pressure, keeping two-way car traffic and exposing cyclists to danger. Crash data shows injuries persist. Activists urge the city to close the gap before the painting season ends.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The narrative states, 'A 31-year-old man stood in the roadway. Two SUVs struck him, one after the other. His body broke beneath the steel. No intersection. No chance.' The crash occurred away from any intersection, with the pedestrian listed as 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Not at Intersection' and engaged in 'Other Actions in Roadway.' The first SUV, a 2023 Nissan, was 'Changing Lanes' before its right front bumper struck the man. The second SUV, a 2018 Jaguar, was described as 'Parked' with impact to its center back end. The police report lists both driver contributing factors as 'Unspecified.' The report does not attribute any contributing factors to the pedestrian's behavior. The sequence and violence of the impacts underscore the vulnerability of people on foot in high-speed corridors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The incident occurred just hours before the Department of Transportation (DOT) implemented a long-stalled safety redesign. The redesign narrowed the roadway to one lane and added a protected bike lane—a 'road diet' proven to improve safety. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives condemned the city's delay, stating, 'delaying projects has a real cost.' The matter highlights the deadly impact of bureaucratic inaction. Between January and early October, there were 86 reported crashes on this mile-long stretch, injuring cyclists, pedestrians, and motorists, and killing one pedestrian. The city faces a pedestrian death crisis, with fatalities rising. DOT claims the redesign will make the street safer, but for Mendez, the fix came too late.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The resolution states opening the path 'must take priority over the convenience of drivers.' DOT has delayed the project repeatedly, citing unrelated upper deck construction.

Deaths up 28 percent from last year. Cars and trucks are the main killers. Not e-bikes. Not mopeds. City pushes plazas, daylighting, and enforcement. Streets remain deadly. Drivers escape blame. Victims pay.</p><p class=mb3>This report, published September 26, 2024, details a surge in pedestrian deaths: 87 killed in NYC between January 1 and September 23, up from 68 in the same period last year—a 28 percent jump. The NYPD and DOT confirm a double-digit rise in deaths and injuries, with 23 pedestrians hurt daily. The matter summary states, 'The 2024 Pedestrian Death Crisis is Due to Driving.' Jon Orcutt, former DOT official, calls for targeted enforcement against drivers, especially those dodging accountability. DOT spokesman Vin Barone says, 'Cars are heavier and faster and still pose a far greater risk.' The Adams administration is expanding pedestrian plazas, daylighting intersections, and cracking down on reckless driving. Data show cars and trucks cause most deaths, not micromobility. Only 5.5% of injuries involve e-bikes or mopeds. The city focuses on driver accountability and infrastructure, but the toll climbs. Vulnerable road users remain at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
