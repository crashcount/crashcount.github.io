The report states the pedestrian was 'outside the crosswalk' and engaged in 'other actions in roadway,' but does not list any pedestrian behavior as a contributing factor. Both vehicle drivers were licensed and headed straight, with the taxi sustaining damage to its left side and the SUV to its center front end. According to the police report, contributing factors are 'unspecified.' The focus remains on the lethal interaction between two large vehicles and a vulnerable pedestrian, with no evidence cited of pedestrian error.
