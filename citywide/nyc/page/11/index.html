A 21-year-old, unlicensed driver in a Nissan Rogue struck him and fled. The cyclist hit the pavement, head first. Paramedics found him unconscious, his red light still flashing in the street.

They renewed speed cameras in school zones. They passed Sammy’s Law, giving the city power to lower speed limits. But the default speed limit remains above 20 mph. The city sprinkles 20 mph zones, but the carnage continues. The most dangerous drivers—those with dozens of camera tickets—still roam free. The law to stop them sits in Albany.</p><h3 id=what-next-the-cost-of-waiting>What Next: The Cost of Waiting</h3><p>Every day, another family joins the list. The city has the tools. It needs the will.

The vehicle’s point of impact was the center front end, confirming a direct collision. The report notes the pedestrian was 'crossing, no signal, or crosswalk,' but only after citing driver inattention. No additional victim behaviors are listed as contributing factors. The fatal crash underscores the deadly consequences of driver distraction on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
