As Attorney General Letitia James put it, <a href=https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/attorney-general-says-police-chases-mostly-banned-20392396.php>“the evidence is clear: police vehicle pursuits and high-speed car chases can be dangerous and even fatal, and it is time for a change.”</a> Policy shifts like this save lives when they are followed, measured, and kept.</p><h3 id=slow-it-down-stop-the-repeat-offenders>Slow it down. Stop the repeat offenders.</h3><p>Tools sit on the shelf. NYC now has the power to set safer default speeds on local streets. Albany renewed 24/7 school‑zone speed cameras through 2030. And a bill in Albany would force the worst repeat speeders to install speed limiters after a set number of violations.
