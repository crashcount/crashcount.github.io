Seven hundred thirty-four suffered wounds so grave they will never be the same. The dead are not numbers. A 76-year-old woman, struck by an SUV while crossing White Plains Road. A 32-year-old woman, crushed by a Jeep on Marcus Garvey Boulevard. A 79-year-old man, found dead in a parked car on West 77th.

But the law that keeps speed cameras running is set to expire. If Albany fails, the cameras go dark. Streets go back to the way they were—fast, brutal, and unforgiving. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez warns, &ldquo;an extremely reckless few continue to endanger themselves and everyone around them.&rdquo; <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/nyc-dot-calls-speed-camera-program-renewal-new-speeding-bill>Patch</a></p><p>There is talk of a new law for &ldquo;super speeders.&rdquo; There is talk of lowering the speed limit to 20 mph. There is always talk. But families keep burying their dead.</p><h3 id=the-system-fails-the-vulnerable>The System Fails the Vulnerable</h3><p><strong>The city cracks down on cyclists and e-bike riders, not the drivers who do the killing.</strong> Community boards call it out. &ldquo;Holding cyclists to a far higher standard than motor vehicle drivers is unjust, puts immigrant workers at grave risk, and sends the wrong message about the actual danger on our streets,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/cart-before-horse-upper-west-siders-demand-nypd-halt-bike-crackdown>said Manhattan Community Board 7</a>.

The report states, 'A 26-year-old man was thrown from his motorcycle. He hit headfirst. The front end crumpled. The road stayed hard. He did not get up.' The impact was severe, with the motorcycle sustaining center front-end damage and the rider suffering fatal head injuries. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified,' providing no further detail on the cause. The victim was ejected from the motorcycle and killed instantly, with apparent death noted at the scene. No other vehicles or persons were involved, and the report does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor. The crash underscores the lethal consequences of high-speed impacts and the unforgiving nature of city expressways.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Seniors and advocates demand action. The city drags its feet. Pedestrians choke on fumes, dodge cars, trip on broken sidewalks. Most don’t own cars. Most walk. Still, cars rule the street. The danger remains. The city studies. People die.</p><p class=mb3>This advocacy campaign, highlighted on October 4, 2024, calls for a full redesign of Canal Street. Manhattan Community Board 1, Transportation Alternatives, and local seniors demand urgent action. The matter: 'transforming Canal Street into a safer, more accessible space for everyone, especially seniors.' Emily Jacobi of Transportation Alternatives says, 'Canal is dangerous, it's deadly, and it's killing us.' Wellington Chen of the Chinatown Partnership points to pollution and stress harming elders. The Department of Transportation claims improvements are coming, but progress is slow. Community Board 1 voted for expanded pedestrian space and a protected bike lane years ago. Most residents walk or use transit. Still, the street favors cars. Since 2014, Canal has seen 10 deaths and 700 injuries. The city’s inaction leaves seniors and all vulnerable users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The danger is clear.</p><p class=mb3>On October 4, 2024, Streetsblog NYC released a media editorial titled 'Friday Video: Car and Truck Drivers are the Cause of Virtually All Road Violence.' The piece does not reference a council bill, but it issues a sharp rebuke to politicians who fixate on moped riders while ignoring the main threat. The editorial states, 'Virtually all of the injuries and deaths on our roadways are caused by the drivers of cars and trucks.' The video, created by Streetsblog Engagement Editor, shows graphic evidence of this violence. The editorial calls for road safety redesigns that protect the most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, seniors, children, people in wheelchairs. It demands accountability from car and truck drivers, not scapegoating of two-wheelers. The message is blunt: the crisis is behind the wheel, not on the sidewalk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

One car lane goes. Cyclists get wide, protected paths. Riders must switch sides twice for tunnel traffic and firehouse parking. 469 crashes, 187 hurt in five years. Locals back the change.</p><p class=mb3>On October 1, 2024, the Department of Transportation announced a plan to close the protected bike lane gap along Soho’s Sixth Avenue. The proposal, discussed with Community Board 2’s Transportation Committee, removes one of four car lanes to install a curbside protected bike lane between Lispenard and W. Eighth streets. DOT project manager Preston Johnson called it 'the last gap between the Financial District and Central Park.' The plan forces cyclists to switch sides twice to accommodate Holland Tunnel traffic and firehouse parking. Over five years, 469 crashes injured 187 people on this stretch. Community Board 2 Transportation Chair Shirley Secunda said, 'Eight years ago we did a resolution asking DOT to reduce Sixth Avenue to three travel lanes from four [so] we’re very happy that it’s finally happening.' The project adds eight-to-ten-foot bike lanes, pedestrianizes a slip lane, and builds bus boarding islands. Local support is strong.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
