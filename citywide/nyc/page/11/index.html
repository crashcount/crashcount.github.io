In the last twelve months, <strong>285 people died</strong> on New York City streets. <strong>767 suffered serious injuries</strong>. The names fade, but the numbers do not. Just last week, a woman in Morris Heights was killed by a driver who struck her and fled. Police <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/woman-killed-in-bronx-hit-and-run/>reported</a> her death. Her family waits for answers. The driver is gone.</p><p>On July 19, a stolen car tore through Chinatown at over 100 miles per hour. It killed Kevin Cruickshank and May Kwok. Kwok was sitting on a bench. Cruickshank was riding his bike. The city’s Department of Transportation promised upgrades, but the dead do not return. NY1 <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/07/chinatown-deadly-crash-safety-upgrades-canal-street>reported</a> that &ldquo;a stolen vehicle, allegedly driven at more than 100 miles per hour&mldr;crashed into them.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=patterns-in-the-blood>Patterns in the Blood</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the highest price.</strong> In three and a half years, cars and SUVs killed <strong>328</strong> and seriously injured <strong>549</strong>. Trucks and buses killed <strong>99</strong>. Motorcycles and mopeds, <strong>11</strong>. Bikes, <strong>11</strong>. The city’s most vulnerable are left to cross streets built for speed, not safety.</p><p>Drivers flee. They run red lights. They turn without looking. The city counts the bodies. The numbers do not lie. The pain is not abstract. It is a mother’s phone that will never ring. It is a bench left empty.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city has taken steps. Speed cameras in school zones will stay on through 2030. The Council legalized jaywalking, ending a law that punished the poor and people of color. But the default speed limit is still 25 mph. The city has the power to lower it to 20 mph. It has not used it. The dead keep coming.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit citywide.</strong> Demand action against repeat speeders. Join the fight with Transportation Alternatives and Families for Safe Streets. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The city will not save itself.</p><p><strong>The blood on the street is not an accident.

The man, who was wearing a lap belt and harness, suffered fatal chest injuries and was not ejected from the vehicle. The report states, 'A 73-year-old man lost consciousness at the wheel. His Ford SUV veered left, crushing into a Lexus.' No driver errors such as distraction or speeding are cited beyond the medical emergency.
