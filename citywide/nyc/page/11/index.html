The case, described as a 'Judicial ruling on NYC bike lane removal,' reversed a lower court decision. Transportation Alternatives and Brooklyn resident Baruch Herzfeld appealed to protect the lanes. Ben Furnas, executive director of Transportation Alternatives, called the project 'central Brooklyn's only protected bike lane.' This legal action preserves safe infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians, supporting mode shift and reducing risk for vulnerable road users while the legal fight continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The complaint, reported by Streetsblog NYC, claims the NYPD's Community Response Team operated as a rogue unit, answerable only to City Hall, with Deputy Mayor Kaz Daughtry allowing reckless pursuits. Donlon cites deaths and injuries, including cyclist Amanda Servedio. The suit alleges 398 crashes and 315 injuries in 2024—a 47% jump. Donlon's allegations highlight how high-speed chases increase risk to pedestrians and cyclists, introducing unpredictable, dangerous driving and eroding public trust in safe, equitable enforcement.
