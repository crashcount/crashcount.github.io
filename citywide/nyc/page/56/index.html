Several people were critically hurt. Business leaders and advocates demand faster action. They want more pedestrian space, protected bike lanes, and fewer cars. The mayor hesitates. The city delays. The danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On June 23, 2022, a crash on Broadway left several people critically injured when a taxi mounted the curb. The incident reignited calls for pedestrian safety from business improvement districts (BIDs) and advocates. The matter, described as 'renewed calls from BIDs and safe-streets advocates for accelerated pedestrian improvements and full pedestrianization of Broadway,' highlights the slow progress of the city's 'Broadway Vision' project, which began in 2009 and has only fully pedestrianized six blocks. BID leaders James Mettham, Jennifer Falk, and Tom Harris voiced strong support for expanding pedestrian areas and protected bike lanes. Cory Epstein of Transportation Alternatives called pedestrianization a 'win-win.' Mayor Adams, however, showed reluctance, deferring decisions to the transportation commissioner. The Department of Transportation promised more information soon. Advocates and BIDs continue to push for a car-free Broadway, citing proven safety and business benefits.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It appears in Streetsblog NYC and is authored by Gersh Kuntzman, the editor. The piece is not a council bill, but a forceful opinion on electric vehicles and urban transportation. Kuntzman writes, 'I believe that electric cars are the biggest current threat to the livable streets movement.' He argues e-cars do not reduce crashes, injuries, or fatalities, nor do they address congestion, social isolation, or pollution. The editorial criticizes political leaders and environmental groups for greenwashing e-cars, warning that they distract from real safety and sustainability. No council members or votes are involved. There is no positive safety impact for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, presented to Community Board 2's Transportation Committee, targets a 'dangerous, narrow stretch of roadway' connecting the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges.

The matter summary states, 'The city will install a two-way protected bike lane along Ashland Place and Navy Street, a dangerous, narrow stretch of roadway.' Community Board 2 members and advocates like Jon Orcutt supported the plan, with only one complaint: it should have come sooner. Jeanette Brown, a local resident, called for more sidewalk space for pedestrians. Since 2018, 297 crashes have caused 111 injuries, including 22 cyclists and 28 pedestrians.

Seventy percent of pedestrians killed in Portland last year lacked permanent housing. The report states: 'The presence of unhoused people does not make our streets unsafe. Rather, poor roadway design, ongoing neglect and deferred maintenance, recklessness in the form of speeding, operating a vehicle while impaired by drugs or alcohol, and other dangerous driving behavior are all well-documented reasons why there is this alarming uptick in deaths.' No council member is named; the report draws on research and advocates’ voices. The analysis condemns sweeps and bans on campsites, arguing these policies force people into more dangerous corridors and away from services. The study calls for ending sweeps, providing housing, redesigning streets, lowering speed limits, improving lighting, and closing high-crash roads to cars.
