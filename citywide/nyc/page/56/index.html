The statement followed a spate of violence: 'Car drivers killed at least three people and injured seven others, including an 11-year-old boy.' The carnage included hit-and-runs, reckless driving, and unlicensed operators. Adams and Rodriguez said they are 'working every day to deliver true public safety for pedestrians, cyclists, and everyone who uses our streets.' They acknowledged recent progress but warned, 'the disturbing incidents we've seen in recent weeks and the last 48 hours remind us just how fragile those positive steps are and how much more work remains.'

The police report lists 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' as contributing factors. The pedestrians were crossing with the signal when struck. The drivers’ actions—speed and improper lane use—created deadly conditions for people in the crosswalk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The incident reignited calls for pedestrian safety from business improvement districts (BIDs) and advocates. The matter, described as 'renewed calls from BIDs and safe-streets advocates for accelerated pedestrian improvements and full pedestrianization of Broadway,' highlights the slow progress of the city's 'Broadway Vision' project, which began in 2009 and has only fully pedestrianized six blocks. BID leaders James Mettham, Jennifer Falk, and Tom Harris voiced strong support for expanding pedestrian areas and protected bike lanes. Cory Epstein of Transportation Alternatives called pedestrianization a 'win-win.' Mayor Adams, however, showed reluctance, deferring decisions to the transportation commissioner. The Department of Transportation promised more information soon. Advocates and BIDs continue to push for a car-free Broadway, citing proven safety and business benefits.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He argues e-cars do not reduce crashes, injuries, or fatalities, nor do they address congestion, social isolation, or pollution.
