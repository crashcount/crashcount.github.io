The project, presented to Community Board 2's Transportation Committee, targets a 'dangerous, narrow stretch of roadway' connecting the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges. DOT will convert Ashland Place to a one-way street northbound, install concrete barriers, and add pedestrian refuge islands. The matter summary states, 'The city will install a two-way protected bike lane along Ashland Place and Navy Street, a dangerous, narrow stretch of roadway.' Community Board 2 members and advocates like Jon Orcutt supported the plan, with only one complaint: it should have come sooner. Jeanette Brown, a local resident, called for more sidewalk space for pedestrians. Since 2018, 297 crashes have caused 111 injuries, including 22 cyclists and 28 pedestrians. The redesign aims to cut these numbers by separating people from traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The fix: redesign, not displacement.</p><p class=mb3>This policy analysis, released June 13, 2022, by Portland State University, exposes the deadly toll of car crashes on unhoused pedestrians. Seventy percent of pedestrians killed in Portland last year lacked permanent housing. The report states: 'The presence of unhoused people does not make our streets unsafe. Rather, poor roadway design, ongoing neglect and deferred maintenance, recklessness in the form of speeding, operating a vehicle while impaired by drugs or alcohol, and other dangerous driving behavior are all well-documented reasons why there is this alarming uptick in deaths.' No council member is named; the report draws on research and advocates’ voices. The analysis condemns sweeps and bans on campsites, arguing these policies force people into more dangerous corridors and away from services. The study calls for ending sweeps, providing housing, redesigning streets, lowering speed limits, improving lighting, and closing high-crash roads to cars. The message: systemic change, not scapegoating, will save lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The driver received only traffic tickets for failure to yield and obey a traffic control device. The matter highlights the absence of protected bike lanes and traffic calming on this block, as Community Board 10 previously rejected safety redesigns. The Department of Transportation’s improvements end one block away. Since 2018, this block has seen 155 crashes, injuring nine cyclists, one pedestrian, and 46 motorists. The NYPD’s enforcement is lax, and illegal parking by officers is common. Advocates have long called for modern safety measures, but local opposition and city inaction leave vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, a Chevy SUV traveling north at unsafe speed struck several parked cars before colliding with a sedan making a left turn.

Cyclists and walkers lose their only safe path. Detour runs through truck-choked streets. No barriers. No protection. Residents demand action. Parks Department faces criticism for neglecting vulnerable road users. Danger rises as closure begins.</p><p class=mb3>On June 6, 2022, the Parks Department will close a one-mile stretch of the Hudson River Greenway between Dyckman Street and the George Washington Bridge for at least four months. The closure, announced in the opinion piece 'City Must Protect Bikers, Walkers During Hudson Greenway Closure,' leaves pedestrians and cyclists in Washington Heights, Inwood, and the Northwest Bronx without a safe north-south route. The city’s detour—via Dyckman Street, Broadway, and West 181st Street—forces vulnerable road users onto dangerous, truck-heavy roads. The author, echoing community demands, calls for immediate safety measures like physical barriers and criticizes the Parks Department for closing vital bike corridors without proper oversight. Previous requests for a protected bike lane on the Henry Hudson Parkway and federal funding for greenway improvements were ignored. The piece urges the city to act now to protect non-vehicular road users during the closure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
