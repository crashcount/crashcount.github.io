In the last twelve months, <strong>241 people died</strong> and <strong>701 suffered serious injuries</strong> on New York’s streets. The dead do not get second chances. The injured carry scars no policy can erase.

His head was wide open,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/brooklyn-90-year-old-man-hit-run-rider/>said an eyewitness</a>. The rider did not stop.

No charges filed. <strong>Fifty-five pedestrians have died this year</strong>. The number is lower than last year.

Lives do not wait.</p><p>Some leaders fight for safety. Others rip it out. The city tried to remove the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane.

They are families left waiting for someone who will not come home.</p><h2 id=what-now>What Now</h2><p><strong>Every day the council delays, someone else dies.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph citywide speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand action.

The incident reignited calls for pedestrian safety from business improvement districts (BIDs) and advocates. The matter, described as 'renewed calls from BIDs and safe-streets advocates for accelerated pedestrian improvements and full pedestrianization of Broadway,' highlights the slow progress of the city's 'Broadway Vision' project, which began in 2009 and has only fully pedestrianized six blocks. BID leaders James Mettham, Jennifer Falk, and Tom Harris voiced strong support for expanding pedestrian areas and protected bike lanes. Cory Epstein of Transportation Alternatives called pedestrianization a 'win-win.' Mayor Adams, however, showed reluctance, deferring decisions to the transportation commissioner. The Department of Transportation promised more information soon. Advocates and BIDs continue to push for a car-free Broadway, citing proven safety and business benefits.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He argues e-cars do not reduce crashes, injuries, or fatalities, nor do they address congestion, social isolation, or pollution.

The redesign adds refuge islands and narrows crossings.</p><p class=mb3>On June 20, 2022, the Department of Transportation announced plans for a two-way protected bike lane along Ashland Place and Navy Street in Downtown Brooklyn. The project, presented to Community Board 2's Transportation Committee, targets a 'dangerous, narrow stretch of roadway' connecting the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges. DOT will convert Ashland Place to a one-way street northbound, install concrete barriers, and add pedestrian refuge islands. The matter summary states, 'The city will install a two-way protected bike lane along Ashland Place and Navy Street, a dangerous, narrow stretch of roadway.' Community Board 2 members and advocates like Jon Orcutt supported the plan, with only one complaint: it should have come sooner. Jeanette Brown, a local resident, called for more sidewalk space for pedestrians. Since 2018, 297 crashes have caused 111 injuries, including 22 cyclists and 28 pedestrians. The redesign aims to cut these numbers by separating people from traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
