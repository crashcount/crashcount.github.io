The toll goes beyond crashes—air and noise pollution, violence, and social injustice hit hardest. Marginalized groups suffer most. The call is clear: shift to walking, cycling, and transit.</p><p class=mb3>On March 5, 2024, a major advocacy report was released, examining the global harms of car dependency. The literature review, conducted by UK and Germany-based researchers, surveyed nearly 500 studies on 'automobility.' The report states: 'Car domination is directly responsible for at least one in every 34 deaths around the world.' The harms extend to air and noise pollution, lead exposure, violence, and social injustice, with marginalized communities bearing the brunt. Patrick Miner, a study author, argues, 'If automobility has contributed, you know, X billion dollars of economic growth ... how do we compare that to killing 60 to 80 million people?' The report calls for policies that reduce car harm and prioritize human-centered transportation—walking, cycling, and public transit.

The impact was severe: the airbag deployed, and the 69-year-old male driver, who was alone in the vehicle, suffered fatal lacerations across his body.

He says low-income New Yorkers need better transit, not more delay. Upgrades for subways and buses hang in the balance. The fight is not about cars. It is about survival and dignity.</p><p class=mb3>On March 4, 2024, David Jones, President and CEO of the Community Service Society, issued a public statement supporting congestion pricing as the MTA prepared for a final vote. The matter, titled 'Want to Really Help Low-Income New Yorkers? Support Congestion Pricing,' argues, 'Low-income New Yorkers are not hurt by congestion pricing. In fact, they overwhelmingly stand to gain from congestion pricing's benefits.' Jones highlights that only 2 percent of poor, outer-borough residents drive into Manhattan, and most would qualify for toll discounts. He warns that lawsuits from suburban officials threaten $15 billion in transit upgrades—modern signals, elevators, electric buses, and new trains—critical for vulnerable riders in neighborhoods like Mott Haven, Crown Heights, Harlem, and Jamaica. Jones urges the MTA to dismiss these lawsuits and deliver the modern, reliable, and accessible transit system New Yorkers deserve.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The 57-year-old woman riding the e-bike, who was wearing a helmet, was struck and crushed at the hip. She died at the scene. The report lists 'Passing Too Closely' as the primary contributing factor, underscoring a critical driver error by the truck operator. The truck itself sustained no damage and continued on after the collision. The e-bike rider’s helmet use is noted in the report, but the fatal outcome was driven by the truck driver's failure to maintain a safe passing distance.

The report states: 'A bus turned right. The rear wheel struck a man’s head. He was 45. Blood pooled on the pavement. The bus showed no damage. He died where he fell.' The pedestrian was at the intersection, engaged in 'other actions in roadway' as described in the report. The vehicle, a 2018 bus, was undamaged and driven by a licensed male driver. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified.' No driver errors are explicitly cited, but the narrative centers the lethal consequences of a turning bus and the vulnerability of those on foot.

The narrative states the cyclist was thrown, crushed, and killed, suffering head trauma. The police report notes the truck 'kept straight' as it struck the cyclist, who lay still after impact. The contributing factor listed by police is 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion,' but no specific driver error is cited in the data. The cyclist was not wearing a helmet, as recorded in the report, but this is not listed as a contributing factor to the crash. The violence of the impact and the truck's continued path underscore the danger faced by cyclists sharing streets with large vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
