According to the police report, both vehicles were making left turns when the SUV hit the e-scooter, ejecting the rider and causing fatal head trauma. The report states that 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' was the contributing factor in the crash. The woman died at the scene, her blood marking the pavement.

They want daylight at every intersection. They cite dead children and blind corners. City drags its feet. DOT promises 1,000 fixes a year. Boards say that’s not enough. Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On March 6, 2024, ten New York City community boards endorsed a citywide ban on parking at intersections—a practice called daylighting. The boards urge the city to stop exempting itself from state law requiring no parking within 20 feet of crosswalks. The resolution follows fatal crashes involving children at poorly visible corners. The matter summary reads: 'Ten community boards representing nearly 1.5 million New Yorkers have voted to endorse a ban on parking at intersections (daylighting) to improve street safety.' Ken Coughlin of Community Board 7 said, 'You’re losing parking [that causes] serious injury and death—that’s pretty indefensible.' Carl Mahaney of StreetopiaUWS added, 'Improving the crosswalk experience really resonates with New Yorkers.' Despite support from Brooklyn and other borough officials, DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez hesitates, citing cost and limited data. DOT pledges to daylight 1,000 intersections yearly, but no full safety analysis exists. Boards and advocates say the city’s pace leaves vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The call is clear: shift to walking, cycling, and transit.</p><p class=mb3>On March 5, 2024, a major advocacy report was released, examining the global harms of car dependency. The literature review, conducted by UK and Germany-based researchers, surveyed nearly 500 studies on 'automobility.' The report states: 'Car domination is directly responsible for at least one in every 34 deaths around the world.' The harms extend to air and noise pollution, lead exposure, violence, and social injustice, with marginalized communities bearing the brunt. Patrick Miner, a study author, argues, 'If automobility has contributed, you know, X billion dollars of economic growth ... how do we compare that to killing 60 to 80 million people?' The report calls for policies that reduce car harm and prioritize human-centered transportation—walking, cycling, and public transit.

It is about survival and dignity.</p><p class=mb3>On March 4, 2024, David Jones, President and CEO of the Community Service Society, issued a public statement supporting congestion pricing as the MTA prepared for a final vote. The matter, titled 'Want to Really Help Low-Income New Yorkers? Support Congestion Pricing,' argues, 'Low-income New Yorkers are not hurt by congestion pricing. In fact, they overwhelmingly stand to gain from congestion pricing's benefits.' Jones highlights that only 2 percent of poor, outer-borough residents drive into Manhattan, and most would qualify for toll discounts. He warns that lawsuits from suburban officials threaten $15 billion in transit upgrades—modern signals, elevators, electric buses, and new trains—critical for vulnerable riders in neighborhoods like Mott Haven, Crown Heights, Harlem, and Jamaica. Jones urges the MTA to dismiss these lawsuits and deliver the modern, reliable, and accessible transit system New Yorkers deserve.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crash occurred at 5:58 a.m. The report states the e-bike rider was traveling at 'unsafe speed' and 'disregarded traffic control.' The narrative details that the rider 'hit a parked Jeep at speed,' was 'ejected,' and 'died before dawn.' The police report notes the victim was wearing a helmet. The Jeep, registered in Pennsylvania, was parked and unoccupied at the time of the crash. The e-bike was described as 'demolished.' The police report centers contributing factors on 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Traffic Control Disregarded.' No driver error from the SUV is cited, as the vehicle was stationary. The focus remains on the systemic dangers of speed and control loss on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The redesign cuts car lanes, adds protected bike lanes, and builds pedestrian islands. Fourteen people have died here since 2016. Locals demand real change.</p><p class=mb3>On February 23, 2024, Brooklyn’s Community Board 7 nearly unanimously endorsed the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) proposal to redesign Third Avenue, a corridor where 14 people have died since 2016. The board’s transportation committee chair called the changes 'long overdue.' The plan, discussed in workshops since spring 2023, would reduce the avenue from three to two moving lanes each way, add parking-protected bike lanes, and install painted pedestrian islands. Board members, including Katie Walsh and Gabino Morales, voiced strong support, with Morales stating, 'This is just a beginning of what we could do to fix our community.' Diana Gonzalez described the avenue as a place where 'they're gonna kill you.' The board will urge DOT to go beyond paint and install hard infrastructure. DOT aims to finalize plans after further traffic analysis, with implementation possible in late 2024.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
