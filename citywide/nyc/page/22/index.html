The incident occurred early in the morning when the motorcycle, traveling south, lost control on slippery pavement and collided head-on with a southbound SUV. The police report lists 'Pavement Slippery' as a contributing factor. The rider, who was helmeted, was ejected from the motorcycle and suffered severe head trauma, resulting in apparent death at the scene. The motorcycle was described as 'demolished,' and blood was visible on the road. Both vehicles sustained front-end damage. No driver errors such as speeding or failure to yield are cited in the report, but the hazardous road surface is explicitly noted. The victim's helmet use is mentioned in the police report after the primary contributing factor of the slick pavement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Scholar Nicole Gelinas analyzed over 200 fatal crashes from 2022 and found that 47 deaths could have been prevented if the city had removed vehicles with five or more red-light or speed camera tickets in a year. Gelinas urges the city and state to escalate fines after two violations, revoke registrations for repeat offenders, and revive the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program. She states, "Heightened enforcement or non-carceral punishment against those drivers should not be controversial... [It] would make New York City’s roads substantially safer without harming the average driver." Gelinas emphasizes that a small group of drivers cause outsized harm, and that enforcement saves lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No city plan released.</p><p class=mb3>On March 12, 2024, residents and advocates sounded the alarm as NYPD vehicles filled the protected bike lane on Park Row, Manhattan. The event, reported by Streetsblog NYC, followed the removal of metal barricades that had long restricted access. Instead of relief, the community found dozens of police cars and unmarked vehicles parked in the bike lane and on sidewalks. Nick Stabile, co-founder of the Park Row Alliance, said, 'Our residents have difficulty with something as simple as walking down the street and riding their bikes – and it's especially difficult for those in wheelchairs and with strollers.' Lucy West, a local resident, added, 'Park Row is not a parking lot, it's a street.' The city has not announced a plan for the corridor. Local elected officials have called for public input before any changes. Vulnerable road users remain at risk as police continue to block critical space.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
