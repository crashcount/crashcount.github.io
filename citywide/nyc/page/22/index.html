The crash occurred in the early morning, at 6:03 a.m. The report states the box truck 'ran the control,' directly leading to the fatal collision. The cyclist, who was wearing a helmet, suffered catastrophic head injuries and was ejected from his bike. He died at the scene. The police report lists 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as the primary contributing factor, highlighting the truck driver's failure to obey signals. The victim's helmet use is noted in the report, but only after the driver's error is cited. No evidence suggests any action by the cyclist contributed to the crash. The deadly impact underscores the danger posed when large vehicles ignore basic traffic controls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The report states the impact was to the center front end of the moped, causing fatal head injuries to the driver, who died at the scene. The police explicitly list 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor in the crash. The narrative underscores that the victim’s skull took the brunt of the blow. No other vehicles or persons are reported involved. The report does not specify the use of any safety equipment by the victim, nor does it list any victim behavior as a contributing factor.

Nick Stabile, co-founder of the Park Row Alliance, said, 'Our residents have difficulty with something as simple as walking down the street and riding their bikes – and it's especially difficult for those in wheelchairs and with strollers.' Lucy West, a local resident, added, 'Park Row is not a parking lot, it's a street.' The city has not announced a plan for the corridor.

The SUV's point of impact was the center front end, and the vehicle was described as 'going straight ahead.' The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified' for both the driver and the pedestrian. The narrative notes the victim 'died there, alone, under the empty sky.' No specific driver errors are cited in the report, but the fatal outcome underscores the lethal risk vulnerable road users face on wide, fast-moving corridors like Canal Street.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

They want daylight at every intersection. They cite dead children and blind corners. City drags its feet. DOT promises 1,000 fixes a year. Boards say that’s not enough. Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On March 6, 2024, ten New York City community boards endorsed a citywide ban on parking at intersections—a practice called daylighting. The boards urge the city to stop exempting itself from state law requiring no parking within 20 feet of crosswalks. The resolution follows fatal crashes involving children at poorly visible corners. The matter summary reads: 'Ten community boards representing nearly 1.5 million New Yorkers have voted to endorse a ban on parking at intersections (daylighting) to improve street safety.' Ken Coughlin of Community Board 7 said, 'You’re losing parking [that causes] serious injury and death—that’s pretty indefensible.' Carl Mahaney of StreetopiaUWS added, 'Improving the crosswalk experience really resonates with New Yorkers.' Despite support from Brooklyn and other borough officials, DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez hesitates, citing cost and limited data. DOT pledges to daylight 1,000 intersections yearly, but no full safety analysis exists. Boards and advocates say the city’s pace leaves vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The toll goes beyond crashes—air and noise pollution, violence, and social injustice hit hardest. Marginalized groups suffer most. The call is clear: shift to walking, cycling, and transit.</p><p class=mb3>On March 5, 2024, a major advocacy report was released, examining the global harms of car dependency. The literature review, conducted by UK and Germany-based researchers, surveyed nearly 500 studies on 'automobility.' The report states: 'Car domination is directly responsible for at least one in every 34 deaths around the world.' The harms extend to air and noise pollution, lead exposure, violence, and social injustice, with marginalized communities bearing the brunt. Patrick Miner, a study author, argues, 'If automobility has contributed, you know, X billion dollars of economic growth ... how do we compare that to killing 60 to 80 million people?' The report calls for policies that reduce car harm and prioritize human-centered transportation—walking, cycling, and public transit. No council bill number or committee applies; this is a research release, not legislation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
