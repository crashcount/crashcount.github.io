A black SUV hit him. He died on the street. The driver stayed. Police said, &ldquo;They were walking, he was crossing the street with his sister&rdquo; (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>police said</a>). No arrest. The street is still open. The danger is still there.</p><p>The day before, in the Bronx, a man ran a red light. His car jumped the curb and crushed three people on the sidewalk. One is still fighting for life. The driver ran but police caught him. He faces charges for assault, fleeing, and driving without a license (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/driver-flees-bronx-car-stop-crash/>faces charges</a>).</p><p><strong>In the last 12 months, 244 people have died on New York City streets. 713 were seriously hurt.</strong> Thirteen of the dead were children. The city logs over 81,000 crashes a year. Each number is a name, a family, a future gone.</p><h3 id=the-policy-that-wasnt>The Policy That Wasn&rsquo;t</h3><p>Leaders talk. Streets stay the same. The mayor ripped out a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue after crashes involving children. He said he was listening to the community. Cyclists said, &ldquo;I don’t think he cares if we die&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/cyclists-fuming-over-mayor-adamss-removal-of-bedford-avenue-protected-bike-lane>Cyclists said</a>). The city put back paint. Paint does not stop cars.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Department of Transportation built a new protected bike lane in Queens. A commuter said, &ldquo;The old street was very dangerous&mldr; the new path is definitely safer because he&rsquo;s no longer competing with trucks and cars for road space&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/27/eyes-on-the-street-new-bike-lane-puts-the-bliss-in-blissville>A commuter said</a>). But these changes come slow. Too slow for the dead.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-that-dont-lie>The Numbers That Don&rsquo;t Lie</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks killed 299 people.</strong> Motorcycles and mopeds killed 21. Bikes killed 11. The city counts 182,570 injuries since 2022. The bodies pile up. The city debates.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call your council member. Call the mayor.

The measure, debated since the 1970s and authorized in the 2019 state budget, now faces legal challenges that could delay its planned mid-June launch. The board's action, described as 'a monumental shift that will be felt by millions of New Yorkers,' aims to reduce traffic and raise $15 billion for the MTA's capital plan. Board members like Midori Valdivia and David Jones voiced strong support, emphasizing the benefit to working New Yorkers who rely on public transit. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber defended the plan's environmental review. The vote marks a turning point in the city's effort to prioritize transit and safety for those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Scholar Nicole Gelinas analyzed over 200 fatal crashes from 2022 and found that 47 deaths could have been prevented if the city had removed vehicles with five or more red-light or speed camera tickets in a year. Gelinas urges the city and state to escalate fines after two violations, revoke registrations for repeat offenders, and revive the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program. She states, "Heightened enforcement or non-carceral punishment against those drivers should not be controversial... [It] would make New York City’s roads substantially safer without harming the average driver."

No city plan released.</p><p class=mb3>On March 12, 2024, residents and advocates sounded the alarm as NYPD vehicles filled the protected bike lane on Park Row, Manhattan. The event, reported by Streetsblog NYC, followed the removal of metal barricades that had long restricted access. Instead of relief, the community found dozens of police cars and unmarked vehicles parked in the bike lane and on sidewalks. Nick Stabile, co-founder of the Park Row Alliance, said, 'Our residents have difficulty with something as simple as walking down the street and riding their bikes – and it's especially difficult for those in wheelchairs and with strollers.' Lucy West, a local resident, added, 'Park Row is not a parking lot, it's a street.' The city has not announced a plan for the corridor. Local elected officials have called for public input before any changes. Vulnerable road users remain at risk as police continue to block critical space.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
