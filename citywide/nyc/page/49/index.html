The driver’s leg shattered. No airbags. No mercy. Rush hour traffic swallowed the screams and the long wait for help began.</p><p class=mb3>A Hyundai sedan collided with a TAIZH vehicle at Lexington Avenue near East 86th Street, according to the police report. The crash occurred during rush hour, with both vehicles traveling south. The report states the Hyundai driver struck the turning TAIZH, resulting in the Hyundai driver suffering severe crush injuries to his knee and lower leg. According to the police report, the primary contributing factors were 'Following Too Closely' and 'Passing Too Closely.' The narrative describes the impact as 'steel on bone,' with the driver remaining conscious as he waited for aid. The report does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor. No vehicle damage was recorded, but the human toll was immediate and severe. The crash underscores the danger when drivers follow or pass too closely, especially amid heavy traffic and complex maneuvers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
