The NYPD reported both were heading eastbound when the collision occurred. No tickets were issued to the driver. Parkside Avenue, recently outfitted with a protected bike lane, is not a designated truck route, but large trucks often use it. Liz Denys, campaign lead for Flatbush Streets for People, said, "Massive tractor trailers simply do not fit on streets in Flatbush. They regularly endanger people walking and biking." Advocates demand stronger measures to keep trucks off local streets and call for a comprehensive network of protected bike lanes.
