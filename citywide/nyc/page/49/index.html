No justice.</p><p class=mb3>On September 18, 2022, a 9-year-old child was killed by a driver turning into a driveway on E. 12th Street near Sheepshead Bay Road. The incident, reported by Streetsblog NYC, highlights the deadly risk to children on city sidewalks. Police did not charge the 35-year-old driver. The crash occurred during the afternoon, a period when, according to city data, streets near schools see 32 percent more crashes per mile. The article states: 'the rate of people injured by drivers on school days was 43 percent higher outside school buildings where a majority of students were brown or Black.' These disparities have persisted for years. The council has not acted to address these systemic dangers. Vulnerable children pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
