His son stands over him, waiting for his eyes to open. They never do. Just days ago, Pasqual Tziquin was killed crossing New Utrecht Avenue in Brooklyn. The driver did not stop. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t stop. He just kept going,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/06/hit-and-run-driver-kills-brooklyn-restaurant-worker-in-front-of-son/>said Henry Tziquin</a>. Eight days later, Pasqual was dead. His family waits for justice.</p><p>Across the city, the violence does not let up. On the Belt Parkway, a BMW vaulted the median and slammed into oncoming cars. Six people were hurt, two left fighting for their lives. Police said, &ldquo;speed may have been an issue&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/05/us-news/six-hurt-when-car-barrels-into-oncoming-nyc-traffic/>in the crash</a>. In Crown Heights, an eight-year-old boy was struck and killed by an SUV. The street is a main road, built for speed. The boy is gone.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-behind-the-blood>The Numbers Behind the Blood</h3><p>In the last twelve months, 236 people have died on New York City streets. Another 704 suffered serious injuries. Children, elders, cyclists, pedestrians—no one is spared. SUVs and cars do the most harm: SUVs and cars killed 300 people, seriously injured 509, and hurt over 26,000 more in the last three years. Trucks and buses killed 93. Motorcycles and mopeds killed 10. Bikes killed 11. The numbers do not lie. The bodies pile up.</p><h3 id=leaders-actbut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Act—But Not Fast Enough</h3><p>Some leaders move. The city has started to lower speed limits, install more speed cameras, and build protected bike lanes. But too often, safety is ripped out as fast as it is built. When the city tried to remove the Bedford Avenue bike lane, the Department of Transportation warned: &ldquo;Removing the protected bike lane won&rsquo;t remove cyclists—it will only make the street less safe&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/dot-testimony-removing-bedford-ave-bike-lane-will-reduce-safety>testified DOT</a>.</p><p>Others push policies that punish the vulnerable. A 15 mph e-bike speed cap is on the table. Michael Replogle, former DOT official, calls it &ldquo;an ill-considered idea to improve safety which will be counterproductive&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/03/ex-dot-official-warns-nycs-counterproductive-e-bike-speed-limit-will-curb-biking-safety>said Replogle</a>. The city debates, the streets bleed.</p><h3 id=act-nowor-count-the-dead>Act Now—Or Count the Dead</h3><p>Every day of delay is another day of loss. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Tell them to protect bike lanes, not rip them out. Tell them to stop blaming the people on foot and on bikes. The bodies in the street are not statistics. They are your neighbors. They are your children.

The Parks Department plans a dangerous detour on Broadway. Advocates say the city ignores cyclist safety. Crash data shows the detour route is unsafe. City Hall faces pressure to act.</p><p class=mb3>On June 10, 2022, former traffic commissioner Sam Schwartz called for a temporary bike lane on the northbound Henry Hudson Parkway during a planned closure of the Hudson River Greenway. The Parks Department's detour sends cyclists onto Broadway, a route Schwartz and advocates call 'dangerous and congested.' Schwartz said, 'Taking a northbound lane and having a temporary bike path...is far superior and much safer than sending bike riders through the street system of upper Manhattan.' Community Board 12 previously requested a study for this solution, but the city did not act. Crash data shows 255 crashes, 20 cyclist injuries, and 18 pedestrian injuries on the detour route in two years. Critics, including residents and transit advocates, accuse the Parks Department of neglecting cyclists and demand City Hall treat the greenway as essential transportation. The Parks Department defends its plan, saying it worked with DOT to find the best route.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The driver received only traffic tickets for failure to yield and obey a traffic control device. The matter highlights the absence of protected bike lanes and traffic calming on this block, as Community Board 10 previously rejected safety redesigns. The Department of Transportation’s improvements end one block away. Since 2018, this block has seen 155 crashes, injuring nine cyclists, one pedestrian, and 46 motorists. The NYPD’s enforcement is lax, and illegal parking by officers is common. Advocates have long called for modern safety measures, but local opposition and city inaction leave vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The closure, announced in the opinion piece 'City Must Protect Bikers, Walkers During Hudson Greenway Closure,' leaves pedestrians and cyclists in Washington Heights, Inwood, and the Northwest Bronx without a safe north-south route. The city’s detour—via Dyckman Street, Broadway, and West 181st Street—forces vulnerable road users onto dangerous, truck-heavy roads. The author, echoing community demands, calls for immediate safety measures like physical barriers and criticizes the Parks Department for closing vital bike corridors without proper oversight. Previous requests for a protected bike lane on the Henry Hudson Parkway and federal funding for greenway improvements were ignored.

The bills aim to revoke about 60,000 city-issued parking placards and allow civilians to report illegal parking. The legislation, not yet passed or assigned to a committee, is described as a response to 'petty corruption' that endangers pedestrians, people with disabilities, and cyclists. Restler said, 'It is petty corruption and it makes our streets unsafe for a parent walking with a stroller, for a person with a wheelchair, for a cyclist.' The first bill would sharply restrict city agencies from issuing parking permits for private cars, with narrow exemptions. The second would empower civilians to report cars blocking bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or hydrants, creating a $175 fine and a reward for reporters. Restler’s district, including Downtown Brooklyn, suffers from rampant placard abuse. The bills seek to reclaim street space and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill would revoke all placards for personal vehicles without government plates, except for those granted by collective bargaining or disability. Restler’s proposal, echoing a prior bill from Stephen Levin, would also empower citizens to report placard abuse to the Department of Transportation, triggering civil penalties. The matter summary reads: 'Placard abuse forces neighbors using wheelchairs to navigate unsafe sidewalks, cyclists to go up against oncoming traffic, and parents to push strollers into the street.' Restler, representing Downtown Brooklyn, Williamsburg, and Greenpoint, has refused a placard himself.
