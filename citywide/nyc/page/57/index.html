Neither does the violence on its streets. In the last twelve months, <strong>246 people died</strong> in crashes. <strong>715 were left with serious injuries</strong>. The numbers are cold. The pain is not. A cyclist is struck in Queens. A teenager dies on a Brooklyn street. A pedestrian is killed crossing Harlem River Drive. The city moves on.

Twenty-four people over 75 did not make it home. The city’s most vulnerable—walkers, riders, children—are left to fend for themselves. Cars and trucks do the most harm. In three years, they killed <strong>299 people</strong> and left thousands more injured. Motorcycles and mopeds killed 10. Bikes killed 11. The street is a gauntlet. The odds are not in your favor.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-doand-dont>What Leaders Do—And Don’t</h2><p>The city talks of Vision Zero.

The DOT promises new barriers, new designs, new hope. But the work is slow. Protected bike lanes are ripped out in Williamsburg. Cyclists are left with nothing but fear. “I don’t think he cares if we die,” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/cyclists-fuming-over-mayor-adamss-removal-of-bedford-avenue-protected-bike-lane>said Jeanette Samyn</a>.</p><p>Some leaders push for change.

The agency will swap out heavy Jersey barriers for curb-height blocks, wave delineators, and armadillo-shaped bumps. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'The Better Barriers pilot is an example of the innovative ways we are addressing traffic safety and improving our cycling network.' The pilot launches on Union Square East, with plans to expand. Mayor Adams and Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi both praised the creative push for safer streets. Advocacy groups like StreetsPAC and Open Plans welcomed the move but raised doubts about durability and the risk of partial barriers failing to keep lanes clear. Bike New York warned, 'simply putting barriers or partial barriers along the edges of the lanes isn’t sufficient to keep them clear.' The city promises faster, more cost-effective protection, but the fight for real safety continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Parks Department's detour sends cyclists onto Broadway, a route Schwartz and advocates call 'dangerous and congested.' Schwartz said, 'Taking a northbound lane and having a temporary bike path...is far superior and much safer than sending bike riders through the street system of upper Manhattan.' Community Board 12 previously requested a study for this solution, but the city did not act. Crash data shows 255 crashes, 20 cyclist injuries, and 18 pedestrian injuries on the detour route in two years. Critics, including residents and transit advocates, accuse the Parks Department of neglecting cyclists and demand City Hall treat the greenway as essential transportation. The Parks Department defends its plan, saying it worked with DOT to find the best route.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The driver received only traffic tickets for failure to yield and obey a traffic control device. The matter highlights the absence of protected bike lanes and traffic calming on this block, as Community Board 10 previously rejected safety redesigns. The Department of Transportation’s improvements end one block away. Since 2018, this block has seen 155 crashes, injuring nine cyclists, one pedestrian, and 46 motorists. The NYPD’s enforcement is lax, and illegal parking by officers is common. Advocates have long called for modern safety measures, but local opposition and city inaction leave vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Seven Council members voted against the resolution. Transportation Alternatives responded, stating, 'This crash could have been prevented by discouraging SUV and light-truck ownership,' highlighting the lethal risk these vehicles pose to pedestrians.

The article identifies four main culprits: lack of sidewalks, dangerous arterials, structural racism, and the rise of large vehicles like SUVs and pickups. Pam Shadel Fischer of the Governors Highway Safety Association calls the toll 'shocking' and urges immediate sidewalk inventories and community reporting. The piece stresses that over two-thirds of deaths happened where walkers had no protection. Communities of color bear the brunt. Experts call for sidewalk upgrades, road redesign, vehicle regulation, and better data. The message is blunt: systemic failures kill.
