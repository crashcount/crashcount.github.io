SUVs and pickups kill more when they strike. The government drags its feet. Advocates demand change. Secretary Buttigieg opens the door. The call is clear: Make cars safer for people outside them.</p><p class=mb3>This opinion piece, published June 2, 2022, urges federal action to protect pedestrians from dangerous vehicles. The article highlights Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg’s move to seek public input on the New Car Assessment Program (NCAP), which rates new cars for safety. The matter title calls for the government to 'require safer vehicles by updating Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards.' Mike McGinn, executive director of America Walks, leads the advocacy. The piece slams current safety ratings as 'almost worthless' and points to the deadly impact of larger vehicles. It notes that SUVs and pickups are two to three times more likely to kill pedestrians than passenger cars. Advocates urge NHTSA to act now, demanding that vehicle design finally center the safety of those outside the car.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Over 42,000 lives lost. Pedestrians and cyclists hit hardest. Urban streets grew deadlier. Officials blame reckless driving and roads built for speed. Advocates demand safer design. The toll keeps rising. No one is safe.</p><p class=mb3>On May 17, 2022, federal officials released a report showing a double-digit percentage increase in U.S. road fatalities for 2021, the highest since 2005. The summary states, '42,915 people dying in motor vehicle crashes—the most since 2005.' Deaths rose on all road types, especially in cities, with pedestrians and cyclists suffering the most. U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg responded, 'Zero is the only acceptable number of deaths and serious injuries on our roadways.' Advocates like Beth Osborne and Corinne Kisner called out dangerous road designs and large vehicles as key threats. The Biden Administration and U.S. DOT pledged a 'Safe System' and Vision Zero approach, promising infrastructure fixes and safety grants. The National Association of City Transportation Officials stressed the power of small, targeted interventions—sidewalks, curb extensions, raised crosswalks. The report makes clear: the system, not just drivers, is killing people.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
