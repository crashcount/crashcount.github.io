The project, presented to Community Board 2's Transportation Committee, targets a 'dangerous, narrow stretch of roadway' connecting the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges. DOT will convert Ashland Place to a one-way street northbound, install concrete barriers, and add pedestrian refuge islands. The matter summary states, 'The city will install a two-way protected bike lane along Ashland Place and Navy Street, a dangerous, narrow stretch of roadway.' Community Board 2 members and advocates like Jon Orcutt supported the plan, with only one complaint: it should have come sooner. Jeanette Brown, a local resident, called for more sidewalk space for pedestrians. Since 2018, 297 crashes have caused 111 injuries, including 22 cyclists and 28 pedestrians. The redesign aims to cut these numbers by separating people from traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Seventy percent of pedestrians killed in Portland last year lacked permanent housing. The report states: 'The presence of unhoused people does not make our streets unsafe. Rather, poor roadway design, ongoing neglect and deferred maintenance, recklessness in the form of speeding, operating a vehicle while impaired by drugs or alcohol, and other dangerous driving behavior are all well-documented reasons why there is this alarming uptick in deaths.' No council member is named; the report draws on research and advocates’ voices. The analysis condemns sweeps and bans on campsites, arguing these policies force people into more dangerous corridors and away from services. The study calls for ending sweeps, providing housing, redesigning streets, lowering speed limits, improving lighting, and closing high-crash roads to cars.

The pilot launches on Union Square East, with plans to expand. Mayor Adams and Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi both praised the creative push for safer streets. Advocacy groups like StreetsPAC and Open Plans welcomed the move but raised doubts about durability and the risk of partial barriers failing to keep lanes clear. Bike New York warned, 'simply putting barriers or partial barriers along the edges of the lanes isn’t sufficient to keep them clear.' The city promises faster, more cost-effective protection, but the fight for real safety continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Parks Department plans a dangerous detour on Broadway. Advocates say the city ignores cyclist safety. Crash data shows the detour route is unsafe. City Hall faces pressure to act.</p><p class=mb3>On June 10, 2022, former traffic commissioner Sam Schwartz called for a temporary bike lane on the northbound Henry Hudson Parkway during a planned closure of the Hudson River Greenway. The Parks Department's detour sends cyclists onto Broadway, a route Schwartz and advocates call 'dangerous and congested.' Schwartz said, 'Taking a northbound lane and having a temporary bike path...is far superior and much safer than sending bike riders through the street system of upper Manhattan.' Community Board 12 previously requested a study for this solution, but the city did not act. Crash data shows 255 crashes, 20 cyclist injuries, and 18 pedestrian injuries on the detour route in two years. Critics, including residents and transit advocates, accuse the Parks Department of neglecting cyclists and demand City Hall treat the greenway as essential transportation. The Parks Department defends its plan, saying it worked with DOT to find the best route.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The driver received only traffic tickets for failure to yield and obey a traffic control device. The matter highlights the absence of protected bike lanes and traffic calming on this block, as Community Board 10 previously rejected safety redesigns. The Department of Transportation’s improvements end one block away. Since 2018, this block has seen 155 crashes, injuring nine cyclists, one pedestrian, and 46 motorists. The NYPD’s enforcement is lax, and illegal parking by officers is common. Advocates have long called for modern safety measures, but local opposition and city inaction leave vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city’s detour—via Dyckman Street, Broadway, and West 181st Street—forces vulnerable road users onto dangerous, truck-heavy roads. The author, echoing community demands, calls for immediate safety measures like physical barriers and criticizes the Parks Department for closing vital bike corridors without proper oversight.
