According to the police report, 'A 16-year-old boy, unbelted and speeding, struck another SUV head-on. His body flew from the wreck. His head hit hard. The car crumpled. He died there, in the dark, alone.' The contributing factor listed is 'Unsafe Speed.' The teen driver was ejected and killed. Four other young passengers, ages 15 to 19, suffered injuries to the neck, chest, and arms. Two adult drivers were also involved, one sustaining an arm injury. The police report notes that some injured teens were not using safety equipment, but this is mentioned only after the primary cause: unsafe speed.

The fix: redesign, not displacement.</p><p class=mb3>This policy analysis, released June 13, 2022, by Portland State University, exposes the deadly toll of car crashes on unhoused pedestrians. Seventy percent of pedestrians killed in Portland last year lacked permanent housing. The report states: 'The presence of unhoused people does not make our streets unsafe. Rather, poor roadway design, ongoing neglect and deferred maintenance, recklessness in the form of speeding, operating a vehicle while impaired by drugs or alcohol, and other dangerous driving behavior are all well-documented reasons why there is this alarming uptick in deaths.' No council member is named; the report draws on research and advocates’ voices. The analysis condemns sweeps and bans on campsites, arguing these policies force people into more dangerous corridors and away from services. The study calls for ending sweeps, providing housing, redesigning streets, lowering speed limits, improving lighting, and closing high-crash roads to cars. The message: systemic change, not scapegoating, will save lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The agency will swap out heavy Jersey barriers for curb-height blocks, wave delineators, and armadillo-shaped bumps. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'The Better Barriers pilot is an example of the innovative ways we are addressing traffic safety and improving our cycling network.' The pilot launches on Union Square East, with plans to expand. Mayor Adams and Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi both praised the creative push for safer streets.

The Parks Department's detour sends cyclists onto Broadway, a route Schwartz and advocates call 'dangerous and congested.' Schwartz said, 'Taking a northbound lane and having a temporary bike path...is far superior and much safer than sending bike riders through the street system of upper Manhattan.' Community Board 12 previously requested a study for this solution, but the city did not act. Crash data shows 255 crashes, 20 cyclist injuries, and 18 pedestrian injuries on the detour route in two years. Critics, including residents and transit advocates, accuse the Parks Department of neglecting cyclists and demand City Hall treat the greenway as essential transportation.
