The driver received only traffic tickets for failure to yield and obey a traffic control device. The matter highlights the absence of protected bike lanes and traffic calming on this block, as Community Board 10 previously rejected safety redesigns. The Department of Transportation’s improvements end one block away. Since 2018, this block has seen 155 crashes, injuring nine cyclists, one pedestrian, and 46 motorists. The NYPD’s enforcement is lax, and illegal parking by officers is common. Advocates have long called for modern safety measures, but local opposition and city inaction leave vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The closure, announced in the opinion piece 'City Must Protect Bikers, Walkers During Hudson Greenway Closure,' leaves pedestrians and cyclists in Washington Heights, Inwood, and the Northwest Bronx without a safe north-south route. The city’s detour—via Dyckman Street, Broadway, and West 181st Street—forces vulnerable road users onto dangerous, truck-heavy roads. The author, echoing community demands, calls for immediate safety measures like physical barriers and criticizes the Parks Department for closing vital bike corridors without proper oversight. Previous requests for a protected bike lane on the Henry Hudson Parkway and federal funding for greenway improvements were ignored.

The driver, a 40-year-old woman, was also listed as injured. The police report cites 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as the contributing factor.

The matter, described as a call to 'keep speed cameras on 24 hours a day, seven days a week,' came as a Jeep driver killed a 1-year-old girl in a crosswalk. Seven Council members voted against the resolution. Transportation Alternatives responded, stating, 'This crash could have been prevented by discouraging SUV and light-truck ownership,' highlighting the lethal risk these vehicles pose to pedestrians. The group called for weight-based vehicle taxes, citing the higher fatality rates and environmental harm from heavier cars. Council and advocates pressed for urgent reforms to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Change is overdue.</p><p class=mb3>This Streetsblog NYC policy analysis, published May 26, 2022, highlights a deadly surge: 'Pedestrian death rates in the U.S. reached a 40-year high in 2021, with 7,485 pedestrians killed.' The article identifies four main culprits: lack of sidewalks, dangerous arterials, structural racism, and the rise of large vehicles like SUVs and pickups. Pam Shadel Fischer of the Governors Highway Safety Association calls the toll 'shocking' and urges immediate sidewalk inventories and community reporting. The piece stresses that over two-thirds of deaths happened where walkers had no protection. Communities of color bear the brunt. Experts call for sidewalk upgrades, road redesign, vehicle regulation, and better data. The message is blunt: systemic failures kill. The time for action is now.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The 63-year-old box truck driver died, his body crushed by the force of the collision. According to the police report, 'A box truck plowed into a stopped tractor-trailer. The 63-year-old driver died behind the wheel, crushed by steel and speed.' The report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor. The tractor-trailer was stopped in traffic when the box truck, traveling straight, hit its rear. No other injuries were reported. The data shows distraction at the wheel led to the fatal impact. The driver wore a lap belt and harness, but distraction was the key factor.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Kids remain at risk.</p><p class=mb3>This report, published May 24, 2022, exposes the city’s failure to protect children near schools. The investigation finds, “streets near schools are uniquely dangerous, with rates of crashes and injuries that exceed city averages, particularly near schools where most students are poor or children of color.” No council bill is cited, but the critique targets the Department of Transportation and NYPD for inadequate redesigns and chronic understaffing of crossing guards. Community leaders like Wilfredo Florentino call the situation “absolutely unacceptable.” Charles T. Brown demands more investment in Black, brown, and low-income communities. The article documents that city interventions—speed cameras, crossing guards, minor redesigns—fall short. The safety impact is clear: children, especially in marginalized neighborhoods, face daily danger from traffic. The city’s response is insufficient.
