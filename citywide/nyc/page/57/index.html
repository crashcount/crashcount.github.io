In the last twelve months, <strong>244 people have died</strong> on New York’s streets. <strong>707 were left with serious injuries</strong>. Children, elders, cyclists, pedestrians—none spared. Just last week, an <strong>8-year-old boy was killed by an SUV</strong> at an intersection in Crown Heights. There was no warning. There was no time. The street was busy, the car was big, and a child did not come home. Streetsblog NYC <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/01/tuesdays-headlines-another-child-sacrificed-to-the-suv-edition>called it</a> &ldquo;another child sacrificed to the SUV.&rdquo;</p><p>Six more people were struck in the Bronx when a Mustang jumped the curb and plowed into a sidewalk shed. Witnesses heard the screams. &ldquo;People were yelling, were in pain, so yelling, crying, it was very upsetting,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>said Vivian Cole</a>. The driver ran. The city moved on.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-that-dont-lie>The Numbers That Don’t Lie</h3><p>The violence is not random. <strong>SUVs and cars killed 300 pedestrians</strong> in the last three years. <strong>Trucks and buses killed 93</strong>. <strong>Motorcycles and mopeds killed 10</strong>. <strong>Bikes killed 11</strong>. The numbers are cold. The bodies are not. Every crash is a family broken, a street stained.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h3><p>City Hall claims progress. The first half of 2025 saw a <strong>32% drop in traffic deaths</strong>. DOT Commissioner Rodriguez said, &ldquo;Traffic deaths reached the lowest level in recorded history during the first six months of this year because of Vision Zero&rsquo;s focus on safer street designs, expanded public education, and targeted traffic enforcement,&rdquo; according to <a href=https://www.bkreader.com/policy-government/nyc-traffic-deaths-reach-record-low-10895611>BKReader</a>.</p><p>But the work is not done. Protected bike lanes are being ripped out. The city drags its feet on lowering speed limits. Policies that sound safe sometimes punish the wrong people. A new rule would cap e-bike speeds at 15 mph. Michael Replogle, a former DOT official, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/03/ex-dot-official-warns-nycs-counterproductive-e-bike-speed-limit-will-curb-biking-safety>called it</a> &ldquo;an ill-considered idea to improve safety which will be counterproductive.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>The city will not save itself.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Tell them to protect bike lanes, not remove them. Tell them to stop blaming the people in the crosswalk. Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</p><p><strong>Act now.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The incident reignited calls for pedestrian safety from business improvement districts (BIDs) and advocates. The matter, described as 'renewed calls from BIDs and safe-streets advocates for accelerated pedestrian improvements and full pedestrianization of Broadway,' highlights the slow progress of the city's 'Broadway Vision' project, which began in 2009 and has only fully pedestrianized six blocks. BID leaders James Mettham, Jennifer Falk, and Tom Harris voiced strong support for expanding pedestrian areas and protected bike lanes. Cory Epstein of Transportation Alternatives called pedestrianization a 'win-win.' Mayor Adams, however, showed reluctance, deferring decisions to the transportation commissioner. The Department of Transportation promised more information soon. Advocates and BIDs continue to push for a car-free Broadway, citing proven safety and business benefits.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary states, 'The city will install a two-way protected bike lane along Ashland Place and Navy Street, a dangerous, narrow stretch of roadway.' Community Board 2 members and advocates like Jon Orcutt supported the plan, with only one complaint: it should have come sooner. Jeanette Brown, a local resident, called for more sidewalk space for pedestrians. Since 2018, 297 crashes have caused 111 injuries, including 22 cyclists and 28 pedestrians.

Streets kill, not tents. Sweeps push people into danger. Advocates demand safer roads, lower speeds, better lighting, and housing. Systemic neglect, reckless driving, and bad design fuel the crisis. The fix: redesign, not displacement.</p><p class=mb3>This policy analysis, released June 13, 2022, by Portland State University, exposes the deadly toll of car crashes on unhoused pedestrians. Seventy percent of pedestrians killed in Portland last year lacked permanent housing. The report states: 'The presence of unhoused people does not make our streets unsafe. Rather, poor roadway design, ongoing neglect and deferred maintenance, recklessness in the form of speeding, operating a vehicle while impaired by drugs or alcohol, and other dangerous driving behavior are all well-documented reasons why there is this alarming uptick in deaths.' No council member is named; the report draws on research and advocates’ voices. The analysis condemns sweeps and bans on campsites, arguing these policies force people into more dangerous corridors and away from services. The study calls for ending sweeps, providing housing, redesigning streets, lowering speed limits, improving lighting, and closing high-crash roads to cars. The message: systemic change, not scapegoating, will save lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists wait for real protection. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On June 10, 2022, the New York City Department of Transportation announced a new pilot: the 'Better Barriers' initiative. The agency will swap out heavy Jersey barriers for curb-height blocks, wave delineators, and armadillo-shaped bumps. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'The Better Barriers pilot is an example of the innovative ways we are addressing traffic safety and improving our cycling network.' The pilot launches on Union Square East, with plans to expand. Mayor Adams and Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi both praised the creative push for safer streets. Advocacy groups like StreetsPAC and Open Plans welcomed the move but raised doubts about durability and the risk of partial barriers failing to keep lanes clear. Bike New York warned, 'simply putting barriers or partial barriers along the edges of the lanes isn’t sufficient to keep them clear.' The city promises faster, more cost-effective protection, but the fight for real safety continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Parks Department's detour sends cyclists onto Broadway, a route Schwartz and advocates call 'dangerous and congested.' Schwartz said, 'Taking a northbound lane and having a temporary bike path...is far superior and much safer than sending bike riders through the street system of upper Manhattan.' Community Board 12 previously requested a study for this solution, but the city did not act. Crash data shows 255 crashes, 20 cyclist injuries, and 18 pedestrian injuries on the detour route in two years. Critics, including residents and transit advocates, accuse the Parks Department of neglecting cyclists and demand City Hall treat the greenway as essential transportation. The Parks Department defends its plan, saying it worked with DOT to find the best route.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
