The city moves forward.</p><p class=mb3>On January 5, 2025, New York City implemented congestion pricing, charging drivers who enter Manhattan below 60th Street. The policy, debated for decades, now stands as law. The measure’s stated goal: 'reduce traffic, improve air quality, and generate revenue for the MTA’s capital plan.' Tolls vary by vehicle and time. Low-income and disabled residents get discounts or exemptions. The plan expects to cut vehicle miles in the central business district by 6.4% and vehicles by 13.4%. Critics, including hospital executives and business owners, warn of negative impacts, but the city promises mitigation—like electric truck upgrades in the Bronx. The law faces ongoing legal and political challenges, but city leaders press on, calling congestion pricing necessary for New York’s future.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Twenty-six crashes in two years. Cyclist Amanda Servedio killed by a fleeing driver. Residents plead for change. NYPD shrugs. No answers. No reform. Streets stay deadly. Accountability missing.</p><p class=mb3>This report details a surge in crashes linked to NYPD high-speed pursuits in Queens’s 114th Precinct. In the last two years, there have been 26 chase-related crashes, compared to 11 in the previous nine years. The increase began after Mayor Adams promoted John Chell to Chief of Patrol and Jeffrey Maddrey to Chief of Department. The mayor claims chases are rare and reserved for violent crime, but the driver who killed cyclist Amanda Servedio was only a suspected burglar. Residents have packed community council meetings since February 2023, demanding an end to these pursuits. Kian Betancourt, a local, told officers, “We are asking you to protect us... and just nothing, I mean, like blank face, absolutely no response whatsoever.” Officers refuse to clarify or change their policy, despite repeated warnings from the community about deadly consequences. No council bill is cited; this is a record of community opposition and official inaction.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the man stepped into the street outside the crosswalk and was struck head-on by a southbound Buick sedan with Florida plates. The report states he died at the scene, his body broken as darkness fell. Police explicitly list 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor in the crash, placing responsibility on the driver’s failure to notice the pedestrian. The vehicle’s point of impact was the center front end, confirming a direct collision. The report notes the pedestrian was 'crossing, no signal, or crosswalk,' but only after citing driver inattention. No additional victim behaviors are listed as contributing factors. The fatal crash underscores the deadly consequences of driver distraction on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
