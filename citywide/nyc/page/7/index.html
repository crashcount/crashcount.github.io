The Department of Transportation warned this will make the roadway less safe. Streetsblog called it 'a crucial piece of the bike network.' Adams defended his decision, blaming press scrutiny. No council bill or committee action is tied to this event. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative change affecting pedestrian or cyclist safety, so no direct safety impact can be assessed.' Still, the loss of protection leaves vulnerable road users at greater risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The teen, unlicensed and speeding at over 100 mph in a 30-mph zone, lost control and struck a parked UPS truck. Prosecutors said he only had a learner's permit and had been previously ticketed for unlicensed driving. His parents, who gave him the BMW, were convicted of child endangerment. DA Melinda Katz called it 'a landmark case where both an unlicensed teenage driver and his parents were held responsible.' The case highlights failures in supervision and enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
