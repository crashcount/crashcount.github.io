Children, elders, cyclists, and workers are struck down in the crosswalk, on the sidewalk, waiting for the light. The city keeps moving. The blood dries. The next crash comes.</p><p>Just days ago, an eight-year-old boy was killed by an SUV in Crown Heights. The street was wide, the car was heavy, the child was small. The city called it another tragedy. Advocates called it what it is: a failure. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/01/tuesdays-headlines-another-child-sacrificed-to-the-suv-edition>Eastern Parkway acts as a major thoroughfare for drivers, and is the sixth most dangerous street in Brooklyn for pedestrians</a>, said one group, demanding more safety infrastructure to stop the killing.</p><h2 id=policy-progress-and-sabotage>Policy: Progress and Sabotage</h2><p><strong>Some leaders move.

Still, the city tries to erase protection for the most vulnerable. On Review Avenue, a new protected bike lane opened after years of struggle. Cyclists now have a sliver of safety. &ldquo;The old street was very dangerous,&rdquo; said a daily rider. The new path is <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/27/eyes-on-the-street-new-bike-lane-puts-the-bliss-in-blissville>definitely safer because he no longer fights trucks for space</a>.</p><p>But for every step forward, another is lost. The mayor removes bike lanes. The council debates. Children die. The city counts bodies.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> Since 2022, they have caused 301 deaths and over 26,000 injuries to pedestrians and cyclists. Trucks and buses killed 93. Motorcycles and mopeds killed 10. Bikes killed 11. The numbers are cold. The pain is not.</p><h2 id=what-now-demand-action>What Now: Demand Action</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every death is preventable. The city has the power to lower speed limits, build real protection, and stop repeat offenders. <strong>Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph limit. Demand protected lanes. Demand enforcement that targets the real danger—drivers, not cyclists or children.</strong></p><p>The city will not save you. Only your voice, raised with others, can force their hand.

Protected bike lane. Injuries fell. Pedestrians, cyclists, passengers safer. No deaths since redesign. Bike traffic soared. DOT says green wave slows cars, helps walkers, riders. Streets once deadly now less so. Numbers show lives saved.</p><p class=mb3>On February 19, 2025, the city Department of Transportation (DOT) released new safety data for Third Avenue in Manhattan. The protected bike lane and street redesign, finished in late 2023 from East 59th to East 96th streets, cut total injuries by 33 percent. Pedestrian injuries dropped 63 percent. Cyclist injuries fell 10 percent, even as bike traffic jumped 79 percent. No pedestrians or cyclists have died since the changes. DOT spokesman Vin Barone said, "DOT's redesign of Third Avenue has significantly reduced serious injuries—whether you're walking, biking, or in a car on the corridor." The DOT also highlighted its 'green wave' signal timing, set to 15 mph, which slows drivers and helps vulnerable users. Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives called Third Avenue "one of the best streets in all of New York City" and urged similar redesigns elsewhere. The city estimates protected bike lanes cut deaths and serious injuries by 18.1 percent for all, and 29.2 percent for pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The fight moves to court.</p><p class=mb3>On February 19, 2025, the Trump administration revoked federal approval for New York City’s congestion pricing plan. The move, announced by U.S. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy, argued the program’s main goal was revenue, not congestion relief. The MTA immediately filed a lawsuit, calling the action unlawful. The bill is not a council measure but a federal policy reversal, with local officials and advocates condemning the decision. State Senator Zellnor Myrie was mentioned among those opposing the move. The matter title reads: 'Trump Withdraws Federal Approval for Congestion Pricing, Blowing Hole in Transit Budget, as MTA Files Lawsuit.' The reversal threatens transit funding and leaves vulnerable road users exposed to ongoing traffic danger. No safety analyst assessment was provided, but the loss of congestion pricing means more cars, more risk, and less money for safer streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The car struck a guardrail, flipped, and caught fire. Both occupants were ejected. The article states, 'A female driver was killed and her passenger seriously injured after they were tossed from a Tesla that flipped and then burst into flames.' The driver died at the scene; the passenger was hospitalized in stable condition. Photos showed 'large pieces of the vehicle scattered across the road.' Police have not determined if speed was a factor and continue to investigate. The crash closed all northbound lanes for several miles as fire crews responded. The incident highlights the violent consequences of high-speed impacts and the dangers posed by vehicle ejection and fire.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states the pedestrian suffered fatal crush injuries and died at the scene. The driver did not remain, and the vehicle showed no visible damage. Police cite 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as contributing factors. The victim's behavior—'Crossing With Signal'—is noted in the report, but only after the documented driver errors.

The driver’s actions are listed as 'unspecified' in the contributing factors, but the narrative details the truck’s movement and its direct role in the fatal outcome. The report notes the woman was 'crossing against the light,' but this is mentioned after describing the truck’s maneuver and impact. The focus remains on the truck’s turn and the systemic danger posed by large vehicles at intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Sixteen children died on city streets last year. Half were walking or biking. Pedestrian deaths rose 21 percent. Most killed at unprotected crossings. Councilmember Paladino opposes proven safety measures. City leaders stall. Streets stay lethal.</p><p class=mb3>On January 28, 2025, Transportation Alternatives released its annual traffic fatality report. The report states: 'the number of children and teens killed in car crashes in NYC has reached record highs, with 16 kids killed last year.' This is the highest three-year total since Vision Zero began in 2014. Councilmember Vickie Paladino (District 19, Queens) is mentioned as a staunch opponent of Vision Zero, speed cameras, and bike lanes. The report criticizes elected leaders for inaction and calls for urgent safety measures, including speed governors for repeat offenders, universal daylighting, lower speed limits, more protected bike lanes, and stronger regulation of delivery apps. The Department of Transportation supports some measures but opposes universal daylighting. The report highlights that most pedestrians killed at intersections were at crossings without physical daylighting, and most cyclists killed were on streets without protected bike lanes. Vulnerable road users remain exposed as city leaders delay life-saving changes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
