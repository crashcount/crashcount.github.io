The article notes the string may have been from a 'fight kite,' with abrasive, glass-coated line. Noble said, "It just seems really horrifically, dangerously negligent to have this stuff out there in the world." The incident highlights a systemic hazard: unregulated objects on public infrastructure can maim without warning.
