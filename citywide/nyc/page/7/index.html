The report states he was unlicensed but wore a helmet. The motorcycle struck the taxi's right front quarter panel, causing the rider to be ejected and thrown onto the roadway. The motorcycle was demolished. The taxi, operated by a licensed driver, stopped after the collision. The police report lists 'Driver Inexperience' as a contributing factor. The rider died at the scene, suffering injuries to his entire body. The report does not cite any contributing victim behavior beyond helmet use.

The report states, 'A 2010 Honda slammed into a parked Jeep. The driver's head struck hard. Airbags burst. The man, 23, died alone in the dark. His seatbelt held. The ramp stayed still. No one else was there.' The sole occupant, a 23-year-old male driver, suffered fatal head injuries. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified.' The Jeep was unoccupied and stationary at the time of the collision. The report notes the driver was restrained and airbags deployed, but does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor. The crash left the ramp empty and silent, underscoring the lethal consequences when a moving vehicle collides with a stationary one.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Vulnerable road users wait for action.</p><p class=mb3>Intro 1138, now before the City Council, would make universal daylighting law in New York City. The bill, discussed in a January 2025 Streetsblog editorial, is designed to remove parking within 20 feet of every crosswalk. Its matter summary: 'Daylighting every intersection would make it easier to accomplish the Department of Transportation's policy goals.' Council members have not yet advanced the bill, while DOT Commissioner Rodriguez has publicly opposed it, claiming daylighting is 'not the right solution everywhere.' The editorial notes that universal daylighting would streamline DOT safety projects by eliminating the need for council notification each time curb space is repurposed, as required by Intro 103. Cities like Hoboken and San Francisco have seen sharp crash reductions after adopting daylighting. Federal Highway Administration data shows up to a 30 percent drop in intersection crashes. The evidence is clear: daylighting protects pedestrians and cyclists. DOT’s refusal leaves vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Granite blocks, bike racks, and barriers will guard corners. Most pedestrian deaths happen at intersections. The city has ignored its own parking ban. Activists demand real change. The fight continues.</p><p class=mb3>On January 17, 2025, Mayor Eric Adams proposed a budget boost to $3.85 million per year for 'hardened daylighting' at intersections. The plan, detailed by City Hall's Office of Management and Budget, aims to install granite blocks, bike racks, and other barriers at hundreds of corners. Adams said, 'We are ... keeping New Yorkers safe on our streets ... by improving road safety at hundreds of targeted traffic intersections.' State law bans parking within 20 feet of intersections, but New York City exempts itself, fueling deadly crashes—55 percent of pedestrian deaths and 79 percent of injuries happen at intersections. Council members and grassroots activists are pushing to end the city's carveout and require the Department of Transportation to add barriers to 1,000 intersections a year. Jackson Chabot of Open Plans said, 'Hardening is what makes daylighting actually work, so the budget item is really crucial to expanding it across the city.' The push follows the 2023 death of 7-year-old Dolma Naadhun at a poorly designed corner. The fight for safer streets is far from over.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move follows deadly crashes, including the killing of cyclist Amanda Servedio. Clear rules now limit pursuits to violent felonies, aiming to cut needless danger on city streets.</p><p class=mb3>On January 15, 2025, NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch announced a sweeping policy reform restricting police vehicle pursuits. The new rules, set to enter the NYPD patrol guide on February 1, 2025, allow chases only for serious violent crimes. Tisch stated, 'The NYPD’s enforcement efforts must never put the public or the police at undue risk, and pursuits for violations and low-level crimes can be both potentially dangerous and unnecessary.' The policy comes after a spike in chases—up 1,413 percent since 2022—and several fatal crashes, including the death of cyclist Amanda Servedio. Tisch’s directive, supported by Chief of Department John Chell, gives officers clear, unambiguous parameters and shields them from discipline for terminating unsafe pursuits. The department will review chases monthly to ensure compliance. The reform aims to end reckless chases for minor offenses, reducing harm to pedestrians, cyclists, and bystanders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
