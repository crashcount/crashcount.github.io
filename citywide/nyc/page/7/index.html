His Mercedes hit a school bus. His passenger died. He ran from the wreck in a taxi. Police found him later. The victim’s family mourns. The street remains unchanged.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News reported on March 2, 2025, that Tyree Epps, 32, drove a Mercedes-Benz without a license, ran a stop sign on Van Sinderen Ave, and crashed into a school bus. The article states, “After the crash, Epps hopped in a taxi and took off, leaving his 26-year-old passenger, Imani Vance, in the front seat suffering severe head trauma.” Epps faces charges of manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, leaving the scene, and unlicensed driving. The bus driver survived. The crash exposes ongoing risks from unlicensed, reckless drivers and the persistent danger at city intersections. The victim’s family is left to grieve and organize a funeral, while the intersection remains a site of loss.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, 'a dump truck turned left. Its right bumper struck a baby boy crossing with the signal. He died there, crushed beneath steel and weight.' The report states the point of impact was the right front bumper of the truck. The child, a pedestrian, suffered fatal crush injuries to his entire body. The police narrative explicitly notes the victim was 'crossing with the signal.' The driver’s actions—executing a left turn in a large vehicle—placed the most vulnerable road user in mortal danger. The report lists 'Unspecified' as the contributing factor for both the driver and the victim, but the sequence of events centers the dump truck’s left turn and the resulting impact.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The article quotes DA Melinda Katz: "An FDNY firefighter who was off duty is accused of driving under the influence, running a steady red light and slamming into a 23-year-old motorist, killing him, as he drove more than three times the posted speed limit." Pena's blood alcohol content was .156 percent, and he allegedly had drugs in his system. The BMW was sent flying into a parked car, its roof torn off. Pena faces manslaughter and related charges.

Prosecutors said Pena was drunk, high on cocaine and marijuana, and driving 83 mph in a 25 mph zone when he ran a red light and struck Diaz’s BMW. Surveillance footage showed the Mercedes 'barreled through an East Elmhurst intersection' at 4:15 a.m. Diaz, headed to work at LaGuardia, died at the scene. Pena refused a breath test; a blood draw later confirmed drug use. He was charged with vehicular manslaughter, DWI, and refusal to submit to testing, but posted $50,000 bail. The article highlights family grief and outrage at bail laws, quoting Diaz’s brother: 'Pena will walk the streets for a $50,000 bail...
