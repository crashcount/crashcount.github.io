The city’s streets are a slow-moving disaster. Every week brings new names. A 21-year-old woman, Madison Ruiz, killed as her boyfriend spun donuts in a Brooklyn parking lot. Her nephews, ages 12 and 17, left bleeding by the curb. Days later, the tire marks still scarred the pavement. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating. It&rsquo;s affecting everyone in our family, especially (Ruiz&rsquo;s) mom. Maddy was her only daughter.&rdquo;</a></p><p>A teenage e-scooter rider, Nacere Ellis, died on Staten Island after colliding with a Hyundai. Head trauma. No charges.

The numbers are cold. The bodies are not. The city’s most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, children—pay the price.</p><h2 id=leaders-movebut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Move—But Not Fast Enough</h2><p>City Hall claims progress. Speed cameras renewed. New 20 mph zones near schools. But the citywide speed limit remains 25 mph. The law lets leaders drop it to 20 mph now. They have not. Each day of delay risks another life. The city touts record bike lanes and intersection daylighting. But the crackdowns fall hardest on cyclists and e-bike delivery workers, not the drivers who do the most harm. Community boards <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/cart-before-horse-upper-west-siders-demand-nypd-halt-bike-crackdown>call it out</a>: &ldquo;It sends the wrong message about the actual danger on our streets.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph citywide limit. Demand real action against repeat speeders. Join the fight. Every day you wait, another family waits for a call that will break them.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
