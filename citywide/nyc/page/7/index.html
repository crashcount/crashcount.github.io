He survived. Many do not. In the last twelve months, 258 people died on New York City streets. 732 suffered serious injuries. The dead include children, elders, and everyone in between. The city counts the bodies. The city moves on.</p><p>A 95-year-old woman, Mayya Gil, was killed crossing Cropsey Avenue. She survived the Nazis and Chernobyl. She did not survive a Brooklyn van. The driver was charged with failure to yield and failure to exercise due care. &ldquo;Police have arrested a man they say struck and killed a beloved 95-year-old Brooklyn woman with a cargo van as she crossed the street near her home,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/brooklyn-man-arrested-in-fatal-crash-with-pedestrian-95-who-survived-nazis-chernobyl>reported Gothamist</a>.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h3><p>Over 51,000 people were injured in the last year.

Cars and SUVs are the main killers—311 deaths in the last three years. Trucks and buses killed 95. Motorcycles and mopeds, 10. Bikes, 11. The numbers are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>The city has taken steps. Speed limits are dropping in some zones.

This is policy. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat offenders.
