The police report makes no mention of the pedestrian’s behavior as a contributing factor.

The plan, described as aiming to 'better organize the park's roads for cyclists, pedestrians, and e-bike users,' includes a protected bike lane on the 86th Street transverse and separate lanes for different users. Board member Sebastian Hallum Clarke introduced the substitute resolution backing the plan. David Saltonstall of the Conservancy stressed the need for separation, referencing Olmsted’s original design.

The matter, titled 'Midtown to Adams: It’s Time For A 42nd Street Busway!', highlights the need to 'significantly improve the efficiency and livability of 42nd Street for both commuters and pedestrians.' Christine Berthet, co-chair of CB 4 Transportation Committee, stressed that busways make intersections safer for pedestrians. The Department of Transportation, represented by spokesperson Mona Bruno, stated its commitment to safer streets for pedestrians, cyclists, and bus riders. The proposal follows the proven gains of the 14th Street busway and comes as congestion pricing looms. DOT has lagged on protected bus lanes, and Adams faces mounting pressure to prioritize vulnerable road users over private vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation (DOT) has not delivered key improvements, like a dedicated pedestrian path on the Queensboro Bridge’s south outer roadway. The matter, described as 'Advocacy and Policy Critique on NYC Street Design and Transportation Improvements Post-Congestion Pricing,' highlights the city’s failure to act. Advocates Danny Pearlstein (Riders Alliance) and Jon Orcutt (Bike New York) urge the city to reclaim space for people, not cars. Sara Lind calls for bold changes, saying, 'This is a dream scenario, to be gifted more space in New York City.' DOT has added a bike lane to the Brooklyn Bridge and bus lanes on the Washington Bridge, but most projects lag. The Adams administration faces criticism for its lack of urgency. With car traffic down, advocates demand immediate action to protect pedestrians and cyclists.

The city moves forward.</p><p class=mb3>On January 5, 2025, New York City implemented congestion pricing, charging drivers who enter Manhattan below 60th Street. The policy, debated for decades, now stands as law. The measure’s stated goal: 'reduce traffic, improve air quality, and generate revenue for the MTA’s capital plan.' Tolls vary by vehicle and time. Low-income and disabled residents get discounts or exemptions. The plan expects to cut vehicle miles in the central business district by 6.4% and vehicles by 13.4%. Critics, including hospital executives and business owners, warn of negative impacts, but the city promises mitigation—like electric truck upgrades in the Bronx. The law faces ongoing legal and political challenges, but city leaders press on, calling congestion pricing necessary for New York’s future.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The board cited the October killing of cyclist Amanda Servedio by a suspect fleeing police on 34th Avenue. The draft letter states: "Such chases have dramatically reduced the public safety of pedestrians, cyclists, and other motorists, while we have found no discernible difference in public safety outcomes." Frank Servedio, Amanda’s father, spoke at the meeting, calling the chases senseless and deadly. The board’s action follows a surge in police pursuits under Mayor Adams, with nearly 400 chase-related crashes and at least 315 injuries this year. The board insists non-violent crimes do not justify high-speed chases through residential streets, demanding accountability and safer policies.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Twenty-six crashes in two years. Cyclist Amanda Servedio killed by a fleeing driver. Residents plead for change. NYPD shrugs. No answers. No reform. Streets stay deadly. Accountability missing.</p><p class=mb3>This report details a surge in crashes linked to NYPD high-speed pursuits in Queens’s 114th Precinct. In the last two years, there have been 26 chase-related crashes, compared to 11 in the previous nine years. The increase began after Mayor Adams promoted John Chell to Chief of Patrol and Jeffrey Maddrey to Chief of Department. The mayor claims chases are rare and reserved for violent crime, but the driver who killed cyclist Amanda Servedio was only a suspected burglar. Residents have packed community council meetings since February 2023, demanding an end to these pursuits. Kian Betancourt, a local, told officers, “We are asking you to protect us... and just nothing, I mean, like blank face, absolutely no response whatsoever.” Officers refuse to clarify or change their policy, despite repeated warnings from the community about deadly consequences. No council bill is cited; this is a record of community opposition and official inaction.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
