Outside distraction and driver error ended her life.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a 69-year-old woman was killed at the corner of Amsterdam Avenue and West 96th Street in Manhattan. The report states she was 'crossing with the light' in the crosswalk when a Ford SUV, making a left turn, struck her with its left front bumper. She suffered fatal injuries to her lower leg and died at the scene. The police report lists 'Outside Car Distraction' and 'Reaction to Uninvolved Vehicle' as contributing factors on the part of the driver. The victim’s actions—crossing with the signal—are noted, but the crash was precipitated by the driver’s failure to yield and inattention. The system allowed an ordinary turn to become deadly.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The narrative states the man was 'crushed and killed beneath steel and rubber,' and that 'a box truck, a pickup, and two others passed through.' The police report lists the contributing factor as 'Unspecified' for the drivers involved. No driver errors are explicitly cited in the report, but the involvement of multiple large vehicles and the presence of a worker in the roadway underscore the systemic dangers faced by those laboring in active traffic lanes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
