The report states the collision occurred at 2:48 a.m. The e-bike rider was thrown and crushed against a parked car, suffering fatal head trauma. According to the police report, 'Traffic Control Disregarded' was cited as a contributing factor, highlighting a critical driver error. The sedan's driver failed to obey traffic controls, leading directly to the deadly impact. The report does not list any victim behaviors as contributing factors. The e-bike rider was ejected and died at the scene. The crash involved two sedans—one moving, one parked—and an e-bike.

The committee will hear it on September 17, 2024. The bill summary warns: 'Intro 941 threatens to upend [the Citizen Air Complaint Program] by discouraging and outright banning participation.' Chris Hartmann, in a Streetsblog NYC opinion, opposes the bill. He says it imposes harsh deadlines on citizen reporters, lets the Department of Environmental Protection ban complainants for vague reasons, and undermines school bus idling limits. The bill also allows retroactive fine reductions for polluters. Hartmann urges Speaker Adrienne Adams and all Council members to reject Intro 941.

The project, first proposed in spring 2023, will run northbound from Dean Street to Flushing Avenue. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "The addition of a parking-protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue will create a critical cycling link in an area where bicycle ridership is booming, while making the road safer for everyone." City Council Member Chi Oss, who criticized delays, now calls the project "a win for everyone." The plan uses concrete barriers, flex-posts, and painted pedestrian islands to shield vulnerable users. Since 2020, five pedestrians have died on this stretch. The project responds to years of advocacy and high crash rates, aiming to protect walkers and cyclists in a busy, dangerous corridor.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Change could save dozens of lives each year.</p><p class=mb3>On September 10, 2024, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) proposed new federal safety standards for vehicles, aiming to "reduce fatalities and serious injuries among pedestrians struck by vehicles." The rules would apply to all new passenger vehicles under 10,000 pounds, including most SUVs and light trucks. The proposal comes after a 75 percent rise in pedestrian deaths since 2009, much of it linked to the high, blocky fronts of modern vehicles. The new standard would require carmakers to design hoods and grilles to reduce the risk of serious or fatal head injuries in crashes up to 25 mph. NHTSA estimates the rule could save 67 lives per year at a cost of about $3 per vehicle. Deputy Administrator Sophie Shulman said, "We have a crisis of roadway deaths, and it’s even worse among vulnerable road users like pedestrians." The move could finally force U.S. automakers to prioritize people outside the car.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states the child was crossing alone in the dark, far from any crosswalk, when the unlicensed driver hit him and did not stop. The police describe the child as suffering crush injuries to his entire body and dying at the scene. The driver’s license status is listed as 'Unlicensed' in the report, and the vehicle was traveling straight ahead. The police narrative makes clear the driver left the scene. No contributing factors are specified beyond the unlicensed status and failure to remain. The focus remains on the actions of the driver and the systemic danger posed by unlicensed, hit-and-run motorists on high-speed roadways.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
