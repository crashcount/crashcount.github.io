Most people on foot are hit by drivers of cars and SUVs; together those drivers account for the largest share of pedestrian deaths and injuries in the period covered (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The Bronx, Queens, Manhattan. Same Story</p><p>In the Bronx, a man was struck and left to die near the Major Deegan and Mosholu Parkway. “The deadly collision happened just after 2 AM on Sunday,” a local report said (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/man-struck-killed-deadly-hit-run-crash-bronx-nyc/17765262/>ABC7</a>). In Queens, state records show a left‑turning SUV driver killed an e‑bike rider in Hollis Court earlier this summer; Manhattan saw a driver plow onto the Manhattan Bridge walkway in July, killing a cyclist and a pedestrian (both in the city crash log for this period) (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Different boroughs. The same wound.</p><p>The Worst Drivers Do Outsized Harm</p><p>A small group does the most damage. Research cited by advocates found that <strong>1.5% of motorists are tied to 21% of pedestrian deaths</strong>, and vehicles with <strong>16 camera tickets in a year are twice as likely</strong> to kill or seriously injure; <strong>30+ tickets multiplies the risk fifty‑fold</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/20/the-1-5-percent-of-drivers-who-cause-21-percent-of-pedestrian-deaths>Streetsblog</a>).

The city can lower the default residential limit to <strong>20 MPH</strong> under Sammy’s Law, and Albany has a bill—the <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045C/A2299C)</strong>—to require intelligent speed limiters for anyone who racks up <strong>11 DMV points in 18 months or 16 camera tickets in a year</strong> (<a href=/take_action/>CrashCount: Take Action</a>). Slower streets and governor devices do not bring back the dead. They stop the next call.</p><p>One more right turn. One more crosswalk. We know how this ends unless we choose otherwise.

Cyclists lose their barrier. Cars reclaim space. The street grows more dangerous for the unshielded.</p><p class=mb3>On July 9, 2025, Judge Carolyn Walker-Diallo ruled that Mayor Eric Adams may remove the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane. The case, covered by Brooklyn Paper, found the city’s reasoning 'rational.' The protected lane will be replaced with a painted, unprotected lane. Council members Lincoln Restler and Chi Ossé criticized the move, saying they were not informed. DOT’s own data showed injuries dropped 47% after protection was installed. Safety analysts warn that removing the barrier reduces safety for cyclists and discourages riding, undermining safety in numbers for all vulnerable users. The city moves backward on Vision Zero.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The case, reported by Streetsblog NYC, allowed Mayor Eric Adams to erase three blocks of protected lane without public notice. The judge called the change a 'modification,' sidestepping city law on notification. Council Member Lincoln Restler and attorney Peter Beadle condemned the move. DOT data showed the protected lane cut crashes and injuries. The ruling strips away safe space for cyclists and pedestrians. As the safety analyst notes, removing a bike lane increases risk for all vulnerable road users by putting cars first.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
