The bill, now in committee, would require the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to set strict vehicle safety standards that protect pedestrians and cyclists. The measure calls for benchmarks on vehicle height, hood and bumper design, and blind zone size. It also demands that federal consumer safety ratings reflect how dangerous cars are to people outside them. Scanlon said, “Just the raw statistics make a really compelling case about the incredible, exponential rise in pedestrian and bicyclist deaths.” She acknowledged automaker resistance but insisted, “clearly, we need to do something in order to improve safety.” The bill takes aim at the deadly rise of large vehicles and the federal government’s failure to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The driver was not charged. The intersection sits in a Vision Zero priority zone, yet remains deadly. Transportation Alternatives called the crash 'entirely preventable,' blasting Mayor Adams for slow progress and broken promises. 'If Mayor Adams wants to save lives, he only has to build the streets and intersections that our city needs and our children deserve,' said co-interim director Elizabeth Adams. Despite a 2022 mayoral pledge and DOT promises, no real safety improvements have been made. Activists demand protected bike lanes and street redesign. The toll mounts: twelve children killed in traffic this year, more than almost any year in the last decade.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
