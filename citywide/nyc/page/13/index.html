In the last twelve months, <strong>287 people died</strong> on New York City streets. <strong>763 were left with serious injuries</strong>—bodies broken, lives changed. The numbers are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors. They are the cost of walking, biking, or driving in this city.</p><p>Just last week, a woman was killed crossing 174th Street in the Bronx. The driver fled. Police are still looking for them. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/driver-kills-bronx-pedestrian-flees-the-scene-nypd-says>Police said they&rsquo;re looking for the driver of a vehicle who struck and killed a woman as she crossed a Bronx street late Wednesday night and then fled the scene.</a> Another man was dragged fifty feet in Brooklyn, left to die. These are not rare stories. Brooklyn leads the city in pedestrian injuries this year.</p><h2 id=speed-and-silence>Speed and Silence</h2><p>Speed is the quiet killer. On July 19, a stolen car flew off the Manhattan Bridge at over 100 miles per hour. It hit a cyclist and a woman sitting on a bench in Chinatown. Both died. The city promised changes. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>As we mourn the loss of the victims of this horrific crash, we are taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection while developing a long-term safety redesign for the entire Canal Street corridor,</a> said Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. But seven have died on Canal Street since 2011. The fixes come after the funerals.</p><p>In another case, a cab driver was killed by an SUV going 77 mph in a 25 mph zone. The driver ran. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/08/08/us-news/bronx-woman-driving-77-mph-in-25-mph-zone-indicted-for-killing-cab-driver-da/>This defendant was allegedly driving three times the speed limit when her SUV slammed into a livery cab, and she fled the scene without checking on the driver&rsquo;s condition or waiting for first responders to arrive,</a> said Bronx District Attorney Darcel Clark.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>The city has tools. Sammy’s Law lets leaders lower the speed limit to 20 mph. They have not done it. Speed cameras are renewed, but the most dangerous drivers—those with dozens of violations—still roam free. The city promises redesigns after the dead are counted. The fixes are slow. The deaths are not.</p><p><strong>Every delay is another name on a slab.</strong></p><h2 id=act-now>Act Now</h2><p>Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat speeders.

According to the police report, the SUV’s left front bumper hit the pedestrian’s head, causing fatal injuries. The report states the man was 'crossing against the signal,' but lists the driver’s contributing factors as 'unspecified.' The impact occurred at the intersection, with the pedestrian dying at the scene. The police narrative describes the man dying alone under the glare of the streetlamp.
