Just last week, an eight-year-old boy was killed crossing Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights. His sister watched. His mother grieves. “He was a boy who loved life,” <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>said his mother</a>.</p><p>Scooter riders, teens on mopeds, and cyclists have all fallen.

The board’s Transportation Committee, led by Vice Chair Barak Friedman and Chair Jason Froimowitz, called the current setup 'really dangerous' and 'horrible for pedestrians and cyclists.' The resolution states opening the path 'must take priority over the convenience of drivers.' DOT has delayed the project repeatedly, citing unrelated upper deck construction. Former Mayor de Blasio promised a fix in 2021, but the Adams administration has not delivered. Cyclists and pedestrians remain forced to share a cramped, unsafe lane while motorists enjoy up to nine.

The proposal, discussed with Community Board 2’s Transportation Committee, removes one of four car lanes to install a curbside protected bike lane between Lispenard and W. Eighth streets. DOT project manager Preston Johnson called it 'the last gap between the Financial District and Central Park.' The plan forces cyclists to switch sides twice to accommodate Holland Tunnel traffic and firehouse parking. Over five years, 469 crashes injured 187 people on this stretch. Community Board 2 Transportation Chair Shirley Secunda said, 'Eight years ago we did a resolution asking DOT to reduce Sixth Avenue to three travel lanes from four [so] we’re very happy that it’s finally happening.' The project adds eight-to-ten-foot bike lanes, pedestrianizes a slip lane, and builds bus boarding islands.

Deaths up 28 percent from last year. Cars and trucks are the main killers. Not e-bikes. Not mopeds. City pushes plazas, daylighting, and enforcement. Streets remain deadly. Drivers escape blame. Victims pay.</p><p class=mb3>This report, published September 26, 2024, details a surge in pedestrian deaths: 87 killed in NYC between January 1 and September 23, up from 68 in the same period last year—a 28 percent jump. The NYPD and DOT confirm a double-digit rise in deaths and injuries, with 23 pedestrians hurt daily. The matter summary states, 'The 2024 Pedestrian Death Crisis is Due to Driving.' Jon Orcutt, former DOT official, calls for targeted enforcement against drivers, especially those dodging accountability. DOT spokesman Vin Barone says, 'Cars are heavier and faster and still pose a far greater risk.' The Adams administration is expanding pedestrian plazas, daylighting intersections, and cracking down on reckless driving. Data show cars and trucks cause most deaths, not micromobility. Only 5.5% of injuries involve e-bikes or mopeds. The city focuses on driver accountability and infrastructure, but the toll climbs. Vulnerable road users remain at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Chris Hartmann, in a Streetsblog NYC opinion, opposes the bill. He says it imposes harsh deadlines on citizen reporters, lets the Department of Environmental Protection ban complainants for vague reasons, and undermines school bus idling limits. The bill also allows retroactive fine reductions for polluters. Hartmann urges Speaker Adrienne Adams and all Council members to reject Intro 941.
