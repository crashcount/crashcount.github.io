In the last twelve months, <strong>241 people died</strong> and <strong>701 suffered serious injuries</strong> on New York’s streets. The dead do not get second chances. The injured carry scars no policy can erase. Just days ago, a <strong>90-year-old man lay on the pavement in Brooklyn, his head split open</strong> after a masked moped rider hit him and fled. &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/brooklyn-90-year-old-man-hit-run-rider/>said an eyewitness</a>. The rider did not stop. The city keeps moving.</p><p>A day before, <strong>Dov Broyde, 70, was crossing Avenue I</strong>. A Smart Car driver plowed into him. Broyde died at the hospital. The driver stayed. No charges filed. <strong>Fifty-five pedestrians have died this year</strong>. The number is lower than last year.

Lives do not wait.</p><p>Some leaders fight for safety. Others rip it out. The city tried to remove the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane. DOT warned: &ldquo;Removing the protected bike lane won&rsquo;t remove cyclists—it will only make the street less safe&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/dot-testimony-removing-bedford-ave-bike-lane-will-reduce-safety>testified DOT</a>.

They are families left waiting for someone who will not come home.</p><h2 id=what-now>What Now</h2><p><strong>Every day the council delays, someone else dies.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph citywide speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand action.

The incident occurred just hours before the Department of Transportation (DOT) implemented a long-stalled safety redesign. The redesign narrowed the roadway to one lane and added a protected bike lane—a 'road diet' proven to improve safety. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives condemned the city's delay, stating, 'delaying projects has a real cost.' The matter highlights the deadly impact of bureaucratic inaction. Between January and early October, there were 86 reported crashes on this mile-long stretch, injuring cyclists, pedestrians, and motorists, and killing one pedestrian. The city faces a pedestrian death crisis, with fatalities rising. DOT claims the redesign will make the street safer, but for Mendez, the fix came too late.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The board’s Transportation Committee, led by Vice Chair Barak Friedman and Chair Jason Froimowitz, called the current setup 'really dangerous' and 'horrible for pedestrians and cyclists.' The resolution states opening the path 'must take priority over the convenience of drivers.' DOT has delayed the project repeatedly, citing unrelated upper deck construction. Former Mayor de Blasio promised a fix in 2021, but the Adams administration has not delivered. Cyclists and pedestrians remain forced to share a cramped, unsafe lane while motorists enjoy up to nine. Advocates and board members say the city’s excuses put lives at risk.

The SUV was turning left when the collision occurred, with the point of impact on its right side doors.

Emily Jacobi of Transportation Alternatives says, 'Canal is dangerous, it's deadly, and it's killing us.' Wellington Chen of the Chinatown Partnership points to pollution and stress harming elders. The Department of Transportation claims improvements are coming, but progress is slow. Community Board 1 voted for expanded pedestrian space and a protected bike lane years ago. Most residents walk or use transit. Still, the street favors cars. Since 2014, Canal has seen 10 deaths and 700 injuries.

DOT project manager Preston Johnson called it 'the last gap between the Financial District and Central Park.'

Community Board 2 Transportation Chair Shirley Secunda said, 'Eight years ago we did a resolution asking DOT to reduce Sixth Avenue to three travel lanes from four [so] we’re very happy that it’s finally happening.'

The Adams administration is expanding pedestrian plazas, daylighting intersections, and cracking down on reckless driving. Data show cars and trucks cause most deaths, not micromobility.

The crash occurred as the truck was making a left turn. The report states, 'A flatbed truck turned left. A 64-year-old man crossed with the light. The front end struck him. His body crushed beneath steel.' The pedestrian was crossing with the signal at the intersection, as explicitly noted in the police data. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified,' but the narrative and vehicle data confirm the truck's left turn and the pedestrian's lawful crossing. The man suffered fatal crush injuries to his entire body. No driver errors beyond the left turn are specified, but the sequence underscores the lethal risk posed by turning vehicles to people in crosswalks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The report states the collision occurred at 2:48 a.m. The e-bike rider was thrown and crushed against a parked car, suffering fatal head trauma. According to the police report, 'Traffic Control Disregarded' was cited as a contributing factor, highlighting a critical driver error. The sedan's driver failed to obey traffic controls, leading directly to the deadly impact. The report does not list any victim behaviors as contributing factors. The e-bike rider was ejected and died at the scene. The crash involved two sedans—one moving, one parked—and an e-bike. The focus remains on the sedan driver's disregard for traffic control, which proved fatal for the vulnerable road user.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The hazard grows as daylight fades.</p><p class=mb3>On September 19, 2024, the Department of Transportation announced another delay for the Queensboro Bridge pedestrian and bike path expansion. The south outer roadway, promised for foot traffic since 2021, will stay open to cars until at least winter. DOT claims closing it would cause gridlock, citing ongoing upper deck repairs. The matter, titled 'Queensboro Pedestrian Path Delayed Again—This Time Until Winter,' has drawn sharp criticism. Council Member Julie Won, who supports the path, said, 'DOT once again is choosing ... drivers over pedestrians,' and warned the delay 'will continue to endanger the nearly 10,000 pedestrians and cyclists who use the narrow shared path every day.' Advocates and local officials echo her concerns, calling the crowded conditions hazardous, especially as nights grow longer. DOT’s decision keeps vulnerable road users at risk, prioritizing car flow over safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The committee will hear it on September 17, 2024. The bill summary warns: 'Intro 941 threatens to upend [the Citizen Air Complaint Program] by discouraging and outright banning participation.' Chris Hartmann, in a Streetsblog NYC opinion, opposes the bill. He says it imposes harsh deadlines on citizen reporters, lets the Department of Environmental Protection ban complainants for vague reasons, and undermines school bus idling limits. The bill also allows retroactive fine reductions for polluters. Hartmann urges Speaker Adrienne Adams and all Council members to reject Intro 941. He stresses that citizen enforcement is vital to public health and that this bill would erase hard-won clean air progress.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
