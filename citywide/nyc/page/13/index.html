The report states the driver was unlicensed. The woman died at the scene, suffering injuries to her entire body. The report notes the pedestrian was not at an intersection and was crossing without a signal or crosswalk, but does not list this as a contributing factor. The police narrative underscores the quiet of the street and the absence of other traffic. The critical failure cited in the report is the driver operating the vehicle without a valid license.

The bill, now in committee, would require the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to set strict vehicle safety standards that protect pedestrians and cyclists. The measure calls for benchmarks on vehicle height, hood and bumper design, and blind zone size. It also demands that federal consumer safety ratings reflect how dangerous cars are to people outside them. Scanlon said, “Just the raw statistics make a really compelling case about the incredible, exponential rise in pedestrian and bicyclist deaths.” She acknowledged automaker resistance but insisted, “clearly, we need to do something in order to improve safety.” The bill takes aim at the deadly rise of large vehicles and the federal government’s failure to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the motorcycle was traveling south at 'Unsafe Speed.' The rider, a 40-year-old man, was unlicensed and wore no helmet.

The police report lists 'Unsafe Speed' as the primary contributing factor. The rider’s lack of a license and helmet is noted in the report, but the focus remains on the excessive speed cited by police as the cause of the crash. No other vehicles or persons were involved.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The impact was severe: 'A Jeep slammed into a northbound moped. The 65-year-old rider flew from the seat, struck the pavement headfirst. Blood pooled in the street. The SUV’s front end folded. He died there.' The moped rider, a 65-year-old man, was killed instantly, suffering fatal head injuries after being ejected from his vehicle. The police report notes the SUV driver was unlicensed, with a license from Georgia that was not valid in New York. No driver errors beyond 'unspecified' are listed, but the unlicensed status is a critical systemic failure. Helmet use is mentioned only to note its absence, after the primary driver error. The crash underscores the lethal consequences when unlicensed drivers operate vehicles on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Cyclists get a jersey barrier. Cars lose a speeding lane. Intersections get safety upgrades. Local officials back the plan. The city moves fast. Danger shifts. Riders win space.</p><p class=mb3>On August 14, 2024, the Department of Transportation announced a permanent express bike lane for the First Avenue tunnel. The project, not tied to a council bill but a DOT action, will install a jersey-barrier-protected lane, realign the uptown cycling path, and add intersection safety measures. The DOT aims to finish before the next UN General Assembly in September. Hayes Lord, DOT bike program director, said, "We saw this as a chance to actually make an express lane through the tunnel." Jason Froimowitz, CB6 Transportation Committee chair, called the tunnel "opportune for conflicts" and praised the bypass. Residents like Mariam Rauf described frequent close calls with cars. The plan removes a car lane, giving cyclists protected space and reducing high-speed danger. Local support is strong. Some want similar routes citywide.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
