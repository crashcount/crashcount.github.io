One car lane goes. Cyclists get wide, protected paths. Riders must switch sides twice for tunnel traffic and firehouse parking. 469 crashes, 187 hurt in five years. Locals back the change.</p><p class=mb3>On October 1, 2024, the Department of Transportation announced a plan to close the protected bike lane gap along Soho’s Sixth Avenue. The proposal, discussed with Community Board 2’s Transportation Committee, removes one of four car lanes to install a curbside protected bike lane between Lispenard and W. Eighth streets. DOT project manager Preston Johnson called it 'the last gap between the Financial District and Central Park.' The plan forces cyclists to switch sides twice to accommodate Holland Tunnel traffic and firehouse parking. Over five years, 469 crashes injured 187 people on this stretch. Community Board 2 Transportation Chair Shirley Secunda said, 'Eight years ago we did a resolution asking DOT to reduce Sixth Avenue to three travel lanes from four [so] we’re very happy that it’s finally happening.' The project adds eight-to-ten-foot bike lanes, pedestrianizes a slip lane, and builds bus boarding islands. Local support is strong.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Deaths up 28 percent from last year. Cars and trucks are the main killers. Not e-bikes. Not mopeds. City pushes plazas, daylighting, and enforcement. Streets remain deadly. Drivers escape blame. Victims pay.</p><p class=mb3>This report, published September 26, 2024, details a surge in pedestrian deaths: 87 killed in NYC between January 1 and September 23, up from 68 in the same period last year—a 28 percent jump. The NYPD and DOT confirm a double-digit rise in deaths and injuries, with 23 pedestrians hurt daily. The matter summary states, 'The 2024 Pedestrian Death Crisis is Due to Driving.' Jon Orcutt, former DOT official, calls for targeted enforcement against drivers, especially those dodging accountability. DOT spokesman Vin Barone says, 'Cars are heavier and faster and still pose a far greater risk.' The Adams administration is expanding pedestrian plazas, daylighting intersections, and cracking down on reckless driving. Data show cars and trucks cause most deaths, not micromobility. Only 5.5% of injuries involve e-bikes or mopeds. The city focuses on driver accountability and infrastructure, but the toll climbs. Vulnerable road users remain at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Chris Hartmann, in a Streetsblog NYC opinion, opposes the bill. He says it imposes harsh deadlines on citizen reporters, lets the Department of Environmental Protection ban complainants for vague reasons, and undermines school bus idling limits. The bill also allows retroactive fine reductions for polluters. Hartmann urges Speaker Adrienne Adams and all Council members to reject Intro 941.

The new lane shields cyclists from traffic, narrows crossings for walkers, and marks a hard-won step for safety advocates.</p><p class=mb3>On September 10, 2024, the Department of Transportation announced the installation of a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue, a Vision Zero priority corridor. The project, first proposed in spring 2023, will run northbound from Dean Street to Flushing Avenue. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "The addition of a parking-protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue will create a critical cycling link in an area where bicycle ridership is booming, while making the road safer for everyone." City Council Member Chi Oss, who criticized delays, now calls the project "a win for everyone." The plan uses concrete barriers, flex-posts, and painted pedestrian islands to shield vulnerable users. Since 2020, five pedestrians have died on this stretch. The project responds to years of advocacy and high crash rates, aiming to protect walkers and cyclists in a busy, dangerous corridor.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

New rules target deadly SUV fronts. Pedestrian deaths soared 75 percent since 2009. The agency wants safer hoods, fewer fatal head injuries. Change could save dozens of lives each year.</p><p class=mb3>On September 10, 2024, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) proposed new federal safety standards for vehicles, aiming to "reduce fatalities and serious injuries among pedestrians struck by vehicles." The rules would apply to all new passenger vehicles under 10,000 pounds, including most SUVs and light trucks. The proposal comes after a 75 percent rise in pedestrian deaths since 2009, much of it linked to the high, blocky fronts of modern vehicles. The new standard would require carmakers to design hoods and grilles to reduce the risk of serious or fatal head injuries in crashes up to 25 mph. NHTSA estimates the rule could save 67 lives per year at a cost of about $3 per vehicle. Deputy Administrator Sophie Shulman said, "We have a crisis of roadway deaths, and it’s even worse among vulnerable road users like pedestrians." The move could finally force U.S. automakers to prioritize people outside the car.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states the man was 'walking along the highway with traffic' when a southbound car struck him. The narrative details, 'His head crushed. Body broken. No crosswalk. No name. Just the dark, the engine’s howl, and a man who didn’t make it home.' The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified.' The victim was not at an intersection at the time of the crash. The vehicle was traveling straight ahead, southbound. The report does not specify any driver actions or errors, but the impact left the pedestrian dead at the scene. The focus remains on the deadly interaction between car and pedestrian in a place built for speed, not for people.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The sole occupant, a 29-year-old male driver, was ejected from the vehicle and killed. The report states the vehicle’s front quarter panel crumpled on impact, leaving the scene silent and grim. Police cite 'Unsafe Speed' as a contributing factor, and note the driver was unlicensed at the time of the crash. The report lists no other vehicles or people involved. The data highlights the danger posed by excessive speed and unlicensed operation, both explicitly documented as driver errors in the official report. No mention is made of victim behavior contributing to the crash.
