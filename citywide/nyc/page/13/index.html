He crossed with the light. The city delayed a safety redesign for years. Hours after the crash, DOT narrowed the road and added a bike lane. Delay cost a life. Activists blame city inaction.</p><p class=mb3>On October 11, 2024, a hit-and-run driver fatally struck Felix Mendez, 49, as he crossed Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn. The incident occurred just hours before the Department of Transportation (DOT) implemented a long-stalled safety redesign. The redesign narrowed the roadway to one lane and added a protected bike lane—a 'road diet' proven to improve safety. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives condemned the city's delay, stating, 'delaying projects has a real cost.' The matter highlights the deadly impact of bureaucratic inaction. Between January and early October, there were 86 reported crashes on this mile-long stretch, injuring cyclists, pedestrians, and motorists, and killing one pedestrian. The city faces a pedestrian death crisis, with fatalities rising. DOT claims the redesign will make the street safer, but for Mendez, the fix came too late.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The board’s Transportation Committee, led by Vice Chair Barak Friedman and Chair Jason Froimowitz, called the current setup 'really dangerous' and 'horrible for pedestrians and cyclists.' The resolution states opening the path 'must take priority over the convenience of drivers.' DOT has delayed the project repeatedly, citing unrelated upper deck construction. Former Mayor de Blasio promised a fix in 2021, but the Adams administration has not delivered. Cyclists and pedestrians remain forced to share a cramped, unsafe lane while motorists enjoy up to nine. Advocates and board members say the city’s excuses put lives at risk.

The report states the collision occurred at 2:48 a.m. The e-bike rider was thrown and crushed against a parked car, suffering fatal head trauma. According to the police report, 'Traffic Control Disregarded' was cited as a contributing factor, highlighting a critical driver error. The sedan's driver failed to obey traffic controls, leading directly to the deadly impact. The report does not list any victim behaviors as contributing factors. The e-bike rider was ejected and died at the scene. The crash involved two sedans—one moving, one parked—and an e-bike. The focus remains on the sedan driver's disregard for traffic control, which proved fatal for the vulnerable road user.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

It weakens citizen power to report illegal idling. The bill opens loopholes for polluters. It lets agencies ban whistleblowers. Clean air gains are at risk. Vulnerable New Yorkers will breathe more danger.</p><p class=mb3>Intro 941 is a New York City Council bill now before the Committee on Environmental Protection, Resiliency, and Waterfronts. The committee will hear it on September 17, 2024. The bill summary warns: 'Intro 941 threatens to upend [the Citizen Air Complaint Program] by discouraging and outright banning participation.' Chris Hartmann, in a Streetsblog NYC opinion, opposes the bill. He says it imposes harsh deadlines on citizen reporters, lets the Department of Environmental Protection ban complainants for vague reasons, and undermines school bus idling limits. The bill also allows retroactive fine reductions for polluters. Hartmann urges Speaker Adrienne Adams and all Council members to reject Intro 941. He stresses that citizen enforcement is vital to public health and that this bill would erase hard-won clean air progress.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
