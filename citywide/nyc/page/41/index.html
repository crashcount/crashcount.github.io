Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) and Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). The bill, now in committee, amends the federal Highway Safety Improvement Program. It allows states to fully fund active transportation projects with federal dollars, removes local match requirements, and lets local governments nominate projects. The bill’s summary states it 'would tweak the regulations on the federal Highway Safety Improvement Program and spur states to spend that money to complete their protected bike and pedestrian networks.' Rep. Blumenauer, founder of the Congressional Bike Caucus, said, 'We have a responsibility to make our streets safer for cyclists and pedestrians.' The bill makes it explicit that states can and should use safety funds to connect existing bike and pedestrian infrastructure, not just for driver-focused projects. The law honors Sarah Langenkamp, killed while biking a gap between trails, and aims to prevent such deaths by closing the gaps that leave vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, detailed as 'Mayor Adams wants to build a seven-mile greenway along the Harlem River in the Bronx, turning the borough's wasteland western waterfront into a safe route for Boogie Down bicyclists and pedestrians from Van Cortlandt Park to Randalls Island,' aims to transform the car-dominated corridor into a haven for cyclists and pedestrians. Adams pledged to expand bike and pedestrian space on Harlem River bridges, reviving stalled efforts from the previous administration. The city will host virtual workshops for community input and plans to repurpose a car lane for a two-way bike lane on the Washington Bridge. Adams, who cycles the bridges himself, stressed the urgency of safer crossings. The plan faces hurdles: private and state land, property negotiations, and no set timeline or budget.

The committee called on the Department of Transportation to present a detailed proposal for an all-ages-and-abilities network, including pedestrian refuges. The matter’s summary: 'a long overdue plan that will save lives, advocates say.' Residents like Nick Ross, whose partner was killed on an unprotected street, spoke out. Cyclist Emily Brady described daily threats from drivers and double-parked cars. Since January, 146 crashes in the district have injured 62 people, including 12 cyclists and 18 pedestrians, with two pedestrian deaths. The resolution now goes to the full board on April 4.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
