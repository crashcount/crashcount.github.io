The project, detailed as 'Mayor Adams wants to build a seven-mile greenway along the Harlem River in the Bronx, turning the borough's wasteland western waterfront into a safe route for Boogie Down bicyclists and pedestrians from Van Cortlandt Park to Randalls Island,' aims to transform the car-dominated corridor into a haven for cyclists and pedestrians. Adams pledged to expand bike and pedestrian space on Harlem River bridges, reviving stalled efforts from the previous administration. The city will host virtual workshops for community input and plans to repurpose a car lane for a two-way bike lane on the Washington Bridge. Adams, who cycles the bridges himself, stressed the urgency of safer crossings. The plan faces hurdles: private and state land, property negotiations, and no set timeline or budget. Advocates say the Bronx deserves open space and safer routes, but connecting all segments could take years.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Elizabeth Adams called the road 'known-dangerous' and demanded protected bike lanes. Less than 2% of District 34’s streets have them. The 90th Precinct saw 1,966 crashes in 2022, injuring 170 cyclists and 145 pedestrians. Advocates say the city’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed. No council bill is attached, but the call for real change is urgent.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cameras can’t catch them. Internal probes end with warnings or nothing. No discipline. No transparency. Officers dodge accountability. Vulnerable road users pay the price. The system shields its own. The danger rolls on.</p><p class=mb3>On March 9, 2023, Streetsblog NYC published an exposé on NYPD officers who deface or obscure license plates to evade traffic enforcement. The article, 'Cycle of Rage: One Hand Whitewashes the Other on NYPD Plate Defacing,' documents months of reporting by Gersh Kuntzman. He flagged over a dozen officers, but NYPD internal investigations led to only warnings or requests to fix plates—no formal punishment. The NYPD often closed cases without action, citing lack of evidence or officer retirement. Kuntzman’s Freedom of Information requests for discipline records were denied. The piece quotes, 'None of the eight cops was disciplined.' The pattern is clear: leniency, secrecy, and a lack of enforcement. Council members are not named; this is a matter of NYPD internal accountability. The lack of consequences leaves dangerous drivers on the street, putting pedestrians and cyclists at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
