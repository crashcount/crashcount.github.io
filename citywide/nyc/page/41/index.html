In the last twelve months, <strong>243 people died</strong> on New York streets. <strong>708 were left with serious injuries</strong>. Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—none are spared. Just last week, an eight-year-old boy was killed crossing Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights. His sister watched. His mother grieves. “He was a boy who loved life,” <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>said his mother</a>.</p><p>Scooter riders, teens on mopeds, and cyclists have all fallen. On June 26, a 39-year-old man was thrown from his scooter and died on 116th Avenue. No arrests. No comfort. The street is unchanged.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> In the last three years, they took <strong>299 lives</strong> and left thousands more broken. Trucks and buses killed <strong>93</strong>. Motorcycles and mopeds, <strong>10</strong>. Bikes, <strong>11</strong>. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not. Every crash is a family torn open.</p><h3 id=leaders-actbut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Act—But Not Fast Enough</h3><p>The city has moved, but the pace is slow. Speed cameras in school zones are now extended through 2030. “It’s simple: speed cameras save lives and keep New Yorkers safe,” <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>said Governor Hochul</a>. But cameras alone are not enough. Streets need to be rebuilt. Speed limits must drop. The city has the power to set a 20 mph limit. It has not used it.</p><p>Some leaders speak plain. “At this point, there are no questions, just facts: speeding kills, and speed cameras save lives,” <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>said State Senator Gounardes</a>. But others drag their feet, or worse, rip out bike lanes and leave riders exposed.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand that repeat speeders are stopped. Do not wait for another child’s name to be written in chalk on the street.</p><p><strong>Act now.

E-scooter and e-moped deaths rise. Advocates demand action. DOT lags on protected bike lanes. Names of the dead echo through the city. Drivers rarely charged. Streets remain lethal. City promises, but danger grows.</p><p class=mb3>In early 2023, New York City saw ten cyclist deaths, the highest toll for this period in a decade. The Department of Transportation (DOT) reported a five-fold increase over 2022. The event, covered April 10, 2023, highlights an advocacy call for more protected bike lanes. Transportation Alternatives spokesman Jacob deCastro urged Mayor Adams and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez to meet the NYC Streets Plan mandate of 50 miles of protected bike lanes this year, after DOT failed to reach its 2022 goal. The article states: 'Mayor Adams and Department of Transportation Commissioner [Ydanis] Rodriguez must build physical infrastructure to protect people riding bikes, especially in areas the city knows to be dangerous.' Cyclist injuries and deaths, including Tamara Chuchi Kao, Sarah Schick, James Giambalvo, and Hua Pan, mount as drivers often face no charges. DOT spokesman Vin Barone claims ongoing Vision Zero efforts, but advocates say the city is moving too slow. The streets remain deadly for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, not tied to a council bill but a DOT initiative, follows the city's push for safer, more spacious cycling routes. The matter summary states: 'DOT crews laid down four blocks of 'double-lane' protected bike lane on Ninth Avenue in Manhattan this week, debuting a 'passing lane' design officials plan to rollout later this year at locations across the city.' Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Wider bike lanes can make cycling more comfortable and social, encouraging the amazing growth we've seen in cycling and e-micromobility use.' The new design features a six-foot bike lane with a four-foot passing lane, separated from parked cars by an eight-foot buffer. DOT will monitor the pilot to guide future installations.

The crashes happened in Borough Park, Brooklyn; Third Avenue, Manhattan; and Williamsbridge Road, Bronx. Two were hit-and-runs. Borough Park, called dangerous for walkers and cyclists, has seen residents oppose safety upgrades. The matter summary states: 'The group reiterated its call for the state legislature to pass the so-called "Sammy's Law," which would allow the city to set its own speed limits, which would dramatically reduce road deaths and serious injuries.' Amy Cohen of Families for Safe Streets, whose son Sammy inspired the bill, condemned Albany’s control over city speed limits. Transportation Alternatives and Families for Safe Streets called for passage of Sammy’s Law and the ROADS package. DOT pledged to continue Vision Zero efforts and support these laws. The deaths highlight the cost of inaction and resistance to proven safety measures.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) and Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). The bill, now in committee, amends the federal Highway Safety Improvement Program. It allows states to fully fund active transportation projects with federal dollars, removes local match requirements, and lets local governments nominate projects. The bill’s summary states it 'would tweak the regulations on the federal Highway Safety Improvement Program and spur states to spend that money to complete their protected bike and pedestrian networks.' Rep. Blumenauer, founder of the Congressional Bike Caucus, said, 'We have a responsibility to make our streets safer for cyclists and pedestrians.' The bill makes it explicit that states can and should use safety funds to connect existing bike and pedestrian infrastructure, not just for driver-focused projects. The law honors Sarah Langenkamp, killed while biking a gap between trails, and aims to prevent such deaths by closing the gaps that leave vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Long road ahead.</p><p class=mb3>On March 22, 2023, Mayor Eric Adams announced a plan to build a seven-mile greenway along the Harlem River in the Bronx. The project, detailed as 'Mayor Adams wants to build a seven-mile greenway along the Harlem River in the Bronx, turning the borough's wasteland western waterfront into a safe route for Boogie Down bicyclists and pedestrians from Van Cortlandt Park to Randalls Island,' aims to transform the car-dominated corridor into a haven for cyclists and pedestrians. Adams pledged to expand bike and pedestrian space on Harlem River bridges, reviving stalled efforts from the previous administration. The city will host virtual workshops for community input and plans to repurpose a car lane for a two-way bike lane on the Washington Bridge. Adams, who cycles the bridges himself, stressed the urgency of safer crossings. The plan faces hurdles: private and state land, property negotiations, and no set timeline or budget. Advocates say the Bronx deserves open space and safer routes, but connecting all segments could take years.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A sedan, driven by an unlicensed 51-year-old man, ignored the traffic control and struck her. Both the pedestrian and the driver died from their injuries. According to the police report, 'A sedan tore through. The unlicensed driver, 51, struck her. Both died. Blood on pavement. Signal ignored.' The report lists 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as the primary contributing factor. The driver’s lack of a valid license is also documented.

The danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On March 20, 2023, after the death of 7-year-old Dolma Naadhun, the city faced pressure to act on Newtown Road. The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, refused to commit to a stop light, promising only to study the site and add a curb extension. The matter, described as 'significant street safety improvements,' drew outrage. Over 30,000 signed a petition for a stop light. Community voices—Dolma’s family, local parents, advocates—demanded more: pedestrian plazas, Open Streets, enforcement. Sarah Chu said, 'And if the family wants a stop light, just give it to them.' Ivana Bologna called for ticketing drivers. The city’s limited response, with only signage and paint, was widely seen as inadequate. Advocates insisted on physical changes to protect lives, not half-measures.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
