The article, 'Cycle of Rage: One Hand Whitewashes the Other on NYPD Plate Defacing,' documents months of reporting by Gersh Kuntzman. He flagged over a dozen officers, but NYPD internal investigations led to only warnings or requests to fix plates—no formal punishment. The NYPD often closed cases without action, citing lack of evidence or officer retirement. Kuntzman’s Freedom of Information requests for discipline records were denied. The piece quotes, 'None of the eight cops was disciplined.' The pattern is clear: leniency, secrecy, and a lack of enforcement. Council members are not named; this is a matter of NYPD internal accountability. The lack of consequences leaves dangerous drivers on the street, putting pedestrians and cyclists at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets remain deadly for the vulnerable.</p><p class=mb3>At a March 7, 2023 meeting, Brooklyn Community Board 12 (CB12) debated street safety and enforcement. Chairman Yidel Perlstein urged police to target cyclists, claiming, “police should focus on ticketing cyclists rather than drivers.” Resident Karen Chan blamed a speeding ticket on a nearby cyclist. Local Nina Sabghir countered, citing rampant driver misconduct: speeding, double parking, blocking bike lanes. Transportation Alternatives’ Jacob deCastro called for protected bike lanes, not scapegoating. The board opposes increased enforcement against drivers and rejects protected bike infrastructure, despite city data showing drivers are the main cause of crashes, injuries, and deaths. Vulnerable road users remain at risk while CB12 resists proven safety measures.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
