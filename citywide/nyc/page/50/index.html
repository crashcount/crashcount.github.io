The incident, reported by Streetsblog NYC, highlights the deadly risk to children on city sidewalks. Police did not charge the 35-year-old driver. The crash occurred during the afternoon, a period when, according to city data, streets near schools see 32 percent more crashes per mile. The article states: 'the rate of people injured by drivers on school days was 43 percent higher outside school buildings where a majority of students were brown or Black.' These disparities have persisted for years. The council has not acted to address these systemic dangers. Vulnerable children pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets swarm with cars. Crashes and injuries spike at drop-off. The city’s open streets program falters. Few schools get protection. Most are in wealthy, white areas. Kids in Black and brown neighborhoods face more harm. The system fails the vulnerable.</p><p class=mb3>On September 8, 2022, Streetfilms released a report highlighting the dangers children face near New York City schools. The film, featuring Streetsblog reporter Jesse Coburn, documents that during the 8 a.m. hour, streets near schools see 57 percent more crashes and 25 percent more injuries per mile than other city streets. The matter summary states, 'School zones don’t have to be danger zones.' The city’s open streets for schools program, meant to keep cars away from children, is failing. Only 38 schools participate, down from 101, and most are in wealthier, whiter neighborhoods. The application process is burdensome, requiring schools to opt in rather than providing universal protection. Former DOT Commissioner Janette Sadik-Khan and StreetopiaUWS Director Carl Mahaney criticize the system. The film exposes how the city’s approach leaves children in Black and brown communities at greater risk, both from crashes and pollution.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
