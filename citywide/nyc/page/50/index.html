The crash occurred at 5:10 p.m. The report states the cyclist was traveling east and hit the pedestrian’s arm with the front wheel, causing severe lacerations. Police cite 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as contributing factors. The narrative details: 'A man stepped into the crosswalk, light in his favor. A bike cut through the dusk. Its front wheel struck his arm. Skin tore. Blood spilled.' The pedestrian, age 38, suffered injuries to the elbow and lower arm and remained conscious at the scene. The police report explicitly notes the pedestrian was 'Crossing With Signal.' The focus remains on the cyclist’s failure to yield and inattention, which led to the injury.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
