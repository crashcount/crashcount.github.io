Seven hundred thirty-four suffered wounds so grave they will never be the same. The dead are not numbers. A 76-year-old woman, struck by an SUV while crossing White Plains Road. A 32-year-old woman, crushed by a Jeep on Marcus Garvey Boulevard. A 79-year-old man, found dead in a parked car on West 77th.

But the law that keeps speed cameras running is set to expire. If Albany fails, the cameras go dark. Streets go back to the way they were—fast, brutal, and unforgiving.

According to the police report, 'The front bumper hit her full. She died there. The driver was distracted.' The driver, a 45-year-old man, suffered a shoulder injury. The crash data lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the primary contributing factor. The woman was not in the roadway at the time of the crash. No other contributing factors are noted in the report. The impact was to the center front end of the SUV, damaging the left front bumper. The fatal outcome underscores the danger of distraction at the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The system fails the vulnerable.</p><p class=mb3>On September 8, 2022, Streetfilms released a report highlighting the dangers children face near New York City schools. The film, featuring Streetsblog reporter Jesse Coburn, documents that during the 8 a.m. hour, streets near schools see 57 percent more crashes and 25 percent more injuries per mile than other city streets. The matter summary states, 'School zones don’t have to be danger zones.' The city’s open streets for schools program, meant to keep cars away from children, is failing. Only 38 schools participate, down from 101, and most are in wealthier, whiter neighborhoods. The application process is burdensome, requiring schools to opt in rather than providing universal protection. Former DOT Commissioner Janette Sadik-Khan and StreetopiaUWS Director Carl Mahaney criticize the system. The film exposes how the city’s approach leaves children in Black and brown communities at greater risk, both from crashes and pollution.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, not a council bill but a city action, follows years of neglect and repeated crashes. DOT will cut traffic lanes from six to two, add a parking-protected bike lane, and expand pedestrian space. The plan also includes daylighting at intersections and improved markings. According to DOT, 'the project will improve safety for all users, providing connections to existing bike infrastructure and the reduction of a vehicle lane encouraging safer speeds.' Queens Borough President Donovan Richards praised the move, saying, 'Far too many people are killed and injured on our city’s streets, especially people of color, who are disproportionately impacted by traffic violence.' Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives added, 'DOT's move to turn car space into protected bike lanes on Seagirt Boulevard, while shortening crossings and expanding median space, will prevent speeding and make it safer to walk, bike, and take transit.' The redesign targets a stretch with 222 crashes and 87 injuries since 2019, aiming to end the long-standing danger for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Transportation Alternatives condemned the lack of turn-calming, leading pedestrian intervals, and bike lanes, calling the crash 'the result of inequitable street design.'
