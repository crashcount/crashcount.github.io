Progress stalls. Lives at risk.</p><p class=mb3>On September 26, 2022, advocacy groups Transportation Alternatives and Riders Alliance released a report slamming the Adams administration for failing to meet the NYC Streets Master Plan’s legal mandates. The report states, 'the city is at only 23% of its bike lane goal and 10% of its bus lane goal for the year.' Elizabeth Adams called for protected bike lanes, saying, 'For the future of our climate and the safety on our streets, protected bike lanes need to be a priority.' Danny Pearlstein demanded faster action on bus lanes. Michael Kaess highlighted the Bronx’s lack of progress. The Department of Transportation disputed the numbers, but advocates pointed to missed deadlines and lack of transparency. Staffing shortages and political interference are blamed. Vulnerable road users—cyclists, bus riders, pedestrians—remain exposed as the city drags its feet.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets swarm with cars. Crashes and injuries spike at drop-off. The city’s open streets program falters. Few schools get protection. Most are in wealthy, white areas. Kids in Black and brown neighborhoods face more harm. The system fails the vulnerable.</p><p class=mb3>On September 8, 2022, Streetfilms released a report highlighting the dangers children face near New York City schools. The film, featuring Streetsblog reporter Jesse Coburn, documents that during the 8 a.m. hour, streets near schools see 57 percent more crashes and 25 percent more injuries per mile than other city streets. The matter summary states, 'School zones don’t have to be danger zones.' The city’s open streets for schools program, meant to keep cars away from children, is failing. Only 38 schools participate, down from 101, and most are in wealthier, whiter neighborhoods. The application process is burdensome, requiring schools to opt in rather than providing universal protection. Former DOT Commissioner Janette Sadik-Khan and StreetopiaUWS Director Carl Mahaney criticize the system. The film exposes how the city’s approach leaves children in Black and brown communities at greater risk, both from crashes and pollution.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the boy was not in a crosswalk or at a signal when the collision occurred. The child suffered abrasions and injuries to his leg and foot. The report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Unsafe Speed' as contributing factors. The motorbike, traveling north, struck the boy with its left front bumper. The police report does not mention any helmet or signal use as a factor. The driver’s failure to pay attention and excessive speed created deadly risk for the young pedestrian.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Riders cross with the pedestrian signal, as allowed since 2019. Cops ticket them anyway. Judges uphold fines. City agencies refuse to comment. Cyclists face danger from cars and the system alike.</p><p class=mb3>This enforcement controversy centers on the 2019 City Council law, sponsored by then-Council Member Carlos Menchaca, which allows cyclists to cross with the pedestrian signal during leading pedestrian intervals (LPIs). Despite the law, NYPD officers and DMV judges continue to ticket and fine cyclists for red light violations when they cross legally. The matter title states, 'The NYPD and DMV Are Punishing Cyclists For Legally Crossing With The Pedestrian Signal.' Cyclist Darren Goldner and Queens resident Chad Formaggio both received $190 tickets for obeying the pedestrian signal. Attorney Steve Vaccaro notes, 'They should have sent a memo about it. But I don't know if anyone did.' The Department of Transportation defers to NYPD and DMV, who remain silent. Cyclists are left exposed, targeted by enforcement instead of protected from reckless drivers. The law’s intent—to give vulnerable road users a head start—remains ignored by those tasked with upholding it.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT will add a parking-protected bike lane and more space for people on foot. The redesign aims to slow drivers and shield those outside cars from harm.</p><p class=mb3>On September 6, 2022, the Department of Transportation announced a major safety redesign for Seagirt Boulevard, a notorious crash corridor in Far Rockaway. The project, not a council bill but a city action, follows years of neglect and repeated crashes. DOT will cut traffic lanes from six to two, add a parking-protected bike lane, and expand pedestrian space. The plan also includes daylighting at intersections and improved markings. According to DOT, 'the project will improve safety for all users, providing connections to existing bike infrastructure and the reduction of a vehicle lane encouraging safer speeds.' Queens Borough President Donovan Richards praised the move, saying, 'Far too many people are killed and injured on our city’s streets, especially people of color, who are disproportionately impacted by traffic violence.' Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives added, 'DOT's move to turn car space into protected bike lanes on Seagirt Boulevard, while shortening crossings and expanding median space, will prevent speeding and make it safer to walk, bike, and take transit.' The redesign targets a stretch with 222 crashes and 87 injuries since 2019, aiming to end the long-standing danger for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
