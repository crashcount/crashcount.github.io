An SUV hit him at the intersection. His name is not in the data. His age is. The street is busy. The city calls it one of the most dangerous for walkers. The group said, <strong>"[Eastern Parkway] acts as a major thoroughfare for drivers, and is the sixth most dangerous street in Brooklyn for pedestrians"</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/01/tuesdays-headlines-another-child-sacrificed-to-the-suv-edition>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>Fourteen people were hurt when a van slammed into a tree in Brooklyn. Twelve of them were adults with special needs, headed to a day program. The driver swerved to avoid another car. A witness said, <strong>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sad because they definitely need a lot of attention more than anyone else. I hope that they&rsquo;re all OK at the end of the day&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/transport-van-crashes-tree-bath-beach-brooklyn-injuring-14-people/16903098/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>A 17-year-old died riding a moped. A 39-year-old was killed on a motorcycle. The list goes on. In the past 12 months, <strong>244 people have died</strong> on city streets. <strong>709 were seriously injured</strong>.

There is no greater priority for me than the safety of New Yorkers&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>amNY</a>). Cameras slow some drivers. But the dead keep coming.</p><p>Protected bike lanes work.

In three years, <strong>cars and SUVs killed 300 people</strong> and left thousands more broken. Trucks and buses killed 93. Motorcycles and mopeds killed 10. Bikes killed 11.

The vehicle’s center front end bore the brunt of the collision. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified,' offering no further detail on driver behavior or conditions. The focus remains on the lethal force of the vehicle and the absence of safe crossing infrastructure at the site.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

According to the police report, a moped traveling straight collided head-on with a sedan that was making a left turn. The 24-year-old moped rider was ejected from his seat, suffering fatal head injuries despite wearing a helmet. The report states the moped struck the sedan's center front end while the sedan was turning. Both vehicles sustained significant front-end damage. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified,' but the sequence of events highlights the systemic danger when turning vehicles cross the paths of vulnerable road users. The moped rider's helmet use is noted in the report, but the impact proved overwhelming.

The board cited the October killing of cyclist Amanda Servedio by a suspect fleeing police on 34th Avenue. The draft letter states: "Such chases have dramatically reduced the public safety of pedestrians, cyclists, and other motorists, while we have found no discernible difference in public safety outcomes." Frank Servedio, Amanda’s father, spoke at the meeting, calling the chases senseless and deadly. The board’s action follows a surge in police pursuits under Mayor Adams, with nearly 400 chase-related crashes and at least 315 injuries this year. The board insists non-violent crimes do not justify high-speed chases through residential streets, demanding accountability and safer policies.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Residents have packed community council meetings since February 2023, demanding an end to these pursuits. Kian Betancourt, a local, told officers, “We are asking you to protect us... and just nothing, I mean, like blank face, absolutely no response whatsoever.” Officers refuse to clarify or change their policy, despite repeated warnings from the community about deadly consequences.

According to the police report, the driver failed to yield the right-of-way and was inattentive or distracted at the time of the crash. The report states, 'Steel met flesh. She dropped, broken. The driver did not yield.' The impact occurred at the left front quarter panel of the SUV, causing fatal crush injuries to the pedestrian's entire body. The woman was not at an intersection and was crossing without a signal or crosswalk, as noted in the report, but the primary contributing factors remain 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction.' The driver was licensed and operating a 2023 SUV. The collision underscores the lethal consequences of driver error on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Four blocks get a two-way protected lane. Pedestrian islands shrink crossings. Forty parking spots vanish. The street saw 28 crash injuries since 2019. Cyclists and walkers get space. Cars lose ground.</p><p class=mb3>On December 3, 2024, the Department of Transportation announced a plan to close the protected bike lane gap on Dyckman Street in uptown Manhattan. The project, not tied to a council bill but a DOT action, will install a two-way protected bike path from Quisqueya Plaza to the waterfront, connecting East and West sides. DOT officials described the plan as making the road 'safer for all users than the current unprotected bike lanes, where drivers often intrude and double park.' The redesign removes 40 free parking spaces, drawing pushback from Community Board 12 members. DOT’s Preston Johnson and Shawn Macias stressed the safety benefits, especially daylighting at intersections to improve visibility for pedestrians. The area saw 28 crash injuries, including six cyclists, from 2019 to 2023. Pedestrian islands will shorten crossings from 44 to 25 feet. The changes are set for spring 2025.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The meeting followed the death of Amanda Servedio, a cyclist killed by a suspect fleeing police. Her family’s statement read: 'We believe Amanda would still be alive if not for the deadly actions of this department and this precinct in particular.' From January through September 2024, officers from the 114th Precinct engaged in 38 high-speed chases—sixth highest in the city. Residents, including Amy and Michael Murtha, criticized the sharp rise in pursuits and the focus on moped riders instead of dangerous drivers. Deputy Inspector Seth Lynch cited department policy but gave no solutions. The community pressed for accountability and demanded police stop risking lives for minor crimes. The meeting showed deep frustration with police priorities and a call for real change to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
