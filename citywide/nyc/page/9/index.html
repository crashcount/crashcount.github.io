Just last week, an eight-year-old boy was killed crossing Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights. His sister watched. His mother grieves. “He was a boy who loved life,” <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>said his mother</a>.</p><p>Scooter riders, teens on mopeds, and cyclists have all fallen.

According to the police report, a moped traveling straight collided head-on with a sedan that was making a left turn. The 24-year-old moped rider was ejected from his seat, suffering fatal head injuries despite wearing a helmet. The report states the moped struck the sedan's center front end while the sedan was turning. Both vehicles sustained significant front-end damage. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified,' but the sequence of events highlights the systemic danger when turning vehicles cross the paths of vulnerable road users. The moped rider's helmet use is noted in the report, but the impact proved overwhelming.

The impact killed a 51-year-old woman and left a baby boy with broken legs. Both victims were pedestrians and, as the report states, 'not in the roadway' at the time of the crash. The police report cites 'Traffic Control Disregarded' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as contributing factors for both drivers. The narrative underscores that 'the drivers missed the signs,' highlighting systemic failures in driver compliance with traffic controls. The collision’s violence—'metal screamed'—left one woman dead from crush injuries and a child with severe leg trauma. The report does not list any victim behavior as a contributing factor.

The board cited the October killing of cyclist Amanda Servedio by a suspect fleeing police on 34th Avenue. The draft letter states: "Such chases have dramatically reduced the public safety of pedestrians, cyclists, and other motorists, while we have found no discernible difference in public safety outcomes." Frank Servedio, Amanda’s father, spoke at the meeting, calling the chases senseless and deadly. The board’s action follows a surge in police pursuits under Mayor Adams, with nearly 400 chase-related crashes and at least 315 injuries this year. The board insists non-violent crimes do not justify high-speed chases through residential streets, demanding accountability and safer policies.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Residents like Brett M. said, 'It would help to extend it the whole way,' and noted, 'People were speeding.' Local politicians told DOT the reduced version in the north did 'nothing' for pedestrians.

In the last two years, there have been 26 chase-related crashes, compared to 11 in the previous nine years. The increase began after Mayor Adams promoted John Chell to Chief of Patrol and Jeffrey Maddrey to Chief of Department. The mayor claims chases are rare and reserved for violent crime, but the driver who killed cyclist Amanda Servedio was only a suspected burglar. Residents have packed community council meetings since February 2023, demanding an end to these pursuits. Kian Betancourt, a local, told officers, “We are asking you to protect us... and just nothing, I mean, like blank face, absolutely no response whatsoever.” Officers refuse to clarify or change their policy, despite repeated warnings from the community about deadly consequences. No council bill is cited; this is a record of community opposition and official inaction.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, not tied to a council bill but a DOT action, will install a two-way protected bike path from Quisqueya Plaza to the waterfront, connecting East and West sides. DOT officials described the plan as making the road 'safer for all users than the current unprotected bike lanes, where drivers often intrude and double park.' The redesign removes 40 free parking spaces, drawing pushback from Community Board 12 members. DOT’s Preston Johnson and Shawn Macias stressed the safety benefits, especially daylighting at intersections to improve visibility for pedestrians. The area saw 28 crash injuries, including six cyclists, from 2019 to 2023. Pedestrian islands will shorten crossings from 44 to 25 feet.
