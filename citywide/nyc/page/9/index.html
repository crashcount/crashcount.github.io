They demand an end to criminal summonses for minor violations, defending cyclists and immigrant delivery workers from systemic harm.</p><p class=mb3>On July 24, 2025, Community Board 3 on the Lower East Side passed a resolution opposing the NYPD’s policy of issuing criminal court summonses to e-bike users for minor traffic violations. The board called for an immediate end to the crackdown, stating it unfairly targets cyclists and delivery workers, especially immigrants. The matter, described as condemning 'disproportionate consequences that e-bike users face,' was supported by advocates like Elizabeth Adams and Shawn Garcia. No council bill number is attached, but the resolution adds pressure on city leaders. Analysts note that ending such crackdowns removes barriers to active transportation and avoids criminalizing vulnerable road users, improving safety and equity.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter urges, "the city to redesign Canal Street to be less car-centric after decades of studies and delays." Duggan, joined by advocates and politicians, calls for lane reductions, speed cuts, and pedestrian-first changes. The Department of Transportation faces a 30-day deadline to release plans. The safety analyst notes the event text is too vague for a clear safety impact, as no concrete intervention is described.
