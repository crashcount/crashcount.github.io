Twenty-six crashes in two years. Cyclist Amanda Servedio killed by a fleeing driver. Residents plead for change. NYPD shrugs. No answers. No reform. Streets stay deadly. Accountability missing.</p><p class=mb3>This report details a surge in crashes linked to NYPD high-speed pursuits in Queens’s 114th Precinct. In the last two years, there have been 26 chase-related crashes, compared to 11 in the previous nine years. The increase began after Mayor Adams promoted John Chell to Chief of Patrol and Jeffrey Maddrey to Chief of Department. The mayor claims chases are rare and reserved for violent crime, but the driver who killed cyclist Amanda Servedio was only a suspected burglar. Residents have packed community council meetings since February 2023, demanding an end to these pursuits. Kian Betancourt, a local, told officers, “We are asking you to protect us... and just nothing, I mean, like blank face, absolutely no response whatsoever.” Officers refuse to clarify or change their policy, despite repeated warnings from the community about deadly consequences. No council bill is cited; this is a record of community opposition and official inaction.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states he died at the scene, his body broken as darkness fell.

The report notes the pedestrian was 'crossing, no signal, or crosswalk,' but only after citing driver inattention. No additional victim behaviors are listed as contributing factors.

The project, not tied to a council bill but a DOT action, will install a two-way protected bike path from Quisqueya Plaza to the waterfront, connecting East and West sides. DOT officials described the plan as making the road 'safer for all users than the current unprotected bike lanes, where drivers often intrude and double park.' The redesign removes 40 free parking spaces, drawing pushback from Community Board 12 members. DOT’s Preston Johnson and Shawn Macias stressed the safety benefits, especially daylighting at intersections to improve visibility for pedestrians. The area saw 28 crash injuries, including six cyclists, from 2019 to 2023. Pedestrian islands will shorten crossings from 44 to 25 feet. The changes are set for spring 2025.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states, "A van veered, struck a station wagon. The SUV’s driver, 54, died belted in place. The airbag burst. His body broke inside."

No victim behavior is listed as a contributing factor. The focus remains on the van driver’s unsafe maneuver, which led directly to the fatal outcome.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The article urges Tisch, newly appointed by Mayor Adams, to confront NYPD’s failures on street safety. It highlights rampant illegal parking by officers, blocked bike and bus lanes, and a culture of impunity: 'Department employees will continue to violate the law if they know they can get away with it.' Public Advocate Jumaane Williams and experts like Noah McClain call for strict discipline and real reform. The piece calls for ending 'Self Enforcement Zones,' enforcing Vision Zero, and reviving placard reforms.
