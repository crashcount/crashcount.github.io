Witness Jack Collins said, "He died basically on the spot." The e-bike rider remained at the scene. No arrests were made. The article notes this intersection is known for frequent stop sign violations: "It's not a unicorn incident. It's happened a lot." The piece highlights systemic issues, including delivery app pressures and gaps in e-bike regulation. City data shows e-bikes account for less than 2% of traffic deaths, but the policy debate continues. Lawmakers have called for tighter rules, as delivery workers face incentives to rush.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The impact occurred at the center front end of the e-bike, causing severe head injuries and fatal bleeding to the pedestrian. The police report describes the victim as 'crossing, no signal, or crosswalk' and 'not at intersection,' but the primary focus remains on the unlicensed status of the e-bike operator and the disregard for traffic control.

The street stayed deadly.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News reported on February 27, 2025, that off-duty FDNY firefighter Michael Pena, 28, killed 23-year-old Justin Diaz in Queens. Prosecutors said Pena was drunk, high on cocaine and marijuana, and driving 83 mph in a 25 mph zone when he ran a red light and struck Diaz’s BMW. Surveillance footage showed the Mercedes 'barreled through an East Elmhurst intersection' at 4:15 a.m. Diaz, headed to work at LaGuardia, died at the scene. Pena refused a breath test; a blood draw later confirmed drug use. He was charged with vehicular manslaughter, DWI, and refusal to submit to testing, but posted $50,000 bail. The article highlights family grief and outrage at bail laws, quoting Diaz’s brother: 'Pena will walk the streets for a $50,000 bail... Justin will never walk the streets again.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, a BMW sedan 'ran the red,' disregarding traffic control. The report lists 'Alcohol Involvement' and 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as contributing factors. The BMW was struck head-on by a Mercedes sedan traveling straight. The 23-year-old BMW driver, unbelted and alone, was killed behind the wheel. The impact was severe enough that a parked Toyota SUV was also damaged. The police narrative describes the aftermath: 'Metal screamed. A parked Toyota caught the edge. The street fell silent.' The report does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor. The crash underscores the deadly consequences of driver actions—specifically, running a red light and alcohol involvement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
