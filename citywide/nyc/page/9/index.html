Over 52,000 were hurt. Seven hundred sixty-six suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same again. These are not numbers. They are fathers, daughters, neighbors, friends.</p><p>Just last week, a 55-year-old woman riding her bike in Queens was killed by an SUV making a left turn. She was ejected from her bike and died in the street. On the same day, a 23-year-old man was struck and killed by a speeding sedan in Ozone Park. The car came fast. The street was slick.

In Washington Heights, after a hit-and-run left a cyclist sprawled on the pavement, a resident <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said, &ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time.&rdquo;</a> Another pleaded, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>&ldquo;I really want there to be speed humps because it&rsquo;s just terrifying.&rdquo;</a></p><p>In Queens, two NYPD cruisers collided while racing to a call. Four officers went to the hospital.

It does not always use it.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The Council can lower the speed limit to 20 mph citywide. They have not. Speed cameras now run 24/7, but the most reckless drivers still roam free. A handful of bills wait for action. Each day of delay is another day of loss.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand the Stop Super Speeders Act.

Metal screamed. The front passenger, a 26-year-old woman, died in her seat. Head wounds ended everything. She never saw it coming. The driver had no license.</p><p class=mb3>A deadly crash unfolded on Van Sinderen Avenue near Blake Avenue in Brooklyn when, according to the police report, a sedan traveling at 'unsafe speed' collided with a bus and then struck a parked box truck. The report states the sedan's front passenger, a 26-year-old woman, suffered fatal head injuries and died at the scene. The sedan's driver was unlicensed, as documented in the official vehicle records. The police report attributes the primary contributing factor to 'Unsafe Speed.' The narrative describes the sedan as 'slammed into a bus, then a parked box truck,' underscoring the violent sequence. No contributing factors related to the victim's behavior are cited in the report.

The narrative describes a scene where 'a taxi's side [was] torn open' and 'a Ford SUV's front [was] crushed,' both vehicles traveling south. The report states the pedestrian was 'outside the crosswalk' and engaged in 'other actions in roadway,' but does not list any pedestrian behavior as a contributing factor. Both vehicle drivers were licensed and headed straight, with the taxi sustaining damage to its left side and the SUV to its center front end. According to the police report, contributing factors are 'unspecified.' The focus remains on the lethal interaction between two large vehicles and a vulnerable pedestrian, with no evidence cited of pedestrian error.
