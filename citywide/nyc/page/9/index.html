Seven hundred thirty-four suffered wounds so grave they will never be the same. The dead are not numbers. A 76-year-old woman, struck by an SUV while crossing White Plains Road. A 32-year-old woman, crushed by a Jeep on Marcus Garvey Boulevard. A 79-year-old man, found dead in a parked car on West 77th.

The report states: 'A sedan ran the light. Steel screamed.' The 27-year-old female front-seat passenger, who was wearing a seatbelt and protected by an airbag, suffered fatal injuries to her entire body.

The letter, titled 'It’s Time to Unite to Solve America’s Roadway Crisis,' highlights the deadly toll: nearly 41,000 killed in 2023, with pedestrian and cyclist deaths at record highs. The coalition urges lawmakers to honor victims and act on World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims. They demand proven solutions: sidewalks, protected bike lanes, medians, and islands; passage of the Sarah Langenkamp Active Transportation Safety Act; expanded vehicle safety tech; local control of speed limits; and stronger post-crash care. The letter states, 'Most solutions require no new federal funding and are proven to reduce deaths.' No council members are named—this is a united call from advocacy groups.

The event marked the completion of protected bike lanes along nearly the entire corridor, except for one block. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "Several elements of this redesign aim at enhancing safety for all road users: Curbside bike lanes to enhance cyclist safety, pedestrian islands to shorten crossing distances while encouraging slower, safe turns, and additional adjustments to traffic signal timing to allow more time for pedestrians to cross before the lights turn green." The project, begun in 2015 under Mayor Bill de Blasio, faced local opposition and political delays but persisted. The city reports a 68 percent drop in traffic fatalities and a 35 percent reduction in pedestrian injuries since the redesign began. Cyclist numbers surged by 450 percent. DOT plans to upgrade bike lanes with concrete, but mountable curbs could leave lanes exposed to cars. Families for Safe Streets activist Lizi Rahman called the redesign a model for dangerous roads everywhere.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The street has only a painted bike lane, lacking physical protection. The driver, responding to an emergency, remained at the scene. Hidalgo is survived by his wife and son. His aunt, Tomasa Hidalgo, said, "The streets are not safe. The drivers don't respect the lives of the cyclists." Ligia Guallpa of the Worker's Justice Project called on the city and app delivery companies to do more, urging investment in infrastructure, regulatory frameworks, and worker protections. This marks the 22nd cyclist death and adds to a rising toll of vulnerable road users in 2024.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city needs real, lasting protection for its youngest.</p><p class=mb3>On October 31, 2024, the Department of Transportation’s Trick-or-Streets program closed select road segments to cars, aiming to protect children on Halloween. The agency called it 'an added safety benefit on a night when more children [are] expected out on our streets.' But the measure is fleeting. Streetsblog’s op-ed slams the city for failing to protect kids year-round. Since 2014, drivers have killed 116 children—an average of 12 per year. Tens of thousands more have been injured. The piece urges permanent pedestrianization, especially near schools, where crash rates spike during drop-off. Paris has closed over 200 school streets since 2000. New York lags behind. The op-ed calls Trick-or-Streets a welcome but insufficient step, demanding the city stop treating child deaths as the price of car convenience.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
