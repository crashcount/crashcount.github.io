A 21-year-old, unlicensed driver in a Nissan Rogue struck him and fled. The cyclist hit the pavement, head first. Paramedics found him unconscious, his red light still flashing in the street. Police arrested the driver two hours later. He faces charges for leaving the scene and driving without a license. <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/driver-arrested-after-collision-with-e-biker-on-second-ave-XF4896347>The biker was rushed by EMS to Bellevue Hospital in critical condition.</a></p><p>On the FDR Drive, a bus and a car collided.

They renewed speed cameras in school zones. They passed Sammy’s Law, giving the city power to lower speed limits. But the default speed limit remains above 20 mph. The city sprinkles 20 mph zones, but the carnage continues. The most dangerous drivers—those with dozens of camera tickets—still roam free. The law to stop them sits in Albany.</p><h3 id=what-next-the-cost-of-waiting>What Next: The Cost of Waiting</h3><p>Every day, another family joins the list. The city has the tools. It needs the will.
