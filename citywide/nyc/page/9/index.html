In the last twelve months, <strong>285 people died</strong> on New York City streets. <strong>767 suffered serious injuries</strong>. The names fade, but the numbers do not. Just last week, a woman in Morris Heights was killed by a driver who struck her and fled. Police <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/woman-killed-in-bronx-hit-and-run/>reported</a> her death. Her family waits for answers. The driver is gone.</p><p>On July 19, a stolen car tore through Chinatown at over 100 miles per hour. It killed Kevin Cruickshank and May Kwok. Kwok was sitting on a bench. Cruickshank was riding his bike. The city’s Department of Transportation promised upgrades, but the dead do not return. NY1 <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/07/chinatown-deadly-crash-safety-upgrades-canal-street>reported</a> that &ldquo;a stolen vehicle, allegedly driven at more than 100 miles per hour&mldr;crashed into them.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=patterns-in-the-blood>Patterns in the Blood</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the highest price.</strong> In three and a half years, cars and SUVs killed <strong>328</strong> and seriously injured <strong>549</strong>. Trucks and buses killed <strong>99</strong>. Motorcycles and mopeds, <strong>11</strong>. Bikes, <strong>11</strong>. The city’s most vulnerable are left to cross streets built for speed, not safety.</p><p>Drivers flee. They run red lights. They turn without looking. The city counts the bodies. The numbers do not lie. The pain is not abstract. It is a mother’s phone that will never ring. It is a bench left empty.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city has taken steps. Speed cameras in school zones will stay on through 2030. The Council legalized jaywalking, ending a law that punished the poor and people of color. But the default speed limit is still 25 mph. The city has the power to lower it to 20 mph. It has not used it. The dead keep coming.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit citywide.</strong> Demand action against repeat speeders. Join the fight with Transportation Alternatives and Families for Safe Streets. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The city will not save itself.</p><p><strong>The blood on the street is not an accident.

A dump truck’s left turn ended his life as he crossed with the signal. The street held him, still and broken, beneath the right bumper’s crush.</p><p class=mb3>At the corner of Woodpoint Road and Withers Street in Brooklyn, a dump truck making a left turn struck and killed a baby boy who was crossing the intersection with the signal. According to the police report, 'a dump truck turned left. Its right bumper struck a baby boy crossing with the signal. He died there, crushed beneath steel and weight.' The report states the point of impact was the right front bumper of the truck. The child, a pedestrian, suffered fatal crush injuries to his entire body. The police narrative explicitly notes the victim was 'crossing with the signal.' The driver’s actions—executing a left turn in a large vehicle—placed the most vulnerable road user in mortal danger. The report lists 'Unspecified' as the contributing factor for both the driver and the victim, but the sequence of events centers the dump truck’s left turn and the resulting impact.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
