According to the police report, the crash occurred just after midnight, and the street was dark. The report states the driver was inattentive or distracted at the time of the collision. The impact was so forceful that parked cars were damaged. The pedestrian was not in a crosswalk when struck, but the police report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor. The driver’s permit status is noted in the narrative, underscoring a lack of full licensure. The report does not cite any pedestrian actions as contributing factors. The focus remains on the driver’s distraction and permit status, which led to fatal consequences for the man in the roadway.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The report states, "A van veered, struck a station wagon. The SUV’s driver, 54, died belted in place. The airbag burst. His body broke inside."

The pedestrian was found in the roadway with fatal head trauma and crush injuries. The report notes, 'No skid marks. No damage to the truck.' The police narrative describes the aftermath: 'Only silence where a life had been.' The vehicle, a 2020 INTL-TRUCK/BUS registered in Indiana, showed no visible damage. The driver was licensed in Pennsylvania. The report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified' for both the driver and the pedestrian. The police report does not cite any pedestrian actions as contributing to the crash. The absence of skid marks and damage underscores the brutal efficiency of the impact. The systemic danger remains: a human body, no match for a truck rolling through city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The letter, titled 'It’s Time to Unite to Solve America’s Roadway Crisis,' highlights the deadly toll: nearly 41,000 killed in 2023, with pedestrian and cyclist deaths at record highs. The coalition urges lawmakers to honor victims and act on World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims. They demand proven solutions: sidewalks, protected bike lanes, medians, and islands; passage of the Sarah Langenkamp Active Transportation Safety Act; expanded vehicle safety tech; local control of speed limits; and stronger post-crash care. The letter states, 'Most solutions require no new federal funding and are proven to reduce deaths.' No council members are named—this is a united call from advocacy groups. The coalition stresses that the Safe System approach and active transportation infrastructure are essential to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The victim died beneath the vehicle’s left front bumper, his head crushed on the pavement. The report notes the absence of a crosswalk at the location. The narrative states, 'No crosswalk. No answers. Just blood on the asphalt and silence in the dark.' The SUV, a 2011 Acura, was traveling straight ahead when the collision occurred. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified' for both the driver and the pedestrian. The victim was not at an intersection and was engaged in 'Other Actions in Roadway' at the time of the crash. The report does not cite any specific driver error, but the impact location and fatal outcome underscore the lethal consequences of vehicle-pedestrian collisions on high-speed roadways.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the truck’s left front bumper hit her head, rendering her unconscious. She suffered internal injuries and died at the scene. The report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor, highlighting the driver’s failure to observe the pedestrian in the crosswalk. The woman was crossing with no signal present, as noted in the report, but the primary fault cited is driver inattention. The collision occurred in broad daylight, and the pickup showed no damage.

Pedestrian injuries dropped 35 percent. Traffic deaths fell 68 percent. Cyclists fill the lanes. Concrete upgrades loom, but mountable curbs may let cars intrude.</p><p class=mb3>On November 13, 2024, the Department of Transportation celebrated a decade of safety improvements on Queens Boulevard. The event marked the completion of protected bike lanes along nearly the entire corridor, except for one block. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "Several elements of this redesign aim at enhancing safety for all road users: Curbside bike lanes to enhance cyclist safety, pedestrian islands to shorten crossing distances while encouraging slower, safe turns, and additional adjustments to traffic signal timing to allow more time for pedestrians to cross before the lights turn green." The project, begun in 2015 under Mayor Bill de Blasio, faced local opposition and political delays but persisted. The city reports a 68 percent drop in traffic fatalities and a 35 percent reduction in pedestrian injuries since the redesign began. Cyclist numbers surged by 450 percent. DOT plans to upgrade bike lanes with concrete, but mountable curbs could leave lanes exposed to cars. Families for Safe Streets activist Lizi Rahman called the redesign a model for dangerous roads everywhere.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states she was 'crossing with the light' in the crosswalk when a Ford SUV, making a left turn, struck her with its left front bumper. She suffered fatal injuries to her lower leg and died at the scene. The police report lists 'Outside Car Distraction' and 'Reaction to Uninvolved Vehicle' as contributing factors on the part of the driver. The victim’s actions—crossing with the signal—are noted, but the crash was precipitated by the driver’s failure to yield and inattention. The system allowed an ordinary turn to become deadly.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
