The case, described as a 'Judicial ruling on NYC bike lane removal,' reversed a lower court decision. Transportation Alternatives and Brooklyn resident Baruch Herzfeld appealed to protect the lanes. Ben Furnas, executive director of Transportation Alternatives, called the project 'central Brooklyn's only protected bike lane.' This legal action preserves safe infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians, supporting mode shift and reducing risk for vulnerable road users while the legal fight continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The action followed an appeal by Transportation Alternatives and Baruch Herzfeld after a lower court sided with Mayor Eric Adams’s plan to swap the protected lane for a painted one. The matter, described as 'removal or modification of the parking-protected bicycle lane,' drew sharp criticism from advocates. Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives called the lane 'a critical safety project.' The court’s move preserves safe infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians, supporting mode shift and reducing risk for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists, kids, and bystanders paid. Streets turned chaotic. Policy ignored. Trust shattered. Vulnerable road users left exposed.</p><p class=mb3>On July 16, 2025, former NYPD Commissioner Tom Donlon filed a civil racketeering suit, alleging 'deadly and unconstitutional high-speed vehicle chases' under Mayor Adams. The complaint, reported by Streetsblog NYC, claims the NYPD's Community Response Team operated as a rogue unit, answerable only to City Hall, with Deputy Mayor Kaz Daughtry allowing reckless pursuits. Donlon cites deaths and injuries, including cyclist Amanda Servedio. The suit alleges 398 crashes and 315 injuries in 2024—a 47% jump. Donlon's allegations highlight how high-speed chases increase risk to pedestrians and cyclists, introducing unpredictable, dangerous driving and eroding public trust in safe, equitable enforcement. No council bill or committee action is tied to this event.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The case, covered by Sophia Lebowitz for Streetsblog NYC, centers on the city’s push to downgrade the lane after pressure from local groups. The matter summary reads: "Judge Ventura’s order prohibits the city from removing or modifying the parking-protected bicycle lane on Bedford Avenue." Council Members Chi Ossé and Lincoln Restler support the lane. Safety analysts warn: demolishing bike lanes strips cyclists of dedicated space, exposes them to traffic, and discourages active travel, undermining street safety for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No council bill number or committee is attached. The matter, reported by Sophia Lebowitz, states: 'Brooklyn cyclists have pledged to sue the city if they are killed or injured on Bedford Avenue after Mayor Adams removes three blocks of protected bike lanes.' Over 200 signed the pledge. Transportation Alternatives and lawyer Peter Beadle cite DOT data showing a 47% drop in injury crashes after the lane was installed. The city, despite proof of safety, moves to remove protection.

Streetsblog quotes Ben Furnas: 'The Adams administration is going to have to spend their night preparing their legal case, not ripping out a critical safety project.'
