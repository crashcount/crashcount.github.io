She struck a man on a bike and a woman sitting on a bench. Both died instantly. Prosecutors said the driver and her passenger tried to run after the crash. Police found alcohol and guns in the car. The judge called it murder. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/06/women-accused-in-horrific-chinatown-crash-that-claimed-two-lives-plead-not-guilty/>Kwok and Cruickshank’s internal and external injuries were described as devastating in court records.

Police said he was drunk. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/6-people-injured-5-car-crash-rfk-bridge/17450795/>Police say an erratic driver was taken into custody after the spectacular collision that closed the Queens-bound RFK Triborough Bridge for hours.</a></p><p>A 13-year-old on a moped collided with a bus in Staten Island.

In the last year alone, <strong>285 people died</strong>. <strong>Children, cyclists, and pedestrians keep paying the price.</strong></p><p>Cars and SUVs are the main killers. In three years, they took <strong>328 lives</strong> and left thousands more broken. Trucks and buses killed <strong>99</strong>. Motorcycles and mopeds, <strong>11</strong>. Bikes, <strong>11</strong>. The numbers do not stop. The grief does not fade.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Some leaders have moved. The city legalized jaywalking, ending a law that punished the poor and people of color. The state renewed speed cameras near schools. But the city still drags its feet on lowering speed limits. The law is there. The will is not.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand the Stop Super Speeders Act.</strong></p><p>Every day of delay means another family shattered. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice. <strong>Act now.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The impact left the sedan demolished. A baby girl, listed as an occupant, was ejected from the vehicle and died on impact, her injuries described as affecting her 'entire body.' The police report explicitly cites 'Unsafe Speed' as the primary contributing factor. No seatbelt was used, as noted in the report. The narrative describes the scene as the Tesla 'slammed at speed,' resulting in the infant's death.

The car struck a guardrail, flipped, and caught fire. Both occupants were ejected. The article states, 'A female driver was killed and her passenger seriously injured after they were tossed from a Tesla that flipped and then burst into flames.' The driver died at the scene; the passenger was hospitalized in stable condition. Photos showed 'large pieces of the vehicle scattered across the road.' Police have not determined if speed was a factor and continue to investigate. The crash closed all northbound lanes for several miles as fire crews responded. The incident highlights the violent consequences of high-speed impacts and the dangers posed by vehicle ejection and fire.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
