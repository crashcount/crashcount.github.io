Seven hundred thirty-four suffered wounds so grave they will never be the same. The dead are not numbers. A 76-year-old woman, struck by an SUV while crossing White Plains Road. A 32-year-old woman, crushed by a Jeep on Marcus Garvey Boulevard. A 79-year-old man, found dead in a parked car on West 77th.

But the law that keeps speed cameras running is set to expire. If Albany fails, the cameras go dark. Streets go back to the way they were—fast, brutal, and unforgiving. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez warns, &ldquo;an extremely reckless few continue to endanger themselves and everyone around them.&rdquo; <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/nyc-dot-calls-speed-camera-program-renewal-new-speeding-bill>Patch</a></p><p>There is talk of a new law for &ldquo;super speeders.&rdquo; There is talk of lowering the speed limit to 20 mph. There is always talk. But families keep burying their dead.</p><h3 id=the-system-fails-the-vulnerable>The System Fails the Vulnerable</h3><p><strong>The city cracks down on cyclists and e-bike riders, not the drivers who do the killing.</strong> Community boards call it out. &ldquo;Holding cyclists to a far higher standard than motor vehicle drivers is unjust, puts immigrant workers at grave risk, and sends the wrong message about the actual danger on our streets,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/cart-before-horse-upper-west-siders-demand-nypd-halt-bike-crackdown>said Manhattan Community Board 7</a>.

The study analyzed 558 illegal parking complaints submitted to 311 over five days, using AI and city traffic cameras. The matter title states: 'A study of NYPD responses to 311 complaints found "inconsistent, and in some cases non-existent" enforcement of safety-related parking rules.' NYPD issued tickets in only 2.87% of cases, often closing complaints in under nine minutes—faster than responses to critical crimes. The report documents police dismissing complaints without proper checks and even harassing complainants. Arnav and Ensari found that at the 21 locations studied, there were two deaths, 257 injuries, and 2,319 crashes since 2014.

The report states the SUV's left front bumper hit the girl's head as she crossed the street. The incident occurred at 13:49, and the girl died at the scene. The police narrative specifies she 'stepped into the street without a signal.' The contributing factor listed in the report is 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion.'

The incident follows a rise in police chases since Mayor Adams took office. The black Dodge Ram involved had 80 camera-issued speeding or red-light tickets since mid-2022, but the owner never faced a mandated safety course because the city’s program expired and was not renewed. Residents and advocates, including Chong Bretillon and Elizabeth Adams, condemned the NYPD’s pursuit tactics. Bretillon demanded accountability from the 114th Precinct, calling the chase 'completely unacceptable.' Adams stated, 'It’s time for the city to ban police chases in writing and in practice.' Calls for a ban on police chases and renewal of the DOT safety course program have intensified as the death toll mounts.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The impact shattered her pelvis, causing fatal crush injuries. The report states the victim 'died on the pavement.' The SUV showed no damage. Critically, the police report notes the driver was unlicensed at the time of the crash. No license, no right to drive, yet the vehicle continued straight ahead, ending a life. The report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified,' but the narrative centers the unlicensed driver as a key element. No mention is made of any victim behavior contributing to the crash. The system allowed a driver with no license to operate a powerful vehicle, with deadly results.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
