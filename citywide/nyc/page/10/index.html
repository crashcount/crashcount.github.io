They highlight the false belief that Orthodox Jews do not bike, noting heavy use of Citi Bike stations and electric cargo bikes in these communities. The piece urges the city to connect bike lanes through all neighborhoods, not just some. No council bill number or committee is attached, but the op-ed stands as a direct challenge to current DOT policy. The authors demand safe infrastructure for all, especially vulnerable road users—children, elders, and delivery workers—who face daily risk on streets built for cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Five years after reform, chaos rules. Only one waste zone runs. No citywide plan. Streets stay dangerous. Lawmakers and survivors demand action. The city stalls. Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>The 2019 commercial waste zone reform aimed to cut truck carnage by dividing New York City into 20 zones, each served by specific haulers. As of October 30, 2024, only one zone is active. No timeline exists for citywide rollout. The Department of Sanitation claims caution is needed to avoid price hikes and ensure effective change, but offers no clear metrics or deadlines. Lauren Pine, a crash survivor, pleads, 'We can't wait another day to enforce truck safety requirements.' Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso warns, 'The city's goal right now should be to prevent bad implementation from undermining a good bill.' Delays keep streets deadly for workers, pedestrians, and cyclists. The law’s promise remains unfulfilled. Vulnerable New Yorkers remain at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the victim was not at an intersection but performing work in the street when he was struck and crushed. The report details that a box truck, a pickup truck, a flatbed, and an SUV were involved, with vehicles traveling both east and west. The narrative states the man was 'crushed and killed beneath steel and rubber,' and that 'a box truck, a pickup, and two others passed through.' The police report lists the contributing factor as 'Unspecified' for the drivers involved. No driver errors are explicitly cited in the report, but the involvement of multiple large vehicles and the presence of a worker in the roadway underscore the systemic dangers faced by those laboring in active traffic lanes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Cameras catch cars blocking lanes while cops claim the problem is fixed. Streets stay dangerous. Delivery trucks turn bike lanes into parking lots. The system fails vulnerable people.</p><p class=mb3>On October 29, 2024, researchers Benjamin Arnav and Elif Ensari released a report exposing NYPD’s 'systemic failure' to enforce safety-related parking violations. The study analyzed 558 illegal parking complaints submitted to 311 over five days, using AI and city traffic cameras. The matter title states: 'A study of NYPD responses to 311 complaints found "inconsistent, and in some cases non-existent" enforcement of safety-related parking rules.' NYPD issued tickets in only 2.87% of cases, often closing complaints in under nine minutes—faster than responses to critical crimes. The report documents police dismissing complaints without proper checks and even harassing complainants. Arnav and Ensari found that at the 21 locations studied, there were two deaths, 257 injuries, and 2,319 crashes since 2014. The findings echo past investigations and highlight a city government at odds with itself: one agency builds safe streets, another lets cars block them.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
