The report states the sedan's front passenger, a 26-year-old woman, suffered fatal head injuries and died at the scene. The sedan's driver was unlicensed, as documented in the official vehicle records. The police report attributes the primary contributing factor to 'Unsafe Speed.' The narrative describes the sedan as 'slammed into a bus, then a parked box truck,' underscoring the violent sequence. No contributing factors related to the victim's behavior are cited in the report. The focus remains on the unlicensed driver’s excessive speed and the systemic danger posed by unqualified motorists operating vehicles on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Prosecutors said Pena was drunk, high on cocaine and marijuana, and driving 83 mph in a 25 mph zone when he ran a red light and struck Diaz’s BMW. Surveillance footage showed the Mercedes 'barreled through an East Elmhurst intersection' at 4:15 a.m. Diaz, headed to work at LaGuardia, died at the scene. Pena refused a breath test; a blood draw later confirmed drug use. He was charged with vehicular manslaughter, DWI, and refusal to submit to testing, but posted $50,000 bail. The article highlights family grief and outrage at bail laws, quoting Diaz’s brother: 'Pena will walk the streets for a $50,000 bail...

Cold air hung over the still street.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a box truck parked near 851 Avenue of the Americas suddenly lurched north and struck a 33-year-old man who was behind the wheel of another vehicle. The man, identified as the driver and sole occupant, wore a lap belt and harness but was pronounced dead at the scene. The crash occurred at 8:10 a.m. The report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor, highlighting a critical lapse in driver vigilance. The truck, registered in Ohio and operated by a licensed driver from Louisiana, was supposed to be stationary but instead moved forward, causing fatal impact. No contributing factors related to the victim's behavior are cited in the report. The crash underscores the lethal consequences of driver distraction and the dangers posed by large vehicles left unattended on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
