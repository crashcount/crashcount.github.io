A 21-year-old, unlicensed driver in a Nissan Rogue struck him and fled. The cyclist hit the pavement, head first. Paramedics found him unconscious, his red light still flashing in the street. Police arrested the driver two hours later. He faces charges for leaving the scene and driving without a license. <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/driver-arrested-after-collision-with-e-biker-on-second-ave-XF4896347>The biker was rushed by EMS to Bellevue Hospital in critical condition.</a></p><p>On the FDR Drive, a bus and a car collided. Traffic stopped. Riders waited for another bus. One person was hurt.

They are families, emptied out by a knock at the door.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>City leaders have taken steps. They renewed speed cameras in school zones. They passed Sammy’s Law, giving the city power to lower speed limits. But the default speed limit remains above 20 mph. The city sprinkles 20 mph zones, but the carnage continues. The most dangerous drivers—those with dozens of camera tickets—still roam free. The law to stop them sits in Albany.</p><h3 id=what-next-the-cost-of-waiting>What Next: The Cost of Waiting</h3><p>Every day, another family joins the list. The city has the tools. It needs the will.

NYPD said the driver experienced a medical episode before jumping the curb and 'plowed into a crowd.' Four people, including a 9-year-old boy and two women, were hospitalized with injuries; all were in stable condition. The driver remained at the scene and was also hospitalized. Police did not suspect criminality and declined to specify the medical issue, citing confidentiality. Four additional people refused medical attention.

The report states, 'A man lay in the road. Three cars struck. His chest crushed. He died there.' Another 56-year-old man, driving one of the vehicles, was injured and pinned, suffering chest injuries described as 'crush injuries.' The police report lists 'Following Too Closely' and 'Reaction to Uninvolved Vehicle' as contributing factors, along with 'Pavement Slippery.' These driver errors—specifically following too closely—are cited as direct contributors to the crash. The narrative highlights the systemic danger posed by multiple vehicles traveling straight ahead on a slick roadway, with no mention of pedestrian error as a contributing factor. The deadly sequence unfolded on a rain-slicked expressway, where human error and hazardous conditions combined with fatal results.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
