The city moves on.</p><p class=mb3>According to NY Daily News (published February 25, 2025), 17-year-old Juan Alexander Quizhpi Naranjo died after his dirt bike collided with a Honda Odyssey minivan at Metcalf Ave and E. 172nd St. in the Bronx. The crash happened around 6:45 p.m., with both Naranjo and his 14-year-old passenger thrown from the bike. The girl is expected to recover. The article notes, 'The 42-year-old man driving the Honda Odyssey remained at the scene. No charges were immediately filed as police continued to investigate.' The report highlights the ongoing investigation and the lack of immediate charges, pointing to systemic risks at the intersection.

Metal screamed. A baby girl, unbelted, was thrown from the car and killed. The sedan crumpled. The road bore witness. No warning, no mercy, only silence and wreckage.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a Tesla sedan traveling north on FDR Drive crashed at 2:44 a.m. The report states the vehicle was moving at 'unsafe speed.' The impact left the sedan demolished. A baby girl, listed as an occupant, was ejected from the vehicle and died on impact, her injuries described as affecting her 'entire body.' The police report explicitly cites 'Unsafe Speed' as the primary contributing factor. No seatbelt was used, as noted in the report. The narrative describes the scene as the Tesla 'slammed at speed,' resulting in the infant's death. The focus remains on the excessive speed and the catastrophic consequences that followed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The car struck a guardrail, flipped, and caught fire. Both occupants were ejected. The article states, 'A female driver was killed and her passenger seriously injured after they were tossed from a Tesla that flipped and then burst into flames.' The driver died at the scene; the passenger was hospitalized in stable condition. Photos showed 'large pieces of the vehicle scattered across the road.' Police have not determined if speed was a factor and continue to investigate. The crash closed all northbound lanes for several miles as fire crews responded. The incident highlights the violent consequences of high-speed impacts and the dangers posed by vehicle ejection and fire.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
