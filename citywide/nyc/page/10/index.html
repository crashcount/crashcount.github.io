Neither does the violence on its streets. In the last twelve months, <strong>246 people died</strong> in crashes. <strong>715 were left with serious injuries</strong>. The numbers are cold. The pain is not. A cyclist is struck in Queens. A teenager dies on a Brooklyn street. A pedestrian is killed crossing Harlem River Drive. The city moves on.

Twenty-four people over 75 did not make it home. The city’s most vulnerable—walkers, riders, children—are left to fend for themselves. Cars and trucks do the most harm. In three years, they killed <strong>299 people</strong> and left thousands more injured. Motorcycles and mopeds killed 10. Bikes killed 11. The street is a gauntlet. The odds are not in your favor.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-doand-dont>What Leaders Do—And Don’t</h2><p>The city talks of Vision Zero.

The DOT promises new barriers, new designs, new hope. But the work is slow. Protected bike lanes are ripped out in Williamsburg. Cyclists are left with nothing but fear. “I don’t think he cares if we die,” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/cyclists-fuming-over-mayor-adamss-removal-of-bedford-avenue-protected-bike-lane>said Jeanette Samyn</a>.</p><p>Some leaders push for change.

The event marked the completion of protected bike lanes along nearly the entire corridor, except for one block. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "Several elements of this redesign aim at enhancing safety for all road users: Curbside bike lanes to enhance cyclist safety, pedestrian islands to shorten crossing distances while encouraging slower, safe turns, and additional adjustments to traffic signal timing to allow more time for pedestrians to cross before the lights turn green." The project, begun in 2015 under Mayor Bill de Blasio, faced local opposition and political delays but persisted. The city reports a 68 percent drop in traffic fatalities and a 35 percent reduction in pedestrian injuries since the redesign began. Cyclist numbers surged by 450 percent. DOT plans to upgrade bike lanes with concrete, but mountable curbs could leave lanes exposed to cars. Families for Safe Streets activist Lizi Rahman called the redesign a model for dangerous roads everywhere.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident, reported by Streetsblog NYC, highlights a dangerous intersection: wide, two-way, with cars parked to the corner and no daylighting. Transportation Alternatives, represented by Philip Miatkowski, condemned the city for failing to deliver promised safety upgrades, stating, "This intersection was designed to be dangerous." Niyell is the 15th child killed by drivers this year, the second-highest toll since Vision Zero began. Advocates demand urgent action to protect vulnerable pedestrians and end the city's deadly neglect.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The street has only a painted bike lane, lacking physical protection. The driver, responding to an emergency, remained at the scene. Hidalgo is survived by his wife and son. His aunt, Tomasa Hidalgo, said, "The streets are not safe. The drivers don't respect the lives of the cyclists." Ligia Guallpa of the Worker's Justice Project called on the city and app delivery companies to do more, urging investment in infrastructure, regulatory frameworks, and worker protections. This marks the 22nd cyclist death and adds to a rising toll of vulnerable road users in 2024.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city needs real, lasting protection for its youngest.</p><p class=mb3>On October 31, 2024, the Department of Transportation’s Trick-or-Streets program closed select road segments to cars, aiming to protect children on Halloween. The agency called it 'an added safety benefit on a night when more children [are] expected out on our streets.' But the measure is fleeting. Streetsblog’s op-ed slams the city for failing to protect kids year-round. Since 2014, drivers have killed 116 children—an average of 12 per year. Tens of thousands more have been injured. The piece urges permanent pedestrianization, especially near schools, where crash rates spike during drop-off. Paris has closed over 200 school streets since 2000. New York lags behind. The op-ed calls Trick-or-Streets a welcome but insufficient step, demanding the city stop treating child deaths as the price of car convenience.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
