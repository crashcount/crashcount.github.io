The report states the Mercedes 'crushed the rear' of the Ford, leaving the victim dead at the wheel with injuries to his entire body. Police list 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor in the collision. The Ford was hit in the right rear bumper by the Mercedes’s left front bumper, consistent with a rear-end impact. The victim was unbelted, but the police report does not cite this as a contributing factor. The crash underscores the deadly consequences of driver distraction, as documented in the official report.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
