Real safety demands fewer car lanes, center bus lanes, and true bike barriers.</p><p class=mb3>This opinion piece, published April 26, 2022, calls out the Department of Transportation’s plan for Queens Boulevard. The plan, part of the 'Great Streets' project, keeps eight car lanes and installs only lightly protected bike lanes with mountable curbs. Samuel Santaella, the author, writes: 'the department has discriminated against thousands of bikers and 13,630 pre-pandemic daily bus riders in order to privilege the needs of 40,000 daily motorists.' Santaella opposes the current DOT plan and urges a redesign: reduce car lanes to four, add center-running bus lanes, fully separated bikeways, and wider sidewalks. He warns that mountable curbs let drivers invade bike lanes, putting cyclists at risk. Bus riders see little benefit, still stuck behind double-parked cars. The piece demands the city stop favoring drivers and start protecting vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Injury crashes fell 37 percent; overall crashes dropped 17 percent. Drivers yielded to pedestrians 27 percent more often. Despite these results, the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices may ban asphalt art, citing concerns about autonomous vehicles and accessibility for low-vision pedestrians.

Fifty-nine killed in three months. Pedestrians, children, seniors hit hardest. Queens and Manhattan saw the worst spikes. Advocates demand urgent action—redesign streets, expand cameras, fund safety. City leaders stall. Streets remain lethal.</p><p class=mb3>This report, published April 20, 2022, highlights a grim milestone: the first quarter of 2022 marked the deadliest start to any year since Vision Zero began in 2014. Transportation Alternatives found 59 people killed in traffic crashes in just three months, a 44 percent jump from last year. The report states, 'Traffic fatalities are up 44 percent so far this year—the deadliest start to any year since Vision Zero launched.' Danny Harris, executive director of Transportation Alternatives, called on Mayor Adams to include the City Council’s $3.1 billion Streets Master Plan request and to fast-track redesigns of 1,000 intersections. Elke Weiss of Families for Safe Streets urged passage of the Crash Victim Rights and Safety Act, saying, 'Crossing the street should not be a life-or-death risk.' The report urges more car-free space, stronger driver accountability, and expanded speed and red-light camera programs. Despite Vision Zero’s promise, the city’s streets remain deadly for its most vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
