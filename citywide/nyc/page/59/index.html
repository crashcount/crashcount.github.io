The city’s plan keeps eight car lanes, weak bike protection, and slow buses. Cyclists dodge cars. Bus riders wait. Drivers rule. Real safety demands fewer car lanes, center bus lanes, and true bike barriers.</p><p class=mb3>This opinion piece, published April 26, 2022, calls out the Department of Transportation’s plan for Queens Boulevard. The plan, part of the 'Great Streets' project, keeps eight car lanes and installs only lightly protected bike lanes with mountable curbs. Samuel Santaella, the author, writes: 'the department has discriminated against thousands of bikers and 13,630 pre-pandemic daily bus riders in order to privilege the needs of 40,000 daily motorists.' Santaella opposes the current DOT plan and urges a redesign: reduce car lanes to four, add center-running bus lanes, fully separated bikeways, and wider sidewalks. He warns that mountable curbs let drivers invade bike lanes, putting cyclists at risk. Bus riders see little benefit, still stuck behind double-parked cars. The piece demands the city stop favoring drivers and start protecting vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Injury crashes fell 37 percent; overall crashes dropped 17 percent. Drivers yielded to pedestrians 27 percent more often. Despite these results, the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices may ban asphalt art, citing concerns about autonomous vehicles and accessibility for low-vision pedestrians.

The report states, 'Traffic fatalities are up 44 percent so far this year—the deadliest start to any year since Vision Zero launched.' Danny Harris, executive director of Transportation Alternatives, called on Mayor Adams to include the City Council’s $3.1 billion Streets Master Plan request and to fast-track redesigns of 1,000 intersections. Elke Weiss of Families for Safe Streets urged passage of the Crash Victim Rights and Safety Act, saying, 'Crossing the street should not be a life-or-death risk.'

Four lanes for bikes. Two for buses. Activists demanded less. Adams promises more. The city claims this move grabs back nearly a quarter of public space from cars. Bold words. Deadly street. Big promise.</p><p class=mb3>On April 1, 2022, Mayor Eric Adams announced a sweeping plan to convert Manhattan’s Third Avenue into the city’s first 'bike superhighway.' The proposal, revealed in a mayoral policy announcement, would turn four of the avenue’s six lanes into protected bike lanes with a buffer, reserving the remaining two for buses. The plan would stretch from 24th Street to 125th Street. Adams declared, 'Getting stuff done means actually getting stuff done for New Yorkers.' He cited his campaign promise and support for Transportation Alternatives’ '25X25' campaign to reclaim public space from cars. The city claims this single project would achieve 22.7 percent of the campaign’s goal. No formal council bill or committee action is attached. The announcement, made at City Hall, signals Adams’s public commitment to bold street redesigns, but the story was later revealed as an April Fool’s satire.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
