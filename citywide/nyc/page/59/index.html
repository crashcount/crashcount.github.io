An SUV hit him at the intersection. His name is not in the data. His age is. The street is busy. The city calls it one of the most dangerous for walkers. The group said, <strong>"[Eastern Parkway] acts as a major thoroughfare for drivers, and is the sixth most dangerous street in Brooklyn for pedestrians"</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/01/tuesdays-headlines-another-child-sacrificed-to-the-suv-edition>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>Fourteen people were hurt when a van slammed into a tree in Brooklyn. Twelve of them were adults with special needs, headed to a day program. The driver swerved to avoid another car. A witness said, <strong>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sad because they definitely need a lot of attention more than anyone else. I hope that they&rsquo;re all OK at the end of the day&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/transport-van-crashes-tree-bath-beach-brooklyn-injuring-14-people/16903098/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>A 17-year-old died riding a moped. A 39-year-old was killed on a motorcycle. The list goes on. In the past 12 months, <strong>244 people have died</strong> on city streets. <strong>709 were seriously injured</strong>. Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers are among them (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=leaders-actbut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Act—But Not Fast Enough</h3><p>The city renewed its speed camera program. Governor Hochul said, <strong>&ldquo;Speed cameras save lives and keep New Yorkers safe. There is no greater priority for me than the safety of New Yorkers&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>amNY</a>). Cameras slow some drivers. But the dead keep coming.</p><p>Protected bike lanes work. The city’s own Department of Transportation warned, <strong>&ldquo;Removing the protected bike lane won&rsquo;t remove cyclists—it will only make the street less safe&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/dot-testimony-removing-bedford-ave-bike-lane-will-reduce-safety>Streetsblog NYC</a>). Still, the mayor ripped out the Bedford Avenue lane. Cyclists are left exposed. The city risks more deaths, more grief.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-are-names>The Numbers Are Names</h3><p>SUVs and cars kill most. In three years, <strong>cars and SUVs killed 300 people</strong> and left thousands more broken. Trucks and buses killed 93. Motorcycles and mopeds killed 10. Bikes killed 11. The numbers are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another body on the street.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes.

The summary states, '42,915 people dying in motor vehicle crashes—the most since 2005.' Deaths rose on all road types, especially in cities, with pedestrians and cyclists suffering the most. U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg responded, 'Zero is the only acceptable number of deaths and serious injuries on our roadways.' Advocates like Beth Osborne and Corinne Kisner called out dangerous road designs and large vehicles as key threats. The Biden Administration and U.S. DOT pledged a 'Safe System' and Vision Zero approach, promising infrastructure fixes and safety grants. The National Association of City Transportation Officials stressed the power of small, targeted interventions—sidewalks, curb extensions, raised crosswalks.
