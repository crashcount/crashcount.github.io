Fifty-nine killed in three months. Pedestrians, children, seniors hit hardest. Queens and Manhattan saw the worst spikes. Advocates demand urgent action—redesign streets, expand cameras, fund safety. City leaders stall. Streets remain lethal.</p><p class=mb3>This report, published April 20, 2022, highlights a grim milestone: the first quarter of 2022 marked the deadliest start to any year since Vision Zero began in 2014. Transportation Alternatives found 59 people killed in traffic crashes in just three months, a 44 percent jump from last year. The report states, 'Traffic fatalities are up 44 percent so far this year—the deadliest start to any year since Vision Zero launched.' Danny Harris, executive director of Transportation Alternatives, called on Mayor Adams to include the City Council’s $3.1 billion Streets Master Plan request and to fast-track redesigns of 1,000 intersections. Elke Weiss of Families for Safe Streets urged passage of the Crash Victim Rights and Safety Act, saying, 'Crossing the street should not be a life-or-death risk.' The report urges more car-free space, stronger driver accountability, and expanded speed and red-light camera programs. Despite Vision Zero’s promise, the city’s streets remain deadly for its most vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article, titled 'The 12 Best Ways to Get Cars out of Cities, Ranked,' reviews research on measures like congestion charges, parking reform, car-free streets, and expanded bike lanes. The analysis finds that combining restrictions on driving with incentives for sustainable travel is key. It warns that electric vehicles alone are not enough, and that city governments must act boldly. The piece states, 'reducing car use should be an urgent priority' to improve health, climate, and livability. No council member is named; this is an advocacy review, not a legislative action.

The proposal, revealed in a mayoral policy announcement, would turn four of the avenue’s six lanes into protected bike lanes with a buffer, reserving the remaining two for buses. The plan would stretch from 24th Street to 125th Street. Adams declared, 'Getting stuff done means actually getting stuff done for New Yorkers.' He cited his campaign promise and support for Transportation Alternatives’ '25X25' campaign to reclaim public space from cars. The city claims this single project would achieve 22.7 percent of the campaign’s goal. No formal council bill or committee action is attached. The announcement, made at City Hall, signals Adams’s public commitment to bold street redesigns, but the story was later revealed as an April Fool’s satire.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The study, titled 'Study: Megacar Drivers Up to 4x More Likely to Hit Walkers While Turning,' points to design flaws—especially wide A-pillars and high, boxy fronts—that create deadly blind spots. Dr. Wen Hu, senior transportation research engineer, said, 'We really need to systematically study the impact of A-pillar design on pedestrian visibility.'
