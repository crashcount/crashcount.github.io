The city targets danger, not people.</p><p class=mb3>On June 11, 2025, the New York City Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, announced intersection redesigns for six high-crash Brooklyn sites. No council bill number or committee is attached; this is a direct DOT action. Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' The plan uses hardened daylighting—barriers, granite blocks, planters—to keep cars away from corners. Each site will get a tailored design, focusing on visibility and reducing conflicts, especially where trucks turn. A safety analyst notes: redesigning high-traffic intersections to improve visibility addresses systemic risk factors and is likely to reduce conflicts and crashes involving pedestrians and cyclists, supporting safer mode shift and street equity.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal, approved unanimously by Community Board 6's Transportation Committee, removes car lanes for a protected bike lane, a dedicated bus lane, and pedestrian improvements.

DOT Project Manager Esteban Doyle said the plan reallocates space to match actual use. Community members praised the move. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not specify what design was implemented or how it affected pedestrians and cyclists, so no safety impact can be determined.'

The committee supported the plan with five votes in favor, three abstentions, and none opposed. The DOT aims to install the lane this summer, pending further presentations. Brunson called the redesign 'essential for fixing Court Street, a pedestrian and cyclist-heavy street dominated by vehicle infrastructure.' Safety analysts note that road diets like this reduce vehicle speeds, shorten crossing distances, and create space for bike lanes or wider sidewalks, improving safety and comfort for pedestrians and cyclists at the population level.

Cyclists would treat red lights as stop signs, stop signs as yields. The change cuts needless stops, reduces police targeting, and matches law to street reality. Safety improves for all.</p><p class=mb3>On June 6, 2025, Neile Weissman issued a public statement backing the Stop as Yield (SAY) bill—also known as the Idaho Stop—for cyclists in New York. The proposal, now before the State Legislature, would 'let cyclists treat red lights as stop signs, and stop signs as yields.' Weissman’s statement, published in Streetsblog NYC, highlights the urgent need to end overzealous enforcement and racial targeting of cyclists. He writes, 'SAY would make roads safer for cyclists, safer for pedestrians and, by spurring transition to sustainable modes of travel, better for the planet.' The bill is not yet law and has no listed committee or vote. Weissman’s advocacy draws on safety data: allowing cyclists to yield at stop signs and proceed on red reduces time spent in intersections, cuts crash risk, and encourages cycling. States like Idaho have seen no rise in cyclist injuries after similar laws. The measure aligns law with how cyclists ride and protects vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He reflected on the city’s transformation: 'If we restore valuable public space to the people, the result will be a healthier, happier, and more humane city.' Schwartz condemned the loss of sidewalks and transit space to cars, recalling when streets were safe for children and transit moved the masses. He supports the Adams administration’s plan to restore sidewalk widths on Fifth Avenue. Schwartz’s advocacy highlights the harm of auto-dependency and the urgent need to reclaim streets for vulnerable road users. Safety analysts note that restoring public space to people reallocates space from cars to pedestrians and cyclists, encouraging active transportation, reducing vehicle dominance, and improving safety for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Commissioner Jessica Tisch claimed police focus on six reckless offenses along 14 corridors. Duggan's reporting, published by Streetsblog NYC, reveals a much broader and harsher crackdown. Cyclists and e-bike riders, many of them immigrant workers, face tickets for minor or unclear infractions. Community boards and elected officials oppose the crackdown. Duggan quotes riders who say police create hazards and confusion, sometimes standing in bike lanes or ticketing for actions not on the official list. The safety analyst notes: 'Selective enforcement against e-bike users, especially if not transparently or equitably applied, can discourage cycling, reduce mode shift, and increase street inequity, ultimately undermining population-level safety for vulnerable road users.'

Hosted by NYS DOT, the event focused on the need to widen the Hudson River Greenway by reclaiming car lanes for pedestrians and cyclists. The matter: 'the proposed redesign of the Hudson River Greenway seize adjacent space currently devoted to cars in order to widen the crowded bike and pedestrian path.' Christine Berthet, co-chair of CB4's Transportation Planning Committee, said, '[Taking some space from cars] to give space to pedestrians and bikes is necessary.' Jeffrey LeFrancois, executive director of the Meatpacking District BID, called the current allocation 'disproportionate.' Attendees supported eliminating a vehicle lane, adding bus lanes, and improving crossings.
