Just last week, an eight-year-old boy was killed crossing Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights. His sister watched. His mother grieves. “He was a boy who loved life,” <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>said his mother</a>.</p><p>Scooter riders, teens on mopeds, and cyclists have all fallen.

Their proposal: turn Monitor Street into a cul-de-sac with a pedestrian plaza, add mid-block crossings, ban corner parking, and close a slip lane at Meeker Avenue. The push follows deadly crashes involving children and a cyclist. Chris Roberti, a parent, said, "The tradeoff right now is [we] prioritize cut-through traffic, big trucks and parking, [but] we are risking the lives of our kids." The Department of Transportation has not responded. Safety analysts note that restricting cut-through traffic near schools prioritizes vulnerable road users, reduces vehicle volumes and speeds, and creates a safer environment for pedestrians and cyclists, especially children. No council bill or committee action yet—just urgent voices demanding streets for kids, not cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' No council member sponsored this; it is a DOT initiative. Safety advocates, including Jackson Chabot of Open Plans, support the move but urge faster, broader action. According to safety analysts, hardened daylighting physically prevents vehicles from blocking sightlines, reducing conflicts and crashes involving pedestrians and cyclists, and supports system-wide safety improvements without burdening vulnerable users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, presented by DOT Director Chris Brunson to the Brooklyn Community Board 2 Transportation Committee, removes a travel lane and 59 parking spots to add a protected bike lane, pedestrian islands, curb extensions, and commercial loading zones. The committee supported the plan with five votes in favor, three abstentions, and none opposed. The DOT aims to install the lane this summer, pending further presentations. Brunson called the redesign 'essential for fixing Court Street, a pedestrian and cyclist-heavy street dominated by vehicle infrastructure.' Safety analysts note that road diets like this reduce vehicle speeds, shorten crossing distances, and create space for bike lanes or wider sidewalks, improving safety and comfort for pedestrians and cyclists at the population level. Council member Dave Colon supports the move.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists would treat red lights as stop signs, stop signs as yields. The change cuts needless stops, reduces police targeting, and matches law to street reality. Safety improves for all.</p><p class=mb3>On June 6, 2025, Neile Weissman issued a public statement backing the Stop as Yield (SAY) bill—also known as the Idaho Stop—for cyclists in New York. The proposal, now before the State Legislature, would 'let cyclists treat red lights as stop signs, and stop signs as yields.' Weissman’s statement, published in Streetsblog NYC, highlights the urgent need to end overzealous enforcement and racial targeting of cyclists. He writes, 'SAY would make roads safer for cyclists, safer for pedestrians and, by spurring transition to sustainable modes of travel, better for the planet.' The bill is not yet law and has no listed committee or vote. Weissman’s advocacy draws on safety data: allowing cyclists to yield at stop signs and proceed on red reduces time spent in intersections, cuts crash risk, and encourages cycling. States like Idaho have seen no rise in cyclist injuries after similar laws. The measure aligns law with how cyclists ride and protects vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He reflected on the city’s transformation: 'If we restore valuable public space to the people, the result will be a healthier, happier, and more humane city.' Schwartz condemned the loss of sidewalks and transit space to cars, recalling when streets were safe for children and transit moved the masses. He supports the Adams administration’s plan to restore sidewalk widths on Fifth Avenue. Schwartz’s advocacy highlights the harm of auto-dependency and the urgent need to reclaim streets for vulnerable road users.

Commissioner Jessica Tisch claimed police focus on six reckless offenses along 14 corridors. Duggan's reporting, published by Streetsblog NYC, reveals a much broader and harsher crackdown. Cyclists and e-bike riders, many of them immigrant workers, face tickets for minor or unclear infractions. Community boards and elected officials oppose the crackdown. Duggan quotes riders who say police create hazards and confusion, sometimes standing in bike lanes or ticketing for actions not on the official list. The safety analyst notes: 'Selective enforcement against e-bike users, especially if not transparently or equitably applied, can discourage cycling, reduce mode shift, and increase street inequity, ultimately undermining population-level safety for vulnerable road users.'
