Weissman’s statement, published in Streetsblog NYC, highlights the urgent need to end overzealous enforcement and racial targeting of cyclists. He writes, 'SAY would make roads safer for cyclists, safer for pedestrians and, by spurring transition to sustainable modes of travel, better for the planet.' The bill is not yet law and has no listed committee or vote. Weissman’s advocacy draws on safety data: allowing cyclists to yield at stop signs and proceed on red reduces time spent in intersections, cuts crash risk, and encourages cycling.

Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>NY1 reported on June 3, 2025, that New York City’s 2,200 speed cameras could shut off July 1 if Albany lawmakers do not reauthorize the program. The article quotes DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, who joined crash victims’ families and officials to urge lawmakers to act before the deadline. The report notes calls for legislation targeting chronic 'super speeders.' Without reauthorization, automated enforcement would lapse, removing a key tool for curbing reckless driving. The article highlights the urgency and the systemic risk posed by legislative inaction, but does not detail any specific crash or driver error.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He mourns lost streets, stolen by autos. He urges leaders to reclaim space for people. Sidewalks must widen. Streets must serve humans. The city’s health depends on this shift.</p><p class=mb3>On June 2, 2025, Sam Schwartz, former head of New York City’s Department of Traffic, issued a public statement through Streetsblog NYC. He reflected on the city’s transformation: 'If we restore valuable public space to the people, the result will be a healthier, happier, and more humane city.' Schwartz condemned the loss of sidewalks and transit space to cars, recalling when streets were safe for children and transit moved the masses. He supports the Adams administration’s plan to restore sidewalk widths on Fifth Avenue. Schwartz’s advocacy highlights the harm of auto-dependency and the urgent need to reclaim streets for vulnerable road users. Safety analysts note that restoring public space to people reallocates space from cars to pedestrians and cyclists, encouraging active transportation, reducing vehicle dominance, and improving safety for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
