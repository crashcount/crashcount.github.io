She struck a man on a bike and a woman sitting on a bench. Both died instantly. Prosecutors said the driver and her passenger tried to run after the crash. Police found alcohol and guns in the car. The judge called it murder. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/06/women-accused-in-horrific-chinatown-crash-that-claimed-two-lives-plead-not-guilty/>Kwok and Cruickshank’s internal and external injuries were described as devastating in court records.

Police said he was drunk. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/6-people-injured-5-car-crash-rfk-bridge/17450795/>Police say an erratic driver was taken into custody after the spectacular collision that closed the Queens-bound RFK Triborough Bridge for hours.</a></p><p>A 13-year-old on a moped collided with a bus in Staten Island.

In the last year alone, <strong>285 people died</strong>. <strong>Children, cyclists, and pedestrians keep paying the price.</strong></p><p>Cars and SUVs are the main killers. In three years, they took <strong>328 lives</strong> and left thousands more broken. Trucks and buses killed <strong>99</strong>. Motorcycles and mopeds, <strong>11</strong>. Bikes, <strong>11</strong>. The numbers do not stop. The grief does not fade.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Some leaders have moved. The city legalized jaywalking, ending a law that punished the poor and people of color. The state renewed speed cameras near schools. But the city still drags its feet on lowering speed limits. The law is there. The will is not.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand the Stop Super Speeders Act.</strong></p><p>Every day of delay means another family shattered. The blood on the street is not an accident.
