The committee voted five in favor, one against, and three abstained. The resolution, described as calling on the NYPD to 'immediately end the policy ... and find another way to mitigate bad behavior,' targets the Adams administration’s escalation of traffic tickets to criminal court for minor cycling infractions. Members, including Ken Coughlin and Howard Yaruss, questioned the evidence and fairness, highlighting risks to immigrant delivery workers. The crackdown, led by Commissioner Jessica Tisch, lacked supporting data. The safety analyst notes no specific policy change or measurable impact on vulnerable road users, so no population-level safety effect can be assessed. The resolution now moves to the full board.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cities suffocate under private vehicles. He demands space for people, not machines. Parking mandates, bus neglect, and narrow sidewalks fuel danger. Boenau calls for bold change. Streets must serve humans. Safety depends on it.</p><p class=mb3>On May 19, 2025, Andy Boenau issued a public statement, covered by Streetsblog NYC. No council bill or committee is attached; this is advocacy, not legislation. Boenau writes: 'There isn't enough physical space for every single household to store its fleet of personal vehicles in front of the home, nor is there space for everyone to drive at the same time.' He opposes minimum parking mandates and car-centric design, and supports bus priority, bike infrastructure, and pedestrian space. Boenau urges the city to reclaim streets for people. A safety analyst notes: Recognizing the spatial limits of car storage and use can lead to policies that prioritize more efficient, equitable street use, encouraging mode shift to walking and cycling and reducing car dominance, which improves safety for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "Brooklyn and Queens deserve a Conduit Boulevard that improves daily life, not a roadway that puts pedestrians and drivers at risk and physically divides entire neighborhoods." The corridor has seen five deaths and 40 severe injuries in five years. The median’s dirt paths show heavy pedestrian use, but only 15 crosswalks span the stretch.

Fear spreads.</p><p class=mb3>On May 5, 2025, Streetsblog NYC reported a major NYPD policy shift. The department now issues criminal court summonses to cyclists and e-bike riders for low-level violations—red lights, stop signs, wrong-way riding. The article, 'NYPD’s Red Light Criminalization Marks ‘Obscene’ Escalation: Advocates,' details the move. Kevin Duggan covered the story. Transportation Alternatives’s Ben Furnas called the change 'an obscene escalation.' Legal experts like Daniel Lambright warned it will amplify racially biased policing, especially against immigrant workers. More than 90% of such summonses in 2024 went to New Yorkers of color. The new policy reverses a decade of decriminalization, exposing thousands to harsh penalties for minor acts. Safety analysts note: 'A quiet change in police practices often signals increased enforcement or surveillance that can disproportionately burden pedestrians and cyclists, potentially discouraging active transportation and undermining safety in numbers.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
