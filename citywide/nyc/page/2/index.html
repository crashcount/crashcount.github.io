Duggan finds a sweeping crackdown. Cyclists face tickets for minor offenses. Immigrant workers lose work. Police ignore official limits. Enforcement spreads fear, not safety. The crackdown hits the vulnerable hardest.</p><p class=mb3>On May 22, 2025, journalist Kevin Duggan reported on the NYPD's e-bike enforcement policy. Commissioner Jessica Tisch claimed police focus on six reckless offenses along 14 corridors. Duggan's reporting, published by Streetsblog NYC, reveals a much broader and harsher crackdown. Cyclists and e-bike riders, many of them immigrant workers, face tickets for minor or unclear infractions. Community boards and elected officials oppose the crackdown. Duggan quotes riders who say police create hazards and confusion, sometimes standing in bike lanes or ticketing for actions not on the official list. The safety analyst notes: 'Selective enforcement against e-bike users, especially if not transparently or equitably applied, can discourage cycling, reduce mode shift, and increase street inequity, ultimately undermining population-level safety for vulnerable road users.' The NYPD's actions widen the gap between stated policy and street reality, putting the most vulnerable at greater risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Seven pedestrians and seven cyclists have died since 2011. The call for change is urgent.</p><p class=mb3>On May 22, 2025, a public workshop on the redesign of Route 9A (West Side Highway) drew dozens to the Javits Center. Hosted by NYS DOT, the event focused on the need to widen the Hudson River Greenway by reclaiming car lanes for pedestrians and cyclists. The matter: 'the proposed redesign of the Hudson River Greenway seize adjacent space currently devoted to cars in order to widen the crowded bike and pedestrian path.' Christine Berthet, co-chair of CB4's Transportation Planning Committee, said, '[Taking some space from cars] to give space to pedestrians and bikes is necessary.' Jeffrey LeFrancois, executive director of the Meatpacking District BID, called the current allocation 'disproportionate.' Attendees supported eliminating a vehicle lane, adding bus lanes, and improving crossings. Safety analysts note that expanding bike and pedestrian paths reduces conflicts with cars and encourages walking and cycling, boosting safety through mode shift and numbers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The committee voted five in favor, one against, and three abstained. The resolution, described as calling on the NYPD to 'immediately end the policy ... and find another way to mitigate bad behavior,' targets the Adams administration’s escalation of traffic tickets to criminal court for minor cycling infractions. Members, including Ken Coughlin and Howard Yaruss, questioned the evidence and fairness, highlighting risks to immigrant delivery workers. The crackdown, led by Commissioner Jessica Tisch, lacked supporting data. The safety analyst notes no specific policy change or measurable impact on vulnerable road users, so no population-level safety effect can be assessed.

Streets must serve humans. Safety depends on it.</p><p class=mb3>On May 19, 2025, Andy Boenau issued a public statement, covered by Streetsblog NYC. No council bill or committee is attached; this is advocacy, not legislation. Boenau writes: 'There isn't enough physical space for every single household to store its fleet of personal vehicles in front of the home, nor is there space for everyone to drive at the same time.' He opposes minimum parking mandates and car-centric design, and supports bus priority, bike infrastructure, and pedestrian space. Boenau urges the city to reclaim streets for people. A safety analyst notes: Recognizing the spatial limits of car storage and use can lead to policies that prioritize more efficient, equitable street use, encouraging mode shift to walking and cycling and reducing car dominance, which improves safety for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He urges rescinding the policy, pledging not to share citation data with ICE, and redirecting enforcement toward car and truck drivers, who inflict most harm on pedestrians. Komanoff calls for city officials to experience cycling firsthand before making policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets grow tense. Advocates call it obscene. The crackdown lands hardest on people of color and immigrants. Safety takes a back seat. Punishment rises. Fear spreads.</p><p class=mb3>On May 5, 2025, Streetsblog NYC reported a major NYPD policy shift. The department now issues criminal court summonses to cyclists and e-bike riders for low-level violations—red lights, stop signs, wrong-way riding. The article, 'NYPD’s Red Light Criminalization Marks ‘Obscene’ Escalation: Advocates,' details the move. Kevin Duggan covered the story. Transportation Alternatives’s Ben Furnas called the change 'an obscene escalation.' Legal experts like Daniel Lambright warned it will amplify racially biased policing, especially against immigrant workers. More than 90% of such summonses in 2024 went to New Yorkers of color. The new policy reverses a decade of decriminalization, exposing thousands to harsh penalties for minor acts. Safety analysts note: 'A quiet change in police practices often signals increased enforcement or surveillance that can disproportionately burden pedestrians and cyclists, potentially discouraging active transportation and undermining safety in numbers.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
