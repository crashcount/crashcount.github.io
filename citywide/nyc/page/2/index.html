A 13-year-old boy on a moped was thrown to the pavement after colliding with an MTA bus in Staten Island. He left the scene in critical condition, his head struck hard. The bus driver and passengers walked away unhurt. Police said, &ldquo;the moped went through a stop sign without stopping and hit the bus&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/moped-bus-collision-staten-island/>reported amNY</a>. No arrests. The investigation drags on.</p><p>Elsewhere, two NYPD cruisers collided in Queens while racing to a call. Four officers were sent to the hospital. &ldquo;Two police vehicles were badly damaged from the collision,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/nypd-crash-edgemere-queens/>said CBS New York</a>. The cause is still under review. The city’s own enforcers are not immune to the chaos of its streets.</p><h2 id=the-numbers-that-dont-lie>The Numbers That Don’t Lie</h2><p><strong>In the last 12 months, 284 people died on New York City streets.</strong> Over 52,000 were injured. 764 suffered injuries so severe they will never be the same. Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians are the first to fall. Fourteen children have died in the past year. Forty-seven people aged 55 to 64. The city counts the bodies. The families count the empty chairs.</p><p>Cars and SUVs do the most damage. <strong>327 deaths and over 27,000 injuries</strong> came from these vehicles alone. Trucks and buses killed 99. Motorcycles and mopeds, 11. Bikes, 11. The city is a machine that chews through flesh and bone.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h2><p>The city has taken steps. Speed cameras in school zones will stay until 2030. The law now allows lower speed limits, but the default is still too high. The council and mayor have the power to drop it to 20 mph. They have not. Each day they wait, the toll grows.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph limit.

Winston Reid, accused of drunk driving, struck a man in an East Flatbush crosswalk. Police charged him with vehicular manslaughter. In a separate January crash, Timothe Andre hit Mayya Gil, 95, and her aide in Bensonhurst. Gil died from her injuries. After a six-month probe, Andre was charged with failure to yield and failure to exercise due care. The article notes, 'As of Thursday, 60 pedestrians had been killed by vehicles across the city this year.' Both drivers remained at the scene.
