Over 52,000 were hurt. Seven hundred sixty-six suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same again. These are not numbers. They are fathers, daughters, neighbors, friends.</p><p>Just last week, a 55-year-old woman riding her bike in Queens was killed by an SUV making a left turn. She was ejected from her bike and died in the street. On the same day, a 23-year-old man was struck and killed by a speeding sedan in Ozone Park. The car came fast. The street was slick. He did not get up. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><h2 id=the-voices-on-the-ground>The Voices on the Ground</h2><p>The city is tired. In Washington Heights, after a hit-and-run left a cyclist sprawled on the pavement, a resident <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said, &ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time.&rdquo;</a> Another pleaded, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>&ldquo;I really want there to be speed humps because it&rsquo;s just terrifying.&rdquo;</a></p><p>In Queens, two NYPD cruisers collided while racing to a call. Four officers went to the hospital. The cause is still under review. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/nypd-cruiser-involved-in-crash-in-queens-3-people-injured/>Police are now trying to determine the cause of the crash.</a></p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p><strong>The city has power. It does not always use it.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The Council can lower the speed limit to 20 mph citywide. They have not. Speed cameras now run 24/7, but the most reckless drivers still roam free. A handful of bills wait for action. Each day of delay is another day of loss.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand the Stop Super Speeders Act. Join groups like Transportation Alternatives and Families for Safe Streets. <strong>Do not wait for another name to become a number.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The shooter, Joseph Meeks, 76, tried four credit cards before the argument escalated. ABC7 reports, "Mr. Barrie asked him to get out of the car and pay him, instead of paying him he shot him in the stomach." Meeks, with about 60 prior arrests, was charged with attempted murder. The United Federation of Taxi Drivers urged the district attorney to deny bail.
