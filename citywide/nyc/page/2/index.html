The plot unraveled when a victim provided dashcam footage of a crash on the Belt Parkway. Queens DA Melinda Katz said, "The prevalence of staged auto crimes has outraged New Yorkers."

Advocates blame the lack of protected infrastructure: 'The road diet works where it's been installed and it's needed for the entire corridor before this happens again,' said Kevin LaCherra. The city had planned to remove a lane for cars, but left two lanes for traffic and an unprotected bike lane after political intervention.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
