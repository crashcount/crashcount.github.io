Surface streets got safer. Speed cameras work, but Albany blocks them on highways. Mayor Adams faces pressure. Families mourn. The city’s most violent crashes go unchecked. The data is clear. Highways need urgent action now.</p><p class=mb3>This editorial, published January 26, 2023, calls on Mayor Adams to advocate for speed cameras on New York City highways. The piece highlights that, despite Vision Zero and surface-street redesigns, highway deaths rose from 29 in 2019 to 49 in 2022. The article states: 'the most proven tool for reducing the most violent crashes—control by speed cameras—is not allowed by New York State on the city's highways.' Mayor Adams is urged to push Albany for legislative change. The editorial notes that surface-street interventions—road diets, bike lanes, intersection redesigns—have cut cyclist deaths by 45 percent and pedestrian deaths by 5 percent since 2019. But highways remain deadly, untouched by these tools. The city’s safety gains stall at the expressway on-ramp. Vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states, 'More children died in crashes last year than in any other year in the Vision Zero era and crashes remain concentrated in areas that are known to be treacherous.' Danny Harris, executive director, condemned the city’s slow pace: 'As we near the 10-year mark of Vision Zero, it’s clear we haven’t moved fast enough to address this crisis.' The city missed its legally mandated targets for protected bike and bus lanes. The Bronx suffered 56 deaths, tying a 20-year high. The NYPD solved more hit-and-runs in white neighborhoods than in communities of color. DOT and City Hall touted small improvements, but the carnage continued.

Berthet writes, 'chargers will enshrine the use of the curb for free parking, and will make it more difficult and expensive to expand sidewalks, bike lanes and bus lanes in the future.' She urges the city to direct incentives toward fast-charging hubs, transit, and Citi Bike, not private car infrastructure.

The advocacy group’s plan, titled 'Joyful, Sustainable Future for a People-Centered NYC,' urges coordinated action on four fronts: livable streets, curb reform, public space, and parking mandates. Sara Lind, a key voice, states, 'We can’t build a livable city without reclaiming space from cars.' The agenda highlights bills like Intro 500 (placard abuse), S3080A/A516 (e-bike rebates), Intro 708 (truck route redesign), and Intro 854 (intersection daylighting). It calls for dynamic parking pricing, expanded loading zones, and a permanent Open Restaurants program. The plan demands city and state action to reduce car dominance, expand safe alternatives, and protect vulnerable road users.

Lives hang in the balance. Reform is overdue.</p><p class=mb3>On January 4, 2023, University of Iowa professor Gregory Shill published a policy proposal urging the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to overhaul its safety standards. The article, titled 'Four Ways Automotive Regulators Could Save Pedestrian Lives,' argues NHTSA 'considers the safety of pedestrians—who are third parties rather than consumers—almost completely alien to its mission.' Shill calls for four reforms: include pedestrian safety in NHTSA’s mandate, make cars safer for walkers by addressing size and design, scrutinize high-tech solutions, and make crash tests reflect real-world bodies and conditions. He notes, 'the agency has the capacity to leverage the best evidence and technology to safeguard pedestrians, and should use it.' Shill’s push comes as U.S. pedestrian deaths rise, especially among Black road users, while other nations see declines. The proposal demands systemic change to protect the most vulnerable on American streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
