Streets must serve the vulnerable.</p><p class=mb3>On January 9, 2023, Open Plans released a sweeping legislative agenda for New York City. The advocacy group’s plan, titled 'Joyful, Sustainable Future for a People-Centered NYC,' urges coordinated action on four fronts: livable streets, curb reform, public space, and parking mandates. Sara Lind, a key voice, states, 'We can’t build a livable city without reclaiming space from cars.' The agenda highlights bills like Intro 500 (placard abuse), S3080A/A516 (e-bike rebates), Intro 708 (truck route redesign), and Intro 854 (intersection daylighting). It calls for dynamic parking pricing, expanded loading zones, and a permanent Open Restaurants program. The plan demands city and state action to reduce car dominance, expand safe alternatives, and protect vulnerable road users. Council members are urged to champion bus lanes and support these reforms.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Its five-star ratings protect drivers, not walkers. SUVs and trucks grow deadlier. U.S. pedestrian deaths soar. Professor Shill demands change: count walkers, shrink cars, test for real-world danger. Lives hang in the balance. Reform is overdue.</p><p class=mb3>On January 4, 2023, University of Iowa professor Gregory Shill published a policy proposal urging the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to overhaul its safety standards. The article, titled 'Four Ways Automotive Regulators Could Save Pedestrian Lives,' argues NHTSA 'considers the safety of pedestrians—who are third parties rather than consumers—almost completely alien to its mission.' Shill calls for four reforms: include pedestrian safety in NHTSA’s mandate, make cars safer for walkers by addressing size and design, scrutinize high-tech solutions, and make crash tests reflect real-world bodies and conditions. He notes, 'the agency has the capacity to leverage the best evidence and technology to safeguard pedestrians, and should use it.' Shill’s push comes as U.S. pedestrian deaths rise, especially among Black road users, while other nations see declines. The proposal demands systemic change to protect the most vulnerable on American streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
