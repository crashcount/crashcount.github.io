A black SUV hit him. He died on the street. The driver stayed. Police said, &ldquo;They were walking, he was crossing the street with his sister&rdquo; (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>police said</a>). No arrest. The street is still open. The danger is still there.</p><p>The day before, in the Bronx, a man ran a red light. His car jumped the curb and crushed three people on the sidewalk. One is still fighting for life. The driver ran but police caught him. He faces charges for assault, fleeing, and driving without a license (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/driver-flees-bronx-car-stop-crash/>faces charges</a>).</p><p><strong>In the last 12 months, 244 people have died on New York City streets. 713 were seriously hurt.</strong> Thirteen of the dead were children. The city logs over 81,000 crashes a year. Each number is a name, a family, a future gone.</p><h3 id=the-policy-that-wasnt>The Policy That Wasn&rsquo;t</h3><p>Leaders talk. Streets stay the same. The mayor ripped out a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue after crashes involving children. He said he was listening to the community. Cyclists said, &ldquo;I don’t think he cares if we die&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/cyclists-fuming-over-mayor-adamss-removal-of-bedford-avenue-protected-bike-lane>Cyclists said</a>). The city put back paint. Paint does not stop cars.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Department of Transportation built a new protected bike lane in Queens. A commuter said, &ldquo;The old street was very dangerous&mldr; the new path is definitely safer because he&rsquo;s no longer competing with trucks and cars for road space&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/27/eyes-on-the-street-new-bike-lane-puts-the-bliss-in-blissville>A commuter said</a>). But these changes come slow. Too slow for the dead.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-that-dont-lie>The Numbers That Don&rsquo;t Lie</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks killed 299 people.</strong> Motorcycles and mopeds killed 21. Bikes killed 11. The city counts 182,570 injuries since 2022. The bodies pile up. The city debates.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call your council member. Call the mayor.

The report states, 'More children died in crashes last year than in any other year in the Vision Zero era and crashes remain concentrated in areas that are known to be treacherous.' Danny Harris, executive director, condemned the city’s slow pace: 'As we near the 10-year mark of Vision Zero, it’s clear we haven’t moved fast enough to address this crisis.' The city missed its legally mandated targets for protected bike and bus lanes. The Bronx suffered 56 deaths, tying a 20-year high. The NYPD solved more hit-and-runs in white neighborhoods than in communities of color. DOT and City Hall touted small improvements, but the carnage continued. The report demands full, urgent implementation of the NYC Streets Plan to save lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The opinion, titled 'Thousands of Chargers for Heavy E-Cars Are Coming to a Sidewalk Near You,' warns that federal grants will fund chargers at the expense of pedestrian, cyclist, and transit space. Berthet writes, 'chargers will enshrine the use of the curb for free parking, and will make it more difficult and expensive to expand sidewalks, bike lanes and bus lanes in the future.' She urges the city to direct incentives toward fast-charging hubs, transit, and Citi Bike, not private car infrastructure.

Its five-star ratings protect drivers, not walkers. SUVs and trucks grow deadlier. U.S. pedestrian deaths soar. Professor Shill demands change: count walkers, shrink cars, test for real-world danger. Lives hang in the balance. Reform is overdue.</p><p class=mb3>On January 4, 2023, University of Iowa professor Gregory Shill published a policy proposal urging the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to overhaul its safety standards. The article, titled 'Four Ways Automotive Regulators Could Save Pedestrian Lives,' argues NHTSA 'considers the safety of pedestrians—who are third parties rather than consumers—almost completely alien to its mission.' Shill calls for four reforms: include pedestrian safety in NHTSA’s mandate, make cars safer for walkers by addressing size and design, scrutinize high-tech solutions, and make crash tests reflect real-world bodies and conditions. He notes, 'the agency has the capacity to leverage the best evidence and technology to safeguard pedestrians, and should use it.' Shill’s push comes as U.S. pedestrian deaths rise, especially among Black road users, while other nations see declines. The proposal demands systemic change to protect the most vulnerable on American streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
