Just last week, an eight-year-old boy was killed crossing Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights. His sister watched. His mother grieves. “He was a boy who loved life,” <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>said his mother</a>.</p><p>Scooter riders, teens on mopeds, and cyclists have all fallen.

Sidewalks belong to the vulnerable.</p><p class=mb3>On January 18, 2023, Christine Berthet published a sharp critique of New York City’s curbside EV charger rollout. The opinion, titled 'Thousands of Chargers for Heavy E-Cars Are Coming to a Sidewalk Near You,' warns that federal grants will fund chargers at the expense of pedestrian, cyclist, and transit space. Berthet writes, 'chargers will enshrine the use of the curb for free parking, and will make it more difficult and expensive to expand sidewalks, bike lanes and bus lanes in the future.' She urges the city to direct incentives toward fast-charging hubs, transit, and Citi Bike, not private car infrastructure. Berthet calls for sidewalk widening, bike lanes, bus lanes, and public review before any curbside charger is installed. Her message: prioritize people, safety, and the environment over car convenience.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She warned, 'I’m concerned about the increased risk of severe injury and death for all road users from heavier curb weights and increasing size, power, and performance of vehicles on our roads, including electric vehicles.' Homendy supports the push to phase out carbon emissions but calls out the deadly risk of heavier EVs like the GMC Hummer EV and Ford F-150 Lightning. She insists safety must not be overlooked in new transportation policies and technologies. Homendy champions Vision Zero, stating, 'Not a single life lost. Zero has to be just as real for them as it is for us.' She urges political will and fearless pursuit of solutions to stop preventable deaths. No council bill or vote is attached, but her statement draws a hard line: climate action must not come at the cost of vulnerable lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The advocacy group’s plan, titled 'Joyful, Sustainable Future for a People-Centered NYC,' urges coordinated action on four fronts: livable streets, curb reform, public space, and parking mandates. Sara Lind, a key voice, states, 'We can’t build a livable city without reclaiming space from cars.' The agenda highlights bills like Intro 500 (placard abuse), S3080A/A516 (e-bike rebates), Intro 708 (truck route redesign), and Intro 854 (intersection daylighting). It calls for dynamic parking pricing, expanded loading zones, and a permanent Open Restaurants program. The plan demands city and state action to reduce car dominance, expand safe alternatives, and protect vulnerable road users.
