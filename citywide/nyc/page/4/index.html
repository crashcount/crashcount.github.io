On 2025-08-13 near JFK, police said, “A hit-and-run driver killed a 52-year-old man” (NY Daily News; Gothamist). And on 2025-08-06 in Bensonhurst a 76-year-old woman in a marked crosswalk was struck and killed; the crash record lists “Traffic Control Disregarded” (NYC Open Data).</p><h3 id=the-toll-that-never-ends>The toll that never ends</h3><p>From 2022 through 2025-08-16, New York City recorded 1,103 traffic deaths and 2,510 serious injuries, according to city crash data. Year‑to‑date through 2025-08-16 the city shows 179 deaths, barely down from 182 at the same point last year (NYC Open Data). Numbers move. Lives don’t return.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-did--and-didnt>What leaders did — and didn’t</h3><p>Prosecutors in Queens won convictions after a wrong‑way rampage on the Clearview Expressway. Queens DA Melinda Katz said, “Joseph Lee terrorized other drivers,” and noted victims remain badly hurt (amNY). Courts punished violence. Enforcement after the fact is not prevention.</p><p>City Hall says a 14th Street redesign will begin next year. The $3 million design project “aims to improve the pedestrian experience,” NY1 reported. Design work is welcome. It will not slow a single car this week.</p><p>Cars and SUVs still do most of the killing. City data show cars/SUVs account for the largest share of pedestrian deaths; trucks and buses add a significant toll (NYC Open Data).</p><h3 id=what-must-happen-now>What must happen now</h3><ul><li>Lower the default speed limit to 20 mph citywide. Slower streets save lives.</li><li>Require intelligent speed‑assistance devices for repeat speeders and repeat red‑light offenders. If a plate racks camera tickets, the vehicle should not be able to exceed the limit by a wide margin.</li><li>Deliver quick, local safety fixes on dangerous corridors: daylight intersections, install Leading Pedestrian Intervals, harden turn radii, and add targeted night enforcement and lighting where crashes cluster.</li></ul><h3 id=tie-local-fixes-to-citywide-policy>Tie local fixes to citywide policy</h3><p>Local crashes show the same solutions work citywide. Use Sammy’s Law and push City Hall to set a default 20 mph. Pair that with a Stop Super Speeders policy to mandate speed limiters for habitual offenders and invest the revenue in quick‑build safety projects. Short timelines and enforcement changes will prevent deaths; delayed redesigns and post‑crash prosecutions will not.</p><h3 id=this-is-on-us>This is on us</h3><p>Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand 20 mph and speed limiters. Press for quick builds on dangerous streets.
