In the last twelve months, <strong>260 people have died</strong> on New York City streets. <strong>742 suffered serious injuries</strong>. These are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors. In the past week alone, the carnage did not stop. A 71-year-old woman died in the Bronx when a 79-year-old driver crashed into two cars and a pole. Police said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/13/multi-car-crash-in-the-bronx-kills-71-year-old-woman-injures-seven-others/>&ldquo;The cause of the crash was not immediately known.&rdquo;</a> Seven others were hurt. In Brooklyn, two men were killed by a hit-and-run driver. Neighbors said, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>&ldquo;drivers speed on that stretch of roadway.&rdquo;</a></p><p>A 16-year-old on an e-scooter died in Staten Island after colliding with a car. His name was Nacere Ellis. He was still a boy. The city keeps count. The city keeps moving.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Older adults and children are not spared.</strong> In the last year, 32 people aged 65–74 died. Eleven children under 18 died. The streets do not forgive. Cars and SUVs are the main killers: <strong>311 deaths</strong> from cars and SUVs since 2022. Trucks and buses killed 95. Motorcycles and mopeds, 10. Bikes, 11. The numbers do not lie. The dead do not speak.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>The city has moved, but not fast enough. Speed cameras run 24/7. The law lets the city lower speed limits. Some streets now have 20 mph zones. But the default speed is still higher. The city could drop it to 20 mph today. It has not. The council and mayor have the power. They have not used it. The state renewed speed cameras. That saves lives. But the worst drivers keep driving. <strong>1.5% of motorists cause 21% of pedestrian deaths.</strong></p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat offenders. Join groups like Transportation Alternatives and Families for Safe Streets. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p><p><strong>The city will not change unless you force it. Act now.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The NYPD’s policy restricts chases to serious crimes and discourages them in residential areas, yet the pursuit occurred near homes and a bodega. The department declined to comment.

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing.

Change comes after loss and pressure.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC reported on April 28, 2025, that the city will close a dangerous Bushwick intersection after a fatal crash killed motorcyclist Philippe Haussmann. The Department of Transportation will ban cars on Scott Avenue between Flushing and Johnson and remove parking at several corners to improve visibility, a process called daylighting. The article notes, 'Drivers struggle to see oncoming traffic on Scott Avenue at Jefferson Street and at Flushing Avenue, due to parking blocking sight lines and the angle of the street.' The intersection saw 39 crashes from 2020 to 2024. The redesign includes a pedestrian plaza, narrowed roadways, and a ban on right turns onto Scott Avenue. These changes follow advocacy from Haussmann’s family and local lawmakers, highlighting systemic danger and the need for proactive street design.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
