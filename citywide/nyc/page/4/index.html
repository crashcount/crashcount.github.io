Cars, which kill and injure most, get less scrutiny. Cyclists and advocates call this unjust. Enforcement targets the least dangerous, not the deadliest.</p><p class=mb3>On April 18, 2025, Streetsblog NYC reported that NYPD officers issued 15 percent of red-light tickets to cyclists, who account for less than 2 percent of city street trips. The article, titled 'Exclusive: Cops Writing 15% of Their Red Light Tix to Cyclists, Who are Just 2% of Road Users,' highlights a stark enforcement imbalance. Activists like Corey Hannigan and Sara Lind criticize the NYPD for targeting cyclists instead of drivers, who cause most crashes and deaths. Cyclist Lee calls the practice 'unjust.' Kate Brockwehl, injured by a car, says the policy shows 'windshield bias.' The Department of Transportation has proposed legalizing the 'Idaho Stop' for cyclists, but City Hall has blocked it. Cyclists like John Surico and George Calderaro say most tickets come from coordinated police actions, not real safety concerns. The data shows enforcement priorities ignore who poses real danger on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lander stressed his record: 'By the time I'm done, you're going to have a lot more bus and bike infrastructure, more of the neighborhood loading zones that use the curb, more of those shared containers, especially in denser areas.' He contrasted his approach with the Adams administration, calling out backroom deals and broken promises. Lander cited his support for protected bike lanes, even when facing opposition. He pledged to make it easier for families to use e-cargo bikes by building safer routes. Lander committed to expanding the Fourth Avenue bike lane to Bay Ridge and reducing car space citywide.

The matter summary reads: 'The Department of Transportation (DOT) planned to reduce car lanes and add a protected bike lane and pedestrian islands, but business leaders...protested.' Community board support was strong. Streetsblog NYC reported that 68 percent of locals backed the changes. Council members were not named, but business owners and advocates like Jon Orcutt and Jim of Bagels By the Park spoke out.

Furnas says, 'These results point to a small population with a shocking pattern of recidivism, resistance to traditional deterrents, and disregard for human life.' Adler points to a recent fatal crash by a repeat offender as proof of legislative failure. Assembly Member Michael Novakhov opposes the bill, claiming six tickets is not excessive.

DOT will add eight-foot-wide bike lanes with three-foot buffers, painted pedestrian islands, and daylighting at corners. The plan does not remove driving or parking lanes but reorganizes car storage to align with track columns.

The matter, described as 'Tragedy Underscores Shortcomings of Vision Zero Era State Ocean Parkway Fixes,' highlights the failure of current efforts. Despite millions spent on speed cameras and signals, the six-lane highway remains deadly. Assembly Member Michael Novakhov called for higher speed limits. State Senator Simcha Felder pushed for a 30 mph limit, above the citywide standard. Advocates like Jon Orcutt demand deeper redesigns—lane reductions, pedestrian islands. Residents and experts say enforcement alone cannot save lives. Local opposition and political power block bold changes. The city DOT promises more work, but the danger persists. Vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crash occurred in daylight, at 15:16, when a 52-year-old man was in the roadway. The report states, 'A 52-year-old man lay in the road. Three SUVs collided. One rolled over him. His body was crushed beneath the weight. He died there, in daylight, under wheels that did not stop in time.' All vehicles were traveling west; two were stopped in traffic, one was going straight ahead. The victim was not at an intersection and was engaged in 'other actions in roadway' at the time. The police report lists contributing factors as 'Unspecified,' providing no further detail on specific driver errors, but the sequence left a pedestrian dead beneath the mass of multiple SUVs.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Jamie Raskin spoke out for the Sarah Debbink Langenkamp Act, a federal bill reintroduced in Congress. The bill would allow state and local governments to use 100 percent federal funding for bike lanes and safety projects under the Transportation Alternatives Program. Raskin, in a Streetsblog NYC interview, declared, 'The carnage on our highways and roads is just intolerable.' He criticized ideological opposition to bike safety and called for robust federal investment. The bill also lets local, regional, and metropolitan governments nominate projects directly, bypassing unsupportive higher authorities. Raskin urged advocates to press their representatives for support, highlighting the deadly toll of current federal policies that block safer streets. The measure has not yet advanced to committee or vote.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states that a mother and her three children were crossing in the crosswalk with the pedestrian signal when the vehicle struck them. The impact killed the 34-year-old woman and two of her children, ages five and eight. A four-year-old boy was left unconscious and severely injured. The police report lists 'Traffic Control Disregarded' and 'Unsafe Speed' as contributing factors for the driver. The pedestrians were crossing with the signal, as documented in the report. The sedan's center front end struck the victims, underscoring the lethal consequences of ignoring traffic controls. The driver’s unlicensed status and disregard for the signal are central to this tragedy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The van's right front bumper struck a 65-year-old man who was crossing the intersection with the pedestrian signal. The report states the man suffered fatal head injuries and died at the scene. The van sustained no damage. Police cite 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as the primary contributing factor. The victim's action—'Crossing With Signal'—is noted in the report, but only after the driver's failure to yield.
