According to the police report, the crash occurred at 9:22 a.m. when all vehicles were traveling south. The report states 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as a contributing factor. The motorcycle was 'demolished,' and its 55-year-old male rider was 'ejected' and killed, suffering 'crush injuries' to his entire body. The narrative describes the scene: 'A sedan, motorcycle, and SUV collide, metal shrieks. The motorcycle is crushed. A 55-year-old man, ejected, dies on the street. Others crawl from wrecks, dazed, bodies aching.' The police report makes no mention of victim behavior as a contributing factor.

NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said, "This was a horrific tragedy caused by someone who should not have been on the road," but did not address the bill.

Headlights flashed, steel met flesh, and blood pooled on the Brooklyn pavement. The night swallowed the noise. He did not rise.</p><p class=mb3>A 49-year-old pedestrian was killed on Franklin Street at India Street in Brooklyn when an unlicensed e-bike rider traveling south struck him head-on, according to the police report. The report states the e-bike driver was 'unlicensed' and identifies 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as a contributing factor. The impact occurred at the center front end of the e-bike, causing severe head injuries and fatal bleeding to the pedestrian. The police report describes the victim as 'crossing, no signal, or crosswalk' and 'not at intersection,' but the primary focus remains on the unlicensed status of the e-bike operator and the disregard for traffic control. The narrative details a quiet night interrupted by the crash, with the victim left motionless on the pavement. No other contributing factors from the pedestrian are cited in the report.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

He died in the street. Two crumpled hoods. One still body. Eastbound traffic kept moving.' Police explicitly cite 'Traffic Control Disregarded' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as contributing factors. The cyclist suffered fatal head injuries. The report does not list any cyclist behavior as a contributing factor; the focus remains on the actions of the drivers and the systemic dangers present on Queens Boulevard.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The letter urges the city to deliver a long-promised busway along the full length of 34th Street. The boards request widened sidewalks, bus stop bulb-outs, and dedicated loading and pickup/drop off zones. They write, 'this project would significantly improve the efficiency and livability of 34th Street for both commuters and pedestrians.' The boards cite the 14th Street busway, which increased bus speeds by 24 percent and ridership by 30 percent. Council members are not named, but the boards’ action is clear: they support the busway and pedestrian improvements. The letter calls these changes 'necessary and forward-thinking' for safety and congestion. Mayor Adams has lagged on bus lanes, painting just 5 miles per year, far below the City Council’s 30-mile goal. DOT says a proposal is coming.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

City missed legal targets for bus and bike lanes. Adams’s interference and staff cuts left streets unchanged. Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price. The mayor’s words and actions stalled safety. The law sits ignored. Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On March 14, 2025, the Department of Transportation released its annual report on the 2019 Streets Master Plan law. The report, required by the City Council, reveals the city missed mandates for protected bike lanes (29.3 of 50 miles) and bus lanes (17.9 of 30 miles) for the third year running. The matter summary states: 'New York City has failed to meet legally required benchmarks for redesigning streets for bikes, buses, and pedestrians due to a lack of resources and political interference.' Mayor Eric Adams is named as the main obstacle. The report cites staff shortages, shrinking divisions, and political pushback—especially the mayor’s role in killing the Fordham Road busway. Former DOT commissioner Polly Trottenberg warned the plan needed more funding and a new approach. Advocates and officials say Adams’s lack of support left the city’s most vulnerable road users exposed. The law’s promise is broken. The streets stay deadly.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
