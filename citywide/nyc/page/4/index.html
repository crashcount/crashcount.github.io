It would require speed limiter technology for drivers with six or more automated enforcement tickets in a year. The bill is supported by Amber Adler of Families for Safe Streets and Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives, who call out the deadly pattern of repeat offenders. Furnas says, 'These results point to a small population with a shocking pattern of recidivism, resistance to traditional deterrents, and disregard for human life.' Adler points to a recent fatal crash by a repeat offender as proof of legislative failure. Assembly Member Michael Novakhov opposes the bill, claiming six tickets is not excessive. The NYPD withholds license plate data, blocking public scrutiny. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program has expired, leaving no replacement. Advocates say the bill is urgent to stop the next tragedy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The impact demolished the bike and ejected its 19-year-old rider, who was crushed and killed. The SUV driver, a 60-year-old woman, survived with pain.

The police report makes clear that the driver failed to yield and was distracted, while the pedestrian was lawfully crossing with the signal. Systemic danger persists when unlicensed, inattentive drivers operate large vehicles on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

No driving or parking lanes are removed.</p><p class=mb3>On April 8, 2025, the NYC Department of Transportation announced plans to install protected bike lanes under the elevated subway tracks on 31st Street in Astoria, Queens. The project, not a council bill but a DOT action, targets a stretch ranked in the top 10 percent for severe injuries and deaths. DOT will add eight-foot-wide bike lanes with three-foot buffers, painted pedestrian islands, and daylighting at corners. The plan does not remove driving or parking lanes but reorganizes car storage to align with track columns. DOT planner Rachael Metz called the roadbed chaotic, with frequent illegal double-parking and blocked sight lines. Community board member Nas Magoutas said, 'I feel like I’ve been waiting 30 years for it.' The project follows similar redesigns in the Bronx and will begin after July 1, 2025, taking about two months to complete.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
