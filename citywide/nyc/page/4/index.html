Every week, the toll grows. Just days ago, two men—ages 80 and 59—were killed crossing with the signal at Third Avenue and 52nd Street. The car kept going. The city kept moving. The families did not.</p><p><strong>Hit-and-runs are routine.</strong> On July 24, firefighter Matthew Goicochea died on the FDR Drive. He fell from his motorcycle and was left in the road. The driver who struck him did not stop. The FDNY mourned: <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/decorated-firefighter-killed-after-falling-off-motorcycle-getting-hit-by-car-on-fdr-drive-GG4877945>&ldquo;We lost a true hero this morning with the tragic passing of Firefighter Matthew Goicochea.&rdquo;</a></p><p>In Sunset Park, two pedestrians were killed in a hit-and-run at Third Avenue and 52nd Street. The driver was caught, but the street remains unchanged. <strong>&ldquo;We wait until someone dies. We wait until a tragedy. We wait to say, &lsquo;oh my gosh, how could this possibly have happened?&rsquo; We let this happen time and time again,&rdquo;</strong> said <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>State Senator Andrew Gounardes</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pauses>Leadership: Promises and Pauses</h3><p>The city has tools. Albany passed Sammy’s Law, giving New York City the power to lower speed limits. The city can set a 20 mph default. It has not. DOT has started to sprinkle 20 mph zones, but the carnage continues. <strong>Speed cameras have been renewed through 2030.</strong> The Stop Super Speeders Act sits in Albany, waiting for a vote. The city’s leaders talk of Vision Zero, but the bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-most-vulnerable>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Most Vulnerable</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> In the last three years, they killed 323 people and left 536 with serious injuries. Trucks and buses killed 99. Motorcycles and mopeds killed 11. Bikes killed 11. The pattern is clear. The most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, children—pay the price. The city’s streets are not safe for them.</p><h3 id=act-now-demand-action>Act Now: Demand Action</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor.

The lane calmed a deadly stretch. Drivers still parked illegally. Children darted into traffic. Now, cyclists and pedestrians face more danger. Policy shifts, safety slips. Streets stay lethal.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC reported on June 13, 2025, that Mayor Adams will remove the protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue, a corridor known for high crash rates. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'before this bike lane from 2018 to 2022 this is the area that had the second largest numbers of pedestrian fatalities and crashes in the city.' The lane faced opposition from some Hasidic leaders, citing children running into the lane from illegally parked cars and buses. Despite tweaks—school bus zones, daylighted corners, no standing areas—drivers kept parking illegally, blocking sightlines and endangering children. The city rarely removes protected lanes, but Adams acted after political pressure. Moving the lane to Classon Avenue, as some demand, would force cyclists onto a chaotic BQE ramp. The decision highlights persistent driver violations and policy gaps that leave vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Steel and stone replace painted lines.</p><p class=mb3>The Brooklyn Paper reported on June 11, 2025, that NYC DOT will redesign intersections to protect cyclists and pedestrians. The plan uses 'hardened daylighting'—physical barriers, granite blocks, and planters—to stop cars from parking near corners. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' Nearly half of city traffic deaths happen at intersections, often due to blocked sightlines and turning vehicles. The redesign targets high-crash Brooklyn intersections first, including Ocean Avenue at Church Avenue. The move highlights the city's shift from painted lines to physical infrastructure, aiming to reduce systemic risk for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article quotes a boatswain: "It was too fast. When we came to see it, we were against the [bridge]. The three masts broke, and that was it." The sailor described shouting warnings as the ship drifted toward the bridge, but "no one reacted." Distress calls went out 45 seconds before impact. The crash happened less than five minutes after departure. The article details chaos on deck, with cadets thrown from rigging and the crew scrambling to rescue the injured. The cause remains under investigation, highlighting possible failures in navigation or communication. The incident raises questions about training, oversight, and safety protocols for large vessels in crowded urban waterways.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Change comes for riders and walkers.</p><p class=mb3>West Side Spirit reported on May 20, 2025, that the Department of Transportation (DOT) has proposed turning 34th Street into a mostly car-free busway, modeled after the 14th Street busway. The plan comes with support from three local community boards. According to the article, 'bus speeds on 14th Street increased by at least 24 percent, and bus ridership grew by 30 percent' after similar changes. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'far fewer New Yorkers are getting hurt in crashes' since the 14th Street redesign. The 34th Street proposal would divert most cars, add painted intersections for visibility, and focus on pedestrian safety. The move targets slow bus speeds—now just 3 mph—and aims to reduce systemic danger for bus riders and people on foot. No driver errors are cited, but the plan addresses longstanding risks from car traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
