Jamie Raskin spoke out for the Sarah Debbink Langenkamp Act, a federal bill reintroduced in Congress. The bill would allow state and local governments to use 100 percent federal funding for bike lanes and safety projects under the Transportation Alternatives Program. Raskin, in a Streetsblog NYC interview, declared, 'The carnage on our highways and roads is just intolerable.' He criticized ideological opposition to bike safety and called for robust federal investment. The bill also lets local, regional, and metropolitan governments nominate projects directly, bypassing unsupportive higher authorities. Raskin urged advocates to press their representatives for support, highlighting the deadly toll of current federal policies that block safer streets. The measure has not yet advanced to committee or vote.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states that a mother and her three children were crossing in the crosswalk with the pedestrian signal when the vehicle struck them. The impact killed the 34-year-old woman and two of her children, ages five and eight. A four-year-old boy was left unconscious and severely injured. The police report lists 'Traffic Control Disregarded' and 'Unsafe Speed' as contributing factors for the driver. The pedestrians were crossing with the signal, as documented in the report. The sedan's center front end struck the victims, underscoring the lethal consequences of ignoring traffic controls. The driver’s unlicensed status and disregard for the signal are central to this tragedy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The incident has reignited debate over pending Albany legislation that would require drivers with more than six speed-camera or red-light tickets to install speed limiters, capping their speed to five miles per hour above the limit. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said, "This was a horrific tragedy caused by someone who should not have been on the road," but did not address the bill. Transportation Alternatives Executive Director Ben Furnas condemned the status quo, stating, "There is legislation up in Albany that would have required a speed limiter in this very car." The bill has not yet advanced.

The law sits ignored. Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On March 14, 2025, the Department of Transportation released its annual report on the 2019 Streets Master Plan law. The report, required by the City Council, reveals the city missed mandates for protected bike lanes (29.3 of 50 miles) and bus lanes (17.9 of 30 miles) for the third year running. The matter summary states: 'New York City has failed to meet legally required benchmarks for redesigning streets for bikes, buses, and pedestrians due to a lack of resources and political interference.' Mayor Eric Adams is named as the main obstacle. The report cites staff shortages, shrinking divisions, and political pushback—especially the mayor’s role in killing the Fordham Road busway. Former DOT commissioner Polly Trottenberg warned the plan needed more funding and a new approach. Advocates and officials say Adams’s lack of support left the city’s most vulnerable road users exposed. The law’s promise is broken. The streets stay deadly.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists and walkers lose.</p><p class=mb3>On March 12, 2025, the U.S. Department of Transportation, led by Secretary Sean Duffy, ordered a halt on all discretionary grants for bike lanes and green infrastructure. The memo, citing Trump-era executive orders, targets projects advancing climate, equity, and safety goals. The review flags any project with equity analysis, green infrastructure, bicycle infrastructure, or EV charging for possible removal. Projects with fully obligated funds are exempt. Rep. Rick Larsen (D-Wash.) condemned the move, saying it 'ignores Congress and the law by slashing grants for bike and pedestrian infrastructure and EV charging.' Senator Ed Markey (D-Mass.) warned, 'Pedestrians and cyclists are going to die.' The League of American Bicyclists said the freeze will hurt communities and halt safety investments. Highway projects remain untouched. Vulnerable road users face greater danger as safety projects stall.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, organized by Make McGuinness Safe, follows the Adams administration's rollback of the original plan after political lobbying. Lander declared, "With street safety, City Hall and DOT are supposed to make the assessment: 'Will this project make things safer?' And if so, go ahead and do it." He criticized the current system as a 'corruption obstacle,' promising to implement the full road diet and streamline safety approvals. Lander's pledge centers community voices and rejects interference from wealthy donors. He invoked DOT data showing that redesigns save lives for all users. Other candidates, including Andrew Cuomo, have not signed the pledge.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
