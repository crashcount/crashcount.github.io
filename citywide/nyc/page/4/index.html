The article notes that the intersection is a known trouble spot, with Collins stating, "It's not a unicorn incident. It's happened a lot." The report highlights systemic issues: delivery app pressures, lack of regulation, and a street design that encourages risky moves.

Police explicitly cite 'Traffic Control Disregarded' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as contributing factors. The cyclist suffered fatal head injuries.

The letter urges the city to deliver a long-promised busway along the full length of 34th Street. The boards request widened sidewalks, bus stop bulb-outs, and dedicated loading and pickup/drop off zones. They write, 'this project would significantly improve the efficiency and livability of 34th Street for both commuters and pedestrians.' The boards cite the 14th Street busway, which increased bus speeds by 24 percent and ridership by 30 percent. Council members are not named, but the boards’ action is clear: they support the busway and pedestrian improvements. The letter calls these changes 'necessary and forward-thinking' for safety and congestion. Mayor Adams has lagged on bus lanes, painting just 5 miles per year, far below the City Council’s 30-mile goal.

The report, required by the City Council, reveals the city missed mandates for protected bike lanes (29.3 of 50 miles) and bus lanes (17.9 of 30 miles) for the third year running. The matter summary states: 'New York City has failed to meet legally required benchmarks for redesigning streets for bikes, buses, and pedestrians due to a lack of resources and political interference.' Mayor Eric Adams is named as the main obstacle. The report cites staff shortages, shrinking divisions, and political pushback—especially the mayor’s role in killing the Fordham Road busway. Former DOT commissioner Polly Trottenberg warned the plan needed more funding and a new approach. Advocates and officials say Adams’s lack of support left the city’s most vulnerable road users exposed. The law’s promise is broken.

The review flags any project with equity analysis, green infrastructure, bicycle infrastructure, or EV charging for possible removal. Projects with fully obligated funds are exempt. Rep. Rick Larsen (D-Wash.) condemned the move, saying it 'ignores Congress and the law by slashing grants for bike and pedestrian infrastructure and EV charging.' Senator Ed Markey (D-Mass.) warned, 'Pedestrians and cyclists are going to die.' The League of American Bicyclists said the freeze will hurt communities and halt safety investments.

The policy proposal, announced February 28, 2025, would add points to TLC licenses for each offense—one for the first, two for the second within 15 months, and increased fines for the third. Six points in 15 months could mean suspension; ten could mean revocation. The matter summary states, 'rules promise to increase safety for passengers, pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorists alike [and] target a relatively small group of repeat offenders.' TLC spokesperson Jason Kersten said the changes target repeat offenders who make streets dangerous. Street safety advocate Jehiah Czebotar and Transportation Alternatives director Ben Furnas support the proposal but call for automated camera enforcement to catch more violators.

The report states the sedan's front passenger, a 26-year-old woman, suffered fatal head injuries and died at the scene. The sedan's driver was unlicensed, as documented in the official vehicle records. The police report attributes the primary contributing factor to 'Unsafe Speed.' The narrative describes the sedan as 'slammed into a bus, then a parked box truck,' underscoring the violent sequence. No contributing factors related to the victim's behavior are cited in the report. The focus remains on the unlicensed driver’s excessive speed and the systemic danger posed by unqualified motorists operating vehicles on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The danger stays.</p><p class=mb3>According to the New York Post (February 27, 2025), off-duty FDNY firefighter Michael Pena drove through a red light at Northern Boulevard and 107th Street in Queens, striking Justin Diaz’s car. Surveillance video captured Pena’s Mercedes “passing a red light on Northern Boulevard and T-boning Diaz’s 2022 BMW.” Diaz, 23, died at Elmhurst Hospital. Pena faces charges of vehicular manslaughter, DWI, and refusal to take a breath test. Two passengers in Pena’s car were hospitalized. The FDNY suspended Pena for 28 days without pay. The crash highlights the lethal consequences of red-light running and impaired driving, raising questions about enforcement and accountability on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
