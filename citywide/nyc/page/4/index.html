An SUV hit him at the corner of Eastern Parkway and Albany Avenue. He was eight. The street is wide. The cars are fast. The city counts another child lost. Advocates <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/01/tuesdays-headlines-another-child-sacrificed-to-the-suv-edition>describe Eastern Parkway as a major thoroughfare for drivers and the sixth most dangerous street in Brooklyn for pedestrians</a>. The numbers do not stop. In the last twelve months, <strong>238 people have died</strong> on New York City streets. <strong>705 were seriously injured</strong>. Children, elders, cyclists, walkers—the city’s most vulnerable, crushed by steel and speed.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> In the current three-year period, they killed <strong>300 people</strong> and seriously injured <strong>509</strong> more. Trucks and buses killed <strong>93</strong> and seriously injured <strong>103</strong>. Motorcycles and mopeds killed <strong>10</strong> and seriously injured <strong>44</strong>. Bikes killed <strong>11</strong> and seriously injured <strong>54</strong>. The dead do not care about the make or model. They are gone all the same. The city’s own <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>data shows the pattern</a>. The violence is not random. It is built into the street.</p><h3 id=leaders-actor-dont>Leaders Act—Or Don’t</h3><p><strong>Some leaders move. Some stall. Some rip out what little safety we have.</strong> When the city tried to remove the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane, the Department of Transportation <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/dot-testimony-removing-bedford-ave-bike-lane-will-reduce-safety>warned that removing the protected bike lane won&rsquo;t remove cyclists—it will only make the street less safe</a>. The city risks legal liability for knowingly making a Vision Zero corridor more dangerous. Cyclists and parents begged to keep the lane. One parent <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/cyclists-tell-judge-carolyn-walker-diallo-the-bedford-ave-bike-lane-is-a-lifesaver>explained, &ldquo;Before the protected bike lane my wife made me promise to never bike the children on it because the driving behavior was so outrageous&mldr; Now the street is so much calmer.&rdquo;</a> Still, the fight drags on.</p><p>Elsewhere, the city installs new bike lanes, then threatens to cap e-bike speeds at 15 mph. A former DOT official <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/03/ex-dot-official-warns-nycs-counterproductive-e-bike-speed-limit-will-curb-biking-safety>called it &ldquo;a war on bikes, a war on immigrants, and it undermines traffic safety&rdquo;</a>. The city’s priorities shift with the wind. The bodies stay in the ground.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay, every rollback, every excuse is another name on a slab. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand streets where children can walk and live. Do not wait for the next siren.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The plan, supported by Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez and Transportation Alternatives, bans cars on a short stretch between Flushing and Johnson Avenues and removes parking at several corners for better visibility—a process known as daylighting. DOT will also narrow Scott Avenue further south and build a concrete pedestrian peninsula at Troutman Street, banning right turns onto Scott. The intersection, described as a 'crash hotspot' with 39 incidents since 2020, will see expanded pedestrian space and improved safety. Gutierrez noted increased foot traffic and little negative feedback. DOT claims the redesign can reduce deaths and serious injuries by up to 45 percent for pedestrians. Advocates say the changes will save lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article, titled 'Exclusive: Cops Writing 15% of Their Red Light Tix to Cyclists, Who are Just 2% of Road Users,' highlights a stark enforcement imbalance. Activists like Corey Hannigan and Sara Lind criticize the NYPD for targeting cyclists instead of drivers, who cause most crashes and deaths. Cyclist Lee calls the practice 'unjust.' Kate Brockwehl, injured by a car, says the policy shows 'windshield bias.' The Department of Transportation has proposed legalizing the 'Idaho Stop' for cyclists, but City Hall has blocked it. Cyclists like John Surico and George Calderaro say most tickets come from coordinated police actions, not real safety concerns. The data shows enforcement priorities ignore who poses real danger on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A 61-year-old man was standing in the roadway when the truck struck him head-on. The report states, 'His body crushed. He died there, in the Bronx morning, as the city stirred.' The point of impact was the center front end of the truck. The police report lists 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a contributing factor. The pedestrian was not at an intersection and was engaged in 'Other Actions in Roadway' at the time. No driver errors are cited in the report. The focus remains on the deadly consequences of a truck pulling out as a person stood in the street.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Lander stressed his record: 'By the time I'm done, you're going to have a lot more bus and bike infrastructure, more of the neighborhood loading zones that use the curb, more of those shared containers, especially in denser areas.' He contrasted his approach with the Adams administration, calling out backroom deals and broken promises. Lander cited his support for protected bike lanes, even when facing opposition. He pledged to make it easier for families to use e-cargo bikes by building safer routes. Lander committed to expanding the Fourth Avenue bike lane to Bay Ridge and reducing car space citywide. He promised 'world-class DOT and transportation leadership.' No formal safety analysis was provided, but Lander’s stance centers vulnerable road users and systemic change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danger stays on the street.</p><p class=mb3>On April 16, 2025, Mayor Adams’s administration postponed the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) Third Avenue safety redesign in Brooklyn. The plan, not yet assigned a council bill number, aimed to cut car lanes, add a protected bike lane, and install pedestrian islands. The DOT cited the need for more public input after business leaders, led by the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce, protested. The matter summary reads: 'The Department of Transportation (DOT) planned to reduce car lanes and add a protected bike lane and pedestrian islands, but business leaders...protested.' Community board support was strong. Streetsblog NYC reported that 68 percent of locals backed the changes. Council members were not named, but business owners and advocates like Jon Orcutt and Jim of Bagels By the Park spoke out. The administration’s delay leaves proven safety measures on hold, exposing vulnerable road users to continued risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
