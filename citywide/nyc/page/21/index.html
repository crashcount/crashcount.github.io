The vehicle was making a left turn through the crosswalk when it hit the child. The report states the girl was 'crossing with the signal' at the intersection. The driver failed to yield the right-of-way and was also cited for 'Driver Inattention/Distraction.' The impact crushed the girl beneath the front end of the SUV, resulting in fatal injuries to her entire body.

It would cut vehicle lanes from four to two, reduce parking, and add a two-way protected bike lane. The proposal also calls for more trees, rain gardens, outdoor dining, public seating, bus boarding islands, and dedicated delivery zones. Buses would move faster, and crossing distances would shrink. Streetopia’s vision addresses long-standing safety concerns and public calls for less sidewalk crowding and safer crossings. The Department of Transportation has not acted, despite clear demand for change.

The measure, debated since the 1970s and authorized in the 2019 state budget, now faces legal challenges that could delay its planned mid-June launch. The board's action, described as 'a monumental shift that will be felt by millions of New Yorkers,' aims to reduce traffic and raise $15 billion for the MTA's capital plan. Board members like Midori Valdivia and David Jones voiced strong support, emphasizing the benefit to working New Yorkers who rely on public transit. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber defended the plan's environmental review. The vote marks a turning point in the city's effort to prioritize transit and safety for those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
