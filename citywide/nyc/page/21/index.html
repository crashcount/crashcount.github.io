An SUV hit him at the intersection. His name is not in the data. His age is. The street is busy. The city calls it one of the most dangerous for walkers. The group said, <strong>"[Eastern Parkway] acts as a major thoroughfare for drivers, and is the sixth most dangerous street in Brooklyn for pedestrians"</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/01/tuesdays-headlines-another-child-sacrificed-to-the-suv-edition>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>Fourteen people were hurt when a van slammed into a tree in Brooklyn. Twelve of them were adults with special needs, headed to a day program. The driver swerved to avoid another car. A witness said, <strong>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sad because they definitely need a lot of attention more than anyone else. I hope that they&rsquo;re all OK at the end of the day&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/transport-van-crashes-tree-bath-beach-brooklyn-injuring-14-people/16903098/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>A 17-year-old died riding a moped. A 39-year-old was killed on a motorcycle. The list goes on. In the past 12 months, <strong>244 people have died</strong> on city streets. <strong>709 were seriously injured</strong>.

Governor Hochul said, <strong>&ldquo;Speed cameras save lives and keep New Yorkers safe. There is no greater priority for me than the safety of New Yorkers&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>amNY</a>). Cameras slow some drivers. But the dead keep coming.</p><p>Protected bike lanes work. The city’s own Department of Transportation warned, <strong>&ldquo;Removing the protected bike lane won&rsquo;t remove cyclists—it will only make the street less safe&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/dot-testimony-removing-bedford-ave-bike-lane-will-reduce-safety>Streetsblog NYC</a>). Still, the mayor ripped out the Bedford Avenue lane. Cyclists are left exposed. The city risks more deaths, more grief.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-are-names>The Numbers Are Names</h3><p>SUVs and cars kill most. In three years, <strong>cars and SUVs killed 300 people</strong> and left thousands more broken. Trucks and buses killed 93. Motorcycles and mopeds killed 10. Bikes killed 11.

They are mothers, sons, neighbors.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another body on the street.</strong> Call your council member.

Brooklyn pavement took another life.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a northbound Mazda sedan struck a 71-year-old woman as she crossed Eldert Street near Knickerbocker Avenue in a marked crosswalk. She suffered fatal crush wounds and never regained consciousness. A second pedestrian, age 44, was also hit and sustained chest contusions but remained conscious. The report states the Mazda driver was unlicensed and disregarded traffic control. 'Traffic Control Disregarded' and 'Unsafe Speed' are listed as contributing factors. The victims were crossing without a signal but within a marked crosswalk, as documented in the report.

The board called on the Department of Transportation to replace corner parking with physical infrastructure like curb extensions. The matter summary: 'Enforcing the Daylighting Law in our community would significantly increase visibility, which would protect pedestrians, drivers, cyclists and all other road users.' Lucia Deng, chair of the Municipal Services committee, led the push, saying, 'The focus was on intersections and why they are the most dangerous for car crashes and how this just benefits everybody.' The board’s vote was nearly unanimous, with no dissent and one abstention. The resolution highlights that more than half of pedestrian deaths and nearly eight in ten injuries occur at intersections. The board’s action joins a growing citywide movement to prioritize people over parking at dangerous corners.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
