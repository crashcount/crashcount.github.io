The measure, described as a 'hard-fought rule change,' exempts roads with three or more lanes outside Manhattan and requires 60 days of community notice before changes. Amy Cohen, Sammy’s mother and Families for Safe Streets co-founder, called the bill 'a step forward, though not perfect.' Sara Lind of Open Plans called it 'a huge victory,' but noted the carve-outs leave many dangerous streets untouched.

Local business owners like Vincent Zeccardi of Caffe Roma and John Michael Rossi of Rossi & Co support the move, citing safety and neighborhood charm.

It would cut vehicle lanes from four to two, reduce parking, and add a two-way protected bike lane. The proposal also calls for more trees, rain gardens, outdoor dining, public seating, bus boarding islands, and dedicated delivery zones. Buses would move faster, and crossing distances would shrink.
