Deaths outside cars now make up 36 percent of all road fatalities. Regulators tout small gains, but the bloodshed for vulnerable users deepens. Hit-and-runs surge. Systemic failure persists.</p><p class=mb3>On April 2, 2024, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration released final 2022 and preliminary 2023 traffic fatality numbers. The agency’s summary highlights a modest dip in overall deaths, but the details are stark: 'drivers had killed more cyclists (1,105) than they had in any single year in the entire history of the reporting system—and pedestrian deaths (7,522) were the highest since 1981.' Vulnerable road users now account for 36 percent of all fatalities, up from 20 percent in 1996. Hit-and-run deaths and serious injuries for pedestrians and cyclists both rose 11 percent. Tami Friedrich of the Truck Safety Coalition demanded urgent federal action, stating, 'No one else needs to die because of bureaucratic inaction.' Advocates and Vision Zero supporters call for systemic reforms—speed limiters, automatic braking, safer trucks, and better infrastructure. Until agencies act, the carnage continues, masked by official optimism.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The board's action, described as 'a monumental shift that will be felt by millions of New Yorkers,' aims to reduce traffic and raise $15 billion for the MTA's capital plan. Board members like Midori Valdivia and David Jones voiced strong support, emphasizing the benefit to working New Yorkers who rely on public transit. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber defended the plan's environmental review.

She states, "Heightened enforcement or non-carceral punishment against those drivers should not be controversial... [It] would make New York City’s roads substantially safer without harming the average driver."
