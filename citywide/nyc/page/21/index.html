Scholar Nicole Gelinas analyzed over 200 fatal crashes from 2022 and found that 47 deaths could have been prevented if the city had removed vehicles with five or more red-light or speed camera tickets in a year. Gelinas urges the city and state to escalate fines after two violations, revoke registrations for repeat offenders, and revive the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program. She states, "Heightened enforcement or non-carceral punishment against those drivers should not be controversial... [It] would make New York City’s roads substantially safer without harming the average driver." Gelinas emphasizes that a small group of drivers cause outsized harm, and that enforcement saves lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Since 2021, officials have delayed a promised project to give pedestrians their own lane on the Queensboro Bridge. The Department of Transportation, under Mayor Adams, has stalled the revamp, citing the need to keep seven of nine car lanes open. The matter: 'the path is too narrow for bi-directional, shared use between cyclists and pedestrians.' Laura Shepard, an advocate, calls it 'appalling that the convenience of drivers is prioritized over the lives and limbs of cyclists and pedestrians.' At least 23 crashes have injured 25 people since 2021. Bike ridership hit a record 1.98 million crossings in 2023. The city’s inaction keeps vulnerable road users at risk while car traffic takes priority.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
