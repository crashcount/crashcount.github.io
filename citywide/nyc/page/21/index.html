The collision occurred as the e-bike rider was making a left turn, while the BMW was traveling straight ahead. The report lists 'Turning Improperly' as a contributing factor in the crash. The impact ejected the cyclist, causing fatal head injuries described as 'crush injuries.' The police report notes the victim was not wearing a helmet, but this detail is mentioned only after the driver error. The violence of the crash and the fatal outcome underscore the lethal consequences when drivers fail to yield or turn improperly.

The law, named for Sammy Cohen Eckstein, killed by a driver in 2013, carves out wide, fast roads in the outer boroughs. Advocates call it progress, but not enough. Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On April 18, 2024, Governor Hochul announced a deal to pass Sammy’s Law in the state budget. The bill, named after 12-year-old Sammy Cohen Eckstein, lets New York City lower its maximum speed limit from 25 to 20 miles per hour. The measure, described as a 'hard-fought rule change,' exempts roads with three or more lanes outside Manhattan and requires 60 days of community notice before changes. Amy Cohen, Sammy’s mother and Families for Safe Streets co-founder, called the bill 'a step forward, though not perfect.' Sara Lind of Open Plans called it 'a huge victory,' but noted the carve-outs leave many dangerous streets untouched. Mayor Adams’s office praised the law, citing the need for more tools to protect New Yorkers. The law’s passage marks progress for vulnerable road users, but leaves key gaps where speed and risk remain high.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It would cut vehicle lanes from four to two, reduce parking, and add a two-way protected bike lane.

Deaths outside cars now make up 36 percent of all road fatalities. Regulators tout small gains, but the bloodshed for vulnerable users deepens. Hit-and-runs surge. Systemic failure persists.</p><p class=mb3>On April 2, 2024, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration released final 2022 and preliminary 2023 traffic fatality numbers. The agency’s summary highlights a modest dip in overall deaths, but the details are stark: 'drivers had killed more cyclists (1,105) than they had in any single year in the entire history of the reporting system—and pedestrian deaths (7,522) were the highest since 1981.' Vulnerable road users now account for 36 percent of all fatalities, up from 20 percent in 1996. Hit-and-run deaths and serious injuries for pedestrians and cyclists both rose 11 percent. Tami Friedrich of the Truck Safety Coalition demanded urgent federal action, stating, 'No one else needs to die because of bureaucratic inaction.' Advocates and Vision Zero supporters call for systemic reforms—speed limiters, automatic braking, safer trucks, and better infrastructure. Until agencies act, the carnage continues, masked by official optimism.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, debated since the 1970s and authorized in the 2019 state budget, now faces legal challenges that could delay its planned mid-June launch. The board's action, described as 'a monumental shift that will be felt by millions of New Yorkers,' aims to reduce traffic and raise $15 billion for the MTA's capital plan. Board members like Midori Valdivia and David Jones voiced strong support, emphasizing the benefit to working New Yorkers who rely on public transit. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber defended the plan's environmental review. The vote marks a turning point in the city's effort to prioritize transit and safety for those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
