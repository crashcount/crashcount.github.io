The city’s plan keeps eight car lanes, weak bike protection, and slow buses. Cyclists dodge cars. Bus riders wait. Drivers rule. Real safety demands fewer car lanes, center bus lanes, and true bike barriers.</p><p class=mb3>This opinion piece, published April 26, 2022, calls out the Department of Transportation’s plan for Queens Boulevard. The plan, part of the 'Great Streets' project, keeps eight car lanes and installs only lightly protected bike lanes with mountable curbs. Samuel Santaella, the author, writes: 'the department has discriminated against thousands of bikers and 13,630 pre-pandemic daily bus riders in order to privilege the needs of 40,000 daily motorists.' Santaella opposes the current DOT plan and urges a redesign: reduce car lanes to four, add center-running bus lanes, fully separated bikeways, and wider sidewalks. He warns that mountable curbs let drivers invade bike lanes, putting cyclists at risk. Bus riders see little benefit, still stuck behind double-parked cars. The piece demands the city stop favoring drivers and start protecting vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states, 'Traffic fatalities are up 44 percent so far this year—the deadliest start to any year since Vision Zero launched.'

Elke Weiss of Families for Safe Streets urged passage of the Crash Victim Rights and Safety Act, saying, 'Crossing the street should not be a life-or-death risk.'

The analysis finds that combining restrictions on driving with incentives for sustainable travel is key. It warns that electric vehicles alone are not enough, and that city governments must act boldly. The piece states, 'reducing car use should be an urgent priority' to improve health, climate, and livability. No council member is named; this is an advocacy review, not a legislative action. The article underscores that only systemic change can protect vulnerable road users and make streets safer.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Big promise.</p><p class=mb3>On April 1, 2022, Mayor Eric Adams announced a sweeping plan to convert Manhattan’s Third Avenue into the city’s first 'bike superhighway.' The proposal, revealed in a mayoral policy announcement, would turn four of the avenue’s six lanes into protected bike lanes with a buffer, reserving the remaining two for buses. The plan would stretch from 24th Street to 125th Street. Adams declared, 'Getting stuff done means actually getting stuff done for New Yorkers.' He cited his campaign promise and support for Transportation Alternatives’ '25X25' campaign to reclaim public space from cars. The city claims this single project would achieve 22.7 percent of the campaign’s goal. No formal council bill or committee action is attached. The announcement, made at City Hall, signals Adams’s public commitment to bold street redesigns, but the story was later revealed as an April Fool’s satire.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
