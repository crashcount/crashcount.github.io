Big promise.</p><p class=mb3>On April 1, 2022, Mayor Eric Adams announced a sweeping plan to convert Manhattan’s Third Avenue into the city’s first 'bike superhighway.' The proposal, revealed in a mayoral policy announcement, would turn four of the avenue’s six lanes into protected bike lanes with a buffer, reserving the remaining two for buses. The plan would stretch from 24th Street to 125th Street. Adams declared, 'Getting stuff done means actually getting stuff done for New Yorkers.' He cited his campaign promise and support for Transportation Alternatives’ '25X25' campaign to reclaim public space from cars. The city claims this single project would achieve 22.7 percent of the campaign’s goal. No formal council bill or committee action is attached. The announcement, made at City Hall, signals Adams’s public commitment to bold street redesigns, but the story was later revealed as an April Fool’s satire.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The study, titled 'Study: Megacar Drivers Up to 4x More Likely to Hit Walkers While Turning,' points to design flaws—especially wide A-pillars and high, boxy fronts—that create deadly blind spots. Dr. Wen Hu, senior transportation research engineer, said, 'We really need to systematically study the impact of A-pillar design on pedestrian visibility.' The report calls out federal regulators for failing to address these hazards. It urges action on vehicle design, left-turn bans in pedestrian areas, and right-on-red bans.
