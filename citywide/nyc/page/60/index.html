An SUV hit him at the intersection. His name is not in the data. His age is. The street is busy. The city calls it one of the most dangerous for walkers. The group said, <strong>"[Eastern Parkway] acts as a major thoroughfare for drivers, and is the sixth most dangerous street in Brooklyn for pedestrians"</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/01/tuesdays-headlines-another-child-sacrificed-to-the-suv-edition>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>Fourteen people were hurt when a van slammed into a tree in Brooklyn. Twelve of them were adults with special needs, headed to a day program. The driver swerved to avoid another car. A witness said, <strong>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sad because they definitely need a lot of attention more than anyone else. I hope that they&rsquo;re all OK at the end of the day&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/transport-van-crashes-tree-bath-beach-brooklyn-injuring-14-people/16903098/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>A 17-year-old died riding a moped. A 39-year-old was killed on a motorcycle. The list goes on. In the past 12 months, <strong>244 people have died</strong> on city streets. <strong>709 were seriously injured</strong>.

Governor Hochul said, <strong>&ldquo;Speed cameras save lives and keep New Yorkers safe. There is no greater priority for me than the safety of New Yorkers&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>amNY</a>). Cameras slow some drivers. But the dead keep coming.</p><p>Protected bike lanes work. The city’s own Department of Transportation warned, <strong>&ldquo;Removing the protected bike lane won&rsquo;t remove cyclists—it will only make the street less safe&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/dot-testimony-removing-bedford-ave-bike-lane-will-reduce-safety>Streetsblog NYC</a>).

The city risks more deaths, more grief.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-are-names>The Numbers Are Names</h3><p>SUVs and cars kill most. In three years, <strong>cars and SUVs killed 300 people</strong> and left thousands more broken. Trucks and buses killed 93. Motorcycles and mopeds killed 10. Bikes killed 11.

They are mothers, sons, neighbors.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another body on the street.</strong> Call your council member.

The plan, part of the 'Great Streets' project, keeps eight car lanes and installs only lightly protected bike lanes with mountable curbs. Samuel Santaella, the author, writes: 'the department has discriminated against thousands of bikers and 13,630 pre-pandemic daily bus riders in order to privilege the needs of 40,000 daily motorists.' Santaella opposes the current DOT plan and urges a redesign: reduce car lanes to four, add center-running bus lanes, fully separated bikeways, and wider sidewalks. He warns that mountable curbs let drivers invade bike lanes, putting cyclists at risk. Bus riders see little benefit, still stuck behind double-parked cars.
