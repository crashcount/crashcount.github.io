She wants a single point of command to cut through city chaos. Her bills aim to end deadly delays, speed up safe street fixes, and give vulnerable road users a fighting chance.</p><p class=mb3>On April 29, 2022, Council Member Carlina Rivera reintroduced a pair of bills to create offices for a bike and a pedestrian 'mayor.' The bills, tied to the Streets Master Plan, seek to centralize and coordinate city efforts for safer streets. Rivera said, 'you do need a point person and an office to coordinate all of this.' She cited recent deaths and injuries among cyclists and pedestrians, and the city's failure to meet Vision Zero goals. Rivera's People-Powered Mobility agenda also includes a Greenways Master Plan and a real-time bike lane map. The bills are not yet law, but City Hall is more open to them than before. Rivera's push aims to give vulnerable road users a voice and force city agencies to act. No safety analyst note was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Injury crashes fell 37 percent; overall crashes dropped 17 percent. Drivers yielded to pedestrians 27 percent more often. Despite these results, the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices may ban asphalt art, citing concerns about autonomous vehicles and accessibility for low-vision pedestrians. Janette Sadik-Khan called the projects "real results for just pennies on the dollar." Mike Flynn urged more study on accessibility.

The 84th Precinct in Downtown Brooklyn was named the worst offender, with officers racking up speeding tickets, blocking hydrants, and abusing placards. Council Member Lincoln Restler, who represents the area, condemned the precinct’s behavior as 'petty, but pervasive corruption' and pledged to push for aggressive legislation and enforcement. Restler has previously called for eliminating parking placards entirely. Streetsblog’s study found that precinct blocks see more crashes than nearby streets, linking NYPD misconduct to increased danger for vulnerable road users. The issue is framed as a threat to public safety and neighborhood respect.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states, 'Traffic fatalities are up 44 percent so far this year—the deadliest start to any year since Vision Zero launched.' Danny Harris, executive director of Transportation Alternatives, called on Mayor Adams to include the City Council’s $3.1 billion Streets Master Plan request and to fast-track redesigns of 1,000 intersections. Elke Weiss of Families for Safe Streets urged passage of the Crash Victim Rights and Safety Act, saying, 'Crossing the street should not be a life-or-death risk.' The report urges more car-free space, stronger driver accountability, and expanded speed and red-light camera programs.

The proposal, now under budget review, seeks to fund at least 500 miles of new bus lanes, 500 miles of protected bike lanes, 38 million square feet of pedestrian space, and 40 miles of car-free busways. The Council’s action responds to the mayor’s $98.5 billion budget and aims to surpass the targets set by the Department of Transportation’s NYC Streets Plan. Adams stated, “To secure an equitable recovery for our city and improve public safety, we must focus on robust investments that strengthen our communities.” The Council’s push highlights the urgent need for safe, accessible streets and addresses the city’s funding gap for critical infrastructure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Four lanes for bikes. Two for buses. Activists demanded less. Adams promises more. The city claims this move grabs back nearly a quarter of public space from cars. Bold words. Deadly street. Big promise.</p><p class=mb3>On April 1, 2022, Mayor Eric Adams announced a sweeping plan to convert Manhattan’s Third Avenue into the city’s first 'bike superhighway.' The proposal, revealed in a mayoral policy announcement, would turn four of the avenue’s six lanes into protected bike lanes with a buffer, reserving the remaining two for buses. The plan would stretch from 24th Street to 125th Street. Adams declared, 'Getting stuff done means actually getting stuff done for New Yorkers.' He cited his campaign promise and support for Transportation Alternatives’ '25X25' campaign to reclaim public space from cars. The city claims this single project would achieve 22.7 percent of the campaign’s goal. No formal council bill or committee action is attached. The announcement, made at City Hall, signals Adams’s public commitment to bold street redesigns, but the story was later revealed as an April Fool’s satire.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
