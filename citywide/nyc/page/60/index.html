The article, titled 'The 12 Best Ways to Get Cars out of Cities, Ranked,' reviews research on measures like congestion charges, parking reform, car-free streets, and expanded bike lanes. The analysis finds that combining restrictions on driving with incentives for sustainable travel is key. It warns that electric vehicles alone are not enough, and that city governments must act boldly. The piece states, 'reducing car use should be an urgent priority' to improve health, climate, and livability. No council member is named; this is an advocacy review, not a legislative action. The article underscores that only systemic change can protect vulnerable road users and make streets safer.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal, revealed in a mayoral policy announcement, would turn four of the avenue’s six lanes into protected bike lanes with a buffer, reserving the remaining two for buses. The plan would stretch from 24th Street to 125th Street. Adams declared, 'Getting stuff done means actually getting stuff done for New Yorkers.' He cited his campaign promise and support for Transportation Alternatives’ '25X25' campaign to reclaim public space from cars. The city claims this single project would achieve 22.7 percent of the campaign’s goal. No formal council bill or committee action is attached. The announcement, made at City Hall, signals Adams’s public commitment to bold street redesigns, but the story was later revealed as an April Fool’s satire.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The study, titled 'Study: Megacar Drivers Up to 4x More Likely to Hit Walkers While Turning,' points to design flaws—especially wide A-pillars and high, boxy fronts—that create deadly blind spots. Dr. Wen Hu, senior transportation research engineer, said, 'We really need to systematically study the impact of A-pillar design on pedestrian visibility.'

Streets remain deadly for walkers and riders.</p><p class=mb3>On March 9, 2022, advocates responded to President Biden’s announcement to halt Russian oil imports. The statement, covered by Streetsblog NYC, criticized the administration for focusing on gas prices instead of tackling America’s deep car dependence. The article’s title: 'Advocates to Biden: Car Dependence — Not Gas Prices — Is America’s Real Crisis.' No council bill or vote was involved. Advocates urged immediate and long-term measures: speed limit caps, carpooling, car-free days, tactical urbanism, and better transit funding. They condemned decades of federal subsidies for driving and the neglect of public transit and active transportation. The piece stressed that reducing car dependence is vital for safety and for protecting vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, and transit riders—who remain at risk under the current system.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
