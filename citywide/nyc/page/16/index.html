A teenager dies in Brooklyn. A pedestrian is crushed in Harlem. <strong>In the last twelve months, 247 people have died on New York City streets.</strong> Over 49,000 have been injured. More than 700 were left with wounds so deep they will never fully heal. The city calls these numbers progress. They are not progress. They are names turned to numbers, families turned to silence.</p><p><strong>The dead are young and old.</strong> Thirteen children did not make it home. Forty-seven people aged 25 to 34 died. The city’s most vulnerable—those on foot, on bikes, on mopeds—pay the highest price. The violence does not stop. It only waits for the next name.</p><h2 id=the-system-streets-built-for-speed-not-safety>The System: Streets Built for Speed, Not Safety</h2><p><strong>Cars and trucks do the most harm.</strong> In the last twelve months, they killed 299 people and injured 26,826. Motorcycles and mopeds killed 21 and injured 2,519. Bikes killed 11 and injured 1,452. The city blames the victims. The city blames the weather. The city blames anything but the street and the wheel.</p><p>A cyclist is thrown from her bike and into a parked car. The driver flees. The police chase ends with a body on the pavement. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/staten-island-man-charged-with-murder-in-hit-and-run-crash-with-queens-cyclist>&ldquo;The defendant allegedly led police on a 10-minute chase through the crowded streets,&rdquo; said the Queens District Attorney</a>.

The city moves on.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-delays-and-the-cost-of-waiting>Leadership: Promises, Delays, and the Cost of Waiting</h2><p><strong>Leaders talk of Vision Zero.</strong> They promise safer intersections, lower speed limits, more cameras. They remove a protected bike lane in Williamsburg. They cap e-bike speeds. They stall on secure bike parking. The city acts when the blood is fresh, then forgets.</p><p>A parent stands in the street and says, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/11/brooklyn-parents-push-for-paris-style-school-street>&ldquo;There is just this sense of impending doom, it’s an obvious danger and if nothing is being done, another terrible thing will happen.&rdquo;</a> The city listens. Then the city waits.</p><h2 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every death is preventable. Every injury is a choice made by those in power. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes that cannot be erased. Demand streets built for people, not for cars.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name. Act now.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

According to the police report, the crash was caused by 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Unsafe Speed.' The motorcycle rider, a 31-year-old man, was ejected and suffered fatal crush injuries, dying at the scene. The report states the SUV was 'Making Left Turn' while the motorcycle was 'Going Straight Ahead.' The police report also cites 'Turning Improperly' as a contributing factor. The victim wore a helmet, but the impact proved unsurvivable. The focus remains on the SUV driver's failure to yield and improper turning, which led directly to the fatal impact.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The contributing factor listed is 'Traffic Control Disregarded.' This means a driver ignored a traffic signal, a critical error that led to the crash. The impact was severe: a 21-year-old woman, riding as a front passenger, was killed. Her injuries were described as affecting her entire body, and she was pronounced dead at the scene. The report notes a parked box truck was present but was not involved in the collision. No driver or vehicle errors are attributed to the victim.

The proposal, supported by 41 local businesses, aims to protect cyclists and pedestrians between Dean Street and Flushing Avenue. As the article states, 'the majority of cyclists using Bedford Avenue... are traveling to homes and businesses in Bedford-Stuyvesant or Clinton Hill,' countering claims that safety projects don’t benefit locals. McKendree Key, founder of Artshack, and Replica analyst Arthur Getman both highlight the urgent need for safer infrastructure. Crash data shows injuries and fatalities rising during the delay: 97 crashes in the first half of 2024, injuring six cyclists, twelve pedestrians, and killing one pedestrian. The Adams administration faces criticism for its pattern of transportation project delays, leaving vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Adams said, "Harlem deserves better from its leaders, and Harlem residents deserve truly safe streets." This tragedy highlights a citywide crisis: pedestrian deaths are up 55% this year.

Cyclists had long complained about cars blocking the lane and weak separation. The city has installed similar barriers elsewhere on Vernon Boulevard and plans a new bike boulevard on 31st Avenue later this summer. No council members are named in this action.

A new map shows daily crashes, injuries, and deaths in the toll zone. Vulnerable people—kids, seniors, disabled—face relentless danger. The city loses a proven fix. The carnage rolls on.</p><p class=mb3>On July 2, 2024, Streetsblog NYC reported on the fallout from Governor Kathy Hochul’s decision to halt New York’s congestion pricing plan. The article, titled 'New Map Shows The Traffic Violence Toll Of Hochul’s Congestion Pricing Cowardice,' highlights a new interactive map by Transpo Maps. The map tracks crashes, injuries, and fatalities in lower Manhattan’s would-be tolling zone. Stephen Braitsch, a map creator, said, 'It's really unfair to have those folks be under constant siege by all this unnecessary vehicle traffic.' The federal government expected congestion pricing to cut vehicle numbers by 17 percent. London saw crashes drop 40 percent after similar measures. Hochul’s move, announced in June, blocks these safety gains. Vulnerable residents—many without cars—remain exposed to daily harm.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states the teen was 'unlicensed and bareheaded' when he struck the bus and was ejected from his motorscooter, suffering fatal head injuries. The bus, registered in New Jersey, was traveling west and was struck on its right front bumper. The police report lists the boy as unlicensed and not wearing any safety equipment. Contributing factors are marked as 'Unspecified' in the report. The narrative emphasizes the severity of the impact and the absence of a helmet, but does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor before listing the lack of helmet use. The focus remains on the systemic dangers present when young, unlicensed individuals operate motor vehicles on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the SUV 'slammed forward in the dark,' with the 'metal folded at the front.' The driver, who was alone in the vehicle and wearing a lap belt and harness, suffered fatal head crush injuries and was found dead behind the wheel. The report notes the driver was 'unlicensed,' a critical systemic failure. No other people were involved or injured in the crash. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified,' but the absence of a valid license stands out as a key driver error. No mention is made of any victim behavior contributing to the crash. The impact and aftermath underscore the persistent dangers on city roads when unlicensed drivers operate vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

These states, already among the deadliest for walkers, set these targets under federal law, which mandates reporting but not ambition. The report states: 'Seven states have set formal federal goals to increase pedestrian fatalities in 2024.' Heidi Simon of Smart Growth America denounced the move, saying, 'I don't think there's any defensible reason to set targets that show an increase in fatalities.' Simon urges Congress to close the loophole and require states to set declining fatality targets. She highlights that regressive targets send a chilling message and fail to address racial disparities in pedestrian deaths. No council members are named; this is a policy critique and advocacy call.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
