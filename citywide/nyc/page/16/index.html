The move, not a council bill but a major policy action, stopped new tolls for drivers entering Manhattan’s core. Hochul claimed she was protecting working-class commuters. But as advocates point out, 'the vast majority of people driving into the CBD are more affluent.' Data shows over 60 percent of car commuters make more than $100,000 a year. Only 13.7 percent of education, healthcare, and social assistance workers drive to Manhattan. The pause strips $16.5 billion from transit upgrades, hurting the 900,000-plus daily transit riders. Renae Reynolds and Danny Pearlstein, transit advocates, slammed the decision. They argue it blocks an 'equitable economic recovery' and leaves vulnerable New Yorkers stranded on slow, crowded trains and buses.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Crash data shows injuries and fatalities rising during the delay: 97 crashes in the first half of 2024, injuring six cyclists, twelve pedestrians, and killing one pedestrian.

Seventeen pedestrians have died this year.</p><p class=mb3>On July 11, 2024, an SUV driver killed a three-year-old girl and injured her mother and two brothers in Harlem. The family crossed with the walk sign when the driver made a left turn and hit them. The driver was not arrested. The intersection, with two wide four-lane roads and little pedestrian infrastructure, has seen 14 crashes in the past year. Advocates, including Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives, condemned city officials for blaming pedestrians and resisting jaywalking reform. Adams said, "Harlem deserves better from its leaders, and Harlem residents deserve truly safe streets." This tragedy highlights a citywide crisis: pedestrian deaths are up 55% this year. The corner’s design encourages dangerous driving and fails to protect people on foot.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the child was 'crossing with the signal' when the 2020 Nissan SUV hit her in the head at the 'center front end' of the vehicle, which sustained damage there. The driver was licensed and operating the vehicle legally. The report lists contributing factors as 'Unspecified' but highlights the driver’s action of making a left turn into a crosswalk occupied by a pedestrian. The narrative states, 'She died there on the street. The front end bore the mark of her final moment.'

The project added concrete barriers and flexi-posts between 33rd Road and 35th Avenue, closing gaps that left cyclists exposed to traffic. DOT’s summary states, 'The Vernon Boulevard protected bike lane is safer than ever outside Rainey Park thanks to new barriers and flexi-posts.' Cyclists had long complained about cars blocking the lane and weak separation. The city has installed similar barriers elsewhere on Vernon Boulevard and plans a new bike boulevard on 31st Avenue later this summer. No council members are named in this action. The upgrades follow incidents of vehicle blockages and a recent NYPD chase that left a cyclist critically injured.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The map tracks crashes, injuries, and fatalities in lower Manhattan’s would-be tolling zone. Stephen Braitsch, a map creator, said, 'It's really unfair to have those folks be under constant siege by all this unnecessary vehicle traffic.' The federal government expected congestion pricing to cut vehicle numbers by 17 percent. London saw crashes drop 40 percent after similar measures.
