A black SUV hit him. He died on the street. The driver stayed. Police said, &ldquo;They were walking, he was crossing the street with his sister&rdquo; (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>police said</a>). No arrest. The street is still open. The danger is still there.</p><p>The day before, in the Bronx, a man ran a red light. His car jumped the curb and crushed three people on the sidewalk. One is still fighting for life. The driver ran but police caught him. He faces charges for assault, fleeing, and driving without a license (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/driver-flees-bronx-car-stop-crash/>faces charges</a>).</p><p><strong>In the last 12 months, 244 people have died on New York City streets. 713 were seriously hurt.</strong> Thirteen of the dead were children. The city logs over 81,000 crashes a year. Each number is a name, a family, a future gone.</p><h3 id=the-policy-that-wasnt>The Policy That Wasn&rsquo;t</h3><p>Leaders talk. Streets stay the same. The mayor ripped out a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue after crashes involving children. He said he was listening to the community. Cyclists said, &ldquo;I don’t think he cares if we die&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/cyclists-fuming-over-mayor-adamss-removal-of-bedford-avenue-protected-bike-lane>Cyclists said</a>). The city put back paint. Paint does not stop cars.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Department of Transportation built a new protected bike lane in Queens. A commuter said, &ldquo;The old street was very dangerous&mldr; the new path is definitely safer because he&rsquo;s no longer competing with trucks and cars for road space&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/27/eyes-on-the-street-new-bike-lane-puts-the-bliss-in-blissville>A commuter said</a>). But these changes come slow. Too slow for the dead.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-that-dont-lie>The Numbers That Don&rsquo;t Lie</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks killed 299 people.</strong> Motorcycles and mopeds killed 21. Bikes killed 11. The city counts 182,570 injuries since 2022. The bodies pile up. The city debates.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call your council member. Call the mayor.

The action, detailed in 'Disabled NYer’s are Victims of Gov. Hochul’s Congestion Pricing Pause,' leaves tens of thousands without access. Michelle Alcaraz and Ray Ray, both disabled New Yorkers, are forced to travel far from home or avoid transit altogether. The MTA’s $16 billion in scheduled repairs, including crucial accessibility upgrades, is now in limbo. Joe Rappaport of the Brooklyn Center for the Independence of the Disabled called on the governor and legislature to restore funding, warning that the lack of elevators treats disabled riders as 'second-class citizens.' The pause keeps stations dangerous for parents, caregivers, and the disabled.

The move, not a council bill but a major policy action, stopped new tolls for drivers entering Manhattan’s core. Hochul claimed she was protecting working-class commuters. But as advocates point out, 'the vast majority of people driving into the CBD are more affluent.' Data shows over 60 percent of car commuters make more than $100,000 a year. Only 13.7 percent of education, healthcare, and social assistance workers drive to Manhattan. The pause strips $16.5 billion from transit upgrades, hurting the 900,000-plus daily transit riders. Renae Reynolds and Danny Pearlstein, transit advocates, slammed the decision. They argue it blocks an 'equitable economic recovery' and leaves vulnerable New Yorkers stranded on slow, crowded trains and buses.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project added concrete barriers and flexi-posts between 33rd Road and 35th Avenue, closing gaps that left cyclists exposed to traffic. DOT’s summary states, 'The Vernon Boulevard protected bike lane is safer than ever outside Rainey Park thanks to new barriers and flexi-posts.' Cyclists had long complained about cars blocking the lane and weak separation. The city has installed similar barriers elsewhere on Vernon Boulevard and plans a new bike boulevard on 31st Avenue later this summer. No council members are named in this action. The upgrades follow incidents of vehicle blockages and a recent NYPD chase that left a cyclist critically injured.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The carnage rolls on.</p><p class=mb3>On July 2, 2024, Streetsblog NYC reported on the fallout from Governor Kathy Hochul’s decision to halt New York’s congestion pricing plan. The article, titled 'New Map Shows The Traffic Violence Toll Of Hochul’s Congestion Pricing Cowardice,' highlights a new interactive map by Transpo Maps. The map tracks crashes, injuries, and fatalities in lower Manhattan’s would-be tolling zone. Stephen Braitsch, a map creator, said, 'It's really unfair to have those folks be under constant siege by all this unnecessary vehicle traffic.' The federal government expected congestion pricing to cut vehicle numbers by 17 percent. London saw crashes drop 40 percent after similar measures. Hochul’s move, announced in June, blocks these safety gains. Vulnerable residents—many without cars—remain exposed to daily harm.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
