The article, titled 'New Map Shows The Traffic Violence Toll Of Hochul’s Congestion Pricing Cowardice,' highlights a new interactive map by Transpo Maps. The map tracks crashes, injuries, and fatalities in lower Manhattan’s would-be tolling zone. Stephen Braitsch, a map creator, said, 'It's really unfair to have those folks be under constant siege by all this unnecessary vehicle traffic.' The federal government expected congestion pricing to cut vehicle numbers by 17 percent. London saw crashes drop 40 percent after similar measures. Hochul’s move, announced in June, blocks these safety gains.

DOT cited 110 injury crashes and one fatality in four years along the corridor. The redesign also includes concrete bus boarding islands and pedestrian improvements near schools and hospitals.

Community board attendees voiced anger over the loss of 28 parking spots, but some residents and advocates praised the safety upgrades, calling them 'desperately needed.'

The 39-year-old motorcycle rider, described as unlicensed and helmeted, was ejected from his seat and pronounced dead at the scene, his body suffering severe lacerations.

Advocates demand raised crosswalks, protected bike lanes, and turn calming. Congestion pricing canceled. Danger grows.</p><p class=mb3>On June 20, 2024, advocates and city officials confronted a surge in pedestrian deaths and injuries. The matter, titled 'There Is A Pedestrian Injury and Death Crisis Going On,' highlights 55 pedestrian deaths and more than 4,000 injuries this year. Brooklyn and Queens are most affected. Over 92 percent of injuries come from drivers of cars, trucks, and heavy vehicles. Council members and advocates, including Alexa Sledge of Transportation Alternatives and Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance, called for urgent safety upgrades: raised crosswalks, protected bike lanes, and turn calming. Jon Orcutt, a former DOT official, blamed slow city action, weak enforcement, and bigger vehicles. The cancellation of congestion pricing—expected to cut 100,000 cars a day—removes a key safety measure. The Department of Transportation did not comment. Advocates stress: the crisis is driver-caused, not the fault of cyclists or e-mobility users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
