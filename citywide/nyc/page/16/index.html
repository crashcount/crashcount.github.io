In the last twelve months, <strong>243 people died</strong> on New York streets. <strong>708 were left with serious injuries</strong>. Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—none are spared. Just last week, an eight-year-old boy was killed crossing Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights. His sister watched. His mother grieves. “He was a boy who loved life,” <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>said his mother</a>.</p><p>Scooter riders, teens on mopeds, and cyclists have all fallen. On June 26, a 39-year-old man was thrown from his scooter and died on 116th Avenue. No arrests. No comfort. The street is unchanged.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> In the last three years, they took <strong>299 lives</strong> and left thousands more broken. Trucks and buses killed <strong>93</strong>. Motorcycles and mopeds, <strong>10</strong>. Bikes, <strong>11</strong>. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not. Every crash is a family torn open.</p><h3 id=leaders-actbut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Act—But Not Fast Enough</h3><p>The city has moved, but the pace is slow. Speed cameras in school zones are now extended through 2030. “It’s simple: speed cameras save lives and keep New Yorkers safe,” <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>said Governor Hochul</a>. But cameras alone are not enough. Streets need to be rebuilt. Speed limits must drop. The city has the power to set a 20 mph limit. It has not used it.</p><p>Some leaders speak plain. “At this point, there are no questions, just facts: speeding kills, and speed cameras save lives,” <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>said State Senator Gounardes</a>. But others drag their feet, or worse, rip out bike lanes and leave riders exposed.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand that repeat speeders are stopped. Do not wait for another child’s name to be written in chalk on the street.</p><p><strong>Act now.

The narrative states, 'His head struck. He died in the road. Not at a crosswalk. The trucks kept going.' The incident occurred at 22:22. Both SUVs, a 2018 Dodge and a 2015 Toyota, were moving westbound—one merging, one going straight—when the collision happened. The police report lists 'Unspecified' as contributing factors for the drivers, and the drivers did not remain at the scene. The pedestrian was not at an intersection, but no victim behavior is cited as a contributing factor. The report underscores the lethal consequences of driver actions and the systemic dangers faced by people on foot in New York City.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The report states the motorcyclist was helmeted but unlicensed. The van was stationary and unoccupied at the time of the crash. The narrative describes the motorcycle crumpling on impact and the rider dying at the scene from head injuries. The police report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor in the crash. No actions by the van or its driver contributed to the incident, as the vehicle was parked. The report notes the rider's helmet use and unlicensed status, but cites driver inattention as the primary factor.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The program, launched during the pandemic and now permanent in some areas, has turned Canal, Orchard, Broome, and Doyers Streets into bustling, pedestrian-friendly zones. The article quotes Vincent Aloi, manager of Le Dive, who says, '[Limiting car access] is not hurting businesses, in any sense.' Tim Laughlin, president of the Lower East Side Partnership, calls the program 'a pedestrianized destination that supports commerce and community.' Despite clear economic and social benefits, Mayor Adams and Governor Hochul have not expanded pedestrianization. Hochul’s cancellation of congestion pricing is seen as a missed chance to further protect people outside cars. Community leaders and workers urge the city to prioritize pedestrians and cyclists, noting most visitors arrive without cars.

The action, detailed in 'Disabled NYer’s are Victims of Gov. Hochul’s Congestion Pricing Pause,' leaves tens of thousands without access. Michelle Alcaraz and Ray Ray, both disabled New Yorkers, are forced to travel far from home or avoid transit altogether. The MTA’s $16 billion in scheduled repairs, including crucial accessibility upgrades, is now in limbo. Joe Rappaport of the Brooklyn Center for the Independence of the Disabled called on the governor and legislature to restore funding, warning that the lack of elevators treats disabled riders as 'second-class citizens.' The pause keeps stations dangerous for parents, caregivers, and the disabled.

The move, not a council bill but a major policy action, stopped new tolls for drivers entering Manhattan’s core. Hochul claimed she was protecting working-class commuters. But as advocates point out, 'the vast majority of people driving into the CBD are more affluent.' Data shows over 60 percent of car commuters make more than $100,000 a year. Only 13.7 percent of education, healthcare, and social assistance workers drive to Manhattan. The pause strips $16.5 billion from transit upgrades, hurting the 900,000-plus daily transit riders. Renae Reynolds and Danny Pearlstein, transit advocates, slammed the decision. They argue it blocks an 'equitable economic recovery' and leaves vulnerable New Yorkers stranded on slow, crowded trains and buses.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The narrative states he was not at a crosswalk and was walking in the dark. The sedan hit him low, causing his head to hit the street. The report notes the pedestrian died at the scene, beneath the vehicle. Police data lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified' for both the driver and the pedestrian. The driver was traveling straight ahead at the time of the crash. The point of impact and vehicle damage were both to the undercarriage, consistent with a pedestrian strike. No driver errors are specifically cited in the report, and no mention is made of pedestrian behavior as a contributing factor beyond location in the roadway.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The family crossed with the walk sign when the driver made a left turn and hit them. The driver was not arrested. The intersection, with two wide four-lane roads and little pedestrian infrastructure, has seen 14 crashes in the past year. Advocates, including Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives, condemned city officials for blaming pedestrians and resisting jaywalking reform. Adams said, "Harlem deserves better from its leaders, and Harlem residents deserve truly safe streets." This tragedy highlights a citywide crisis: pedestrian deaths are up 55% this year. The corner’s design encourages dangerous driving and fails to protect people on foot.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the child was 'crossing with the signal' when the 2020 Nissan SUV hit her in the head at the 'center front end' of the vehicle, which sustained damage there. The driver was licensed and operating the vehicle legally. The report lists contributing factors as 'Unspecified' but highlights the driver’s action of making a left turn into a crosswalk occupied by a pedestrian. The narrative states, 'She died there on the street. The front end bore the mark of her final moment.'

The project added concrete barriers and flexi-posts between 33rd Road and 35th Avenue, closing gaps that left cyclists exposed to traffic. DOT’s summary states, 'The Vernon Boulevard protected bike lane is safer than ever outside Rainey Park thanks to new barriers and flexi-posts.' Cyclists had long complained about cars blocking the lane and weak separation. The city has installed similar barriers elsewhere on Vernon Boulevard and plans a new bike boulevard on 31st Avenue later this summer. No council members are named in this action. The upgrades follow incidents of vehicle blockages and a recent NYPD chase that left a cyclist critically injured.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
