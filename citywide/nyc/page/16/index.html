The family crossed with the walk sign when the driver made a left turn and hit them. The driver was not arrested. The intersection, with two wide four-lane roads and little pedestrian infrastructure, has seen 14 crashes in the past year. Advocates, including Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives, condemned city officials for blaming pedestrians and resisting jaywalking reform. Adams said, "Harlem deserves better from its leaders, and Harlem residents deserve truly safe streets." This tragedy highlights a citywide crisis: pedestrian deaths are up 55% this year. The corner’s design encourages dangerous driving and fails to protect people on foot.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project added concrete barriers and flexi-posts between 33rd Road and 35th Avenue, closing gaps that left cyclists exposed to traffic. DOT’s summary states, 'The Vernon Boulevard protected bike lane is safer than ever outside Rainey Park thanks to new barriers and flexi-posts.' Cyclists had long complained about cars blocking the lane and weak separation. The city has installed similar barriers elsewhere on Vernon Boulevard and plans a new bike boulevard on 31st Avenue later this summer. No council members are named in this action. The upgrades follow incidents of vehicle blockages and a recent NYPD chase that left a cyclist critically injured.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article, titled 'New Map Shows The Traffic Violence Toll Of Hochul’s Congestion Pricing Cowardice,' highlights a new interactive map by Transpo Maps. The map tracks crashes, injuries, and fatalities in lower Manhattan’s would-be tolling zone. Stephen Braitsch, a map creator, said, 'It's really unfair to have those folks be under constant siege by all this unnecessary vehicle traffic.' The federal government expected congestion pricing to cut vehicle numbers by 17 percent. London saw crashes drop 40 percent after similar measures. Hochul’s move, announced in June, blocks these safety gains.

The stretch is notorious for speeding, crashes, and one recent fatality. The plan adds sidewalk space, bus islands, and closes slip lanes. Some locals protest lost parking.</p><p class=mb3>On June 24, 2024, the NYC Department of Transportation (DOT) announced plans to install protected bike lanes on Seventh Avenue in Dyker Heights, Brooklyn. The project, pitched as a school safety upgrade, will replace painted bike lanes with a two-way protected lane, add sidewalk extensions, and close two slip lanes. DOT cited 110 injury crashes and one fatality in four years along the corridor. The redesign also includes concrete bus boarding islands and pedestrian improvements near schools and hospitals. DOT staffer Alex Ussery said, 'We’ve received some concerns from the community and various elected officials specifically regarding safety around students.' Community board attendees voiced anger over the loss of 28 parking spots, but some residents and advocates praised the safety upgrades, calling them 'desperately needed.' Installation will begin this summer and finish in the fall. No council member directly sponsored or voted on this DOT action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
