In the last twelve months, <strong>244 people have died</strong> on New York’s streets. <strong>707 were left with serious injuries</strong>. Children, elders, cyclists, pedestrians—none spared. Just last week, an <strong>8-year-old boy was killed by an SUV</strong> at an intersection in Crown Heights. There was no warning. There was no time. The street was busy, the car was big, and a child did not come home. Streetsblog NYC <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/01/tuesdays-headlines-another-child-sacrificed-to-the-suv-edition>called it</a> &ldquo;another child sacrificed to the SUV.&rdquo;</p><p>Six more people were struck in the Bronx when a Mustang jumped the curb and plowed into a sidewalk shed. Witnesses heard the screams. &ldquo;People were yelling, were in pain, so yelling, crying, it was very upsetting,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>said Vivian Cole</a>. The driver ran. The city moved on.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-that-dont-lie>The Numbers That Don’t Lie</h3><p>The violence is not random. <strong>SUVs and cars killed 300 pedestrians</strong> in the last three years. <strong>Trucks and buses killed 93</strong>. <strong>Motorcycles and mopeds killed 10</strong>. <strong>Bikes killed 11</strong>. The numbers are cold. The bodies are not. Every crash is a family broken, a street stained.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h3><p>City Hall claims progress. The first half of 2025 saw a <strong>32% drop in traffic deaths</strong>. DOT Commissioner Rodriguez said, &ldquo;Traffic deaths reached the lowest level in recorded history during the first six months of this year because of Vision Zero&rsquo;s focus on safer street designs, expanded public education, and targeted traffic enforcement,&rdquo; according to <a href=https://www.bkreader.com/policy-government/nyc-traffic-deaths-reach-record-low-10895611>BKReader</a>.</p><p>But the work is not done. Protected bike lanes are being ripped out. The city drags its feet on lowering speed limits. Policies that sound safe sometimes punish the wrong people. A new rule would cap e-bike speeds at 15 mph. Michael Replogle, a former DOT official, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/03/ex-dot-official-warns-nycs-counterproductive-e-bike-speed-limit-will-curb-biking-safety>called it</a> &ldquo;an ill-considered idea to improve safety which will be counterproductive.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>The city will not save itself.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Tell them to protect bike lanes, not remove them. Tell them to stop blaming the people in the crosswalk.

The morning rose over his body, the city moving on as another life ended in traffic.</p><p class=mb3>A deadly collision unfolded on 2nd Avenue when a motorcycle crashed into the rear of a refrigerated van, according to the police report. The report states the van was 'slowing or stopping' when the motorcycle, traveling southbound, struck its center back end. The 33-year-old motorcyclist, who was unlicensed and wore no helmet, died at the scene after hitting head-first. The police report lists 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' as a contributing factor in the crash, highlighting a critical driver error. The van driver was licensed and operating within the law, while the motorcycle rider's lack of a license and helmet are noted in the report after the primary driver error. The crash left the rider dead in the road, underscoring the lethal consequences of improper lane usage and systemic vulnerability for those outside the protection of steel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

No more quick road reopenings. Streets become sites of failure, not business as usual. The goal: force drivers to slow down, save lives.</p><p class=mb3>This policy proposal, discussed on August 6, 2024, introduces the 'Emergency Streets' intervention. The plan, outlined by Kevin Krizek and Tila Duhaime, demands that after a fatal crash, city officials halve speed limits and install temporary, modular traffic-calming infrastructure within a half-mile radius of the site. These changes would remain for at least two weeks or until the community addresses permanent safety upgrades. The proposal challenges current protocols, which prioritize rapid road reopening over thorough investigation and public awareness. Krizek questions whether returning roads to 'normal' is wise, while Duhaime insists that physical changes—not police enforcement—will force drivers to slow down. The matter summary reads: 'What if, instead, they treated those streets as the site of a catastrophic transportation failure and took immediate action to prevent the worst from happening again?' No council bill number or committee is assigned, as this is a policy concept, not legislation. The proposal centers vulnerable road users and aims to shift responsibility for traffic violence from individuals to the system itself.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Tim Laughlin, president of the Lower East Side Partnership, calls the program 'a pedestrianized destination that supports commerce and community.'

Only 13.7 percent of education, healthcare, and social assistance workers drive to Manhattan. The pause strips $16.5 billion from transit upgrades, hurting the 900,000-plus daily transit riders.

The report states, 'A 51-year-old man was struck and crushed by two sedans. One driver was unlicensed. The front end hit center mass. He died in the road. Whole body broken.' The first sedan, traveling north, was driven by an unlicensed driver, with the point of impact listed as 'center front end.' Police cite 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Unsafe Speed' as contributing factors. The second sedan was parked at the time of the crash. The report does not name the victim or specify the borough. The focus remains on the lethal consequences of driver inattention and lack of a valid license, as documented by police.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the crash was caused by 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Unsafe Speed.' The motorcycle rider, a 31-year-old man, was ejected and suffered fatal crush injuries, dying at the scene. The report states the SUV was 'Making Left Turn' while the motorcycle was 'Going Straight Ahead.' The police report also cites 'Turning Improperly' as a contributing factor. The victim wore a helmet, but the impact proved unsurvivable. The focus remains on the SUV driver's failure to yield and improper turning, which led directly to the fatal impact.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The contributing factor listed is 'Traffic Control Disregarded.' This means a driver ignored a traffic signal, a critical error that led to the crash. The impact was severe: a 21-year-old woman, riding as a front passenger, was killed. Her injuries were described as affecting her entire body, and she was pronounced dead at the scene. The report notes a parked box truck was present but was not involved in the collision. No driver or vehicle errors are attributed to the victim. The fatal outcome stemmed from a driver’s failure to obey traffic controls, as documented by police.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The police report lists 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as contributing factors on the part of the truck driver. The e-bike rider was wearing a helmet, as noted in the report, but this is mentioned only after the driver's errors.

The toll mounts. The need is urgent.</p><p class=mb3>This report details the delayed installation of a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue, a project planned by the Department of Transportation for late 2023 but stalled with no updates as of March 2024. The proposal, supported by 41 local businesses, aims to protect cyclists and pedestrians between Dean Street and Flushing Avenue. As the article states, 'the majority of cyclists using Bedford Avenue... are traveling to homes and businesses in Bedford-Stuyvesant or Clinton Hill,' countering claims that safety projects don’t benefit locals. McKendree Key, founder of Artshack, and Replica analyst Arthur Getman both highlight the urgent need for safer infrastructure. Crash data shows injuries and fatalities rising during the delay: 97 crashes in the first half of 2024, injuring six cyclists, twelve pedestrians, and killing one pedestrian. The Adams administration faces criticism for its pattern of transportation project delays, leaving vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, a southbound moped was struck by an eastbound SUV. Both the moped rider and the SUV driver were unlicensed at the time of the crash. The report states the moped rider was ejected, his helmet crushed, and he suffered fatal head wounds. The contributing factor listed is 'Traffic Control Disregarded.' The SUV's front end struck the moped, which was left demolished at the scene. The police report makes clear that both drivers operated vehicles without licenses, and the disregard for traffic control directly contributed to the deadly outcome. The focus remains on the systemic danger posed by unlicensed drivers and ignored traffic controls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
