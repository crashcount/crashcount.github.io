The Department of Transportation opposes the bill. The issue gained urgency after three pedestrians, including 7-year-old Dolma Naadhun, died in separate crashes over the weekend of February 19, 2023. One victim was killed at an intersection where parked cars blocked visibility and the ADA ramp. Another, Zabina Gafoor, was struck by an NYPD vehicle responding to an emergency. Advocates, including Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives, condemned the city’s failure to implement proven safety measures, saying, 'Our city’s children deserve to grow up without the threat of traffic violence.'

He calls for smaller fleets, safer vehicles, and real accountability. Safety advocates back him. City Hall pushes back. The fight is over money, lives, and responsibility.</p><p class=mb3>On February 12, 2023, Comptroller Brad Lander released a report urging city agencies to bear financial responsibility for crash settlements involving their employees, instead of using the general city budget. The proposal, detailed in the report titled "Make City Drivers Safer By Punishing Agencies for Crashes," calls for accelerated adoption of vehicle safety technology, a direct vision standard for fleet vehicles, reduction in both fleet size and vehicle size, and stronger accountability for city drivers. Lander states, "The city should place the budgeted allocation for projected settlement costs within each agency's budget." Safety advocates, including Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives, support the move, calling it "an important step toward creating a safer city." City Hall responded by highlighting ongoing safety efforts and questioning the link between settlements and fleet crashes. The proposal has not yet advanced to a formal council stage or committee.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He declared, 'Our ultimate goal is to get traffic deaths down to zero.' Buttigieg urged mayors to adopt Vision Zero, citing cities like Hoboken and Jersey City as proof that progress is possible. He called for lower speed limits, protected bike and bus lanes, curb extensions, high-visibility crosswalks, and more frequent signals. Buttigieg stressed, 'Every infrastructure choice is a safety choice.' He met with Families for Safe Streets, grounding his plea in the pain of victims.

The $800 million, part of a $5 billion, five-year program, will reach 510 communities. Most grants fund local Vision Zero action plans, aiming to cut car crash deaths. Only 37 projects get money for real infrastructure. These receive 60 percent of the funds, with 80 percent benefiting cyclists and 90 percent helping pedestrians. Leah Shahum of the Vision Zero Network called the funding 'an encouraging start,' but warned, 'plans don’t always lead to real results.' Corinne Kisner of NACTO said the program 'aligns transportation investments to the safety, equity, and climate crises.' Still, advocates note the grants are less than 1 percent of federal infrastructure spending.
