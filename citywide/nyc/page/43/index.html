The proposal, detailed in the report titled "Make City Drivers Safer By Punishing Agencies for Crashes," calls for accelerated adoption of vehicle safety technology, a direct vision standard for fleet vehicles, reduction in both fleet size and vehicle size, and stronger accountability for city drivers. Lander states, "The city should place the budgeted allocation for projected settlement costs within each agency's budget." Safety advocates, including Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives, support the move, calling it "an important step toward creating a safer city." City Hall responded by highlighting ongoing safety efforts and questioning the link between settlements and fleet crashes. The proposal has not yet advanced to a formal council stage or committee.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The $800 million, part of a $5 billion, five-year program, will reach 510 communities. Most grants fund local Vision Zero action plans, aiming to cut car crash deaths. Only 37 projects get money for real infrastructure. These receive 60 percent of the funds, with 80 percent benefiting cyclists and 90 percent helping pedestrians. Leah Shahum of the Vision Zero Network called the funding 'an encouraging start,' but warned, 'plans don’t always lead to real results.' Corinne Kisner of NACTO said the program 'aligns transportation investments to the safety, equity, and climate crises.' Still, advocates note the grants are less than 1 percent of federal infrastructure spending.

Pedestrian space shrinks. Bike and bus lanes face new barriers. Car dominance grows. Federal money fuels the push. Critics say: put people first, not parking. Sidewalks belong to the vulnerable.</p><p class=mb3>On January 18, 2023, Christine Berthet published a sharp critique of New York City’s curbside EV charger rollout. The opinion, titled 'Thousands of Chargers for Heavy E-Cars Are Coming to a Sidewalk Near You,' warns that federal grants will fund chargers at the expense of pedestrian, cyclist, and transit space. Berthet writes, 'chargers will enshrine the use of the curb for free parking, and will make it more difficult and expensive to expand sidewalks, bike lanes and bus lanes in the future.' She urges the city to direct incentives toward fast-charging hubs, transit, and Citi Bike, not private car infrastructure. Berthet calls for sidewalk widening, bike lanes, bus lanes, and public review before any curbside charger is installed. Her message: prioritize people, safety, and the environment over car convenience.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
