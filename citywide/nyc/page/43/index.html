According to the police report, an unlicensed taxi driver struck a parked forklift. The crash killed a 64-year-old man riding in the right rear seat of the taxi.

He declared, 'Our ultimate goal is to get traffic deaths down to zero.' Buttigieg urged mayors to adopt Vision Zero, citing cities like Hoboken and Jersey City as proof that progress is possible. He called for lower speed limits, protected bike and bus lanes, curb extensions, high-visibility crosswalks, and more frequent signals. Buttigieg stressed, 'Every infrastructure choice is a safety choice.' He met with Families for Safe Streets, grounding his plea in the pain of victims. The speech, though not a bill, marked a federal push for cities to act, prioritize vulnerable road users, and end the carnage.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Most get planning money, not shovels. Big projects win the rest. Cyclists and walkers see most of the gains. Advocates cheer, but warn: plans alone do not save lives. More cash, more action needed.</p><p class=mb3>On February 2, 2023, the U.S. Department of Transportation announced the first round of 'Safe Streets and Roads For All' grants. The $800 million, part of a $5 billion, five-year program, will reach 510 communities. Most grants fund local Vision Zero action plans, aiming to cut car crash deaths. Only 37 projects get money for real infrastructure. These receive 60 percent of the funds, with 80 percent benefiting cyclists and 90 percent helping pedestrians. Leah Shahum of the Vision Zero Network called the funding 'an encouraging start,' but warned, 'plans don’t always lead to real results.' Corinne Kisner of NACTO said the program 'aligns transportation investments to the safety, equity, and climate crises.' Still, advocates note the grants are less than 1 percent of federal infrastructure spending. Road deaths remain high, hitting vulnerable users hardest.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
