In the last twelve months, <strong>243 people died</strong> on New York streets. <strong>708 were left with serious injuries</strong>. Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—none are spared. Just last week, an eight-year-old boy was killed crossing Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights. His sister watched. His mother grieves. “He was a boy who loved life,” <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>said his mother</a>.</p><p>Scooter riders, teens on mopeds, and cyclists have all fallen. On June 26, a 39-year-old man was thrown from his scooter and died on 116th Avenue. No arrests. No comfort. The street is unchanged.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> In the last three years, they took <strong>299 lives</strong> and left thousands more broken. Trucks and buses killed <strong>93</strong>. Motorcycles and mopeds, <strong>10</strong>. Bikes, <strong>11</strong>. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not. Every crash is a family torn open.</p><h3 id=leaders-actbut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Act—But Not Fast Enough</h3><p>The city has moved, but the pace is slow. Speed cameras in school zones are now extended through 2030. “It’s simple: speed cameras save lives and keep New Yorkers safe,” <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>said Governor Hochul</a>. But cameras alone are not enough. Streets need to be rebuilt. Speed limits must drop. The city has the power to set a 20 mph limit. It has not used it.</p><p>Some leaders speak plain. “At this point, there are no questions, just facts: speeding kills, and speed cameras save lives,” <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>said State Senator Gounardes</a>. But others drag their feet, or worse, rip out bike lanes and leave riders exposed.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand that repeat speeders are stopped. Do not wait for another child’s name to be written in chalk on the street.</p><p><strong>Act now. Or count the dead.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Most get planning money, not shovels. Big projects win the rest. Cyclists and walkers see most of the gains. Advocates cheer, but warn: plans alone do not save lives. More cash, more action needed.</p><p class=mb3>On February 2, 2023, the U.S. Department of Transportation announced the first round of 'Safe Streets and Roads For All' grants. The $800 million, part of a $5 billion, five-year program, will reach 510 communities. Most grants fund local Vision Zero action plans, aiming to cut car crash deaths. Only 37 projects get money for real infrastructure. These receive 60 percent of the funds, with 80 percent benefiting cyclists and 90 percent helping pedestrians. Leah Shahum of the Vision Zero Network called the funding 'an encouraging start,' but warned, 'plans don’t always lead to real results.' Corinne Kisner of NACTO said the program 'aligns transportation investments to the safety, equity, and climate crises.' Still, advocates note the grants are less than 1 percent of federal infrastructure spending. Road deaths remain high, hitting vulnerable users hardest.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
