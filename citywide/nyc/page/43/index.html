The crash occurred at 9:30 p.m. The report states the woman was crossing against the signal and was not at an intersection when the collision happened. She suffered severe bleeding to the face and was found unconscious on the pavement. The police narrative describes the bike as continuing on, undamaged, after the impact. No intersection was involved, and the report notes 'no time to stop.' The police report lists the pedestrian’s action as 'crossing against signal,' but contributing factors for both the cyclist and pedestrian are marked as 'unspecified.'
