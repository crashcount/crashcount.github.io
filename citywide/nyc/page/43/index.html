Just last week, an eight-year-old boy was killed crossing Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights. His sister watched. His mother grieves. “He was a boy who loved life,” <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>said his mother</a>.</p><p>Scooter riders, teens on mopeds, and cyclists have all fallen.

The Department of Transportation opposes the bill. The issue gained urgency after three pedestrians, including 7-year-old Dolma Naadhun, died in separate crashes over the weekend of February 19, 2023. One victim was killed at an intersection where parked cars blocked visibility and the ADA ramp. Another, Zabina Gafoor, was struck by an NYPD vehicle responding to an emergency. Advocates, including Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives, condemned the city’s failure to implement proven safety measures, saying, 'Our city’s children deserve to grow up without the threat of traffic violence.'

The proposal, detailed in the report titled "Make City Drivers Safer By Punishing Agencies for Crashes," calls for accelerated adoption of vehicle safety technology, a direct vision standard for fleet vehicles, reduction in both fleet size and vehicle size, and stronger accountability for city drivers. Lander states, "The city should place the budgeted allocation for projected settlement costs within each agency's budget." Safety advocates, including Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives, support the move, calling it "an important step toward creating a safer city." City Hall responded by highlighting ongoing safety efforts and questioning the link between settlements and fleet crashes.

Only 37 projects get money for real infrastructure. These receive 60 percent of the funds, with 80 percent benefiting cyclists and 90 percent helping pedestrians. Leah Shahum of the Vision Zero Network called the funding 'an encouraging start,' but warned, 'plans don’t always lead to real results.' Corinne Kisner of NACTO said the program 'aligns transportation investments to the safety, equity, and climate crises.'
