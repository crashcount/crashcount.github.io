The opinion, titled 'Thousands of Chargers for Heavy E-Cars Are Coming to a Sidewalk Near You,' warns that federal grants will fund chargers at the expense of pedestrian, cyclist, and transit space. Berthet writes, 'chargers will enshrine the use of the curb for free parking, and will make it more difficult and expensive to expand sidewalks, bike lanes and bus lanes in the future.' She urges the city to direct incentives toward fast-charging hubs, transit, and Citi Bike, not private car infrastructure. Berthet calls for sidewalk widening, bike lanes, bus lanes, and public review before any curbside charger is installed.

Homendy supports the push to phase out carbon emissions but calls out the deadly risk of heavier EVs like the GMC Hummer EV and Ford F-150 Lightning. She insists safety must not be overlooked in new transportation policies and technologies. Homendy champions Vision Zero, stating, 'Not a single life lost.

Sara Lind, a key voice, states, 'We can’t build a livable city without reclaiming space from cars.' The agenda highlights bills like Intro 500 (placard abuse), S3080A/A516 (e-bike rebates), Intro 708 (truck route redesign), and Intro 854 (intersection daylighting). It calls for dynamic parking pricing, expanded loading zones, and a permanent Open Restaurants program.

Its five-star ratings protect drivers, not walkers. SUVs and trucks grow deadlier. U.S. pedestrian deaths soar. Professor Shill demands change: count walkers, shrink cars, test for real-world danger. Lives hang in the balance. Reform is overdue.</p><p class=mb3>On January 4, 2023, University of Iowa professor Gregory Shill published a policy proposal urging the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to overhaul its safety standards. The article, titled 'Four Ways Automotive Regulators Could Save Pedestrian Lives,' argues NHTSA 'considers the safety of pedestrians—who are third parties rather than consumers—almost completely alien to its mission.' Shill calls for four reforms: include pedestrian safety in NHTSA’s mandate, make cars safer for walkers by addressing size and design, scrutinize high-tech solutions, and make crash tests reflect real-world bodies and conditions. He notes, 'the agency has the capacity to leverage the best evidence and technology to safeguard pedestrians, and should use it.' Shill’s push comes as U.S. pedestrian deaths rise, especially among Black road users, while other nations see declines. The proposal demands systemic change to protect the most vulnerable on American streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, a moped slammed into the side of a southbound Mercedes. The 31-year-old moped rider, not wearing a helmet, struck headfirst and died at the scene. The sedan driver was not reported injured. The police report lists 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as a contributing factor for both drivers. Both vehicles were going straight ahead before the crash.
