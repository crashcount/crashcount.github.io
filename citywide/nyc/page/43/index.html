A black SUV hit him. He died on the street. The driver stayed. Police said, &ldquo;They were walking, he was crossing the street with his sister&rdquo; (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>police said</a>). No arrest. The street is still open. The danger is still there.</p><p>The day before, in the Bronx, a man ran a red light. His car jumped the curb and crushed three people on the sidewalk. One is still fighting for life. The driver ran but police caught him. He faces charges for assault, fleeing, and driving without a license (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/driver-flees-bronx-car-stop-crash/>faces charges</a>).</p><p><strong>In the last 12 months, 244 people have died on New York City streets. 713 were seriously hurt.</strong> Thirteen of the dead were children. The city logs over 81,000 crashes a year. Each number is a name, a family, a future gone.</p><h3 id=the-policy-that-wasnt>The Policy That Wasn&rsquo;t</h3><p>Leaders talk. Streets stay the same. The mayor ripped out a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue after crashes involving children. He said he was listening to the community. Cyclists said, &ldquo;I don’t think he cares if we die&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/cyclists-fuming-over-mayor-adamss-removal-of-bedford-avenue-protected-bike-lane>Cyclists said</a>). The city put back paint. Paint does not stop cars.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Department of Transportation built a new protected bike lane in Queens. A commuter said, &ldquo;The old street was very dangerous&mldr; the new path is definitely safer because he&rsquo;s no longer competing with trucks and cars for road space&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/27/eyes-on-the-street-new-bike-lane-puts-the-bliss-in-blissville>A commuter said</a>). But these changes come slow. Too slow for the dead.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-that-dont-lie>The Numbers That Don&rsquo;t Lie</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks killed 299 people.</strong> Motorcycles and mopeds killed 21. Bikes killed 11. The city counts 182,570 injuries since 2022. The bodies pile up. The city debates.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call your council member. Call the mayor.

The Department of Transportation opposes the bill. The issue gained urgency after three pedestrians, including 7-year-old Dolma Naadhun, died in separate crashes over the weekend of February 19, 2023. One victim was killed at an intersection where parked cars blocked visibility and the ADA ramp. Another, Zabina Gafoor, was struck by an NYPD vehicle responding to an emergency. Advocates, including Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives, condemned the city’s failure to implement proven safety measures, saying, 'Our city’s children deserve to grow up without the threat of traffic violence.' The bill remains pending.

Surface streets got safer. Speed cameras work, but Albany blocks them on highways. Mayor Adams faces pressure. Families mourn. The city’s most violent crashes go unchecked. The data is clear. Highways need urgent action now.</p><p class=mb3>This editorial, published January 26, 2023, calls on Mayor Adams to advocate for speed cameras on New York City highways. The piece highlights that, despite Vision Zero and surface-street redesigns, highway deaths rose from 29 in 2019 to 49 in 2022. The article states: 'the most proven tool for reducing the most violent crashes—control by speed cameras—is not allowed by New York State on the city's highways.' Mayor Adams is urged to push Albany for legislative change. The editorial notes that surface-street interventions—road diets, bike lanes, intersection redesigns—have cut cyclist deaths by 45 percent and pedestrian deaths by 5 percent since 2019. But highways remain deadly, untouched by these tools. The city’s safety gains stall at the expressway on-ramp. Vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The message is clear: put safety and public space before cars.</p><p class=mb3>On January 25, 2023, advocates released a statement ahead of Mayor Adams’s State of the City address. The statement, titled 'What the Livable Streets Movement Wants from Thursday’s State of the City Address,' urges the city to prioritize open streets, permanent outdoor dining, and public transit. The group calls for eliminating parking mandates and expanding Summer Streets to Brooklyn and Queens. They demand automated curb enforcement and a reduction in the city’s vehicle fleet. Borough Presidents Antonio Reynoso and Donovan Richards support the Summer Streets expansion. The statement insists, 'Leadership should be celebrating [public transit] and investing in it above all else.' The advocates reject half-measures and marketing campaigns. They want policies that move people out of cars and reclaim streets for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
