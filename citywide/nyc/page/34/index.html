The project, described as 'a permanent car-free space in a neighborhood lacking parkland,' formalizes an open street that began in 2021. Local organizers, including Meghan Canale and Katie Denny Horowitz, praised the transformation. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno said, 'We're developing permanent designs for existing locations to create safer, more vibrant community spaces.' The North Brooklyn Parks Alliance partnered with DOT. The plaza adds bike corrals, movable furniture, and planters. While some residents oppose similar projects, the city continues to expand pedestrian and cycling infrastructure in the area. No formal council bill or vote was involved in this installation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Justice now moves forward.</p><p class=mb3>On August 10, 2023, the Manhattan District Attorney indicted Mahbub Ali for killing a cyclist and injuring four others while driving drunk. The case is not a council bill but a prosecution, led by DA Alvin Bragg. The charges include vehicular homicide, manslaughter, assault, and drunk driving, with the top charge carrying up to 25 years. Bragg stated, 'Vehicular violence threatens the safety of New Yorkers who have the right to walk and bike without fear.' The indictment follows a June 4 crash on Third Avenue, where Ali struck and killed 22-year-old Abdulhekim Esiyok, then hit a pole, an NYPD van, and a garbage can. The crash injured another cyclist and two pedestrians. This case highlights the deadly threat drivers pose to vulnerable road users. NYPD data show 96 percent of pedestrian injuries are caused by drivers of cars and trucks, not micromobility users. The prosecution seeks accountability for violence behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident marks the 21st cyclist death this year, the highest since Vision Zero began in 2014. The matter highlights that only 1.64% of district streets have protected bike lanes, far below the city average. Jada Yeboah, Bronx/Uptown Organizer for Transportation Alternatives, condemned the city's failure: "Inaction is killing New Yorkers of color." She demanded Mayor Adams meet legal requirements for protected bike lanes, noting only five miles have been built in the Bronx out of 50 required citywide this year. The Bronx ranks third in traffic fatalities, eighth in injuries among 51 districts. The city's inaction leaves cyclists exposed.

Cars block ramps, endanger walkers, and hide danger. Advocates cheer. The city will hold a hearing. The change restores sight lines and puts people before parking.</p><p class=mb3>On July 27, 2023, the Department of Transportation (DOT) proposed a rule change to close a 2009 loophole that allowed drivers to park in unmarked crosswalks at T-intersections. The proposal, not yet finalized, will be discussed at a virtual hearing in early September. The matter summary states: 'The city wants to reverse a 2009 policy that allows drivers to park in unmarked crosswalks at T-intersections, undoing a decade-and-a-half giveaway to drivers that blocked pedestrian access and made streets less safe.' Former Council Member Vincent Gentile pushed for the original exemption, arguing it would create parking and increase safety. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno said, 'This proposed change will enhance safety and accessibility for pedestrians.' Disability and street safety advocates, including Jean Ryan, praised the move, saying the loophole blocked access for people with disabilities and endangered all pedestrians. The change will restore visibility at intersections, known as daylighting, and aligns city rules with state law requiring clear sight lines at crosswalks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
