The article, titled 'Beyond KSI: How DOT Can Identify Unsafe Streets Before Tragedy Strikes,' exposes how KSI misses hidden dangers and fails to prevent future deaths. No council bill number is attached; this is a public call to action, not legislation. The critique highlights that, despite 37 road deaths on the Upper West Side in ten years, DOT’s 2023 plan ignored these corridors. The author mapped safety features and hazards, proposing a new, proactive metric based on accessibility, comfort, and livability. The piece urges DOT to shift from counting casualties to preventing them, stating, 'we need a different metric to fix the underlying problem of safety on city streets—one that is community-centered and doesn’t reduce our assessment of a certain street’s needs to grim numbers.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The statement, titled 'Safe Streets Advocates: Incoming NYPD Transportation Chief Must Do Better,' calls for better officer education, consistent and equitable ticketing, transparency, and a shift from armed police to civilian and automated enforcement. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives said, 'We need to see a shift away from police officer enforcement to self-enforcing streets.' Michelle Feldman of the Center for Policing Equity added, 'You don’t need a person with a gun and a badge for all these incidents.'

The project, described as 'a permanent car-free space in a neighborhood lacking parkland,' formalizes an open street that began in 2021. Local organizers, including Meghan Canale and Katie Denny Horowitz, praised the transformation. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno said, 'We're developing permanent designs for existing locations to create safer, more vibrant community spaces.' The North Brooklyn Parks Alliance partnered with DOT. The plaza adds bike corrals, movable furniture, and planters. While some residents oppose similar projects, the city continues to expand pedestrian and cycling infrastructure in the area.

The Manhattan DA indicted him for vehicular homicide and manslaughter. The crash left one dead, several hurt, and a city shaken by reckless driving. Justice now moves forward.</p><p class=mb3>On August 10, 2023, the Manhattan District Attorney indicted Mahbub Ali for killing a cyclist and injuring four others while driving drunk. The case is not a council bill but a prosecution, led by DA Alvin Bragg. The charges include vehicular homicide, manslaughter, assault, and drunk driving, with the top charge carrying up to 25 years. Bragg stated, 'Vehicular violence threatens the safety of New Yorkers who have the right to walk and bike without fear.' The indictment follows a June 4 crash on Third Avenue, where Ali struck and killed 22-year-old Abdulhekim Esiyok, then hit a pole, an NYPD van, and a garbage can. The crash injured another cyclist and two pedestrians. This case highlights the deadly threat drivers pose to vulnerable road users. NYPD data show 96 percent of pedestrian injuries are caused by drivers of cars and trucks, not micromobility users. The prosecution seeks accountability for violence behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She demanded Mayor Adams meet legal requirements for protected bike lanes, noting only five miles have been built in the Bronx out of 50 required citywide this year. The Bronx ranks third in traffic fatalities, eighth in injuries among 51 districts. The city's inaction leaves cyclists exposed.
