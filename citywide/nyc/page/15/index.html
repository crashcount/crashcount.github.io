Hochul’s pause on congestion pricing slams the brakes on 23 planned subway elevators. Disabled New Yorkers are stranded. The city’s promise of mobility is broken. Crowded stations stay deadly. Lawmakers offer no fix. Riders wait. Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On July 23, 2024, advocates condemned Governor Hochul’s decision to pause congestion pricing, a move that halted funding for 23 new subway elevators. The action, detailed in 'Disabled NYer’s are Victims of Gov. Hochul’s Congestion Pricing Pause,' leaves tens of thousands without access. Michelle Alcaraz and Ray Ray, both disabled New Yorkers, are forced to travel far from home or avoid transit altogether. The MTA’s $16 billion in scheduled repairs, including crucial accessibility upgrades, is now in limbo. Joe Rappaport of the Brooklyn Center for the Independence of the Disabled called on the governor and legislature to restore funding, warning that the lack of elevators treats disabled riders as 'second-class citizens.' The pause keeps stations dangerous for parents, caregivers, and the disabled. Lawmakers have yet to offer a solution.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crash occurred at 21:55. The report states the bicyclist suffered fatal head injuries and internal bleeding, dying at the scene. Police cite 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as a contributing factor, emphasizing that the right-of-way was not given. The narrative notes, 'No helmet. Head smashed. Internal bleeding. He died beneath the streetlights, where the right-of-way was not his, and no one yielded.' The police report does not list any victim behavior as a contributing factor prior to the collision.

The move, not a council bill but a major policy action, stopped new tolls for drivers entering Manhattan’s core. Hochul claimed she was protecting working-class commuters. But as advocates point out, 'the vast majority of people driving into the CBD are more affluent.' Data shows over 60 percent of car commuters make more than $100,000 a year. Only 13.7 percent of education, healthcare, and social assistance workers drive to Manhattan. The pause strips $16.5 billion from transit upgrades, hurting the 900,000-plus daily transit riders. Renae Reynolds and Danny Pearlstein, transit advocates, slammed the decision. They argue it blocks an 'equitable economic recovery' and leaves vulnerable New Yorkers stranded on slow, crowded trains and buses.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A new map shows daily crashes, injuries, and deaths in the toll zone. Vulnerable people—kids, seniors, disabled—face relentless danger. The city loses a proven fix. The carnage rolls on.</p><p class=mb3>On July 2, 2024, Streetsblog NYC reported on the fallout from Governor Kathy Hochul’s decision to halt New York’s congestion pricing plan. The article, titled 'New Map Shows The Traffic Violence Toll Of Hochul’s Congestion Pricing Cowardice,' highlights a new interactive map by Transpo Maps. The map tracks crashes, injuries, and fatalities in lower Manhattan’s would-be tolling zone. Stephen Braitsch, a map creator, said, 'It's really unfair to have those folks be under constant siege by all this unnecessary vehicle traffic.' The federal government expected congestion pricing to cut vehicle numbers by 17 percent. London saw crashes drop 40 percent after similar measures. Hochul’s move, announced in June, blocks these safety gains. Vulnerable residents—many without cars—remain exposed to daily harm.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
