In the last twelve months, <strong>241 people died</strong> and <strong>701 suffered serious injuries</strong> on New York’s streets. The dead do not get second chances. The injured carry scars no policy can erase.

According to the police report, the motorcyclist 'lost control, struck hard, and flew.' The report states he was helmeted and was ejected from the motorcycle, suffering fatal head injuries. Police cite 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Unsafe Speed' as contributing factors in the crash. The rider was the sole occupant, traveling northbound, and held only a permit. The report details that the motorcycle struck with its right front bumper and sustained damage to the right front quarter panel. The narrative closes with the man dying alone on the bridge, his engine cooling beside him.

The bill, now in committee, would require the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to set strict vehicle safety standards that protect pedestrians and cyclists. The measure calls for benchmarks on vehicle height, hood and bumper design, and blind zone size. It also demands that federal consumer safety ratings reflect how dangerous cars are to people outside them. Scanlon said, “Just the raw statistics make a really compelling case about the incredible, exponential rise in pedestrian and bicyclist deaths.” She acknowledged automaker resistance but insisted, “clearly, we need to do something in order to improve safety.” The bill takes aim at the deadly rise of large vehicles and the federal government’s failure to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Transportation Alternatives called the crash 'entirely preventable,' blasting Mayor Adams for slow progress and broken promises. 'If Mayor Adams wants to save lives, he only has to build the streets and intersections that our city needs and our children deserve,' said co-interim director Elizabeth Adams. Despite a 2022 mayoral pledge and DOT promises, no real safety improvements have been made. Activists demand protected bike lanes and street redesign.

The street swallowed another life.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a box truck was making a right turn on Ditmas Avenue near Coney Island Avenue when it struck a 16-year-old riding a Hurley e-bike. The report states the teen was crushed beneath the truck’s right front quarter panel, suffering fatal chest injuries. The victim was ejected and died at the scene. The truck sustained no damage and continued on, according to the narrative. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified' and does not cite any driver error, but the sequence of events centers on the truck’s right turn and the resulting impact. The report notes the e-bike rider was unlicensed and wore no helmet, but these details are listed only after the fatal collision caused by the truck’s maneuver.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

No driver errors beyond 'unspecified' are listed, but the unlicensed status is a critical systemic failure. Helmet use is mentioned only to note its absence, after the primary driver error. The crash underscores the lethal consequences when unlicensed drivers operate vehicles on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Riders win space.</p><p class=mb3>On August 14, 2024, the Department of Transportation announced a permanent express bike lane for the First Avenue tunnel. The project, not tied to a council bill but a DOT action, will install a jersey-barrier-protected lane, realign the uptown cycling path, and add intersection safety measures. The DOT aims to finish before the next UN General Assembly in September. Hayes Lord, DOT bike program director, said, "We saw this as a chance to actually make an express lane through the tunnel." Jason Froimowitz, CB6 Transportation Committee chair, called the tunnel "opportune for conflicts" and praised the bypass. Residents like Mariam Rauf described frequent close calls with cars. The plan removes a car lane, giving cyclists protected space and reducing high-speed danger. Local support is strong.
