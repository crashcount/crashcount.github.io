Riders win space.</p><p class=mb3>On August 14, 2024, the Department of Transportation announced a permanent express bike lane for the First Avenue tunnel. The project, not tied to a council bill but a DOT action, will install a jersey-barrier-protected lane, realign the uptown cycling path, and add intersection safety measures. The DOT aims to finish before the next UN General Assembly in September. Hayes Lord, DOT bike program director, said, "We saw this as a chance to actually make an express lane through the tunnel." Jason Froimowitz, CB6 Transportation Committee chair, called the tunnel "opportune for conflicts" and praised the bypass. Residents like Mariam Rauf described frequent close calls with cars. The plan removes a car lane, giving cyclists protected space and reducing high-speed danger. Local support is strong. Some want similar routes citywide.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No more quick road reopenings. Streets become sites of failure, not business as usual. The goal: force drivers to slow down, save lives.</p><p class=mb3>This policy proposal, discussed on August 6, 2024, introduces the 'Emergency Streets' intervention. The plan, outlined by Kevin Krizek and Tila Duhaime, demands that after a fatal crash, city officials halve speed limits and install temporary, modular traffic-calming infrastructure within a half-mile radius of the site. These changes would remain for at least two weeks or until the community addresses permanent safety upgrades. The proposal challenges current protocols, which prioritize rapid road reopening over thorough investigation and public awareness. Krizek questions whether returning roads to 'normal' is wise, while Duhaime insists that physical changes—not police enforcement—will force drivers to slow down. The matter summary reads: 'What if, instead, they treated those streets as the site of a catastrophic transportation failure and took immediate action to prevent the worst from happening again?' No council bill number or committee is assigned, as this is a policy concept, not legislation. The proposal centers vulnerable road users and aims to shift responsibility for traffic violence from individuals to the system itself.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Tim Laughlin, president of the Lower East Side Partnership, calls the program 'a pedestrianized destination that supports commerce and community.' Despite clear economic and social benefits, Mayor Adams and Governor Hochul have not expanded pedestrianization.

Lawmakers offer no fix. Riders wait. Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On July 23, 2024, advocates condemned Governor Hochul’s decision to pause congestion pricing, a move that halted funding for 23 new subway elevators. The action, detailed in 'Disabled NYer’s are Victims of Gov. Hochul’s Congestion Pricing Pause,' leaves tens of thousands without access. Michelle Alcaraz and Ray Ray, both disabled New Yorkers, are forced to travel far from home or avoid transit altogether. The MTA’s $16 billion in scheduled repairs, including crucial accessibility upgrades, is now in limbo. Joe Rappaport of the Brooklyn Center for the Independence of the Disabled called on the governor and legislature to restore funding, warning that the lack of elevators treats disabled riders as 'second-class citizens.' The pause keeps stations dangerous for parents, caregivers, and the disabled. Lawmakers have yet to offer a solution.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crash occurred at 21:55. The report states the bicyclist suffered fatal head injuries and internal bleeding, dying at the scene. Police cite 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as a contributing factor, emphasizing that the right-of-way was not given. The narrative notes, 'No helmet. Head smashed. Internal bleeding. He died beneath the streetlights, where the right-of-way was not his, and no one yielded.' The police report does not list any victim behavior as a contributing factor prior to the collision. The focus remains on the failure to yield, a recurring danger on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The city’s most vulnerable pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On July 22, 2024, Governor Hochul halted New York’s congestion pricing plan. The move, not a council bill but a major policy action, stopped new tolls for drivers entering Manhattan’s core. Hochul claimed she was protecting working-class commuters. But as advocates point out, 'the vast majority of people driving into the CBD are more affluent.' Data shows over 60 percent of car commuters make more than $100,000 a year. Only 13.7 percent of education, healthcare, and social assistance workers drive to Manhattan. The pause strips $16.5 billion from transit upgrades, hurting the 900,000-plus daily transit riders. Renae Reynolds and Danny Pearlstein, transit advocates, slammed the decision. They argue it blocks an 'equitable economic recovery' and leaves vulnerable New Yorkers stranded on slow, crowded trains and buses.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The motorcycle rider, a 31-year-old man, was ejected and suffered fatal crush injuries, dying at the scene. The report states the SUV was 'Making Left Turn' while the motorcycle was 'Going Straight Ahead.' The police report also cites 'Turning Improperly' as a contributing factor. The victim wore a helmet, but the impact proved unsurvivable. The focus remains on the SUV driver's failure to yield and improper turning, which led directly to the fatal impact.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The contributing factor listed is 'Traffic Control Disregarded.' This means a driver ignored a traffic signal, a critical error that led to the crash.
