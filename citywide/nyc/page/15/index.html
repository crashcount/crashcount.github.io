No more quick road reopenings. Streets become sites of failure, not business as usual. The goal: force drivers to slow down, save lives.</p><p class=mb3>This policy proposal, discussed on August 6, 2024, introduces the 'Emergency Streets' intervention. The plan, outlined by Kevin Krizek and Tila Duhaime, demands that after a fatal crash, city officials halve speed limits and install temporary, modular traffic-calming infrastructure within a half-mile radius of the site. These changes would remain for at least two weeks or until the community addresses permanent safety upgrades. The proposal challenges current protocols, which prioritize rapid road reopening over thorough investigation and public awareness. Krizek questions whether returning roads to 'normal' is wise, while Duhaime insists that physical changes—not police enforcement—will force drivers to slow down. The matter summary reads: 'What if, instead, they treated those streets as the site of a catastrophic transportation failure and took immediate action to prevent the worst from happening again?' No council bill number or committee is assigned, as this is a policy concept, not legislation. The proposal centers vulnerable road users and aims to shift responsibility for traffic violence from individuals to the system itself.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article quotes Vincent Aloi, manager of Le Dive, who says, '[Limiting car access] is not hurting businesses, in any sense.' Tim Laughlin, president of the Lower East Side Partnership, calls the program 'a pedestrianized destination that supports commerce and community.' Despite clear economic and social benefits, Mayor Adams and Governor Hochul have not expanded pedestrianization. Hochul’s cancellation of congestion pricing is seen as a missed chance to further protect people outside cars. Community leaders and workers urge the city to prioritize pedestrians and cyclists, noting most visitors arrive without cars.
