Just last week, an eight-year-old boy was killed crossing Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights. His sister watched. His mother grieves. “He was a boy who loved life,” <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>said his mother</a>.</p><p>Scooter riders, teens on mopeds, and cyclists have all fallen.

The DOT aims to finish before the next UN General Assembly in September. Hayes Lord, DOT bike program director, said, "We saw this as a chance to actually make an express lane through the tunnel." Jason Froimowitz, CB6 Transportation Committee chair, called the tunnel "opportune for conflicts" and praised the bypass. Residents like Mariam Rauf described frequent close calls with cars. The plan removes a car lane, giving cyclists protected space and reducing high-speed danger. Local support is strong.

No more quick road reopenings. Streets become sites of failure, not business as usual. The goal: force drivers to slow down, save lives.</p><p class=mb3>This policy proposal, discussed on August 6, 2024, introduces the 'Emergency Streets' intervention. The plan, outlined by Kevin Krizek and Tila Duhaime, demands that after a fatal crash, city officials halve speed limits and install temporary, modular traffic-calming infrastructure within a half-mile radius of the site. These changes would remain for at least two weeks or until the community addresses permanent safety upgrades. The proposal challenges current protocols, which prioritize rapid road reopening over thorough investigation and public awareness. Krizek questions whether returning roads to 'normal' is wise, while Duhaime insists that physical changes—not police enforcement—will force drivers to slow down. The matter summary reads: 'What if, instead, they treated those streets as the site of a catastrophic transportation failure and took immediate action to prevent the worst from happening again?' No council bill number or committee is assigned, as this is a policy concept, not legislation. The proposal centers vulnerable road users and aims to shift responsibility for traffic violence from individuals to the system itself.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
