The resolution urges the city to daylight 'all possible' intersections with physical barriers, quoting: 'We don’t want to wait for tragedy, we know what works and we want to get it done.' Board co-chair Doug Gordon and member Marc Torrence led the push, highlighting the danger of blocked sightlines. The board also backed a new city law requiring daylighting at 100 intersections per year starting in 2025. The measure passed 33-3. The board’s action follows deadly crashes and echoes similar calls from Queens and Manhattan boards. Daylighting is proven to reduce crashes and protect pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Safety loses.</p><p class=mb3>On October 6, 2023, the Department of Transportation (DOT) confirmed it would not install a protected bike lane on the southernmost block of Ashland Place. The plan was dropped after pressure from real estate firm Two Trees. DOT will keep a two-way street with bike sharrows, citing 'community feedback and unique block conditions.' The block connects major cycling routes but remains unprotected. Advocates and politicians, including Andrew Matsuoka and Kathy Park Price of Transportation Alternatives, and Jon Orcutt of Bike New York, condemned the decision. Matsuoka said he was 'angry but unsurprised that Mayor Adams would put Two Trees’ interests ahead of safety.' The move follows a recent cyclist fatality and comes as 2023 is set to be the second deadliest year for NYC cyclists. The city’s action leaves vulnerable road users at risk and signals that corporate interests outweigh public safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
