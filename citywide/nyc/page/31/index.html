Children, elders, cyclists, and workers are struck down in the crosswalk, on the sidewalk, waiting for the light. The city keeps moving. The blood dries. The next crash comes.</p><p>Just days ago, an eight-year-old boy was killed by an SUV in Crown Heights. The street was wide, the car was heavy, the child was small. The city called it another tragedy. Advocates called it what it is: a failure. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/01/tuesdays-headlines-another-child-sacrificed-to-the-suv-edition>Eastern Parkway acts as a major thoroughfare for drivers, and is the sixth most dangerous street in Brooklyn for pedestrians</a>, said one group, demanding more safety infrastructure to stop the killing.</p><h2 id=policy-progress-and-sabotage>Policy: Progress and Sabotage</h2><p><strong>Some leaders move.

Still, the city tries to erase protection for the most vulnerable. On Review Avenue, a new protected bike lane opened after years of struggle. Cyclists now have a sliver of safety. &ldquo;The old street was very dangerous,&rdquo; said a daily rider. The new path is <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/27/eyes-on-the-street-new-bike-lane-puts-the-bliss-in-blissville>definitely safer because he no longer fights trucks for space</a>.</p><p>But for every step forward, another is lost. The mayor removes bike lanes. The council debates. Children die. The city counts bodies.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> Since 2022, they have caused 301 deaths and over 26,000 injuries to pedestrians and cyclists. Trucks and buses killed 93. Motorcycles and mopeds killed 10. Bikes killed 11. The numbers are cold. The pain is not.</p><h2 id=what-now-demand-action>What Now: Demand Action</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every death is preventable. The city has the power to lower speed limits, build real protection, and stop repeat offenders. <strong>Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph limit. Demand protected lanes. Demand enforcement that targets the real danger—drivers, not cyclists or children.</strong></p><p>The city will not save you. Only your voice, raised with others, can force their hand.

The driver, Hector Yepes, was charged with failure to yield and failure to exercise due care. Union leaders Donald Nesbit and Denise Ferrante condemned the city’s response, criticizing NYPD’s plan to cut guard posts and Mayor Adams for not redesigning streets near schools. Nesbit demanded more guards at dangerous corners, saying, "Corners like that, we need additional guards, not less." Ferrante called city officials neglectful, stating, "They ignore it – it’s like no big deal to them." Between 2012 and 2022, 73 crossing guards were struck, but most drivers faced only minor charges. The intersection has seen multiple crashes and injuries in 2023, highlighting the ongoing danger for those protecting children.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

His widow blames Mayor Adams. She says paint is not protection. She calls for real barriers, not empty promises. She demands action, not delay. Cyclists keep dying. The city stalls. Grief turns to protest.</p><p class=mb3>On October 10, 2023, Frédérique Uster-Hug, widow of Adam Uster, spoke out after her husband was killed while cycling in a Brooklyn bike lane. The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, was an advocacy action, not a council bill. Uster-Hug condemned the lack of physical protection in bike lanes and criticized Mayor Adams for failing to deliver real safety improvements. She said, 'Adam’s death was completely preventable. No one else should die.' Uster-Hug plans to join a protest ride to City Hall, demanding urgent action to end cyclist deaths. She warns that delays and scrapped street safety projects will mean more fatalities. Her message: city leaders must act now to protect cyclists and pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Safety loses.</p><p class=mb3>On October 6, 2023, the Department of Transportation (DOT) confirmed it would not install a protected bike lane on the southernmost block of Ashland Place. The plan was dropped after pressure from real estate firm Two Trees. DOT will keep a two-way street with bike sharrows, citing 'community feedback and unique block conditions.' The block connects major cycling routes but remains unprotected. Advocates and politicians, including Andrew Matsuoka and Kathy Park Price of Transportation Alternatives, and Jon Orcutt of Bike New York, condemned the decision. Matsuoka said he was 'angry but unsurprised that Mayor Adams would put Two Trees’ interests ahead of safety.' The move follows a recent cyclist fatality and comes as 2023 is set to be the second deadliest year for NYC cyclists. The city’s action leaves vulnerable road users at risk and signals that corporate interests outweigh public safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Police say both stopped at a red light; when it turned green, the truck turned right, running over Patterson. The driver stayed at the scene and was not charged. This marks the 26th cyclist death on New York City streets in 2023, the highest since the Vision Zero program began. The crash occurred in the 71st Precinct, which has seen 829 crashes, injuring 48 cyclists and 86 pedestrians this year. Council Member Rita Joseph responded, 'We must continue our efforts to make our streets safer for all.'
