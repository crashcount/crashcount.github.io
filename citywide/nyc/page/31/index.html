Safety loses.</p><p class=mb3>On October 6, 2023, the Department of Transportation (DOT) confirmed it would not install a protected bike lane on the southernmost block of Ashland Place. The plan was dropped after pressure from real estate firm Two Trees. DOT will keep a two-way street with bike sharrows, citing 'community feedback and unique block conditions.' The block connects major cycling routes but remains unprotected. Advocates and politicians, including Andrew Matsuoka and Kathy Park Price of Transportation Alternatives, and Jon Orcutt of Bike New York, condemned the decision. Matsuoka said he was 'angry but unsurprised that Mayor Adams would put Two Trees’ interests ahead of safety.' The move follows a recent cyclist fatality and comes as 2023 is set to be the second deadliest year for NYC cyclists. The city’s action leaves vulnerable road users at risk and signals that corporate interests outweigh public safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Kandula, a 23-year-old student, was killed by Officer Kevin Dave, who drove 74 mph in a 25 mph zone. The incident exposed deep flaws in how the legal system values the lives of crash victims, especially BIPOC pedestrians. Amy Cohen of Families for Safe Streets, whose son was killed by a driver, said, 'My child wasn't worth anything.' Cohen and Bobbi Koval, another advocate, are pushing for New York State bills—the Grieving Families Act and Crash Victims Bill of Rights Act—to secure fair compensation and dignity for families. Cohen stressed, 'It’s about providing support and a voice to crime victims, and it should be extended to crash victims whether or not the driver is charged.' Advocates argue that financial penalties alone won’t end traffic violence.

Pavement cracks. Grass chokes lanes. Markings fade. Entrances block. Crossings threaten. Parks and DOT fail. Cyclists and walkers dodge danger daily. Only Vanderbilt Parkway stands out. Advocates demand funding, action, and safety. City stalls. Blood waits.</p><p class=mb3>On September 15, 2023, Streetsblog NYC published a scathing report on the state of six New York City greenways. The article, titled 'These 6 Bike Paths Are in Unacceptable, Incomprehensible, Outrageous Disrepair,' exposes cracked pavement, overgrown vegetation, faded lane markings, blocked entrances, and dangerous crossings. The report singles out the Parks Department and Department of Transportation for neglect and underfunding. Advocates call for increased funding and a transfer of maintenance duties to DOT, arguing, 'the city's sprawling network of bicycle and pedestrian greenways has long been in need of help.' Only the Vanderbilt Parkway section earns praise. Council members are not named, but the report amplifies the urgent call for safe, accessible routes for cyclists and pedestrians. The city’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He flew from the seat. Helmet on. Body broken. No other vehicle. No other name. Distraction blamed. He died there, alone.' The only listed contributing factor was 'Driver Inattention/Distraction.'
