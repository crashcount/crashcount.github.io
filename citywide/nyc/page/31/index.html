Seven hundred thirty-four suffered wounds so grave they will never be the same. The dead are not numbers. A 76-year-old woman, struck by an SUV while crossing White Plains Road. A 32-year-old woman, crushed by a Jeep on Marcus Garvey Boulevard. A 79-year-old man, found dead in a parked car on West 77th.

The meeting followed a DOT survey showing 76% support for protected lanes and 74% for more pedestrian space. The area, a Vision Zero Priority Zone, saw 264 injuries and three deaths—including a 7-year-old and a 16-year-old cyclist—between 2016 and 2020. Local politicians and advocates like Huge Ma and Laura Shepard voiced strong support, calling the lack of safe routes 'an embarrassment.' DOT spokesman Scott Gastel said the agency will keep gathering feedback and present new designs to Community Board 1 by next spring or summer. Until then, Astoria’s streets remain perilous for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal follows a deadly year: three people, including two children, killed in Astoria’s streets in the first quarter alone. The matter summary reads, 'Astorians envision a 31st Avenue that contains a fully protected bike lane, multiple car-free zones, and traffic calming measures along the length of the corridor.' Council members have advocated for these changes in press conferences, letters, and meetings. They are partnering with DOT for a public workshop on September 14. The push comes as the city falls behind on its legal mandate to build 50 miles of new bike lanes in 2023—only ten miles completed so far. Advocates and officials cite evidence: protected lanes and daylighting save lives.

Christine Serdjenian Yearwood, Jean Ryan, Rosamond Gianutsos, and Jackson Chabot spoke out, demanding a total ban and daylighting at all intersections. Advocates argue that parking at T intersections blocks visibility and endangers pedestrians, especially the disabled and children. DOT supports the rule change but gave no timeline.
