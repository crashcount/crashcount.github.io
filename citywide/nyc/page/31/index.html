A black SUV hit him. He died on the street. The driver stayed. Police said, &ldquo;They were walking, he was crossing the street with his sister&rdquo; (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>police said</a>). No arrest. The street is still open. The danger is still there.</p><p>The day before, in the Bronx, a man ran a red light. His car jumped the curb and crushed three people on the sidewalk. One is still fighting for life. The driver ran but police caught him. He faces charges for assault, fleeing, and driving without a license (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/driver-flees-bronx-car-stop-crash/>faces charges</a>).</p><p><strong>In the last 12 months, 244 people have died on New York City streets. 713 were seriously hurt.</strong> Thirteen of the dead were children. The city logs over 81,000 crashes a year. Each number is a name, a family, a future gone.</p><h3 id=the-policy-that-wasnt>The Policy That Wasn&rsquo;t</h3><p>Leaders talk. Streets stay the same. The mayor ripped out a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue after crashes involving children. He said he was listening to the community. Cyclists said, &ldquo;I don’t think he cares if we die&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/cyclists-fuming-over-mayor-adamss-removal-of-bedford-avenue-protected-bike-lane>Cyclists said</a>). The city put back paint. Paint does not stop cars.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Department of Transportation built a new protected bike lane in Queens. A commuter said, &ldquo;The old street was very dangerous&mldr; the new path is definitely safer because he&rsquo;s no longer competing with trucks and cars for road space&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/27/eyes-on-the-street-new-bike-lane-puts-the-bliss-in-blissville>A commuter said</a>). But these changes come slow. Too slow for the dead.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-that-dont-lie>The Numbers That Don&rsquo;t Lie</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks killed 299 people.</strong> Motorcycles and mopeds killed 21. Bikes killed 11. The city counts 182,570 injuries since 2022. The bodies pile up. The city debates.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call your council member. Call the mayor.

The resolution urges the city to daylight 'all possible' intersections with physical barriers, quoting: 'We don’t want to wait for tragedy, we know what works and we want to get it done.' Board co-chair Doug Gordon and member Marc Torrence led the push, highlighting the danger of blocked sightlines. The board also backed a new city law requiring daylighting at 100 intersections per year starting in 2025. The measure passed 33-3. The board’s action follows deadly crashes and echoes similar calls from Queens and Manhattan boards. Daylighting is proven to reduce crashes and protect pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The block connects major cycling routes but remains unprotected. Advocates and politicians, including Andrew Matsuoka and Kathy Park Price of Transportation Alternatives, and Jon Orcutt of Bike New York, condemned the decision. Matsuoka said he was 'angry but unsurprised that Mayor Adams would put Two Trees’ interests ahead of safety.'

The article, 'Two Paths Forward: Broadway Shows What Could Be on Fifth Avenue,' compares Broadway’s pedestrian success to Fifth Avenue’s congestion. The authors cite survey data: most visitors walk, bike, or use transit, but face cramped sidewalks and unsafe cycling. They argue, 'Mayor Adams can help immediately by widening sidewalks and adding a protected bike lane.' The city began work in 2021, but then-Mayor de Blasio halted it. Council members are not named, but the piece calls for city leadership to act.

New York bills seek to fix a system that devalues lives lost to traffic violence.</p><p class=mb3>On September 25, 2023, outrage erupted after Seattle police officer Daniel Auderer was caught joking that the death of pedestrian Jaahnavi Kandula might be settled for $11,000. Kandula, a 23-year-old student, was killed by Officer Kevin Dave, who drove 74 mph in a 25 mph zone. The incident exposed deep flaws in how the legal system values the lives of crash victims, especially BIPOC pedestrians. Amy Cohen of Families for Safe Streets, whose son was killed by a driver, said, 'My child wasn't worth anything.' Cohen and Bobbi Koval, another advocate, are pushing for New York State bills—the Grieving Families Act and Crash Victims Bill of Rights Act—to secure fair compensation and dignity for families. Cohen stressed, 'It’s about providing support and a voice to crime victims, and it should be extended to crash victims whether or not the driver is charged.' Advocates argue that financial penalties alone won’t end traffic violence. They demand safer streets, lower speed limits, and real accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
