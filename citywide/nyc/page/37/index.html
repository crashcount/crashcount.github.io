They want to keep four lanes for trucks. The city plan would add protected bike lanes and pedestrian islands. Some businesses and residents back the safety overhaul. The battle rages on.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13, 2023, a coalition called 'Keep McGuinness Moving' launched a campaign to block the city’s plan to redesign McGuinness Boulevard in Greenpoint. The proposal, led by the Department of Transportation, would narrow the boulevard from four lanes to two, add protected bike lanes, and install pedestrian islands. The matter summary states: 'Trucking companies whose drivers have killed New Yorkers in crashes are among the signatories of a petition to halt the city's plan.' The Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce, represented by CEO Randy Peers, threatened legal action, claiming insufficient outreach. Broadway Stages, a key business in the coalition, issued statements supporting both safe streets and business access. The redesign follows a fatal hit-and-run in 2021 and has support from local officials and many residents. DOT cites a 30-percent drop in fatalities on similar projects. Opponents claim the changes will block emergency vehicles and hurt business, but DOT refutes these points. The fight pits business interests against the safety of vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The committee cited the deaths of a 7-year-old and a 16-year-old at local crossings.

Board members Huge Ma and Adam Fisher-Cox spoke out, with Ma stating, 'I think it will save lives.' The committee wants physical barriers, not just paint, and calls for daylighting and curb extensions as standard in all future roadwork. The City Council recently passed a bill mandating daylighting at 100 intersections per year starting in 2025, despite mayoral opposition.

The project, first promised in 2015, faced years of delay and political resistance.

The corridor is a Vision Zero priority, with high rates of pedestrian injuries and fatalities—233 people were injured on the targeted stretch in five years.

Advocates, including Juan Restrepo and Peter Beadle of Transportation Alternatives, praised Mayor Adams and the DOT for finally acting. Community Board 8 chair Martha Taylor called the proposal 'well thought out' but voiced caution about bike lanes. DOT credits existing bike lanes with reducing injuries and boosting cycling.
