The project, first promised in 2015, faced years of delay and political resistance. The DOT will remove one car lane in each direction, add center-median bike paths, extend pedestrian medians, and install short bus lanes. The corridor is a Vision Zero priority, with high rates of pedestrian injuries and fatalities—233 people were injured on the targeted stretch in five years. The matter summary calls Queens Boulevard the 'Boulevard of Death.' Advocates, including Juan Restrepo and Peter Beadle of Transportation Alternatives, praised Mayor Adams and the DOT for finally acting. Community Board 8 chair Martha Taylor called the proposal 'well thought out' but voiced caution about bike lanes. DOT credits existing bike lanes with reducing injuries and boosting cycling. No timeline for capital upgrades was given.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No current guards lost jobs, but the risk grows.</p><p class=mb3>On May 25, 2023, Mayor Adams and the NYPD cut 483 vacant school crossing guard positions, reducing the authorized headcount to 2,219 for fiscal year 2024. The move, confirmed by NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell, came as a budget-saving measure, slashing $7.5 million from the $43-million crossing guard budget. The matter summary states, 'The NYPD has cut close to 500 crossing guard positions in a money-saving measure—a move that puts kids at risk on school roadways that were already more dangerous than other city streets.' Council members were not named, but union leaders like Donald Nesbit and Denise Ferrante condemned the cuts, citing chronic neglect and daily danger. Streets near schools see 57 percent more crashes and 25 percent more injuries per mile than other city roads. The city claims no active guards lost jobs, but the loss leaves children more exposed to reckless drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They urge a ban on northbound traffic between Dean and Bergen, warning of deadly conflict points. DOT says it will review. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On May 24, 2023, Brooklyn cycling advocates responded to the Department of Transportation’s proposed Bedford Avenue protected bike lane. The Transportation Alternatives Brooklyn Activist Committee praised the plan as 'a step toward creating a safer and more accessible transportation system,' but slammed a key flaw: cyclists must cross moving traffic where the lane shifts sides. The committee called this 'an unacceptable safety risk,' demanding DOT eliminate northbound car traffic between Dean and Bergen. Former DOT Deputy Commissioner Ryan Russo backed the ban, saying northbound Bedford isn’t needed. Advocates also pushed for a delayed bike signal, a pedestrian and cyclist-only crossing at Atlantic, and a concrete midblock island. DOT spokesman Vin Barone said the agency would review the proposals. The activists’ stance: don’t settle for half-measures—protect every vulnerable road user.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
