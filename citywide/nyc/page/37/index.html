The local community board voted unanimously to support the proposal, with some recommendations to adjust bump-out locations and bike parking. DOT urban designer Kaarin Patterson emphasized the project's focus on safety and public space. Resident Samir Lavingia said, 'Lives are more important than free parking, it's just as simple as that.'

The battle rages on.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13, 2023, a coalition called 'Keep McGuinness Moving' launched a campaign to block the city’s plan to redesign McGuinness Boulevard in Greenpoint. The proposal, led by the Department of Transportation, would narrow the boulevard from four lanes to two, add protected bike lanes, and install pedestrian islands. The matter summary states: 'Trucking companies whose drivers have killed New Yorkers in crashes are among the signatories of a petition to halt the city's plan.' The Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce, represented by CEO Randy Peers, threatened legal action, claiming insufficient outreach. Broadway Stages, a key business in the coalition, issued statements supporting both safe streets and business access. The redesign follows a fatal hit-and-run in 2021 and has support from local officials and many residents. DOT cites a 30-percent drop in fatalities on similar projects. Opponents claim the changes will block emergency vehicles and hurt business, but DOT refutes these points. The fight pits business interests against the safety of vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Board members Huge Ma and Adam Fisher-Cox spoke out, with Ma stating, 'I think it will save lives.' The committee wants physical barriers, not just paint, and calls for daylighting and curb extensions as standard in all future roadwork. The City Council recently passed a bill mandating daylighting at 100 intersections per year starting in 2025, despite mayoral opposition.
