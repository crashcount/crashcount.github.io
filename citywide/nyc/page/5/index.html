Police later arrested a driver and charged him with leaving the scene resulting in death. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/truck-driver-charged-off-duty-nypd-officer-killed-hit-run-crash-home-84th-precinct-brooklyn/17676103/>That’s per ABC7’s report.</a></p><p>A name, an arraignment, a charge.

As Attorney General Letitia James put it, <a href=https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/attorney-general-says-police-chases-mostly-banned-20392396.php>“the evidence is clear: police vehicle pursuits and high-speed car chases can be dangerous and even fatal, and it is time for a change.”</a> Policy shifts like this save lives when they are followed, measured, and kept.</p><h3 id=slow-it-down-stop-the-repeat-offenders>Slow it down. Stop the repeat offenders.</h3><p>Tools sit on the shelf. NYC now has the power to set safer default speeds on local streets. Albany renewed 24/7 school‑zone speed cameras through 2030. And a bill in Albany would force the worst repeat speeders to install speed limiters after a set number of violations.

Prosecutors say Fiseku, fleeing police after an attempted burglary, sped through red lights and bike lanes, ultimately hitting Servedio at 37th Street and 34th Avenue. Surveillance captured the chase. The indictment states, 'The defendant allegedly led police on a 10-minute chase through the crowded streets.' Servedio, 36, was returning from a cycling event and had the right of way. Fiseku abandoned his truck and evaded arrest until February. The case highlights the lethal risk posed by reckless drivers and high-speed police pursuits on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A cyclist strikes. Bedford Avenue’s protected bike lane will vanish. City listens to complaints, not data. Streets stay dangerous. Cyclists and children caught in the crossfire. Policy shifts, safety left behind.</p><p class=mb3>CBS New York reported on June 14, 2025, that Mayor Eric Adams will remove three blocks of the protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn after several crashes, including one involving a child exiting a school bus. The mayor cited 'community concerns' and stated, 'After several incidents—including some involving children...we decided to adjust the current design.' City Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized the move, calling it 'pure politics' and warning, 'He is going to make this area less safe for pedestrians, for cyclists.' The article highlights tension between local complaints and street safety policy. No driver error is cited; the crash involved a cyclist and a child. The decision raises questions about how New York responds to vulnerable road users and whether removing infrastructure addresses underlying dangers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
