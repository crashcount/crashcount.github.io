In the last twelve months, <strong>285 people died</strong> on New York City streets. <strong>767 suffered serious injuries</strong>. The names fade, but the numbers do not. Just last week, a woman in Morris Heights was killed by a driver who struck her and fled. Police <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/woman-killed-in-bronx-hit-and-run/>reported</a> her death. Her family waits for answers. The driver is gone.</p><p>On July 19, a stolen car tore through Chinatown at over 100 miles per hour. It killed Kevin Cruickshank and May Kwok. Kwok was sitting on a bench. Cruickshank was riding his bike. The city’s Department of Transportation promised upgrades, but the dead do not return. NY1 <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/07/chinatown-deadly-crash-safety-upgrades-canal-street>reported</a> that &ldquo;a stolen vehicle, allegedly driven at more than 100 miles per hour&mldr;crashed into them.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=patterns-in-the-blood>Patterns in the Blood</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the highest price.</strong> In three and a half years, cars and SUVs killed <strong>328</strong> and seriously injured <strong>549</strong>. Trucks and buses killed <strong>99</strong>. Motorcycles and mopeds, <strong>11</strong>. Bikes, <strong>11</strong>. The city’s most vulnerable are left to cross streets built for speed, not safety.</p><p>Drivers flee. They run red lights. They turn without looking. The city counts the bodies. The numbers do not lie. The pain is not abstract. It is a mother’s phone that will never ring. It is a bench left empty.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city has taken steps. Speed cameras in school zones will stay on through 2030. The Council legalized jaywalking, ending a law that punished the poor and people of color. But the default speed limit is still 25 mph. The city has the power to lower it to 20 mph. It has not used it. The dead keep coming.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit citywide.</strong> Demand action against repeat speeders. Join the fight with Transportation Alternatives and Families for Safe Streets. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The city will not save itself.</p><p><strong>The blood on the street is not an accident.

Rollins allegedly ran over Gary Charlotin, who was crossing Hempstead Ave., then stopped for two minutes before fleeing. According to Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz, Rollins 'proceeded to speed away from the scene while dragging the victim's body, while the victim was still alive.' Bystanders pleaded for the driver to stop. The incident highlights the lethal consequences of driver inattention and failure to yield, as well as the dangers posed by drivers who flee crash scenes.

The plan comes with support from three local community boards. According to the article, 'bus speeds on 14th Street increased by at least 24 percent, and bus ridership grew by 30 percent' after similar changes. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'far fewer New Yorkers are getting hurt in crashes' since the 14th Street redesign. The 34th Street proposal would divert most cars, add painted intersections for visibility, and focus on pedestrian safety. The move targets slow bus speeds—now just 3 mph—and aims to reduce systemic danger for bus riders and people on foot.

Fines become court dates. Advocates warn of escalation. Lawmakers push for e-bike registration after a fatal crash. Streets grow tense. Riders and pedestrians caught in the crossfire.</p><p class=mb3>West Side Spirit reported on May 13, 2025, that NYPD has begun issuing criminal summonses, not just traffic tickets, to cyclists and e-bike riders for violations like running red lights or riding on sidewalks. The change means accused riders must appear in criminal court, not just pay a fine. The move follows the death of Priscilla Loke, struck by an e-bike in 2023. Advocates like Transportation Alternatives call the new policy 'a dangerous escalation.' The NYC E-Vehicle Safety Alliance urges lawmakers to require license plates for e-bikes and scooters. The article notes, 'Under the new policy, a person issued a criminal summons must turn up in person in criminal court.' The shift highlights growing tension over enforcement and the push for stricter regulation after high-profile crashes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
