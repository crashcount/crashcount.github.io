The city’s streets are a slow-moving disaster. Every week brings new names. A 21-year-old woman, Madison Ruiz, killed as her boyfriend spun donuts in a Brooklyn parking lot. Her nephews, ages 12 and 17, left bleeding by the curb. Days later, the tire marks still scarred the pavement. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating. It&rsquo;s affecting everyone in our family, especially (Ruiz&rsquo;s) mom. Maddy was her only daughter.&rdquo;</a></p><p>A teenage e-scooter rider, Nacere Ellis, died on Staten Island after colliding with a Hyundai. Head trauma. No charges.

The numbers are cold. The bodies are not. The city’s most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, children—pay the price.</p><h2 id=leaders-movebut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Move—But Not Fast Enough</h2><p>City Hall claims progress. Speed cameras renewed. New 20 mph zones near schools. But the citywide speed limit remains 25 mph. The law lets leaders drop it to 20 mph now. They have not. Each day of delay risks another life. The city touts record bike lanes and intersection daylighting. But the crackdowns fall hardest on cyclists and e-bike delivery workers, not the drivers who do the most harm. Community boards <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/cart-before-horse-upper-west-siders-demand-nypd-halt-bike-crackdown>call it out</a>: &ldquo;It sends the wrong message about the actual danger on our streets.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph citywide limit. Demand real action against repeat speeders. Join the fight. Every day you wait, another family waits for a call that will break them.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Department of Transportation will ban cars on Scott Avenue between Flushing and Johnson and remove parking at several corners to improve visibility, a process called daylighting. The article notes, 'Drivers struggle to see oncoming traffic on Scott Avenue at Jefferson Street and at Flushing Avenue, due to parking blocking sight lines and the angle of the street.' The intersection saw 39 crashes from 2020 to 2024. The redesign includes a pedestrian plaza, narrowed roadways, and a ban on right turns onto Scott Avenue.

Prosecutors allege Yarimi drove her 2023 Audi A3 at twice the speed limit, striking an Uber and then the Saada family in a crosswalk. The Audi had over 93 traffic violations, including 20 speeding tickets. Brooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez called it 'one of the worst collisions he has seen on a New York City street.' Yarimi reportedly refused a breathalyzer and berated first responders.
