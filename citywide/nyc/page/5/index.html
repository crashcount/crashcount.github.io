An SUV hit him at the intersection. His name is not in the data. His age is. The street is busy. The city calls it one of the most dangerous for walkers. The group said, <strong>"[Eastern Parkway] acts as a major thoroughfare for drivers, and is the sixth most dangerous street in Brooklyn for pedestrians"</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/01/tuesdays-headlines-another-child-sacrificed-to-the-suv-edition>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>Fourteen people were hurt when a van slammed into a tree in Brooklyn. Twelve of them were adults with special needs, headed to a day program. The driver swerved to avoid another car. A witness said, <strong>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sad because they definitely need a lot of attention more than anyone else. I hope that they&rsquo;re all OK at the end of the day&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/transport-van-crashes-tree-bath-beach-brooklyn-injuring-14-people/16903098/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>A 17-year-old died riding a moped. A 39-year-old was killed on a motorcycle. The list goes on. In the past 12 months, <strong>244 people have died</strong> on city streets. <strong>709 were seriously injured</strong>.

There is no greater priority for me than the safety of New Yorkers&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>amNY</a>). Cameras slow some drivers. But the dead keep coming.</p><p>Protected bike lanes work. The city’s own Department of Transportation warned, <strong>&ldquo;Removing the protected bike lane won&rsquo;t remove cyclists—it will only make the street less safe&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/dot-testimony-removing-bedford-ave-bike-lane-will-reduce-safety>Streetsblog NYC</a>).

In three years, <strong>cars and SUVs killed 300 people</strong> and left thousands more broken. Trucks and buses killed 93. Motorcycles and mopeds killed 10. Bikes killed 11.

The street fell quiet, the life lost in a moment of steel and silence.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a box truck was backing up near 546 Gulf Avenue when a thirty-four-year-old man was crushed in the roadway. The incident occurred at 22:58. The narrative states, 'A box truck backed up in the dark. The driver sat behind the wheel. A man, age thirty-four, was crushed in the roadway.' The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified.' The report does not cite any actions by the pedestrian as contributing factors. The truck showed no damage, and the street was quiet after. The driver’s action—backing the truck—placed a vulnerable road user in fatal danger.

According to the police report, the driver was unlicensed and operating a 2023 GMC SUV. The report cites 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as contributing factors. The pedestrian was crossing at the intersection with the signal when the collision occurred. She suffered fatal head injuries and was described as conscious but bleeding from the head before succumbing to her injuries. The driver was unharmed. The police report makes clear that the driver failed to yield and was distracted, while the pedestrian was lawfully crossing with the signal.

The project, not a council bill but a DOT action, targets a stretch ranked in the top 10 percent for severe injuries and deaths. DOT will add eight-foot-wide bike lanes with three-foot buffers, painted pedestrian islands, and daylighting at corners. The plan does not remove driving or parking lanes but reorganizes car storage to align with track columns. DOT planner Rachael Metz called the roadbed chaotic, with frequent illegal double-parking and blocked sight lines. Community board member Nas Magoutas said, 'I feel like I’ve been waiting 30 years for it.' The project follows similar redesigns in the Bronx and will begin after July 1, 2025, taking about two months to complete.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The sole occupant, a 43-year-old woman, was inside the vehicle at the time and was held in place by her lap belt. The report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor leading to the collision. The impact folded metal and resulted in the apparent death of the woman, who did not leave the car. The police report does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor. The focus remains on the danger created by driver distraction, which turned a parked vehicle into a scene of tragedy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Witness Jack Collins said, "He died basically on the spot." The e-bike rider remained at the scene. No arrests were made. The article notes this intersection is known for frequent stop sign violations: "It's not a unicorn incident. It's happened a lot." The piece highlights systemic issues, including delivery app pressures and gaps in e-bike regulation. City data shows e-bikes account for less than 2% of traffic deaths, but the policy debate continues. Lawmakers have called for tighter rules, as delivery workers face incentives to rush.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states the e-bike driver was 'unlicensed' and identifies 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as a contributing factor. The impact occurred at the center front end of the e-bike, causing severe head injuries and fatal bleeding to the pedestrian. The police report describes the victim as 'crossing, no signal, or crosswalk' and 'not at intersection,' but the primary focus remains on the unlicensed status of the e-bike operator and the disregard for traffic control. The narrative details a quiet night interrupted by the crash, with the victim left motionless on the pavement. No other contributing factors from the pedestrian are cited in the report.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

City Hall has stalled.</p><p class=mb3>On March 18, 2025, leaders of Manhattan Community Boards 4, 5, and 6 sent a letter to Mayor Adams and the Department of Transportation. The letter urges the city to deliver a long-promised busway along the full length of 34th Street. The boards request widened sidewalks, bus stop bulb-outs, and dedicated loading and pickup/drop off zones. They write, 'this project would significantly improve the efficiency and livability of 34th Street for both commuters and pedestrians.' The boards cite the 14th Street busway, which increased bus speeds by 24 percent and ridership by 30 percent. Council members are not named, but the boards’ action is clear: they support the busway and pedestrian improvements. The letter calls these changes 'necessary and forward-thinking' for safety and congestion. Mayor Adams has lagged on bus lanes, painting just 5 miles per year, far below the City Council’s 30-mile goal. DOT says a proposal is coming.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
