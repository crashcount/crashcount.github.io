Repeat offenders face points, higher fines, and possible license loss. Over 28,000 violations in 15 months. Advocates demand even tougher enforcement. Hearing set for March 12.</p><p class=mb3>The Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) has proposed new rules to escalate fines and penalties for taxi drivers who block bike lanes, crosswalks, and other critical spaces. The policy proposal, announced February 28, 2025, would add points to TLC licenses for each offense—one for the first, two for the second within 15 months, and increased fines for the third. Six points in 15 months could mean suspension; ten could mean revocation. The matter summary states, 'rules promise to increase safety for passengers, pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorists alike [and] target a relatively small group of repeat offenders.' TLC spokesperson Jason Kersten said the changes target repeat offenders who make streets dangerous. Street safety advocate Jehiah Czebotar and Transportation Alternatives director Ben Furnas support the proposal but call for automated camera enforcement to catch more violators. A public hearing is scheduled for March 12.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states the sedan's front passenger, a 26-year-old woman, suffered fatal head injuries and died at the scene. The sedan's driver was unlicensed, as documented in the official vehicle records. The police report attributes the primary contributing factor to 'Unsafe Speed.' The narrative describes the sedan as 'slammed into a bus, then a parked box truck,' underscoring the violent sequence. No contributing factors related to the victim's behavior are cited in the report. The focus remains on the unlicensed driver’s excessive speed and the systemic danger posed by unqualified motorists operating vehicles on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Prosecutors said Pena was drunk, high on cocaine and marijuana, and driving 83 mph in a 25 mph zone when he ran a red light and struck Diaz’s BMW. Surveillance footage showed the Mercedes 'barreled through an East Elmhurst intersection' at 4:15 a.m. Diaz, headed to work at LaGuardia, died at the scene. Pena refused a breath test; a blood draw later confirmed drug use. He was charged with vehicular manslaughter, DWI, and refusal to submit to testing, but posted $50,000 bail. The article highlights family grief and outrage at bail laws, quoting Diaz’s brother: 'Pena will walk the streets for a $50,000 bail...

The protected bike lane and street redesign, finished in late 2023 from East 59th to East 96th streets, cut total injuries by 33 percent. Pedestrian injuries dropped 63 percent. Cyclist injuries fell 10 percent, even as bike traffic jumped 79 percent. No pedestrians or cyclists have died since the changes. DOT spokesman Vin Barone said, "DOT's redesign of Third Avenue has significantly reduced serious injuries—whether you're walking, biking, or in a car on the corridor." The DOT also highlighted its 'green wave' signal timing, set to 15 mph, which slows drivers and helps vulnerable users. Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives called Third Avenue "one of the best streets in all of New York City" and urged similar redesigns elsewhere. The city estimates protected bike lanes cut deaths and serious injuries by 18.1 percent for all, and 29.2 percent for pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill is not a council measure but a federal policy reversal, with local officials and advocates condemning the decision. State Senator Zellnor Myrie was mentioned among those opposing the move. The matter title reads: 'Trump Withdraws Federal Approval for Congestion Pricing, Blowing Hole in Transit Budget, as MTA Files Lawsuit.' The reversal threatens transit funding and leaves vulnerable road users exposed to ongoing traffic danger.
