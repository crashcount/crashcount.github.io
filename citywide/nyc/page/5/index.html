The incident has reignited debate over pending Albany legislation that would require drivers with more than six speed-camera or red-light tickets to install speed limiters, capping their speed to five miles per hour above the limit. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said, "This was a horrific tragedy caused by someone who should not have been on the road," but did not address the bill. Transportation Alternatives Executive Director Ben Furnas condemned the status quo, stating, "There is legislation up in Albany that would have required a speed limiter in this very car."

The deadly crash exposed the peril of driver incapacitation.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, at 10:31 a.m. on 87th Street near Atlantic Avenue in Queens, a Ford SUV traveling south veered off course when the driver lost consciousness. The vehicle struck two men, aged 31 and 67, walking mid-block, killing them both with injuries to their entire bodies. The report highlights 'Lost Consciousness' as the primary contributing factor on the part of the SUV driver. Parked cars were also hit and damaged in the crash. No other driver errors or pedestrian behaviors were cited as contributing factors. This incident underscores the lethal risk posed by sudden driver incapacitation and the vulnerability of pedestrians outside intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The boards request widened sidewalks, bus stop bulb-outs, and dedicated loading and pickup/drop off zones. They write, 'this project would significantly improve the efficiency and livability of 34th Street for both commuters and pedestrians.' The boards cite the 14th Street busway, which increased bus speeds by 24 percent and ridership by 30 percent. Council members are not named, but the boards’ action is clear: they support the busway and pedestrian improvements. The letter calls these changes 'necessary and forward-thinking' for safety and congestion. Mayor Adams has lagged on bus lanes, painting just 5 miles per year, far below the City Council’s 30-mile goal.
