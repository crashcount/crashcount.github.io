Lives lost.</p><p class=mb3>On March 29, 2025, a driver with a suspended license and over 90 violations—including 15 school zone speeding tickets—killed three pedestrians and injured a fourth in Brooklyn. The incident has reignited debate over pending Albany legislation that would require drivers with more than six speed-camera or red-light tickets to install speed limiters, capping their speed to five miles per hour above the limit. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said, "This was a horrific tragedy caused by someone who should not have been on the road," but did not address the bill. Transportation Alternatives Executive Director Ben Furnas condemned the status quo, stating, "There is legislation up in Albany that would have required a speed limiter in this very car." The bill has not yet advanced. The crash exposes deep flaws in enforcement and legislative inaction, leaving vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The boards request widened sidewalks, bus stop bulb-outs, and dedicated loading and pickup/drop off zones. They write, 'this project would significantly improve the efficiency and livability of 34th Street for both commuters and pedestrians.' The boards cite the 14th Street busway, which increased bus speeds by 24 percent and ridership by 30 percent. Council members are not named, but the boards’ action is clear: they support the busway and pedestrian improvements. The letter calls these changes 'necessary and forward-thinking' for safety and congestion. Mayor Adams has lagged on bus lanes, painting just 5 miles per year, far below the City Council’s 30-mile goal.

The city remains dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist (published March 3, 2025) reports a fatal crash in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. A man in his 20s, crouched in the street to pick up food, was struck and killed by a turning dump truck just before 4 a.m. at Withers Street and Woodpoint Road. The NYPD stated, “The driver, a 49-year-old man, left the scene.” No arrests have been made. The NYPD’s Collision Investigation Squad is investigating. The article notes this was one of several deadly crashes in Brooklyn that week, highlighting ongoing risks for pedestrians and the persistent issue of hit-and-runs. At least 10 people have died in Brooklyn traffic crashes so far this year, matching last year’s pace. The crash underscores the lethal mix of heavy vehicles, vulnerable road users, and gaps in enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, 'a dump truck turned left. Its right bumper struck a baby boy crossing with the signal. He died there, crushed beneath steel and weight.' The report states the point of impact was the right front bumper of the truck. The child, a pedestrian, suffered fatal crush injuries to his entire body. The police narrative explicitly notes the victim was 'crossing with the signal.' The driver’s actions—executing a left turn in a large vehicle—placed the most vulnerable road user in mortal danger. The report lists 'Unspecified' as the contributing factor for both the driver and the victim, but the sequence of events centers the dump truck’s left turn and the resulting impact.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Repeat offenders face points, higher fines, and possible license loss. Over 28,000 violations in 15 months. Advocates demand even tougher enforcement. Hearing set for March 12.</p><p class=mb3>The Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) has proposed new rules to escalate fines and penalties for taxi drivers who block bike lanes, crosswalks, and other critical spaces. The policy proposal, announced February 28, 2025, would add points to TLC licenses for each offense—one for the first, two for the second within 15 months, and increased fines for the third. Six points in 15 months could mean suspension; ten could mean revocation. The matter summary states, 'rules promise to increase safety for passengers, pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorists alike [and] target a relatively small group of repeat offenders.' TLC spokesperson Jason Kersten said the changes target repeat offenders who make streets dangerous. Street safety advocate Jehiah Czebotar and Transportation Alternatives director Ben Furnas support the proposal but call for automated camera enforcement to catch more violators. A public hearing is scheduled for March 12.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states the sedan's front passenger, a 26-year-old woman, suffered fatal head injuries and died at the scene. The sedan's driver was unlicensed, as documented in the official vehicle records. The police report attributes the primary contributing factor to 'Unsafe Speed.' The narrative describes the sedan as 'slammed into a bus, then a parked box truck,' underscoring the violent sequence. No contributing factors related to the victim's behavior are cited in the report. The focus remains on the unlicensed driver’s excessive speed and the systemic danger posed by unqualified motorists operating vehicles on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
