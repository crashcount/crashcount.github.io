Projects tied to equity, climate, or safety face removal. Advocates warn the move will kill bike and pedestrian safety efforts. Highway projects continue. Cyclists and walkers lose.</p><p class=mb3>On March 12, 2025, the U.S. Department of Transportation, led by Secretary Sean Duffy, ordered a halt on all discretionary grants for bike lanes and green infrastructure. The memo, citing Trump-era executive orders, targets projects advancing climate, equity, and safety goals. The review flags any project with equity analysis, green infrastructure, bicycle infrastructure, or EV charging for possible removal. Projects with fully obligated funds are exempt. Rep. Rick Larsen (D-Wash.) condemned the move, saying it 'ignores Congress and the law by slashing grants for bike and pedestrian infrastructure and EV charging.' Senator Ed Markey (D-Mass.) warned, 'Pedestrians and cyclists are going to die.' The League of American Bicyclists said the freeze will hurt communities and halt safety investments. Highway projects remain untouched. Vulnerable road users face greater danger as safety projects stall.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, organized by Make McGuinness Safe, follows the Adams administration's rollback of the original plan after political lobbying. Lander declared, "With street safety, City Hall and DOT are supposed to make the assessment: 'Will this project make things safer?' And if so, go ahead and do it." He criticized the current system as a 'corruption obstacle,' promising to implement the full road diet and streamline safety approvals. Lander's pledge centers community voices and rejects interference from wealthy donors. He invoked DOT data showing that redesigns save lives for all users. Other candidates, including Andrew Cuomo, have not signed the pledge.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Six points in 15 months could mean suspension; ten could mean revocation. The matter summary states, 'rules promise to increase safety for passengers, pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorists alike [and] target a relatively small group of repeat offenders.' TLC spokesperson Jason Kersten said the changes target repeat offenders who make streets dangerous. Street safety advocate Jehiah Czebotar and Transportation Alternatives director Ben Furnas support the proposal but call for automated camera enforcement to catch more violators.

Protected bike lane. Injuries fell. Pedestrians, cyclists, passengers safer. No deaths since redesign. Bike traffic soared. DOT says green wave slows cars, helps walkers, riders. Streets once deadly now less so. Numbers show lives saved.</p><p class=mb3>On February 19, 2025, the city Department of Transportation (DOT) released new safety data for Third Avenue in Manhattan. The protected bike lane and street redesign, finished in late 2023 from East 59th to East 96th streets, cut total injuries by 33 percent. Pedestrian injuries dropped 63 percent. Cyclist injuries fell 10 percent, even as bike traffic jumped 79 percent. No pedestrians or cyclists have died since the changes. DOT spokesman Vin Barone said, "DOT's redesign of Third Avenue has significantly reduced serious injuries—whether you're walking, biking, or in a car on the corridor." The DOT also highlighted its 'green wave' signal timing, set to 15 mph, which slows drivers and helps vulnerable users. Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives called Third Avenue "one of the best streets in all of New York City" and urged similar redesigns elsewhere. The city estimates protected bike lanes cut deaths and serious injuries by 18.1 percent for all, and 29.2 percent for pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The feds yanked approval. The MTA sued. Transit funding took a hit. Streets stay clogged. Pedestrians and cyclists lose. The city’s lifeline is at risk. Politicians bicker. The danger remains. The fight moves to court.</p><p class=mb3>On February 19, 2025, the Trump administration revoked federal approval for New York City’s congestion pricing plan. The move, announced by U.S. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy, argued the program’s main goal was revenue, not congestion relief. The MTA immediately filed a lawsuit, calling the action unlawful. The bill is not a council measure but a federal policy reversal, with local officials and advocates condemning the decision. State Senator Zellnor Myrie was mentioned among those opposing the move. The matter title reads: 'Trump Withdraws Federal Approval for Congestion Pricing, Blowing Hole in Transit Budget, as MTA Files Lawsuit.' The reversal threatens transit funding and leaves vulnerable road users exposed to ongoing traffic danger. No safety analyst assessment was provided, but the loss of congestion pricing means more cars, more risk, and less money for safer streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
