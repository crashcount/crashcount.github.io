Just last week, an eight-year-old boy was killed crossing Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights. His sister watched. His mother grieves. “He was a boy who loved life,” <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>said his mother</a>.</p><p>Scooter riders, teens on mopeds, and cyclists have all fallen.

Written by her husband, Dan Langenkamp, it describes the rising toll of traffic violence against cyclists and pedestrians. The piece states: 'She shouldn’t have died because of it.' Langenkamp organized the 'Ride for Your Life' and pressed Congress and the Department of Transportation for expanded safety funding and new truck safety rules.

The call is clear: stop the excuses, count every victim, demand safer roads now.</p><p class=mb3>On November 18, 2022, Streetsblog NYC published an advocacy statement for the World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims. The piece, titled 'On This World Day of Remembrance, Get Angry — And Take Action,' highlights a record number of U.S. cities demanding change as pedestrian deaths hit a 40-year high and overall fatalities set a 16-year record. The article urges readers to 'recognize deadly patterns, push for better data, demand action from transportation leaders, and not accept excuses.' It criticizes road design that prioritizes speed, the auto industry's push for larger vehicles, and the false promise of electric vehicles as a safety solution. The statement insists that Vision Zero is possible if political will and community demand align, and that every traffic death is preventable. No council member is named; this is a broad call to action for policymakers and the public.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
