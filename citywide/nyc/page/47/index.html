The dead include children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians. The city keeps count, but the numbers do not bleed. A 17-year-old boy died in Brooklyn last week, thrown from a moped after a car turned left in front of him. His passenger, 14, left unconscious in the street. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/teen-boy-dead-man-critically-injured-in-moped-crash-in-brooklyn/>Jhoan later died at the hospital.</a> The driver stayed.

But the pace is slow. The city removed a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue. Cyclists <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/cyclists-fuming-over-mayor-adamss-removal-of-bedford-avenue-protected-bike-lane>asked</a>, &ldquo;What the fuck!

The piece, titled 'On This World Day of Remembrance, Get Angry — And Take Action,' highlights a record number of U.S. cities demanding change as pedestrian deaths hit a 40-year high and overall fatalities set a 16-year record. The article urges readers to 'recognize deadly patterns, push for better data, demand action from transportation leaders, and not accept excuses.' It criticizes road design that prioritizes speed, the auto industry's push for larger vehicles, and the false promise of electric vehicles as a safety solution. The statement insists that Vision Zero is possible if political will and community demand align, and that every traffic death is preventable. No council member is named; this is a broad call to action for policymakers and the public.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists and bus riders get space. Pedestrians breathe easier. Community board backs the plan. Car drivers lose parking. The city moves to fix a deadly gap.</p><p class=mb3>On November 9, 2022, the Department of Transportation proposed repurposing two car lanes on the Washington Bridge for a two-way protected bike lane and a dedicated bus lane. The plan was presented to Manhattan Community Board 12's Traffic and Transportation committee, which gave unanimous advisory support. The DOT aims to install the changes by summer or early fall 2023. The proposal states: 'The city wants to repurpose a pair of car lanes on the Washington Bridge uptown for a two-way bike lane and a bus lane next year, giving a dedicated space to cyclists who are currently forced to share extremely narrow paths with pedestrians.' Lucia Deng, a Transportation Alternatives activist, called the move 'huge,' noting the Bronx and Upper Manhattan have long been neglected. DOT planner Patrick Kennedy said, 'We try to maintain the protected connections as much as possible. They really only work if they’re continuous.' The plan removes 20 parking spaces but connects vital bike and bus routes, giving thousands of non-drivers safer passage.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Parks Department closed 1.4 miles of the greenway for repairs, pushing cyclists onto Dyckman, Broadway, and W. 181st—hilly streets with scant bike infrastructure. The city rejected calls for a protected bike lane on the adjacent Henry Hudson Parkway, citing cost and an eight-month traffic study. The detour, mostly unprotected, violates city law requiring safe routes during construction. Streetsblog reports 102 crashes and 36 injuries on the detour this year. Locals and cyclists, including Allegra LeGrande, say the route is unsafe, especially for children and inexperienced riders. The city’s refusal to reallocate a car lane for a protected bike path left vulnerable road users exposed to daily danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the e-bike rider was ejected and suffered fatal head injuries, dying at the scene. The report states: 'Traffic control ignored.' Both 'Traffic Control Disregarded' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' are listed as contributing factors for the crash. The e-bike rider was not wearing a helmet, but this is noted only after the driver errors. The sedan's right front quarter panel hit the e-bike.
