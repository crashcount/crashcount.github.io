His son stands over him, waiting for his eyes to open. They never do. Just days ago, Pasqual Tziquin was killed crossing New Utrecht Avenue in Brooklyn. The driver did not stop. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t stop. He just kept going,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/06/hit-and-run-driver-kills-brooklyn-restaurant-worker-in-front-of-son/>said Henry Tziquin</a>. Eight days later, Pasqual was dead. His family waits for justice.</p><p>Across the city, the violence does not let up. On the Belt Parkway, a BMW vaulted the median and slammed into oncoming cars. Six people were hurt, two left fighting for their lives. Police said, &ldquo;speed may have been an issue&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/05/us-news/six-hurt-when-car-barrels-into-oncoming-nyc-traffic/>in the crash</a>. In Crown Heights, an eight-year-old boy was struck and killed by an SUV. The street is a main road, built for speed. The boy is gone.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-behind-the-blood>The Numbers Behind the Blood</h3><p>In the last twelve months, 236 people have died on New York City streets. Another 704 suffered serious injuries. Children, elders, cyclists, pedestrians—no one is spared. SUVs and cars do the most harm: SUVs and cars killed 300 people, seriously injured 509, and hurt over 26,000 more in the last three years. Trucks and buses killed 93. Motorcycles and mopeds killed 10. Bikes killed 11. The numbers do not lie. The bodies pile up.</p><h3 id=leaders-actbut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Act—But Not Fast Enough</h3><p>Some leaders move. The city has started to lower speed limits, install more speed cameras, and build protected bike lanes. But too often, safety is ripped out as fast as it is built. When the city tried to remove the Bedford Avenue bike lane, the Department of Transportation warned: &ldquo;Removing the protected bike lane won&rsquo;t remove cyclists—it will only make the street less safe&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/dot-testimony-removing-bedford-ave-bike-lane-will-reduce-safety>testified DOT</a>.</p><p>Others push policies that punish the vulnerable. A 15 mph e-bike speed cap is on the table. Michael Replogle, former DOT official, calls it &ldquo;an ill-considered idea to improve safety which will be counterproductive&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/03/ex-dot-official-warns-nycs-counterproductive-e-bike-speed-limit-will-curb-biking-safety>said Replogle</a>. The city debates, the streets bleed.</p><h3 id=act-nowor-count-the-dead>Act Now—Or Count the Dead</h3><p>Every day of delay is another day of loss. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Tell them to protect bike lanes, not rip them out. Tell them to stop blaming the people on foot and on bikes. The bodies in the street are not statistics. They are your neighbors. They are your children. Act now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The piece, titled 'On This World Day of Remembrance, Get Angry — And Take Action,' highlights a record number of U.S. cities demanding change as pedestrian deaths hit a 40-year high and overall fatalities set a 16-year record. The article urges readers to 'recognize deadly patterns, push for better data, demand action from transportation leaders, and not accept excuses.' It criticizes road design that prioritizes speed, the auto industry's push for larger vehicles, and the false promise of electric vehicles as a safety solution. The statement insists that Vision Zero is possible if political will and community demand align, and that every traffic death is preventable. No council member is named; this is a broad call to action for policymakers and the public.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
