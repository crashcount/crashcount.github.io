Vulnerable users wait. Progress is slow. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On January 7, 2025, the city launched congestion pricing. The Department of Transportation (DOT) has not delivered key improvements, like a dedicated pedestrian path on the Queensboro Bridge’s south outer roadway. The matter, described as 'Advocacy and Policy Critique on NYC Street Design and Transportation Improvements Post-Congestion Pricing,' highlights the city’s failure to act. Advocates Danny Pearlstein (Riders Alliance) and Jon Orcutt (Bike New York) urge the city to reclaim space for people, not cars. Sara Lind calls for bold changes, saying, 'This is a dream scenario, to be gifted more space in New York City.' DOT has added a bike lane to the Brooklyn Bridge and bus lanes on the Washington Bridge, but most projects lag. The Adams administration faces criticism for its lack of urgency. With car traffic down, advocates demand immediate action to protect pedestrians and cyclists. The city’s delay leaves vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The policy, debated for decades, now stands as law. The measure’s stated goal: 'reduce traffic, improve air quality, and generate revenue for the MTA’s capital plan.' Tolls vary by vehicle and time. Low-income and disabled residents get discounts or exemptions. The plan expects to cut vehicle miles in the central business district by 6.4% and vehicles by 13.4%. Critics, including hospital executives and business owners, warn of negative impacts, but the city promises mitigation—like electric truck upgrades in the Bronx. The law faces ongoing legal and political challenges, but city leaders press on, calling congestion pricing necessary for New York’s future.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The board’s action follows a surge in police pursuits under Mayor Adams, with nearly 400 chase-related crashes and at least 315 injuries this year.

The incident occurred off the roadway, with the pedestrian described as 'not in roadway' and 'not at intersection.' The police report states, 'Two flatbeds passed. One did not see. The right front bumper struck his head.' The victim suffered fatal head injuries and died at the scene. The primary contributing factor cited in the police report is 'Driver Inattention/Distraction.' No driver errors beyond inattention are listed. The report does not cite any pedestrian behavior as a contributing factor. The focus remains on the truck driver's failure to notice the man lying off the road, resulting in a fatal collision.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Twenty-six crashes in two years. Cyclist Amanda Servedio killed by a fleeing driver. Residents plead for change. NYPD shrugs. No answers. No reform. Streets stay deadly. Accountability missing.</p><p class=mb3>This report details a surge in crashes linked to NYPD high-speed pursuits in Queens’s 114th Precinct. In the last two years, there have been 26 chase-related crashes, compared to 11 in the previous nine years. The increase began after Mayor Adams promoted John Chell to Chief of Patrol and Jeffrey Maddrey to Chief of Department. The mayor claims chases are rare and reserved for violent crime, but the driver who killed cyclist Amanda Servedio was only a suspected burglar. Residents have packed community council meetings since February 2023, demanding an end to these pursuits. Kian Betancourt, a local, told officers, “We are asking you to protect us... and just nothing, I mean, like blank face, absolutely no response whatsoever.” Officers refuse to clarify or change their policy, despite repeated warnings from the community about deadly consequences. No council bill is cited; this is a record of community opposition and official inaction.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
