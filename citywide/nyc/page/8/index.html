Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—no one is spared. In June, a 17-year-old boy died after his moped collided with a car in Brooklyn. His passenger, 14, was thrown to the pavement and left unconscious. Days earlier, a cyclist named Amanda Servedio was killed in Astoria, struck by a man fleeing police through red lights and bike lanes. She was coming home from a ride. She never made it back. The <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/staten-island-man-charged-with-murder-in-hit-and-run-crash-with-queens-cyclist>chase lasted ten minutes</a>. Ten minutes of sirens, speed, and fear.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-policy-moves-but-the-blood-stays>The Pattern: Policy Moves, But the Blood Stays</h2><p><strong>The city talks safety. The city counts bodies.</strong> In June, Mayor Adams ripped out a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue. He said it was for safety. Cyclists saw it for what it was. “I don’t think he cares if we die,” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/cyclists-fuming-over-mayor-adamss-removal-of-bedford-avenue-protected-bike-lane>said Jeanette Samyn</a>. The city rolled out new intersection designs—mini-protected bike lanes, daylighting, barriers. “Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety,” <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/nyc-dot-cyclist-safety-intersections/>said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>. But the pace is slow. The danger is fast.</p><h2 id=the-blame-who-pays-who-waits>The Blame: Who Pays, Who Waits</h2><p><strong>Most deaths come from cars and trucks.</strong> In the last three and a half years, they killed 299 people and injured over 26,000. Bikes killed 11. Mopeds and motorcycles killed 10. The city blames speed, then delays lowering limits. The city blames e-bikes, then stalls on safe storage. The city blames the dead, then moves on.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-no-more-waiting>The Next Step: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Every day, someone else is lost.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits. The city can build real protection at every corner. The city can end the bloodletting. But only if you force their hand. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph limit. Demand hardened intersections. Demand action, not excuses.</p><p><strong>If you wait, the street will take someone you love.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Department of Transportation, represented by spokesperson Mona Bruno, stated its commitment to safer streets for pedestrians, cyclists, and bus riders. The proposal follows the proven gains of the 14th Street busway and comes as congestion pricing looms.

Advocates Danny Pearlstein (Riders Alliance) and Jon Orcutt (Bike New York) urge the city to reclaim space for people, not cars. Sara Lind calls for bold changes, saying, 'This is a dream scenario, to be gifted more space in New York City.' DOT has added a bike lane to the Brooklyn Bridge and bus lanes on the Washington Bridge, but most projects lag. The Adams administration faces criticism for its lack of urgency.

The collision’s violence—'metal screamed'—left one woman dead from crush injuries and a child with severe leg trauma. The report does not list any victim behavior as a contributing factor. The focus remains on driver error and the lethal consequences for those outside the vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The crash occurred at 21:33. The report states both drivers were inattentive or distracted at the time of the collision. The pedestrian suffered fatal injuries, including a shattered pelvis and internal bleeding, and died at the scene. The police report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor for both vehicles. The victim was crossing without a signal, but this is only mentioned after the drivers' failures. The impact and aftermath are described in stark terms: 'Her pelvis shattered. Internal bleeding. She died on the street. Both drivers were distracted.' The sequence of events and the cited driver errors underscore the systemic danger faced by pedestrians on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

No other people were involved or injured. The police report lists 'Unsafe Speed' as the primary contributing factor, with the driver’s lack of a valid license also noted in the data.

The report states, 'A man lay in the road. Three cars struck. His chest crushed. He died there.' Another 56-year-old man, driving one of the vehicles, was injured and pinned, suffering chest injuries described as 'crush injuries.' The police report lists 'Following Too Closely' and 'Reaction to Uninvolved Vehicle' as contributing factors, along with 'Pavement Slippery.' These driver errors—specifically following too closely—are cited as direct contributors to the crash. The narrative highlights the systemic danger posed by multiple vehicles traveling straight ahead on a slick roadway, with no mention of pedestrian error as a contributing factor. The deadly sequence unfolded on a rain-slicked expressway, where human error and hazardous conditions combined with fatal results.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The board says these pursuits shatter safety for pedestrians and cyclists. The letter urges policy change, citing rising injuries and a grieving family’s plea.</p><p class=mb3>On December 23, 2024, Queens Community Board 1 voted to send a letter to Mayor Adams and NYPD Commissioner Tisch demanding an end to "unnecessary" police chases in Astoria. The board cited the October killing of cyclist Amanda Servedio by a suspect fleeing police on 34th Avenue. The draft letter states: "Such chases have dramatically reduced the public safety of pedestrians, cyclists, and other motorists, while we have found no discernible difference in public safety outcomes." Frank Servedio, Amanda’s father, spoke at the meeting, calling the chases senseless and deadly. The board’s action follows a surge in police pursuits under Mayor Adams, with nearly 400 chase-related crashes and at least 315 injuries this year. The board insists non-violent crimes do not justify high-speed chases through residential streets, demanding accountability and safer policies.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states, "Ten cars slid north on black ice. Metal screamed." The sole contributing factor cited for every vehicle involved is "Pavement Slippery." All vehicles were traveling straight ahead before losing control. A 45-year-old woman, a front right passenger, suffered fatal injuries and died at the scene. The report notes her death repeatedly, once for each vehicle involved. No driver errors such as speeding or failure to yield were listed, only the hazardous road condition. Another occupant, a 14-year-old rear passenger, was injured with back injuries and whiplash, also linked to slippery pavement. The victim’s safety equipment use is unknown. This crash highlights the systemic danger of multiple vehicles losing traction simultaneously on icy roads.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The redesign, meant to 'improve safety for pedestrians and cyclists,' was only fully applied between Calyer and Meeker Avenue. The northern section kept two car lanes each way. Residents like Brett M. said, 'It would help to extend it the whole way,' and noted, 'People were speeding.' Local politicians told DOT the reduced version in the north did 'nothing' for pedestrians. The new single-lane setup in the south brought calm and safety. But north of Calyer, cars still dominate. Bike lanes fill with vehicles. Crossings remain perilous. The city’s half-measure leaves vulnerable road users exposed where the redesign stops.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
