Critics warn of spillover and enforcement gaps. The city moves forward.</p><p class=mb3>On January 5, 2025, New York City implemented congestion pricing, charging drivers who enter Manhattan below 60th Street. The policy, debated for decades, now stands as law. The measure’s stated goal: 'reduce traffic, improve air quality, and generate revenue for the MTA’s capital plan.' Tolls vary by vehicle and time. Low-income and disabled residents get discounts or exemptions. The plan expects to cut vehicle miles in the central business district by 6.4% and vehicles by 13.4%. Critics, including hospital executives and business owners, warn of negative impacts, but the city promises mitigation—like electric truck upgrades in the Bronx. The law faces ongoing legal and political challenges, but city leaders press on, calling congestion pricing necessary for New York’s future.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The board cited the October killing of cyclist Amanda Servedio by a suspect fleeing police on 34th Avenue. The draft letter states: "Such chases have dramatically reduced the public safety of pedestrians, cyclists, and other motorists, while we have found no discernible difference in public safety outcomes." Frank Servedio, Amanda’s father, spoke at the meeting, calling the chases senseless and deadly. The board’s action follows a surge in police pursuits under Mayor Adams, with nearly 400 chase-related crashes and at least 315 injuries this year. The board insists non-violent crimes do not justify high-speed chases through residential streets, demanding accountability and safer policies.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Residents have packed community council meetings since February 2023, demanding an end to these pursuits. Kian Betancourt, a local, told officers, “We are asking you to protect us... and just nothing, I mean, like blank face, absolutely no response whatsoever.” Officers refuse to clarify or change their policy, despite repeated warnings from the community about deadly consequences.

According to the police report, the man stepped into the street outside the crosswalk and was struck head-on by a southbound Buick sedan with Florida plates.
