Yarimi, driving with a suspended license, allegedly 'sped through a steady red light' at 68 mph—well above the 25 mph limit—before striking the family as they crossed Ocean Parkway. The district attorney called it 'one of the worst' crashes he had seen, stating the defendant's 'unconscionably dangerous driving wiped out a family.' The crash also injured Saada's son and five Uber passengers. Yarimi faces multiple felony charges and up to 15 years in prison.

Streets turned dangerous in a blink.</p><p class=mb3>CBS New York reported on April 4, 2025, that two separate crashes in Queens left multiple pedestrians injured. In Astoria, a 35-year-old driver 'lost control of her vehicle and went onto the sidewalk, running over two girls, ages 7 and 14.' Police charged her with reckless driving and driving without a license. Later, in South Ozone Park, a 79-year-old driver swerved, sideswiped a bus, then 'jumped the curb and struck four women who were standing at a bus shelter.' All victims survived, but injuries ranged from broken bones to head trauma. The incidents highlight ongoing dangers for pedestrians and raise questions about driver screening and street design.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Three pedestrians—Natasha Saada, 34, and her daughters, ages 8 and 5—were killed. A 4-year-old remains hospitalized. Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez called the driving "almost being wanton." Yarimi’s car had multiple prior tickets from red light and speed cameras. The crash highlights ongoing policy concerns about repeat traffic offenders and street safety. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said the city "is still working to make streets safer, emphasizing the need to protect vulnerable New Yorkers."</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
