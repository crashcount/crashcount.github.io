Every week, the toll grows. Just days ago, two men—ages 80 and 59—were killed crossing with the signal at Third Avenue and 52nd Street. The car kept going. The city kept moving. The families did not.</p><p><strong>Hit-and-runs are routine.</strong> On July 24, firefighter Matthew Goicochea died on the FDR Drive. He fell from his motorcycle and was left in the road. The driver who struck him did not stop. The FDNY mourned: <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/decorated-firefighter-killed-after-falling-off-motorcycle-getting-hit-by-car-on-fdr-drive-GG4877945>&ldquo;We lost a true hero this morning with the tragic passing of Firefighter Matthew Goicochea.&rdquo;</a></p><p>In Sunset Park, two pedestrians were killed in a hit-and-run at Third Avenue and 52nd Street. The driver was caught, but the street remains unchanged. <strong>&ldquo;We wait until someone dies. We wait until a tragedy. We wait to say, &lsquo;oh my gosh, how could this possibly have happened?&rsquo; We let this happen time and time again,&rdquo;</strong> said <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>State Senator Andrew Gounardes</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pauses>Leadership: Promises and Pauses</h3><p>The city has tools. Albany passed Sammy’s Law, giving New York City the power to lower speed limits. The city can set a 20 mph default. It has not. DOT has started to sprinkle 20 mph zones, but the carnage continues. <strong>Speed cameras have been renewed through 2030.</strong> The Stop Super Speeders Act sits in Albany, waiting for a vote. The city’s leaders talk of Vision Zero, but the bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-most-vulnerable>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Most Vulnerable</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> In the last three years, they killed 323 people and left 536 with serious injuries. Trucks and buses killed 99. Motorcycles and mopeds killed 11. Bikes killed 11. The pattern is clear. The most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, children—pay the price. The city’s streets are not safe for them.</p><h3 id=act-now-demand-action>Act Now: Demand Action</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph citywide speed limit. Demand passage of the Stop Super Speeders Act.

The report states she was not at an intersection and was crossing without a signal or crosswalk. The impact killed her instantly, leaving her body in the roadway. The vehicle involved was a station wagon or SUV traveling straight ahead, with the point of impact at the center front end. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified,' offering no further detail on driver behavior or conditions. The narrative underscores the stark aftermath: 'her body still beneath the glare of headlights, as silence settled over the blacktop.' No evidence from the report suggests any action by the victim contributed to the crash; the focus remains on the lethal force of the vehicle and the vulnerability of the pedestrian.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
