Granite blocks, bike racks, and barriers will guard corners. Most pedestrian deaths happen at intersections. The city has ignored its own parking ban. Activists demand real change. The fight continues.</p><p class=mb3>On January 17, 2025, Mayor Eric Adams proposed a budget boost to $3.85 million per year for 'hardened daylighting' at intersections. The plan, detailed by City Hall's Office of Management and Budget, aims to install granite blocks, bike racks, and other barriers at hundreds of corners. Adams said, 'We are ... keeping New Yorkers safe on our streets ... by improving road safety at hundreds of targeted traffic intersections.' State law bans parking within 20 feet of intersections, but New York City exempts itself, fueling deadly crashes—55 percent of pedestrian deaths and 79 percent of injuries happen at intersections. Council members and grassroots activists are pushing to end the city's carveout and require the Department of Transportation to add barriers to 1,000 intersections a year. Jackson Chabot of Open Plans said, 'Hardening is what makes daylighting actually work, so the budget item is really crucial to expanding it across the city.' The push follows the 2023 death of 7-year-old Dolma Naadhun at a poorly designed corner. The fight for safer streets is far from over.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move follows deadly crashes, including the killing of cyclist Amanda Servedio. Clear rules now limit pursuits to violent felonies, aiming to cut needless danger on city streets.</p><p class=mb3>On January 15, 2025, NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch announced a sweeping policy reform restricting police vehicle pursuits. The new rules, set to enter the NYPD patrol guide on February 1, 2025, allow chases only for serious violent crimes. Tisch stated, 'The NYPD’s enforcement efforts must never put the public or the police at undue risk, and pursuits for violations and low-level crimes can be both potentially dangerous and unnecessary.' The policy comes after a spike in chases—up 1,413 percent since 2022—and several fatal crashes, including the death of cyclist Amanda Servedio. Tisch’s directive, supported by Chief of Department John Chell, gives officers clear, unambiguous parameters and shields them from discipline for terminating unsafe pursuits. The department will review chases monthly to ensure compliance. The reform aims to end reckless chases for minor offenses, reducing harm to pedestrians, cyclists, and bystanders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'Midtown to Adams: It’s Time For A 42nd Street Busway!', highlights the need to 'significantly improve the efficiency and livability of 42nd Street for both commuters and pedestrians.' Christine Berthet, co-chair of CB 4 Transportation Committee, stressed that busways make intersections safer for pedestrians. The Department of Transportation, represented by spokesperson Mona Bruno, stated its commitment to safer streets for pedestrians, cyclists, and bus riders. The proposal follows the proven gains of the 14th Street busway and comes as congestion pricing looms. DOT has lagged on protected bus lanes, and Adams faces mounting pressure to prioritize vulnerable road users over private vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation (DOT) has not delivered key improvements, like a dedicated pedestrian path on the Queensboro Bridge’s south outer roadway. The matter, described as 'Advocacy and Policy Critique on NYC Street Design and Transportation Improvements Post-Congestion Pricing,' highlights the city’s failure to act. Advocates Danny Pearlstein (Riders Alliance) and Jon Orcutt (Bike New York) urge the city to reclaim space for people, not cars. Sara Lind calls for bold changes, saying, 'This is a dream scenario, to be gifted more space in New York City.' DOT has added a bike lane to the Brooklyn Bridge and bus lanes on the Washington Bridge, but most projects lag. The Adams administration faces criticism for its lack of urgency. With car traffic down, advocates demand immediate action to protect pedestrians and cyclists. The city’s delay leaves vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The policy, debated for decades, now stands as law. The measure’s stated goal: 'reduce traffic, improve air quality, and generate revenue for the MTA’s capital plan.' Tolls vary by vehicle and time. Low-income and disabled residents get discounts or exemptions. The plan expects to cut vehicle miles in the central business district by 6.4% and vehicles by 13.4%.

The board cited the October killing of cyclist Amanda Servedio by a suspect fleeing police on 34th Avenue. The draft letter states: "Such chases have dramatically reduced the public safety of pedestrians, cyclists, and other motorists, while we have found no discernible difference in public safety outcomes." Frank Servedio, Amanda’s father, spoke at the meeting, calling the chases senseless and deadly. The board’s action follows a surge in police pursuits under Mayor Adams, with nearly 400 chase-related crashes and at least 315 injuries this year.

A 45-year-old woman riding front right died at the scene, her body broken. Slippery pavement caused the crash, listed repeatedly as the sole factor.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a chain-reaction crash occurred early morning on Hutchinson River Parkway when ten cars slid northbound on black ice. The report states, "Ten cars slid north on black ice. Metal screamed." The sole contributing factor cited for every vehicle involved is "Pavement Slippery." All vehicles were traveling straight ahead before losing control. A 45-year-old woman, a front right passenger, suffered fatal injuries and died at the scene. The report notes her death repeatedly, once for each vehicle involved. No driver errors such as speeding or failure to yield were listed, only the hazardous road condition. Another occupant, a 14-year-old rear passenger, was injured with back injuries and whiplash, also linked to slippery pavement. The victim’s safety equipment use is unknown. This crash highlights the systemic danger of multiple vehicles losing traction simultaneously on icy roads.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
