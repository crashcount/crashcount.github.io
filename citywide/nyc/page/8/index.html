An e-bike delivery worker flew through a stop sign. The crash was sudden. Cruz died on the street. The rider stayed. The intersection is known for danger. Delivery speed and city policy collide.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist reported on March 23, 2025, that Luis Cruz, 49, died after being struck by an e-bike delivery worker who "sped through a stop sign" at Franklin and India streets in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Witness Jack Collins said, "He died basically on the spot." The e-bike rider remained at the scene; no arrests were made as the investigation continued. The article notes that the intersection is a known trouble spot, with Collins stating, "It's not a unicorn incident. It's happened a lot." The report highlights systemic issues: delivery app pressures, lack of regulation, and a street design that encourages risky moves. City data shows e-bikes account for a small share of traffic deaths, but the policy debate continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
