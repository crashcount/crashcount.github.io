The street fell silent, marked by violence and disregard.</p><p class=mb3>A violent collision unfolded at the corner of Northern Boulevard and 107th Street in Queens. According to the police report, a BMW sedan 'ran the red,' disregarding traffic control. The report lists 'Alcohol Involvement' and 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as contributing factors. The BMW was struck head-on by a Mercedes sedan traveling straight. The 23-year-old BMW driver, unbelted and alone, was killed behind the wheel. The impact was severe enough that a parked Toyota SUV was also damaged. The police narrative describes the aftermath: 'Metal screamed. A parked Toyota caught the edge. The street fell silent.' The report does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor. The crash underscores the deadly consequences of driver actions—specifically, running a red light and alcohol involvement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

On February 10, 2024, Vennitti allegedly rear-ended David Berney, 43, after Berney and another driver stopped in the middle lane following a minor collision. The crash threw Berney from his car, killing him at the scene. The other driver was injured. Vennitti, unlicensed, abandoned his Mercedes and fled on foot. Police arrested him a year later. A grand jury indicted Vennitti for leaving the scene of a fatal crash and driving without a license.
