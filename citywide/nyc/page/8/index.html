Fire bloomed.' A 57-year-old unlicensed man, driving a Ford sedan, was killed—burned to death while strapped in his seat. The Ford was described as 'ash by the time help came.' The crash occurred at 21:45. The police report cites 'Unsafe Speed' as a contributing factor. The deceased was not ejected and was wearing a lap belt and harness. The data shows the man was unlicensed at the time of the crash. The other vehicle, a Toyota sedan, was also demolished. The report does not list any victim behavior as a contributing factor. The deadly outcome traces directly to unsafe speed and the presence of an unlicensed driver behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The crash occurred at 11:35 a.m. The report states the SUV driver was 'distracted' and that 'alcohol was involved.' The pedestrian was not at an intersection and was engaged in 'other actions in roadway,' but the police report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the primary contributing factor. The SUV's right front bumper delivered the fatal blow, crushing the man's body. The police narrative describes the victim's death as immediate, with his body 'crumpled beneath the wheels.' No contributing factors are attributed to the pedestrian.

The project, not tied to a council bill but a DOT action, will install a two-way protected bike path from Quisqueya Plaza to the waterfront, connecting East and West sides. DOT officials described the plan as making the road 'safer for all users than the current unprotected bike lanes, where drivers often intrude and double park.' The redesign removes 40 free parking spaces, drawing pushback from Community Board 12 members. DOT’s Preston Johnson and Shawn Macias stressed the safety benefits, especially daylighting at intersections to improve visibility for pedestrians. The area saw 28 crash injuries, including six cyclists, from 2019 to 2023. Pedestrian islands will shorten crossings from 44 to 25 feet. The changes are set for spring 2025.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The meeting followed the death of Amanda Servedio, a cyclist killed by a suspect fleeing police. Her family’s statement read: 'We believe Amanda would still be alive if not for the deadly actions of this department and this precinct in particular.' From January through September 2024, officers from the 114th Precinct engaged in 38 high-speed chases—sixth highest in the city. Residents, including Amy and Michael Murtha, criticized the sharp rise in pursuits and the focus on moped riders instead of dangerous drivers. Deputy Inspector Seth Lynch cited department policy but gave no solutions. The community pressed for accountability and demanded police stop risking lives for minor crimes. The meeting showed deep frustration with police priorities and a call for real change to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The study calls for fewer car lanes, more space for cyclists, and safer crossings. Advocates cite deadly crashes. City DOT backs the plan. Safety for walkers and riders comes first.</p><p class=mb3>On November 20, 2024, the Central Park Conservancy released a study proposing protected bike lanes on the park’s four crosstown transverses—66th, 79th, 86th, and 96th Streets—starting with both directions on 86th. The study, endorsed by the Conservancy and supported by the Department of Transportation, recommends reducing vehicle lanes to expand space for cyclists. The matter title reads: "Central Park Study Calls for Bike Lanes on the Transverses." The report also suggests a two-way protected lane on Fifth Avenue, converting Central Park West’s lane to two-way, and adding protected crosstown lanes on 59th and 110th. Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "These recommendations will update the park's drives to prioritize pedestrian safety while also better accommodating cyclists and legal e-mobility options." Advocates and city officials point to past deaths, like Daniel Cammerman’s in 2019, as evidence of urgent need. The plan aims to shield the most vulnerable from harm.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The change, effective with 2026 models, adds safety ratings for how vehicles protect pedestrians and cyclists. The new system scores cars for features like blind spot warnings, lane keeping assist, and pedestrian automatic emergency braking. It also introduces a crashworthiness program to measure injury risk to people struck by a vehicle’s front end. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg praised the move, saying, 'these changes to the 5-Star Safety Ratings will speed up adoption of technologies that reduce the frequency and severity of crashes.' Amy Cohen of Families for Safe Streets called the action 'long overdue and will save lives.' Advocates say the update finally centers the safety of those outside the car, not just those inside.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, discussed in the 'MTA Board vote on congestion pricing implementation,' sets a $9 toll for vehicles entering Manhattan below 60th Street during peak hours. The board's action follows years of debate since the plan's 2019 authorization. Board members Midori Valdivia, Neal Zuckerman, and David Jones voiced strong support, emphasizing the plan's importance for working New Yorkers and transit riders. Janno Lieber highlighted the exhaustive federal review process. The toll is expected to raise $15 billion for transit improvements. Cameras will activate January 5, pending final federal approval. Lawsuits continue, but MTA leaders remain confident. The plan promises to reduce car traffic and improve safety for pedestrians and cyclists, though direct safety impacts for vulnerable road users are not yet detailed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident occurred at 9:49 a.m. The narrative states, 'A 65-year-old man lay still in the road. A southbound box truck passed. No screech, no crash, no damage. Just the crack of bone. The shoulder gave. Then silence.' The police report lists the pedestrian's location as 'not at intersection' and his action as 'other actions in roadway.' Both contributing factors for the pedestrian are marked as 'Unspecified.' The box truck, registered in Illinois and operated by a licensed driver from Pennsylvania, was reportedly 'avoiding object in roadway' before the crash. Despite the lack of visible vehicle damage, the impact proved fatal. The report does not cite any specific driver errors or victim behaviors as contributing factors, but the outcome underscores the lethal risk faced by pedestrians outside intersections in the presence of large vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
