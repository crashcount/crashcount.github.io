Homendy said, 'It ain’t 94 percent,' and criticized the statistic for ignoring systemic factors. She called for a 'Safe Systems' approach, stating, 'everybody needs to come to the table to prevent that death.' Homendy praised USDOT’s adoption of this approach and its commitment to zero roadway deaths. She stressed that responsibility is shared among road users, planners, engineers, and regulators. Homendy’s stance rejects blaming individuals alone and demands action from all levels of government to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
