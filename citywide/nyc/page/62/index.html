Seven hundred thirty-four suffered wounds so grave they will never be the same. The dead are not numbers. A 76-year-old woman, struck by an SUV while crossing White Plains Road. A 32-year-old woman, crushed by a Jeep on Marcus Garvey Boulevard. A 79-year-old man, found dead in a parked car on West 77th.

But the law that keeps speed cameras running is set to expire. If Albany fails, the cameras go dark. Streets go back to the way they were—fast, brutal, and unforgiving.

There is always talk. But families keep burying their dead.</p><h3 id=the-system-fails-the-vulnerable>The System Fails the Vulnerable</h3><p><strong>The city cracks down on cyclists and e-bike riders, not the drivers who do the killing.</strong> Community boards call it out. &ldquo;Holding cyclists to a far higher standard than motor vehicle drivers is unjust, puts immigrant workers at grave risk, and sends the wrong message about the actual danger on our streets,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/cart-before-horse-upper-west-siders-demand-nypd-halt-bike-crackdown>said Manhattan Community Board 7</a>.

The matter title reads: 'Activists are gathering under a new statewide umbrella... to once again demand that Albany lawmakers make roadways safer, force drivers to slow down, and protect victims.' Sara Lind of Open Plans and Amy Cohen of Families for Safe Streets led the call, demanding proven tools to end traffic violence.

The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, promised swift action: 'quickly reinforce half of the city’s plastic-protected bike lanes with tougher materials.' But the city has not acted. The bike lane remains unprotected. Drivers invade it. Cyclists and pedestrians remain at risk. The matter highlights 'institutional sluggishness'—even two deaths could not force change. Rodriguez attended a vigil, repeated his promise, but the street stays deadly. Essential workers still rely on these lanes. Obstructions, poor markings, and conflicts with turning vehicles persist.
