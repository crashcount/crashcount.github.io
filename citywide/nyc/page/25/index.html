The article, titled 'Video Unmasks NYPD Lies About ‘Resolved’ Bike Lane Complaints,' documents how government workers used city-issued placards to block bike lanes. Between November 15 and January 25, 1,177 complaints were filed. In 27% of cases, NYPD officers falsely claimed the bike lane was clear, ignoring photographic evidence. The most common response—'took action to fix the condition'—resulted in no tickets or tows. Only five summonses were confirmed, despite NYPD claims of 66. Internal Affairs and the Brooklyn DA failed to hold officers accountable. The article calls for replacing NYPD with traffic enforcement agents for 311 bike lane complaints and requiring photographic proof of enforcement.

The incident occurred mid-block, away from any intersection or signal. The report describes head trauma and severe bleeding, with the victim dying at the scene, caught between the curb and the car’s front end. The police narrative states the pedestrian was 'crossing mid-block without a signal.' The vehicle’s point of impact and damage were both centered on the front end, consistent with a direct collision. The report lists 'unspecified' as the contributing factor for both driver and pedestrian, offering no further detail on driver actions. The focus remains on the lethal interaction between a moving sedan and a vulnerable pedestrian in daylight, with the system’s gaps leaving another life lost on Brooklyn’s streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'They Don’t Care: Cops, Placard Perps Block Disabled Drop-Off Zones,' highlights how city employees, including NYPD and Fire Department staff, routinely block spaces meant for disabled transit users. Activists and organizations like Independence Care System and the Brooklyn Center for Independence of the Disabled say these spots are almost never available. Julianne Munford, a wheelchair user, said, 'To me, their attitude is like, So what you’re in a wheelchair. Deal with it.' Despite repeated complaints to the local precinct, DOT, and Mayor's Office for People with Disabilities, enforcement is absent. Official warnings and signage have failed. City officials, including Rich Davey, express frustration but admit, 'Ultimately, nothing real has happened.' The ongoing placard abuse strips away safety and dignity from vulnerable New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, named for 12-year-old Sammy Cohen Eckstein, killed by a driver in 2013, failed in Albany last year. Hochul included the measure in her executive budget, stating, “I think it’s ridiculous that the City of New York is forced to ask the State’s permission to reduce speed limits.” Mayor Adams, advocates, and lawmakers rallied for the bill. Amy Cohen, Sammy’s mother, said, “We can’t wait any longer. People like Sammy, and so many others are dying on our streets.” The bill would allow, but not require, the city to lower its speed limit from 25 mph to 20 mph.

The report states, 'Traffic signal ignored.' The moped lay twisted in the dark, its rider showing no pulse. The contributing factor listed is 'Traffic Control Disregarded,' highlighting the BMW driver's failure to obey a traffic signal. The moped rider was unlicensed and wore no helmet, as noted in the police report, but these details are mentioned only after the primary driver error. The crash underscores the lethal consequences when drivers disregard traffic controls, with the vulnerable moped rider bearing the brunt of systemic danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
