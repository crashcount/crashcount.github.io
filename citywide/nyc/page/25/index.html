In the last twelve months, <strong>241 people died</strong> and <strong>701 suffered serious injuries</strong> on New York’s streets. The dead do not get second chances. The injured carry scars no policy can erase.

No charges filed. <strong>Fifty-five pedestrians have died this year</strong>. The number is lower than last year.

The crash occurred at 20:14. The report states the woman was crossing the street, not at an intersection or signal. The sedan hit her with its left front bumper. She died at the scene. Police cite 'Unsafe Speed' as a contributing factor, noting, 'His speed was too much.' The driver continued straight ahead. The report does not attribute any contributing factors to the pedestrian’s actions.

Fleet safety plans, driver training, and crash reporting now required. Over 23,000 trucks affected. City officials and advocates call it a major win for street safety.</p><p class=mb3>On February 15, 2024, Mayor Adams issued an executive order targeting truck safety for city contractors and employees. The order requires contractors with large vehicles to use high-vision trucks or install surround cameras, submit fleet-safety plans, ensure driver licensing, report crashes, and install telematics. City employees must also complete safety courses and report crashes. The order exempts emergency agencies and cases of impracticability. The matter aims to address the high rate of pedestrian and cyclist deaths involving trucks. Department of Citywide Administrative Services Commissioner Dawn Pinnock called it 'a major step towards safer streets for New Yorkers, and a big win for our city.' Kate Brockwehl of Families for Safe Streets said, 'We know these safety solutions will save lives in the five boroughs.' The order impacts over 23,000 trucks and expands on previous city safety pilots.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Experts like Leah Shahum and Terje Elvaas stress, "The foundation for reaching Vision Zero is to significantly reduce the number of cars on the road." The piece criticizes Adams for retreating from bold safety projects and contrasts New York’s inaction with decisive moves in Oslo, Hoboken, and Paris. The analysis urges the mayor to act, not just listen, to guarantee safety for all New Yorkers.

The bill was discussed at a City Council hearing on February 1, 2024. The Adams administration, represented by DOT officials Margaret Forgione and Will Carry, voiced strong support, citing 'public safety risks posed by growing risks of uncertified e-bike batteries.' The bill aims to help delivery workers transition to legal, safe devices and address both street and fire safety. Last year, 18 people died in 268 lithium-ion battery fires. Delivery companies like Uber, DoorDash, and Grubhub oppose the bill, claiming it could lead to fraud and fail to solve the battery crisis. Workers' advocates back the bill but demand protections against retaliation, noting certified batteries are expensive and scarce.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The SUV’s left front bumper hit the pedestrian, crushing his skull and causing fatal injuries. Police also cited 'Tinted Windows' as a contributing factor. The victim was crossing against the signal, as documented in the report, but the focus remains on the driver's actions and the systemic dangers present.

NYPD lied about enforcement. Cameras caught the truth: blocked lanes, fake reports, no tickets. Cyclists forced into traffic. Accountability is missing. Corruption, not confusion, drives the danger.</p><p class=mb3>On January 31, 2024, Streetsblog NYC exposed widespread NYPD misconduct and placard abuse on Adams Street in Downtown Brooklyn. The article, titled 'Video Unmasks NYPD Lies About ‘Resolved’ Bike Lane Complaints,' documents how government workers used city-issued placards to block bike lanes. Between November 15 and January 25, 1,177 complaints were filed. In 27% of cases, NYPD officers falsely claimed the bike lane was clear, ignoring photographic evidence. The most common response—'took action to fix the condition'—resulted in no tickets or tows. Only five summonses were confirmed, despite NYPD claims of 66. Internal Affairs and the Brooklyn DA failed to hold officers accountable. The article calls for replacing NYPD with traffic enforcement agents for 311 bike lane complaints and requiring photographic proof of enforcement. Until consequences exist for lying, placard abuse and blocked bike lanes will endanger cyclists and pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, a pickup truck and an SUV collided while both were 'going straight ahead.' The report lists 'Unsafe Speed' and 'View Obstructed/Limited' as contributing factors. The SUV was driven by an unlicensed driver, as noted in the report. The narrative states the boy was 'crushed beneath speeding steel' and suffered 'crush injuries' to his entire body. The collision occurred at 6:15 p.m., leaving the child dead at the scene. The report does not cite any pedestrian actions as contributing factors. The focus remains on driver speed, obstructed views, and the presence of an unlicensed driver, all of which contributed to this fatal crash.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The incident occurred mid-block, away from any intersection or signal. The report describes head trauma and severe bleeding, with the victim dying at the scene, caught between the curb and the car’s front end. The police narrative states the pedestrian was 'crossing mid-block without a signal.' The vehicle’s point of impact and damage were both centered on the front end, consistent with a direct collision. The report lists 'unspecified' as the contributing factor for both driver and pedestrian, offering no further detail on driver actions. The focus remains on the lethal interaction between a moving sedan and a vulnerable pedestrian in daylight, with the system’s gaps leaving another life lost on Brooklyn’s streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'They Don’t Care: Cops, Placard Perps Block Disabled Drop-Off Zones,' highlights how city employees, including NYPD and Fire Department staff, routinely block spaces meant for disabled transit users. Activists and organizations like Independence Care System and the Brooklyn Center for Independence of the Disabled say these spots are almost never available. Julianne Munford, a wheelchair user, said, 'To me, their attitude is like, So what you’re in a wheelchair. Deal with it.' Despite repeated complaints to the local precinct, DOT, and Mayor's Office for People with Disabilities, enforcement is absent. Official warnings and signage have failed. City officials, including Rich Davey, express frustration but admit, 'Ultimately, nothing real has happened.' The ongoing placard abuse strips away safety and dignity from vulnerable New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
