The article, titled '… And the Biggest Failures and Disappointments of 2023,' slams the Adams administration and City Council for undermining street safety. It cites missed legal benchmarks for bike and bus lanes, interference with DOT projects, and the prioritization of car storage over safety. The mayor and his chief adviser, Ingrid Lewis-Martin, are named for derailing safety efforts. The Council failed to renew the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program and weakened the outdoor dining program. Delays on the Queensboro Bridge pedestrian path and flawed bike lane designs left vulnerable road users exposed. The article’s verdict is clear: powerful interests won, while pedestrians and cyclists lost ground. No council member took a stand for safety.

The event, organized by the Brooklyn Street Safety Coalition, called on Mayor Adams to restore funding for school crossing guards. The Adams administration had announced an 18-percent reduction in crossing guard positions, aiming to save $7.5 million. Kay White, PTSO Co-Chair at Brooklyn Prospect Downtown Elementary, said, “With expanded city funding, real crossing guards could be protecting our children as they walk to school.” She described the process of securing a guard as slow and dependent on connections. Despite a brief increase in staffing after the crash, numbers have dropped again. Investigations show higher crash and injury rates near schools. Crossing guards face daily danger from drivers.
