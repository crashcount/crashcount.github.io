The lane offered no protection. The driver stayed. No tickets. Uster is the 13th cyclist killed this year. Advocates demand protected lanes and speed control. The city stalls. Cyclists die.</p><p class=mb3>On May 3, 2023, Adam Uster, a member of Transportation Alternatives, was killed by a flatbed truck while biking home on Franklin Avenue, Brooklyn. The street is notorious for crashes. Uster rode in an unprotected bike lane. The driver remained at the scene, but police issued no tickets. Uster’s death marks the 13th cyclist fatality in New York City this year, the highest since Vision Zero began in 2014. Danny Harris, Executive Director of Transportation Alternatives, demanded, 'the city must build essential biking infrastructure and Albany must pass Sammy’s Law, to give New York City control of its own speed limits.' Uster’s family and advocates call for immediate action: protected bike lanes, lower speed limits, and an end to deadly streets. The city’s inaction leaves cyclists exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, 'Traffic Control Disregarded' was a contributing factor. The moped rider, a 32-year-old man, was unlicensed and wore no helmet. He was ejected from the moped and suffered fatal head injuries, dying at the scene. The sedan driver, licensed and uninjured, was making a left turn when the crash occurred. No other injuries were reported. The police report notes the moped's front end struck the sedan's left rear quarter panel.

The report states, 'the lack of bike lanes or safe routes represents the most frequent barrier to cycling, according to 73.6 percent of respondents.' CEO Dan Suraci said, 'we see an overwhelming demand for more protected bike infrastructure and trails.' The census urges lawmakers to expand open streets, improve bike parking, and boost safety education. Over 70 percent of confident cyclists say unsafe streets keep them from riding. Forty-four percent cite poor bike parking. The report warns that focusing only on bike lanes misses other dangers. It calls for funding for parking, training, and maintenance.

Clarence Eckerson’s count exposes the lopsided allocation. City transportation officials recently announced plans to 'explore' wider bike lane designs, but the first attempt merely repurposed buffer space, not expanding actual bike room.
