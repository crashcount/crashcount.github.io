The project, long stalled by city-state bureaucracy, now moves to the New York City DOT for action. The matter, titled 'The Time Has Come to Install the Addabbo Bridge Protected Bike Lane,' aims to replace a painted, often-blocked lane with real protection. Transportation Alternatives' Laura Shepard called the move 'urgent and long-overdue,' citing the bridge's danger and rising cyclist deaths. Jamaica Bay-Rockaway Parks Conservancy's Terri Carta urged the city to close the Jamaica Bay Greenway gap. State DOT spokesperson Diane Park confirmed the state's readiness. The city has not set a construction timeline. Advocates demand speed. The bridge remains a threat until the lane is built.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclist injuries and deaths, including Tamara Chuchi Kao, Sarah Schick, James Giambalvo, and Hua Pan, mount as drivers often face no charges.

Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Wider bike lanes can make cycling more comfortable and social, encouraging the amazing growth we've seen in cycling and e-micromobility use.' The new design features a six-foot bike lane with a four-foot passing lane, separated from parked cars by an eight-foot buffer. DOT will monitor the pilot to guide future installations.

Lawmakers say the law could save lives by ending the patchwork of protection that leaves riders exposed.</p><p class=mb3>The Sarah Debbink Langenkamp Active Transportation Act was introduced on March 30, 2023, by Reps. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) and Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). The bill, now in committee, amends the federal Highway Safety Improvement Program. It allows states to fully fund active transportation projects with federal dollars, removes local match requirements, and lets local governments nominate projects. The bill’s summary states it 'would tweak the regulations on the federal Highway Safety Improvement Program and spur states to spend that money to complete their protected bike and pedestrian networks.' Rep. Blumenauer, founder of the Congressional Bike Caucus, said, 'We have a responsibility to make our streets safer for cyclists and pedestrians.' The bill makes it explicit that states can and should use safety funds to connect existing bike and pedestrian infrastructure, not just for driver-focused projects. The law honors Sarah Langenkamp, killed while biking a gap between trails, and aims to prevent such deaths by closing the gaps that leave vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
