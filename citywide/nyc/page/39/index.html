The article documents a surge in micro-mobility on Second Avenue, where 321 bikes and 550 cars were counted in 30 minutes, yet bikes get just one lane to cars’ three. Clarence Eckerson’s count exposes the lopsided allocation. City transportation officials recently announced plans to 'explore' wider bike lane designs, but the first attempt merely repurposed buffer space, not expanding actual bike room. The National Association of City Transportation Officials recommends wider, clearer lanes for safety. The city’s promise remains unfulfilled.

Lives depend on it.</p><p class=mb3>On April 14, 2023, the New York State Department of Transportation approved the installation of a protected bike lane on the Addabbo Bridge. The project, long stalled by city-state bureaucracy, now moves to the New York City DOT for action. The matter, titled 'The Time Has Come to Install the Addabbo Bridge Protected Bike Lane,' aims to replace a painted, often-blocked lane with real protection. Transportation Alternatives' Laura Shepard called the move 'urgent and long-overdue,' citing the bridge's danger and rising cyclist deaths. Jamaica Bay-Rockaway Parks Conservancy's Terri Carta urged the city to close the Jamaica Bay Greenway gap. State DOT spokesperson Diane Park confirmed the state's readiness. The city has not set a construction timeline. Advocates demand speed. The bridge remains a threat until the lane is built.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable people pay.</p><p class=mb3>On April 12, 2023, Streetsblog NYC exposed the 75th Precinct as the worst offender in its annual March (Parking) Madness tournament. The report, titled 'The 75th Precinct is the Most Disrespectful of All!', details how officers park on sidewalks, in bus stops, and block curb ramps, despite having five parking lots. The East New York Community Land Trust noted that several lots, zoned for housing, are misused for police vehicles. Council members are not named, but the exposé criticizes NYPD and city leadership for ignoring the problem. Marcel Moran, a safety analyst, called for enforcement of parking rules. The report documents how these abuses block access, slow buses, and degrade walkability, harming residents, especially those most at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
