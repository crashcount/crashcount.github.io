The plan replaces a painted 'murderstrip' with an 11-foot-wide, two-way protected lane and a five-foot buffer, connecting to the Jamaica Bay Greenway. The matter summary states: 'The painted bike lane on the Addabbo Bridge, once dubbed a "murderstrip" for the danger it posed to cyclists, will soon be replaced by a barrier-protected, two-way bike lane.' Advocates like Brian Hedden (Brooklyn Greenway Initiative) and Laura Shepherd (Transportation Alternatives) praised the project, calling for more such infrastructure. Cyclists voiced concern over the removal of existing markings before the new lane is installed, urging better DOT communication. The project is part of the city's legal mandate to build 50 miles of protected bike lanes in 2023.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report, covered by Streetsblog NYC, states: 'Pedestrian deaths in the United States climbed once again in 2022, reaching their highest point in 41 years.' Safety analyst Pam Shadel Fischer called for a 'kitchen sink approach,' stressing road design, public education, and equitable enforcement. She warned, 'the onus is really on drivers to be on the lookout for people on foot.' The report blames wide arterials, large vehicles, and dark conditions for the spike. Officials admit that asking drivers to be careful is not enough. Federal regulators are considering new rules, but advocates say more must be done to protect those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Board member Huge Ma stated, 'Ultimately, we are just asking DOT to follow the law. It will save lives.' The vote followed the court appearance of the driver who killed Dolma Naadhun, age 7, at a crosswalk blocked by parked cars.

The Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce, represented by CEO Randy Peers, threatened legal action, claiming insufficient outreach.

The redesign follows a fatal hit-and-run in 2021 and has support from local officials and many residents. DOT cites a 30-percent drop in fatalities on similar projects. Opponents claim the changes will block emergency vehicles and hurt business, but DOT refutes these points.
