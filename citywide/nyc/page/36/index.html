Advocates demand more: frequent protected lanes, concrete barriers, car bans on park transverses. Cyclists and pedestrians face daily danger. The city’s timid plan leaves lives at risk.</p><p class=mb3>This opinion, published July 5, 2023, urges the city to go beyond the current Crosstown Bike Lane proposal. The piece highlights the lack of east-west protected bike lanes between 55th and 158th streets, except for two blocks. It quotes: 'A proposal for crosstown bike paths on the Upper West and East sides has potential to close that gap—but should go further by significantly reducing the presence of cars on the arterial transverses cutting across Central Park.' The author criticizes Community Boards 7 and 8 for only requesting lanes every ten blocks, calling this inadequate. The editorial calls for more frequent, concrete-protected bike lanes, expanded pedestrian space, and bus lanes. It demands car bans on select park transverses, citing the death of Carling Mott and widespread resident dissatisfaction. The call is clear: timid measures leave vulnerable road users exposed. Only bold action will save lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, detailed in committee and public remarks, promises to eliminate 70,000 surface parking spaces by 2026, daylight all intersections, and create 300 school streets. Hidalgo declared, 'We must protect pedestrians first.' The policy bans shared e-scooters but keeps private ones legal, expands bike infrastructure, and introduces progressive parking fees for SUVs. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives contrasted Paris’s action with New York’s inaction, noting, 'The number one danger to pedestrians is cars and trucks.' Advocates say Paris’s approach—shrinking car space, not blaming micromobility—shows how cities can save lives by putting vulnerable road users first.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danger grows at every corner.</p><p class=mb3>On June 26, 2023, Heather Beers-Dimitriadis, Chair of Queens Community Board 6, published an opinion blasting Mayor Adams’s decision to cut 500 crossing guard positions. The statement, titled 'Opinion: Mayor Adams’s Crossing Guard Cuts are Unconscionable,' highlights the urgent need for crossing guards, especially near busy roads and highways. Beers-Dimitriadis writes, 'The one thing we can't do is cut headcount without a workable plan to ensure that our students get to and from school safely.' She recounts years of unmet requests for more guards and points to a 2013 tragedy where a child was killed near school. The statement accuses the administration of lacking data, facts, and a plan to protect children, noting, 'By failing to release a plan that ensures that our children get to and from school unharmed, Adams has, in a sense, removed school-aged children from the Vision Zero policy.' The timing is dire: pedestrian and cyclist deaths are up.

She warned, 'the onus is really on drivers to be on the lookout for people on foot.' The report blames wide arterials, large vehicles, and dark conditions for the spike. Officials admit that asking drivers to be careful is not enough. Federal regulators are considering new rules, but advocates say more must be done to protect those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No opposition.</p><p class=mb3>On June 20, 2023, Queens Community Board 1 unanimously passed a resolution urging the city to implement universal daylighting—clearing parked cars from all intersections. The board’s letter to the Department of Transportation calls for physical barriers, not just paint, to keep corners clear. The matter, described as a call for 'standard installation,' was championed by Transportation Committee Chair Dominic Stiller. Board member Huge Ma stated, 'Ultimately, we are just asking DOT to follow the law. It will save lives.' The vote followed the court appearance of the driver who killed Dolma Naadhun, age 7, at a crosswalk blocked by parked cars. The board cited national guidelines and urged the city to include daylighting in all future street work. No members opposed or debated the measure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the motorcycle made a left turn when the passenger, who was wearing a helmet, was ejected and suffered fatal head injuries. The driver, a male with only a permit, was operating the motorcycle at an unsafe speed. The police report lists 'Driver Inexperience' and 'Unsafe Speed' as contributing factors. The victim was a passenger, not responsible for the crash. The report notes she was helmeted, but the primary causes were driver error and inexperience.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
