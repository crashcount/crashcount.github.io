In her statement, she urged the City Council and Department of Transportation to install dedicated crosstown bike lanes, especially on East 85th Street, and to add truck stanchions to block oversized vehicles from restricted roads. Mott highlighted the lack of east-west bike paths in Yorkville and the ongoing threat posed by illegal truck traffic. She said, 'Immediately add safe corridors east/west so that we can prevent another tragedy from happening now in the Upper East Side.' Mott reached out to local council members and Suraj Patel, supporting his safe corridor policies. Her call is clear: build safe, accessible crosstown routes to protect cyclists and all New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Children, especially the most vulnerable, pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>This policy comparison, published August 1, 2022, highlights New York City's failure to match global peers on car-free school streets. The report notes, 'A movement to ban cars from streets near schools is taking off globally, with cities like London, Paris, and Tirana implementing hundreds of car-free school streets to protect children from traffic and air pollution.' In contrast, NYC has only 41 such streets. Advocates like Emily Stutts and Simon Battisti criticize the city’s lack of political will, funding, and urgency. Battisti points to Tirana’s swift removal of parking for safety, while David Belliard in Paris calls for cities to prioritize children and vulnerable people over cars. The report underscores that New York’s program is underfunded, limited, and absent from top officials’ agendas. Streets near schools remain hazardous, especially for children of color and low-income families. The city’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed to daily danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal targets a Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provision that requires automakers to install passive drunk-driving detection systems in all new vehicles by 2024. The bill is not yet assigned to a committee. The senators have not issued public statements, but sources cite concerns over driver privacy. The bill’s summary states it would 'overturn a key provision in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that requires automakers to install passive drunk-driving detection mechanisms.' Safety advocates argue the technology could prevent up to 94 percent of alcohol-related crash deaths. They say removing the mandate puts vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, passengers—at greater risk.
