Freemark argued, 'Reducing automobile dependency can play a major role in reducing costs... a society where fewer people drive is... less destructive to the environment.' Pope-Harden pushed for 'multimodal electrification' and road pricing to curb driving. Both experts condemned auto-centric infrastructure, calling for federal funds to support transit, bikes, and equitable electrification. No council bill was discussed, but the advocacy targeted systemic danger: car dominance fuels inequity, high costs, and unsafe streets for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city had scrapped a bike lane plan for E. 85th Street after opposition from Rep. Carolyn Maloney and local parochial schools, citing a supposed 'security breach.' Janice Mott called this excuse 'ridiculous,' insisting, 'That street should be closed during school hours, or at least when kids are coming to school or leaving.' Janice and James Mott, a traffic engineer, both said a dedicated bike lane would have saved Carling’s life. Suraj Patel, running in the 12th Congressional District, criticized Maloney’s actions as 'an abuse of power.' Streetsblog analysis shows children face the greatest risk of traffic violence near schools, especially during school hours. Other cities have adopted 'school streets' to protect kids.

Patel criticized Rep. Carolyn Maloney for lobbying against bike lanes at the crash site, stating, 'It's time to put people over cars.' He called for capping highways, expanding transit, and passing the Vision Zero and Complete Streets Acts. Patel accused Reps. Maloney and Nadler of fostering a 'culture of no' that blocks life-saving street redesigns. He urged a new generation of leaders to support bike lanes, transit, and housing, arguing these changes are overdue to end car dominance and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Paris, London, and Tirana have hundreds of car-free school streets. NYC has just 41. Streets near schools remain dangerous. City leaders lack urgency. Children, especially the most vulnerable, pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>This policy comparison, published August 1, 2022, highlights New York City's failure to match global peers on car-free school streets. The report notes, 'A movement to ban cars from streets near schools is taking off globally, with cities like London, Paris, and Tirana implementing hundreds of car-free school streets to protect children from traffic and air pollution.' In contrast, NYC has only 41 such streets. Advocates like Emily Stutts and Simon Battisti criticize the city’s lack of political will, funding, and urgency. Battisti points to Tirana’s swift removal of parking for safety, while David Belliard in Paris calls for cities to prioritize children and vulnerable people over cars. The report underscores that New York’s program is underfunded, limited, and absent from top officials’ agendas. Streets near schools remain hazardous, especially for children of color and low-income families. The city’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed to daily danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Victims get no say.</p><p class=mb3>On August 1, 2022, Senators Mike Rounds, Mike Braun, and John Cornyn introduced a bill to repeal a key safety measure. The proposal targets a Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provision that requires automakers to install passive drunk-driving detection systems in all new vehicles by 2024. The bill is not yet assigned to a committee. The senators have not issued public statements, but sources cite concerns over driver privacy. The bill’s summary states it would 'overturn a key provision in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that requires automakers to install passive drunk-driving detection mechanisms.' Safety advocates argue the technology could prevent up to 94 percent of alcohol-related crash deaths. They say removing the mandate puts vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, passengers—at greater risk. The debate pits privacy against public safety, but the cost will be measured in lives lost on the street.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
