In the last twelve months, <strong>243 people died</strong> on New York streets. <strong>708 were left with serious injuries</strong>. Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—none are spared. Just last week, an eight-year-old boy was killed crossing Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights. His sister watched. His mother grieves. “He was a boy who loved life,” <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>said his mother</a>.</p><p>Scooter riders, teens on mopeds, and cyclists have all fallen. On June 26, a 39-year-old man was thrown from his scooter and died on 116th Avenue. No arrests. No comfort. The street is unchanged.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> In the last three years, they took <strong>299 lives</strong> and left thousands more broken. Trucks and buses killed <strong>93</strong>. Motorcycles and mopeds, <strong>10</strong>. Bikes, <strong>11</strong>. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not. Every crash is a family torn open.</p><h3 id=leaders-actbut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Act—But Not Fast Enough</h3><p>The city has moved, but the pace is slow. Speed cameras in school zones are now extended through 2030. “It’s simple: speed cameras save lives and keep New Yorkers safe,” <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>said Governor Hochul</a>. But cameras alone are not enough. Streets need to be rebuilt. Speed limits must drop. The city has the power to set a 20 mph limit. It has not used it.</p><p>Some leaders speak plain. “At this point, there are no questions, just facts: speeding kills, and speed cameras save lives,” <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>said State Senator Gounardes</a>. But others drag their feet, or worse, rip out bike lanes and leave riders exposed.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand that repeat speeders are stopped. Do not wait for another child’s name to be written in chalk on the street.</p><p><strong>Act now.

The advocacy follows her death, which occurred when a flatbed truck turned across her path, running her over. Langenkamp denounces 'paint-only' bike lanes and wide, fast arterials, stating, 'We're luring bicyclists to their deaths.' He urges lawmakers to require truck safety sensors and direct vision standards, questioning why such laws do not exist. Langenkamp’s push highlights the deadly gap in infrastructure and vehicle safety, demanding urgent policy change to prevent more families from suffering. He calls for a societal reckoning with traffic violence that leaves children without parents.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No arrest. This marks the second death at the site this year. Advocates and officials slam the city’s failure to fix deadly roads. Urgent action demanded.</p><p class=mb3>On September 1, 2022, a truck driver struck and killed cyclist Jarrod Little at a dangerous intersection in East New York. The incident, covered by Streetsblog NYC, highlights ongoing failures in Council District 42, where more people have died or been injured in traffic since 2020 than anywhere else in the city. Council Member Charles Barron called for urgent DOT action, stating, 'More needs to be done, especially if you designate this area a priority zone.' Transportation Alternatives condemned the lack of turn-calming, leading pedestrian intervals, and bike lanes, calling the crash 'the result of inequitable street design.' Community Board 5’s Wilfredo Florentino demanded a full review of major corridors. DOT claims deaths have dropped and points to a $900 million street redesign investment, but crashes persist. The city’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed to daily danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It demands speed governors in new cars and direct visibility for heavy SUVs. The measure aims to cut traffic deaths and force safer vehicles onto New York streets. Oversized cars face new scrutiny.</p><p class=mb3>On August 12, 2022, Manhattan State Senator Brad Hoylman introduced a bill in the New York State Senate. The bill would require all new cars registered in the state to have speed-limiting technology by 2024. It also directs the Department of Motor Vehicles to set visibility rules for vehicles over 3,000 pounds, like SUVs and pickups, to ensure drivers can see pedestrians and cyclists. The bill summary states: 'A new bill in the New York State Senate would require all new cars registered in the state to have speed-limiting technology by 2024.' Senator Hoylman sponsored the bill, citing the 'failure of the promise of Vision Zero.' Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives praised the measure, calling it 'common-sense.' The bill comes as pedestrian deaths hit a 40-year high. If passed, it would force automakers to include safety tech and could make some monster trucks illegal on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report surveyed 727 placard-bearing cars, finding widespread illegal parking in crosswalks, bus stops, and truck zones. The article states: 'Lower Manhattan is overwhelmed by cars with city, state, and federal placards—many of them fake or misused—allowing public employees to park for free or illegally.' Advocacy leader Juan Restrepo of Transportation Alternatives called for ending placard abuse and repurposing parking for people, not cars. The NYPD rarely enforces the law, despite mounting crashes and blocked streets. The report urges strict enforcement and reclaiming space for vulnerable road users. The danger grows as city leaders fail to act.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
