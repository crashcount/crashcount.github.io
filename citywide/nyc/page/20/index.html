The crash occurred at 5:10 a.m. when a 2011 Ford SUV, traveling east, struck the pedestrian in the chest with its center front end. The report states the man was crossing outside an intersection, with no signal or crosswalk present. The narrative notes, 'A man crossed alone before dawn. A 2011 Ford SUV struck him chest-first. The street was quiet. He died there, broken beneath the grille, his body still in the hush of morning.' The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified' for both the driver and the pedestrian, offering no further explanation for the fatal impact. The focus remains on the lethal consequences of vehicle movement through pedestrian space in the early morning hours.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The DOJ threatened a civil rights lawsuit if the NYPD fails to act. The NYPD has not announced new enforcement.

The measure, described as a 'hard-fought rule change,' exempts roads with three or more lanes outside Manhattan and requires 60 days of community notice before changes. Amy Cohen, Sammy’s mother and Families for Safe Streets co-founder, called the bill 'a step forward, though not perfect.' Sara Lind of Open Plans called it 'a huge victory,' but noted the carve-outs leave many dangerous streets untouched.

The report states, 'A BMW ran the light at speed. No belts. No breath. Two young men, 23 and 21, crushed inside. Booze in blood.' Both occupants of the BMW were killed, suffering fatal crush injuries. The driver’s actions—specifically 'Traffic Control Disregarded' and 'Unsafe Speed'—are cited as primary contributing factors. Alcohol involvement is also listed as a contributing factor for both the driver and the passenger. The data does not indicate any contributing behavior by the victims beyond the lack of safety equipment, which is noted only after the driver’s errors.

The report states the woman was 'crossing with the signal' at the intersection. The driver was traveling at 'unsafe speed' and 'disregarded traffic control,' as cited in the contributing factors. The sedan was heading south and made no attempt to yield. The victim suffered fatal crush injuries to her entire body and died at the scene. The police report makes clear the driver’s lack of license and failure to obey traffic signals were central to the deadly impact.

The report states she was not using any safety equipment and was ejected from the vehicle, suffering fatal chest injuries. The narrative notes, 'She died alone in the driver’s seat.'

The report states the vehicle "ran the signal" and struck a 57-year-old man who was in the roadway. The pedestrian suffered fatal crush injuries to his entire body and was pronounced dead at the scene. The police report explicitly cites 'Traffic Control Disregarded' and 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' as contributing factors on the part of the driver.

Pedestrians squeeze past SUVs. Cafes spill onto narrow sidewalks. On weekends, the street breathes—open, alive, safe. Advocates demand a permanent car ban. Local businesses agree. The city stalls. The danger remains. Action is overdue.</p><p class=mb3>This advocacy opinion, published April 3, 2024, calls for a permanent car ban on Mulberry Street. The proposal has no formal bill number or council status but echoes a long-running fight for pedestrianization. The article states: "It is time to ban cars on Mulberry Street." Local business owners like Vincent Zeccardi of Caffe Roma and John Michael Rossi of Rossi & Co support the move, citing safety and neighborhood charm. In 2020, Community Board 1’s Transportation Committee unanimously demanded expanded pedestrian space and protected bike lanes nearby. The piece highlights that only 4 percent of visitors drive, while most walk. Sidewalks are too narrow, drivers speed, and fail to yield. The city’s limited Open Streets program offers only brief relief. The call is clear: make Mulberry car-free, every day, to protect the crowds who walk, shop, and live there.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan shrinks parking, widens sidewalks, and links two parks. It puts people first, not cars. The city has stalled for years.</p><p class=mb3>On April 3, 2024, Streetopia UWS unveiled a street redesign proposal for West 72nd Street in Manhattan. The plan, responding to a 2020 Manhattan Community Board 7 request, aims to 'prioritize pedestrians, bus riders, and micro-mobility users.' It would cut vehicle lanes from four to two, reduce parking, and add a two-way protected bike lane. The proposal also calls for more trees, rain gardens, outdoor dining, public seating, bus boarding islands, and dedicated delivery zones. Buses would move faster, and crossing distances would shrink. Streetopia’s vision addresses long-standing safety concerns and public calls for less sidewalk crowding and safer crossings. The Department of Transportation has not acted, despite clear demand for change. No council member is named; this is a community-driven push.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
