The plan cuts car lanes, adds parking-protected bike lanes, and shortens crossings. Advocates and locals back the move. Cyclists and pedestrians face daily danger here. The city finally acts.</p><p class=mb3>On May 14, 2024, the Department of Transportation proposed protected bike lanes for the westernmost mile of Queens Boulevard, between Skillman Avenue and Roosevelt Avenue. The plan, covered by Streetsblog NYC, would reduce car lanes from five to three in each direction, making room for eight-foot parking-protected bike lanes. Painted islands would shield cyclists at intersections and shorten pedestrian crossings. The proposal responds to years of crashes and injuries in a high-traffic area. Community advocates, including Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives and Joby Jacob of LaGuardia Community College, voiced strong support. Jacob called it 'absolutely necessary,' while Shepard said, 'This has been a missing link for a really long time.' The Thomson Avenue extension remains in early planning, with ongoing advocacy for more sidewalk space and safer access. Vision Zero funds are allocated, but advocates push for more. The city’s move follows years of criticism over insufficient safety measures.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article, titled 'Congestion Pricing Will Make New York a World-Class City,' details how Gothenburg and Stockholm used tolls to reduce car traffic, fund transit, and reclaim streets for people. Per Bergström-Jonsson, a Swedish official, says, 'Congestion pricing improved travel times far more than all other road investments.' Stockholm’s crash deaths are a third of New York’s. Council members are not directly named, as this is an advocacy article, but the stance is clear: support for congestion pricing, bike infrastructure, transit, and pedestrianization. The Swedish experience shows that fewer cars mean safer, more vibrant streets for all vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The board called on the Department of Transportation to replace corner parking with physical infrastructure like curb extensions. The matter summary: 'Enforcing the Daylighting Law in our community would significantly increase visibility, which would protect pedestrians, drivers, cyclists and all other road users.' Lucia Deng, chair of the Municipal Services committee, led the push, saying, 'The focus was on intersections and why they are the most dangerous for car crashes and how this just benefits everybody.' The board’s vote was nearly unanimous, with no dissent and one abstention. The resolution highlights that more than half of pedestrian deaths and nearly eight in ten injuries occur at intersections.

The law, named for Sammy Cohen Eckstein, killed by a driver in 2013, carves out wide, fast roads in the outer boroughs. Advocates call it progress, but not enough. Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On April 18, 2024, Governor Hochul announced a deal to pass Sammy’s Law in the state budget. The bill, named after 12-year-old Sammy Cohen Eckstein, lets New York City lower its maximum speed limit from 25 to 20 miles per hour. The measure, described as a 'hard-fought rule change,' exempts roads with three or more lanes outside Manhattan and requires 60 days of community notice before changes. Amy Cohen, Sammy’s mother and Families for Safe Streets co-founder, called the bill 'a step forward, though not perfect.' Sara Lind of Open Plans called it 'a huge victory,' but noted the carve-outs leave many dangerous streets untouched. Mayor Adams’s office praised the law, citing the need for more tools to protect New Yorkers. The law’s passage marks progress for vulnerable road users, but leaves key gaps where speed and risk remain high.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states she was 'crossing with the light' and was in the crosswalk at the time of impact. The collision resulted in fatal injuries to the pedestrian, who died at the scene. The police report explicitly cites 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as the contributing factor on the part of the sedan driver. The vehicle's point of impact was the center front end, matching the narrative of a direct, forceful collision. The victim's behavior—crossing with the signal—is noted in the report, but the primary cause remains the driver's failure to yield. The crash underscores the lethal consequences when drivers disregard pedestrian right-of-way at intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
