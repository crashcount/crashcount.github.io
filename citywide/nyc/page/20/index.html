An SUV hit him at the corner of Eastern Parkway and Albany Avenue. He was eight. The street is wide. The cars are fast. The city counts another child lost. Advocates <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/01/tuesdays-headlines-another-child-sacrificed-to-the-suv-edition>describe Eastern Parkway as a major thoroughfare for drivers and the sixth most dangerous street in Brooklyn for pedestrians</a>. The numbers do not stop. In the last twelve months, <strong>238 people have died</strong> on New York City streets. <strong>705 were seriously injured</strong>. Children, elders, cyclists, walkers—the city’s most vulnerable, crushed by steel and speed.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> In the current three-year period, they killed <strong>300 people</strong> and seriously injured <strong>509</strong> more. Trucks and buses killed <strong>93</strong> and seriously injured <strong>103</strong>. Motorcycles and mopeds killed <strong>10</strong> and seriously injured <strong>44</strong>. Bikes killed <strong>11</strong> and seriously injured <strong>54</strong>. The dead do not care about the make or model. They are gone all the same. The city’s own <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>data shows the pattern</a>. The violence is not random. It is built into the street.</p><h3 id=leaders-actor-dont>Leaders Act—Or Don’t</h3><p><strong>Some leaders move. Some stall. Some rip out what little safety we have.</strong> When the city tried to remove the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane, the Department of Transportation <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/dot-testimony-removing-bedford-ave-bike-lane-will-reduce-safety>warned that removing the protected bike lane won&rsquo;t remove cyclists—it will only make the street less safe</a>. The city risks legal liability for knowingly making a Vision Zero corridor more dangerous. Cyclists and parents begged to keep the lane. One parent <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/cyclists-tell-judge-carolyn-walker-diallo-the-bedford-ave-bike-lane-is-a-lifesaver>explained, &ldquo;Before the protected bike lane my wife made me promise to never bike the children on it because the driving behavior was so outrageous&mldr; Now the street is so much calmer.&rdquo;</a> Still, the fight drags on.</p><p>Elsewhere, the city installs new bike lanes, then threatens to cap e-bike speeds at 15 mph. A former DOT official <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/03/ex-dot-official-warns-nycs-counterproductive-e-bike-speed-limit-will-curb-biking-safety>called it &ldquo;a war on bikes, a war on immigrants, and it undermines traffic safety&rdquo;</a>. The city’s priorities shift with the wind. The bodies stay in the ground.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay, every rollback, every excuse is another name on a slab. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand streets where children can walk and live. Do not wait for the next siren.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report states, 'The box truck hit him first. The SUV followed. Head shattered. Bones crushed. He died there, beneath the streetlights, far from the crosswalk, alone on the asphalt.' Both vehicles—a box truck and a sport utility vehicle—were traveling straight ahead at the time of the collision. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified' for both drivers, offering no further detail on specific driver errors. The pedestrian was crossing the street at a location not marked by a signal or crosswalk, but the report does not cite this as a contributing factor. The focus remains on the lethal impact of large vehicles moving unchecked through city streets, leaving a man dead and unanswered questions in their wake.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The plan cuts car lanes, adds parking-protected bike lanes, and shortens crossings. Advocates and locals back the move. Cyclists and pedestrians face daily danger here. The city finally acts.</p><p class=mb3>On May 14, 2024, the Department of Transportation proposed protected bike lanes for the westernmost mile of Queens Boulevard, between Skillman Avenue and Roosevelt Avenue. The plan, covered by Streetsblog NYC, would reduce car lanes from five to three in each direction, making room for eight-foot parking-protected bike lanes. Painted islands would shield cyclists at intersections and shorten pedestrian crossings. The proposal responds to years of crashes and injuries in a high-traffic area. Community advocates, including Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives and Joby Jacob of LaGuardia Community College, voiced strong support. Jacob called it 'absolutely necessary,' while Shepard said, 'This has been a missing link for a really long time.' The Thomson Avenue extension remains in early planning, with ongoing advocacy for more sidewalk space and safer access. Vision Zero funds are allocated, but advocates push for more. The city’s move follows years of criticism over insufficient safety measures.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The lesson is blunt: fewer cars, safer streets, more life.</p><p class=mb3>This opinion piece, published May 13, 2024, in Streetsblog NYC, draws on Sweden’s decade of congestion pricing. The article, titled 'Congestion Pricing Will Make New York a World-Class City,' details how Gothenburg and Stockholm used tolls to reduce car traffic, fund transit, and reclaim streets for people. Per Bergström-Jonsson, a Swedish official, says, 'Congestion pricing improved travel times far more than all other road investments.' Stockholm’s crash deaths are a third of New York’s. Council members are not directly named, as this is an advocacy article, but the stance is clear: support for congestion pricing, bike infrastructure, transit, and pedestrianization. The Swedish experience shows that fewer cars mean safer, more vibrant streets for all vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She suffered fatal crush wounds and never regained consciousness. A second pedestrian, age 44, was also hit and sustained chest contusions but remained conscious. The report states the Mazda driver was unlicensed and disregarded traffic control. 'Traffic Control Disregarded' and 'Unsafe Speed' are listed as contributing factors. The victims were crossing without a signal but within a marked crosswalk, as documented in the report.
