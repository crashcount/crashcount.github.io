Just last week, an eight-year-old boy was killed crossing Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights. His sister watched. His mother grieves. “He was a boy who loved life,” <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>said his mother</a>.</p><p>Scooter riders, teens on mopeds, and cyclists have all fallen.

The plan, covered by Streetsblog NYC, would reduce car lanes from five to three in each direction, making room for eight-foot parking-protected bike lanes. Painted islands would shield cyclists at intersections and shorten pedestrian crossings. The proposal responds to years of crashes and injuries in a high-traffic area. Community advocates, including Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives and Joby Jacob of LaGuardia Community College, voiced strong support. Jacob called it 'absolutely necessary,' while Shepard said, 'This has been a missing link for a really long time.' The Thomson Avenue extension remains in early planning, with ongoing advocacy for more sidewalk space and safer access. Vision Zero funds are allocated, but advocates push for more.

Per Bergström-Jonsson, a Swedish official, says, 'Congestion pricing improved travel times far more than all other road investments.' Stockholm’s crash deaths are a third of New York’s.
