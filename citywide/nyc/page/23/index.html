Just last week, an eight-year-old boy was killed crossing Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights. His sister watched. His mother grieves. “He was a boy who loved life,” <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>said his mother</a>.</p><p>Scooter riders, teens on mopeds, and cyclists have all fallen.

Instead of relief, the community found dozens of police cars and unmarked vehicles parked in the bike lane and on sidewalks. Nick Stabile, co-founder of the Park Row Alliance, said, 'Our residents have difficulty with something as simple as walking down the street and riding their bikes – and it's especially difficult for those in wheelchairs and with strollers.' Lucy West, a local resident, added, 'Park Row is not a parking lot, it's a street.' The city has not announced a plan for the corridor.

Since 2021, officials have delayed a promised project to give pedestrians their own lane on the Queensboro Bridge. The Department of Transportation, under Mayor Adams, has stalled the revamp, citing the need to keep seven of nine car lanes open. The matter: 'the path is too narrow for bi-directional, shared use between cyclists and pedestrians.' Laura Shepard, an advocate, calls it 'appalling that the convenience of drivers is prioritized over the lives and limbs of cyclists and pedestrians.' At least 23 crashes have injured 25 people since 2021. Bike ridership hit a record 1.98 million crossings in 2023.

The boards urge the city to stop exempting itself from state law requiring no parking within 20 feet of crosswalks. The resolution follows fatal crashes involving children at poorly visible corners. The matter summary reads: 'Ten community boards representing nearly 1.5 million New Yorkers have voted to endorse a ban on parking at intersections (daylighting) to improve street safety.' Ken Coughlin of Community Board 7 said, 'You’re losing parking [that causes] serious injury and death—that’s pretty indefensible.' Carl Mahaney of StreetopiaUWS added, 'Improving the crosswalk experience really resonates with New Yorkers.' Despite support from Brooklyn and other borough officials, DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez hesitates, citing cost and limited data. DOT pledges to daylight 1,000 intersections yearly, but no full safety analysis exists.

The harms extend to air and noise pollution, lead exposure, violence, and social injustice, with marginalized communities bearing the brunt. Patrick Miner, a study author, argues, 'If automobility has contributed, you know, X billion dollars of economic growth ... how do we compare that to killing 60 to 80 million people?' The report calls for policies that reduce car harm and prioritize human-centered transportation—walking, cycling, and public transit.
