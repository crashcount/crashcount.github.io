Since 2021, officials have delayed a promised project to give pedestrians their own lane on the Queensboro Bridge. The Department of Transportation, under Mayor Adams, has stalled the revamp, citing the need to keep seven of nine car lanes open. The matter: 'the path is too narrow for bi-directional, shared use between cyclists and pedestrians.' Laura Shepard, an advocate, calls it 'appalling that the convenience of drivers is prioritized over the lives and limbs of cyclists and pedestrians.' At least 23 crashes have injured 25 people since 2021. Bike ridership hit a record 1.98 million crossings in 2023. The city’s inaction keeps vulnerable road users at risk while car traffic takes priority.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The boards urge the city to stop exempting itself from state law requiring no parking within 20 feet of crosswalks. The resolution follows fatal crashes involving children at poorly visible corners. The matter summary reads: 'Ten community boards representing nearly 1.5 million New Yorkers have voted to endorse a ban on parking at intersections (daylighting) to improve street safety.' Ken Coughlin of Community Board 7 said, 'You’re losing parking [that causes] serious injury and death—that’s pretty indefensible.' Carl Mahaney of StreetopiaUWS added, 'Improving the crosswalk experience really resonates with New Yorkers.' Despite support from Brooklyn and other borough officials, DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez hesitates, citing cost and limited data. DOT pledges to daylight 1,000 intersections yearly, but no full safety analysis exists.

The harms extend to air and noise pollution, lead exposure, violence, and social injustice, with marginalized communities bearing the brunt.

In fact, they overwhelmingly stand to gain from congestion pricing's benefits.' Jones highlights that only 2 percent of poor, outer-borough residents drive into Manhattan, and most would qualify for toll discounts. He warns that lawsuits from suburban officials threaten $15 billion in transit upgrades—modern signals, elevators, electric buses, and new trains—critical for vulnerable riders in neighborhoods like Mott Haven, Crown Heights, Harlem, and Jamaica.

The crash occurred in the morning, with the report noting, 'Morning light spilled over the street.' The bicyclist, who was wearing a helmet, was ejected and suffered injuries to his entire body, resulting in death. The police report explicitly cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor. One sedan was parked, while the other was traveling straight ahead. The report describes the aftermath: 'His whole body broken. The silence afterward was complete.' The victim’s helmet use is noted only after the driver error. This fatal collision underscores the lethal consequences of driver distraction on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Deaths persist.</p><p class=mb3>A City Council bill, set for reintroduction in February 2024, would require taxi owners to place stickers warning passengers to look for cyclists before opening doors. The bill follows the death of a cyclist doored into traffic on Broadway, Brooklyn—a corridor labeled a Vision Zero Priority for over a decade, yet still hazardous. Council Member Jen Gutierrez called for accountability, saying, 'Broadway is notoriously difficult & dangerous for cyclists, pedestrians, and motorists alike.' Transportation Alternatives’ Danny Harris added, 'Let this be another tragic call for the City to fix it and keep cyclists safe.' Despite DOT claims of progress, injuries and fatalities have not declined. The bill aims to address a recurring danger: dooring, which rarely results in enforcement. The lack of protected bike lanes and daylighting at the crash site remains unaddressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
