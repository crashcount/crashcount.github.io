The crash occurred at 4:09 a.m. The report explicitly lists 'Alcohol Involvement' as a contributing factor. The pickup was traveling straight ahead, while the sedan was also moving westbound. The police narrative states: 'A pickup struck a westbound sedan’s side. The front passenger, 29, belted and still, bled out in her seat. Airbag torn open. Harness tight across her chest.

The proposal, aimed at the Adams administration and City Council, calls for mandatory safety standards, paid time for workers, speed-limited e-bikes with safe batteries, and robust data sharing. Danny Harris, the group’s executive director, said, “Same-day delivery apps would be regulated by New York City and then charged for the privilege of operating.” The recommendations also demand safe charging stations, secure bike parking, and a ban on moped sales to unlicensed drivers. Harris stressed, “The industry’s created a race to the bottom which has made delivery worker the most dangerous profession in the city.” The proposal urges the city to phase out gas-powered delivery vehicles, ban immediate delivery promises, and prioritize protected bike lanes using delivery data. Industry representatives pushed back, but Harris insisted the current system endangers workers and the public.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

City employees must also complete safety courses and report crashes. The order exempts emergency agencies and cases of impracticability. The matter aims to address the high rate of pedestrian and cyclist deaths involving trucks.
