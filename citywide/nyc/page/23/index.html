The boards urge the city to stop exempting itself from state law requiring no parking within 20 feet of crosswalks. The resolution follows fatal crashes involving children at poorly visible corners. The matter summary reads: 'Ten community boards representing nearly 1.5 million New Yorkers have voted to endorse a ban on parking at intersections (daylighting) to improve street safety.' Ken Coughlin of Community Board 7 said, 'You’re losing parking [that causes] serious injury and death—that’s pretty indefensible.' Carl Mahaney of StreetopiaUWS added, 'Improving the crosswalk experience really resonates with New Yorkers.' Despite support from Brooklyn and other borough officials, DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez hesitates, citing cost and limited data. DOT pledges to daylight 1,000 intersections yearly, but no full safety analysis exists.

The pedestrian was at the intersection, engaged in 'other actions in roadway' as described in the report. The vehicle, a 2018 bus, was undamaged and driven by a licensed male driver. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified.' No driver errors are explicitly cited, but the narrative centers the lethal consequences of a turning bus and the vulnerability of those on foot.

The pilot, part of the 'Charge Safe Ride Safe Action Plan,' opened its first station in Cooper Square.

The official summary states the pilot 'aims to improve the safety of recharging lithium-ion batteries and counter the demonization of e-bikes.' Mayor Adams said, 'This pilot program ... will give delivery workers the ability to access safe, accessible, outdoor battery-charging that will undoubtedly save lives.' The city faces delays and pushback on e-bike infrastructure, with faster progress for electric cars. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'We’re going to be working to address any area where we can make an improvement.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
