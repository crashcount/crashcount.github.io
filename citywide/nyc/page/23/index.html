The 57-year-old woman riding the e-bike, who was wearing a helmet, was struck and crushed at the hip. She died at the scene. The report lists 'Passing Too Closely' as the primary contributing factor, underscoring a critical driver error by the truck operator. The truck itself sustained no damage and continued on after the collision. The e-bike rider’s helmet use is noted in the report, but the fatal outcome was driven by the truck driver's failure to maintain a safe passing distance.

The report states: 'A bus turned right. The rear wheel struck a man’s head. He was 45. Blood pooled on the pavement. The bus showed no damage. He died where he fell.' The pedestrian was at the intersection, engaged in 'other actions in roadway' as described in the report. The vehicle, a 2018 bus, was undamaged and driven by a licensed male driver. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified.' No driver errors are explicitly cited, but the narrative centers the lethal consequences of a turning bus and the vulnerability of those on foot.

Diana Gonzalez described the avenue as a place where 'they're gonna kill you.' The board will urge DOT to go beyond paint and install hard infrastructure.
