An SUV hit him at the intersection. His name is not in the data. His age is. The street is busy. The city calls it one of the most dangerous for walkers. The group said, <strong>"[Eastern Parkway] acts as a major thoroughfare for drivers, and is the sixth most dangerous street in Brooklyn for pedestrians"</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/01/tuesdays-headlines-another-child-sacrificed-to-the-suv-edition>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>Fourteen people were hurt when a van slammed into a tree in Brooklyn. Twelve of them were adults with special needs, headed to a day program. The driver swerved to avoid another car. A witness said, <strong>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sad because they definitely need a lot of attention more than anyone else. I hope that they&rsquo;re all OK at the end of the day&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/transport-van-crashes-tree-bath-beach-brooklyn-injuring-14-people/16903098/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>A 17-year-old died riding a moped. A 39-year-old was killed on a motorcycle. The list goes on. In the past 12 months, <strong>244 people have died</strong> on city streets. <strong>709 were seriously injured</strong>.

There is no greater priority for me than the safety of New Yorkers&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>amNY</a>). Cameras slow some drivers. But the dead keep coming.</p><p>Protected bike lanes work. The city’s own Department of Transportation warned, <strong>&ldquo;Removing the protected bike lane won&rsquo;t remove cyclists—it will only make the street less safe&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/dot-testimony-removing-bedford-ave-bike-lane-will-reduce-safety>Streetsblog NYC</a>).

In three years, <strong>cars and SUVs killed 300 people</strong> and left thousands more broken. Trucks and buses killed 93. Motorcycles and mopeds killed 10. Bikes killed 11.

A child’s life ended in the crosswalk.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a pickup truck made a left turn at the intersection of 31st Avenue and 100th Street in Queens at 16:15. An eight-year-old boy was crossing at the intersection with the pedestrian signal when the truck’s right front bumper struck him. The report states the child suffered crush injuries to his entire body and died at the scene. The police report explicitly cites 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as contributing factors. The boy was crossing with the signal, as documented in the report. The driver’s failure to yield during a left turn directly led to the fatal collision.

Nick Stabile, co-founder of the Park Row Alliance, said, 'Our residents have difficulty with something as simple as walking down the street and riding their bikes – and it's especially difficult for those in wheelchairs and with strollers.' Lucy West, a local resident, added, 'Park Row is not a parking lot, it's a street.' The city has not announced a plan for the corridor.

The matter summary reads: 'Ten community boards representing nearly 1.5 million New Yorkers have voted to endorse a ban on parking at intersections (daylighting) to improve street safety.'

The toll goes beyond crashes—air and noise pollution, violence, and social injustice hit hardest. Marginalized groups suffer most. The call is clear: shift to walking, cycling, and transit.</p><p class=mb3>On March 5, 2024, a major advocacy report was released, examining the global harms of car dependency. The literature review, conducted by UK and Germany-based researchers, surveyed nearly 500 studies on 'automobility.' The report states: 'Car domination is directly responsible for at least one in every 34 deaths around the world.' The harms extend to air and noise pollution, lead exposure, violence, and social injustice, with marginalized communities bearing the brunt. Patrick Miner, a study author, argues, 'If automobility has contributed, you know, X billion dollars of economic growth ... how do we compare that to killing 60 to 80 million people?' The report calls for policies that reduce car harm and prioritize human-centered transportation—walking, cycling, and public transit. No council bill number or committee applies; this is a research release, not legislation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states the vehicle was moving at an unsafe speed. The impact was severe: the airbag deployed, and the 69-year-old male driver, who was alone in the vehicle, suffered fatal lacerations across his body. The police report lists 'Unsafe Speed' as the contributing factor in this crash. The narrative describes the truck striking hard and coming to a stop, with the road falling silent in the aftermath. No other vehicles or individuals were involved.

He says low-income New Yorkers need better transit, not more delay. Upgrades for subways and buses hang in the balance. The fight is not about cars. It is about survival and dignity.</p><p class=mb3>On March 4, 2024, David Jones, President and CEO of the Community Service Society, issued a public statement supporting congestion pricing as the MTA prepared for a final vote. The matter, titled 'Want to Really Help Low-Income New Yorkers? Support Congestion Pricing,' argues, 'Low-income New Yorkers are not hurt by congestion pricing. In fact, they overwhelmingly stand to gain from congestion pricing's benefits.' Jones highlights that only 2 percent of poor, outer-borough residents drive into Manhattan, and most would qualify for toll discounts. He warns that lawsuits from suburban officials threaten $15 billion in transit upgrades—modern signals, elevators, electric buses, and new trains—critical for vulnerable riders in neighborhoods like Mott Haven, Crown Heights, Harlem, and Jamaica. Jones urges the MTA to dismiss these lawsuits and deliver the modern, reliable, and accessible transit system New Yorkers deserve.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The 57-year-old woman riding the e-bike, who was wearing a helmet, was struck and crushed at the hip. She died at the scene. The report lists 'Passing Too Closely' as the primary contributing factor, underscoring a critical driver error by the truck operator. The truck itself sustained no damage and continued on after the collision. The e-bike rider’s helmet use is noted in the report, but the fatal outcome was driven by the truck driver's failure to maintain a safe passing distance.

The pilot, part of the 'Charge Safe Ride Safe Action Plan,' opened its first station in Cooper Square. The program, highlighted by Council Member Lincoln Restler (District 33), offers 102 charging points for 100 delivery workers, many of them immigrants, at no cost. Three companies—Swobbee, Popwheels, and Swiftmile—operate the FDNY-reviewed stations. The official summary states the pilot 'aims to improve the safety of recharging lithium-ion batteries and counter the demonization of e-bikes.' Mayor Adams said, 'This pilot program ... will give delivery workers the ability to access safe, accessible, outdoor battery-charging that will undoubtedly save lives.' The city faces delays and pushback on e-bike infrastructure, with faster progress for electric cars. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'We’re going to be working to address any area where we can make an improvement.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
