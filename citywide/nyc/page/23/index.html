Since 2021, officials have delayed a promised project to give pedestrians their own lane on the Queensboro Bridge. The Department of Transportation, under Mayor Adams, has stalled the revamp, citing the need to keep seven of nine car lanes open. The matter: 'the path is too narrow for bi-directional, shared use between cyclists and pedestrians.' Laura Shepard, an advocate, calls it 'appalling that the convenience of drivers is prioritized over the lives and limbs of cyclists and pedestrians.' At least 23 crashes have injured 25 people since 2021. Bike ridership hit a record 1.98 million crossings in 2023.

Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On March 6, 2024, ten New York City community boards endorsed a citywide ban on parking at intersections—a practice called daylighting. The boards urge the city to stop exempting itself from state law requiring no parking within 20 feet of crosswalks. The resolution follows fatal crashes involving children at poorly visible corners. The matter summary reads: 'Ten community boards representing nearly 1.5 million New Yorkers have voted to endorse a ban on parking at intersections (daylighting) to improve street safety.' Ken Coughlin of Community Board 7 said, 'You’re losing parking [that causes] serious injury and death—that’s pretty indefensible.' Carl Mahaney of StreetopiaUWS added, 'Improving the crosswalk experience really resonates with New Yorkers.' Despite support from Brooklyn and other borough officials, DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez hesitates, citing cost and limited data. DOT pledges to daylight 1,000 intersections yearly, but no full safety analysis exists.

The toll goes beyond crashes—air and noise pollution, violence, and social injustice hit hardest. Marginalized groups suffer most. The call is clear: shift to walking, cycling, and transit.</p><p class=mb3>On March 5, 2024, a major advocacy report was released, examining the global harms of car dependency. The literature review, conducted by UK and Germany-based researchers, surveyed nearly 500 studies on 'automobility.' The report states: 'Car domination is directly responsible for at least one in every 34 deaths around the world.' The harms extend to air and noise pollution, lead exposure, violence, and social injustice, with marginalized communities bearing the brunt. Patrick Miner, a study author, argues, 'If automobility has contributed, you know, X billion dollars of economic growth ... how do we compare that to killing 60 to 80 million people?' The report calls for policies that reduce car harm and prioritize human-centered transportation—walking, cycling, and public transit. No council bill number or committee applies; this is a research release, not legislation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'Want to Really Help Low-Income New Yorkers? Support Congestion Pricing,' argues, 'Low-income New Yorkers are not hurt by congestion pricing. In fact, they overwhelmingly stand to gain from congestion pricing's benefits.' Jones highlights that only 2 percent of poor, outer-borough residents drive into Manhattan, and most would qualify for toll discounts. He warns that lawsuits from suburban officials threaten $15 billion in transit upgrades—modern signals, elevators, electric buses, and new trains—critical for vulnerable riders in neighborhoods like Mott Haven, Crown Heights, Harlem, and Jamaica.
