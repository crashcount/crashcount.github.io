Over 52,000 were hurt. Seven hundred sixty-six suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same again. These are not numbers. They are fathers, daughters, neighbors, friends.</p><p>Just last week, a 55-year-old woman riding her bike in Queens was killed by an SUV making a left turn. She was ejected from her bike and died in the street. On the same day, a 23-year-old man was struck and killed by a speeding sedan in Ozone Park. The car came fast. The street was slick. He did not get up. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><h2 id=the-voices-on-the-ground>The Voices on the Ground</h2><p>The city is tired. In Washington Heights, after a hit-and-run left a cyclist sprawled on the pavement, a resident <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said, &ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time.&rdquo;</a> Another pleaded, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>&ldquo;I really want there to be speed humps because it&rsquo;s just terrifying.&rdquo;</a></p><p>In Queens, two NYPD cruisers collided while racing to a call. Four officers went to the hospital. The cause is still under review. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/nypd-cruiser-involved-in-crash-in-queens-3-people-injured/>Police are now trying to determine the cause of the crash.</a></p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p><strong>The city has power. It does not always use it.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The Council can lower the speed limit to 20 mph citywide. They have not. Speed cameras now run 24/7, but the most reckless drivers still roam free. A handful of bills wait for action. Each day of delay is another day of loss.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand the Stop Super Speeders Act. Join groups like Transportation Alternatives and Families for Safe Streets. <strong>Do not wait for another name to become a number.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Police say the driver, Menachem Shagalow, was unlicensed and charged with aggravated unlicensed operation, failure to exercise due care, and unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle. Brod died from her injuries at Maimonides Medical Center on April 20. The article notes, 'Menachem was arrested at 8:37 p.m. on April 8 shortly after the incident.' This crash follows another fatal collision involving a suspended driver in Brooklyn the previous week. The incidents highlight ongoing dangers from unlicensed drivers and raise questions about enforcement and systemic safety failures.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
