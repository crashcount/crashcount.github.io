A 21-year-old, unlicensed driver in a Nissan Rogue struck him and fled. The cyclist hit the pavement, head first. Paramedics found him unconscious, his red light still flashing in the street. Police arrested the driver two hours later. He faces charges for leaving the scene and driving without a license. <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/driver-arrested-after-collision-with-e-biker-on-second-ave-XF4896347>The biker was rushed by EMS to Bellevue Hospital in critical condition.</a></p><p>On the FDR Drive, a bus and a car collided.

They renewed speed cameras in school zones. They passed Sammy’s Law, giving the city power to lower speed limits. But the default speed limit remains above 20 mph. The city sprinkles 20 mph zones, but the carnage continues. The most dangerous drivers—those with dozens of camera tickets—still roam free. The law to stop them sits in Albany.</p><h3 id=what-next-the-cost-of-waiting>What Next: The Cost of Waiting</h3><p>Every day, another family joins the list. The city has the tools. It needs the will.

Police said Santana failed to yield as Reinharth crossed Amsterdam Avenue at West 96th Street. The NYPD Collision Investigation Squad found Santana turned left into her path. He was charged with failure to yield and failure to exercise due care. Reinharth died from severe injuries, including a broken leg and pelvis fractures. The article notes, 'The police officer said the accident was not Miriam's fault at all.'

The Department of Transportation will ban cars on Scott Avenue between Flushing and Johnson and remove parking at several corners to improve visibility, a process called daylighting. The article notes, 'Drivers struggle to see oncoming traffic on Scott Avenue at Jefferson Street and at Flushing Avenue, due to parking blocking sight lines and the angle of the street.' The intersection saw 39 crashes from 2020 to 2024. The redesign includes a pedestrian plaza, narrowed roadways, and a ban on right turns onto Scott Avenue. These changes follow advocacy from Haussmann’s family and local lawmakers, highlighting systemic danger and the need for proactive street design.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
