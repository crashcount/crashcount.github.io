A 13-year-old boy on a moped was thrown to the pavement after colliding with an MTA bus in Staten Island. He left the scene in critical condition, his head struck hard. The bus driver and passengers walked away unhurt. Police said, &ldquo;the moped went through a stop sign without stopping and hit the bus&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/moped-bus-collision-staten-island/>reported amNY</a>. No arrests. The investigation drags on.</p><p>Elsewhere, two NYPD cruisers collided in Queens while racing to a call. Four officers were sent to the hospital. &ldquo;Two police vehicles were badly damaged from the collision,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/nypd-crash-edgemere-queens/>said CBS New York</a>. The cause is still under review. The city’s own enforcers are not immune to the chaos of its streets.</p><h2 id=the-numbers-that-dont-lie>The Numbers That Don’t Lie</h2><p><strong>In the last 12 months, 284 people died on New York City streets.</strong> Over 52,000 were injured. 764 suffered injuries so severe they will never be the same. Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians are the first to fall. Fourteen children have died in the past year. Forty-seven people aged 55 to 64. The city counts the bodies. The families count the empty chairs.</p><p>Cars and SUVs do the most damage. <strong>327 deaths and over 27,000 injuries</strong> came from these vehicles alone. Trucks and buses killed 99. Motorcycles and mopeds, 11. Bikes, 11. The city is a machine that chews through flesh and bone.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h2><p>The city has taken steps. Speed cameras in school zones will stay until 2030. The law now allows lower speed limits, but the default is still too high. The council and mayor have the power to drop it to 20 mph. They have not. Each day they wait, the toll grows.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph limit.

The driver fled. Mitchell died steps from home. Police have not caught the driver. The street stayed quiet. The loss cut deep. The danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News reported on May 11, 2025, that Kelvin Mitchell, 43, was killed by a hit-and-run driver while crossing Webster Ave. near E. 168th St. in the Bronx. The article states, "Mitchell was crossing Webster Ave. midblock... when he was mowed down by the driver of a black Mercedes-Benz." Surveillance video showed the Mercedes speeding in a bus lane before the crash. The driver did not stop. NYPD could not confirm if police were pursuing the car. Mitchell was a father and community figure. The crash highlights the lethal risk of speeding and hit-and-run drivers, and the lack of immediate accountability. No arrests have been made.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Prosecutors say Rosen pursued William McField, a 55-year-old motorcyclist, after a minor collision. On Woodhaven Boulevard, Rosen struck McField from behind, ran him over, and continued driving, dragging the motorcycle until it caught fire. Rosen then hit another car before stopping at a lamp post. McField died from severe trauma. District Attorney Melinda Katz stated, "Our roadways are not the place to settle disputes." The case highlights the lethal risk of aggressive driving and the need for stronger enforcement against road violence.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
