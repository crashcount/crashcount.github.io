The plan, now open for public comment, would require companies to register with DOT, assign unique ID cards to workers, and provide mandatory safety training and gear. Adams said, 'Our administration is committed to creating safer, more sustainable streets for everyone.' The rules demand reflective vests and reporting of vehicle types. Critics warn of risks to undocumented workers.

They raced the M34 bus across 34th Street to expose slow bus speeds. The event asked: 'Is it faster to walk across town or take the bus?' Russo-Lennon and others backed bus improvements, highlighting how cars choke streets and trap riders. The demonstration drew support from Council Members Erik Bottcher and Keith Powers, and city officials. The safety analyst notes this was a demonstration, not a policy change, so it does not directly affect pedestrian or cyclist safety or system-wide outcomes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Kuntzman cited a Department of Transportation analysis showing these programs boost business and reclaim space from cars. He amplified local voices mourning the loss of pedestrian zones on Vanderbilt Avenue. Open streets and outdoor dining, he argued, reduce vehicle traffic and give streets back to pedestrians and cyclists.

Advocates demand real protection, not empty enforcement.</p><p class=mb3>On August 7, 2025, Council Member Yoshi Omi-Jarrett issued a statement against NYPD enforcement squads for the unprotected Bedford Avenue bike lane. Omi-Jarrett said, "Streets that are properly designed with bike lanes that can't be blocked or narrower lanes in which drivers can't speed don't need squads of cops to hand out tickets." The statement supports protected bike lanes and narrower vehicle lanes, opposing increased police enforcement. Advocates and officers agree: paint-only lanes invite danger, and enforcement cannot replace safe design. Prioritizing street design improvements such as protected bike lanes and traffic calming reduces danger at the source, encourages mode shift, and improves safety for all without burdening vulnerable users.
