The truck’s right front bumper struck a 65-year-old woman as she crossed the intersection.

The driver’s actions are listed as 'unspecified' in the contributing factors, but the narrative details the truck’s movement and its direct role in the fatal outcome. The report notes the woman was 'crossing against the light,' but this is mentioned after describing the truck’s maneuver and impact.

The plan, detailed by City Hall's Office of Management and Budget, aims to install granite blocks, bike racks, and other barriers at hundreds of corners. Adams said, 'We are ... keeping New Yorkers safe on our streets ... by improving road safety at hundreds of targeted traffic intersections.' State law bans parking within 20 feet of intersections, but New York City exempts itself, fueling deadly crashes—55 percent of pedestrian deaths and 79 percent of injuries happen at intersections. Council members and grassroots activists are pushing to end the city's carveout and require the Department of Transportation to add barriers to 1,000 intersections a year. Jackson Chabot of Open Plans said, 'Hardening is what makes daylighting actually work, so the budget item is really crucial to expanding it across the city.' The push follows the 2023 death of 7-year-old Dolma Naadhun at a poorly designed corner.

The move follows deadly crashes, including the killing of cyclist Amanda Servedio. Clear rules now limit pursuits to violent felonies, aiming to cut needless danger on city streets.</p><p class=mb3>On January 15, 2025, NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch announced a sweeping policy reform restricting police vehicle pursuits. The new rules, set to enter the NYPD patrol guide on February 1, 2025, allow chases only for serious violent crimes. Tisch stated, 'The NYPD’s enforcement efforts must never put the public or the police at undue risk, and pursuits for violations and low-level crimes can be both potentially dangerous and unnecessary.' The policy comes after a spike in chases—up 1,413 percent since 2022—and several fatal crashes, including the death of cyclist Amanda Servedio. Tisch’s directive, supported by Chief of Department John Chell, gives officers clear, unambiguous parameters and shields them from discipline for terminating unsafe pursuits. The department will review chases monthly to ensure compliance. The reform aims to end reckless chases for minor offenses, reducing harm to pedestrians, cyclists, and bystanders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The street swallowed another life.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a 70-year-old woman was crossing 7th Avenue at 44th Street in Brooklyn with the pedestrian signal when a northbound Toyota sedan made a left turn. The vehicle's left front bumper struck her head, causing her to fall and suffer fatal injuries. The report states the driver failed to yield the right-of-way, listing 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as the primary contributing factor. The pedestrian was described as 'unconscious' at the scene and died there. The police report explicitly notes the pedestrian was 'crossing with signal,' making clear she had the legal right to be in the crosswalk. The crash underscores the lethal consequences of driver inattention and failure to yield during turning movements at intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
