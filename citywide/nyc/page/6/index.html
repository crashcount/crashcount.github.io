The February collision killed his 26-year-old passenger, Imani Vance, and injured the bus driver. According to the Brooklyn DA, Epps "ignored a stop sign and drove at excessive speeds," then left the scene by calling an Uber, abandoning his injured passenger. The impact pushed the bus into a third, empty vehicle. No children on the bus were harmed. Epps was apprehended after fleeing on foot. The case highlights persistent dangers at intersections and the lethal consequences of ignoring traffic controls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
