Protected bike lane. Injuries fell. Pedestrians, cyclists, passengers safer. No deaths since redesign. Bike traffic soared. DOT says green wave slows cars, helps walkers, riders. Streets once deadly now less so. Numbers show lives saved.</p><p class=mb3>On February 19, 2025, the city Department of Transportation (DOT) released new safety data for Third Avenue in Manhattan. The protected bike lane and street redesign, finished in late 2023 from East 59th to East 96th streets, cut total injuries by 33 percent. Pedestrian injuries dropped 63 percent. Cyclist injuries fell 10 percent, even as bike traffic jumped 79 percent. No pedestrians or cyclists have died since the changes. DOT spokesman Vin Barone said, "DOT's redesign of Third Avenue has significantly reduced serious injuries—whether you're walking, biking, or in a car on the corridor." The DOT also highlighted its 'green wave' signal timing, set to 15 mph, which slows drivers and helps vulnerable users. Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives called Third Avenue "one of the best streets in all of New York City" and urged similar redesigns elsewhere. The city estimates protected bike lanes cut deaths and serious injuries by 18.1 percent for all, and 29.2 percent for pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The fight moves to court.</p><p class=mb3>On February 19, 2025, the Trump administration revoked federal approval for New York City’s congestion pricing plan. The move, announced by U.S. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy, argued the program’s main goal was revenue, not congestion relief. The MTA immediately filed a lawsuit, calling the action unlawful. The bill is not a council measure but a federal policy reversal, with local officials and advocates condemning the decision. State Senator Zellnor Myrie was mentioned among those opposing the move. The matter title reads: 'Trump Withdraws Federal Approval for Congestion Pricing, Blowing Hole in Transit Budget, as MTA Files Lawsuit.' The reversal threatens transit funding and leaves vulnerable road users exposed to ongoing traffic danger. No safety analyst assessment was provided, but the loss of congestion pricing means more cars, more risk, and less money for safer streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
