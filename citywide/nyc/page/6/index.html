The driver, a 56-year-old woman, was licensed and uninjured. No other injuries were reported among the vehicle occupants. The pedestrian was not at an intersection at the time of the crash. The police report does not list any pedestrian error or equipment as a factor.

The suspect, Miguel Jiraud, was arraigned on attempted murder and assault charges. Prosecutors said Jiraud, on parole and wearing a GPS anklet, attacked Agudela after 11:30 p.m., stole her e-bike, and discarded it in the East River. Agudela is not expected to survive, having undergone multiple brain surgeries. The article quotes Agudela’s daughter: “We need more protection, we need more lights.” The path where the attack occurred lacked lighting and surveillance.

Buses crawl now. Riders wait. DOT wants faster trips, safer crossings. Community boards back the plan. Painted lanes, fewer cars, more eyes on the street. Change comes for riders and walkers.</p><p class=mb3>West Side Spirit reported on May 20, 2025, that the Department of Transportation (DOT) has proposed turning 34th Street into a mostly car-free busway, modeled after the 14th Street busway. The plan comes with support from three local community boards. According to the article, 'bus speeds on 14th Street increased by at least 24 percent, and bus ridership grew by 30 percent' after similar changes. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'far fewer New Yorkers are getting hurt in crashes' since the 14th Street redesign. The 34th Street proposal would divert most cars, add painted intersections for visibility, and focus on pedestrian safety. The move targets slow bus speeds—now just 3 mph—and aims to reduce systemic danger for bus riders and people on foot. No driver errors are cited, but the plan addresses longstanding risks from car traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The fuselage, rotor, and tail tore loose. Loud bangs echoed. The craft plunged. No black box. No warning. Only fragments and silence left behind.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News reported on May 7, 2025, that federal officials released images showing a sightseeing helicopter breaking apart in midair before crashing into the Hudson River, killing six. The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
