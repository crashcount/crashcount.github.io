He struck Abdulhekim Esiyok in the crosswalk. Bars kept pouring drinks for the driver. Blood alcohol soared. Esiyok died at Bellevue. The driver hit more people before stopping. The city’s system failed again.</p><p class=mb3>According to the New York Post (2025-06-07), Abdulhekim Esiyok, a 23-year-old Turkish immigrant, was killed while crossing Third Avenue after Mahbub Ali, allegedly intoxicated, drove into him. Prosecutors say Ali drank for nearly six hours at three Manhattan bars, reaching a blood alcohol content of .158, almost twice the legal limit. After hitting Esiyok, Ali continued, injuring a cyclist, two more pedestrians, and crashing into a van. The family’s lawsuit cites New York’s Dram Shop Act, which holds bars liable for serving visibly drunk patrons who later cause harm. The article quotes the family’s lawyer: “The family is devastated. They’re still in disbelief.” The case highlights failures in both driver responsibility and alcohol-serving oversight.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan includes boarding islands for safer passenger access and removes two car lanes. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, “Almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic, and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles.” The redesign aims to separate buses from car traffic, reduce conflicts, and improve safety for vulnerable road users. Parking will decrease, but the exact impact is unclear. The plan responds to chronic congestion and slow bus speeds, which often fall below five miles per hour during rush hour.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Tourists and workers crowd the street. Mayor Adams pledges $400 million. Some push back. The avenue stays dangerous for those on foot. Space for people, not just cars, hangs in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>NY1 reported on May 22, 2025, that Mayor Eric Adams will allocate over $400 million to a pedestrian-focused redesign of Fifth Avenue, stretching from Bryant Park to Central Park. The plan aims to double sidewalk widths, making room for the heavy foot traffic from both tourists and local workers. The article quotes a local worker: 'When you're walking around and getting from one place to another, yeah, it does get kind of annoying.' The proposal faces backlash, highlighting the tension between pedestrian needs and existing street design. No specific driver errors are cited, but the move underscores the city's ongoing struggle to prioritize vulnerable road users over vehicle flow.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
