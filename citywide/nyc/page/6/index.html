Two cadets died. Nineteen others were hurt. Masts snapped. Blood covered the deck. A sailor’s warnings went unheard as the vessel drifted off course. Chaos followed. The cause is under investigation.</p><p class=mb3>According to the New York Post (May 24, 2025), a Mexican navy training ship crashed into the Brooklyn Bridge on May 17, killing two cadets and injuring nineteen. The article quotes a boatswain: "It was too fast. When we came to see it, we were against the [bridge]. The three masts broke, and that was it." The sailor described shouting warnings as the ship drifted toward the bridge, but "no one reacted." Distress calls went out 45 seconds before impact. The crash happened less than five minutes after departure. The article details chaos on deck, with cadets thrown from rigging and the crew scrambling to rescue the injured. The cause remains under investigation, highlighting possible failures in navigation or communication.

Only fragments and silence left behind.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News reported on May 7, 2025, that federal officials released images showing a sightseeing helicopter breaking apart in midair before crashing into the Hudson River, killing six. The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
