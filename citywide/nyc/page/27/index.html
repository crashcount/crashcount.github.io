The event, organized by the Brooklyn Street Safety Coalition, called on Mayor Adams to restore funding for school crossing guards. The Adams administration had announced an 18-percent reduction in crossing guard positions, aiming to save $7.5 million. Kay White, PTSO Co-Chair at Brooklyn Prospect Downtown Elementary, said, “With expanded city funding, real crossing guards could be protecting our children as they walk to school.” She described the process of securing a guard as slow and dependent on connections. Despite a brief increase in staffing after the crash, numbers have dropped again. Investigations show higher crash and injury rates near schools. Crossing guards face daily danger from drivers. City Hall did not respond to requests for comment.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Concrete curbs and daylighting shield cyclists from cars. Gaps persist at key intersections and bridge connections. Advocates demand more links and stronger barriers. Progress, but not enough.</p><p class=mb3>On November 30, 2023, city officials unveiled new protected bike lanes along 11th Street, 44th Drive, and Jackson Avenue in Long Island City. The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, called the lanes 'life-saving' and said they fill a critical gap, connecting cyclists to the Queensboro and Pulaski bridges. The project follows years of advocacy, including a 2019 push by then-Council Member Jimmy Van Bramer. Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives praised the concrete curbs and daylighting but warned that gaps remain—especially at confusing intersections and near truck routes. Shepard urged DOT to add more physical barriers and expand the network, noting, 'It’s exciting, but we still need a lot more.' The new lanes mark progress, but the area’s vulnerable road users still face danger from incomplete connections and blocked paths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
