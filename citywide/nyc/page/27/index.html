Progress, but not enough.</p><p class=mb3>On November 30, 2023, city officials unveiled new protected bike lanes along 11th Street, 44th Drive, and Jackson Avenue in Long Island City. The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, called the lanes 'life-saving' and said they fill a critical gap, connecting cyclists to the Queensboro and Pulaski bridges. The project follows years of advocacy, including a 2019 push by then-Council Member Jimmy Van Bramer. Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives praised the concrete curbs and daylighting but warned that gaps remain—especially at confusing intersections and near truck routes. Shepard urged DOT to add more physical barriers and expand the network, noting, 'It’s exciting, but we still need a lot more.' The new lanes mark progress, but the area’s vulnerable road users still face danger from incomplete connections and blocked paths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, not yet in formal bill stage, covers neighborhoods like Long Island City, Astoria, Elmhurst, and Jackson Heights. It calls for a 'protected bike lane network, more pedestrian space, a ban on parking near intersections, more space for micromobility users, and policy changes to improve safety.' Lawmakers demand these projects by 2029, including opening the Queensboro Bridge’s south outer roadway to pedestrians, redesigning 31st Avenue, and universal daylighting. The plan also pushes for automated enforcement, lower speed limits, higher fees for heavy vehicles, and bus lanes on every major route. The lawmakers’ statement reads: 'Even one death is too many, and these 13 tragedies have had a major impact on Western Queens residents.' Their plan aims to hold officials accountable and make streets safer for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates want more streets like this.</p><p class=mb3>On November 21, 2023, the Department of Transportation (DOT) completed a permanent redesign of Berry Street in north Brooklyn. The project, described as a 'model for other streets,' included flipping one-way traffic, coral paint at intersections, curb extensions, and barriers to keep drivers out. The redesign faced delays from supply chain issues and local opposition. Brent Bovenzi, a volunteer with the North Brooklyn Open Streets Community Coalition, praised the changes, saying, 'Ultimately all of those physical things are what every local street in this city should have.' Residents like David Burgos noted, 'It did lower the traffic.' The street now has two-way bike markings, lower speed limits, and expanded pedestrian space. Advocates urge further improvements and expansion. DOT will monitor and adjust as needed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
