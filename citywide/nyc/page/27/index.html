The project, described as a 'model for other streets,' included flipping one-way traffic, coral paint at intersections, curb extensions, and barriers to keep drivers out. The redesign faced delays from supply chain issues and local opposition. Brent Bovenzi, a volunteer with the North Brooklyn Open Streets Community Coalition, praised the changes, saying, 'Ultimately all of those physical things are what every local street in this city should have.' Residents like David Burgos noted, 'It did lower the traffic.' The street now has two-way bike markings, lower speed limits, and expanded pedestrian space.

The call is clear: build safe streets now, not after more blood is spilled.</p><p class=mb3>This advocacy statement, published November 17, 2023, is titled 'We Are Victims of Road Violence and We Demand Change.' It is not a council bill, but a public call to action. The statement highlights the deaths of Jayden, Karina, and Tammy, killed by reckless drivers. It notes that 219 New Yorkers have died in traffic violence this year, with cyclist injuries up 35 percent in Queens. The authors demand city and state leaders implement universal daylighting, protected bike lanes, Open Streets, school streets, bike boulevards, and neighborhood-wide safety plans. They urge passage of Sammy's Law and expansion of speed and red-light camera programs. The statement condemns the current piecemeal, reactive approach, calling it 'bad policy, bad government,' and demands systemic change to prevent more deaths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
