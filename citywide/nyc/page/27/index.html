In the last twelve months, <strong>241 people died</strong> and <strong>701 suffered serious injuries</strong> on New York’s streets. The dead do not get second chances. The injured carry scars no policy can erase. Just days ago, a <strong>90-year-old man lay on the pavement in Brooklyn, his head split open</strong> after a masked moped rider hit him and fled. &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/brooklyn-90-year-old-man-hit-run-rider/>said an eyewitness</a>. The rider did not stop. The city keeps moving.</p><p>A day before, <strong>Dov Broyde, 70, was crossing Avenue I</strong>. A Smart Car driver plowed into him. Broyde died at the hospital. The driver stayed. No charges filed. <strong>Fifty-five pedestrians have died this year</strong>. The number is lower than last year.

Lives do not wait.</p><p>Some leaders fight for safety. Others rip it out. The city tried to remove the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane. DOT warned: &ldquo;Removing the protected bike lane won&rsquo;t remove cyclists—it will only make the street less safe&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/dot-testimony-removing-bedford-ave-bike-lane-will-reduce-safety>testified DOT</a>.

They are families left waiting for someone who will not come home.</p><h2 id=what-now>What Now</h2><p><strong>Every day the council delays, someone else dies.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph citywide speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand action.

The article, 'States, We Need Your Vision to Get to ‘Zero’,' highlights how state Departments of Transportation shape safety outcomes. Texas and Georgia prioritize fast car travel, leading to more crashes and deaths. California and Massachusetts invest in transit and set design standards for pedestrians and cyclists. The piece states, 'States must lead. Whether it’s lowering speed limits, re-designing roadways to encourage safer speeds, adding speed safety cameras, or other proven safety countermeasures; states are usually loath to make change.' Advocates and local leaders push for accountability. The analysis finds that without state leadership, vulnerable road users remain at risk. States must lower speeds, redesign roads, and fund transit—or let cities act.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, organized by the Brooklyn Street Safety Coalition, called on Mayor Adams to restore funding for school crossing guards. The Adams administration had announced an 18-percent reduction in crossing guard positions, aiming to save $7.5 million. Kay White, PTSO Co-Chair at Brooklyn Prospect Downtown Elementary, said, “With expanded city funding, real crossing guards could be protecting our children as they walk to school.” She described the process of securing a guard as slow and dependent on connections. Despite a brief increase in staffing after the crash, numbers have dropped again. Investigations show higher crash and injury rates near schools. Crossing guards face daily danger from drivers. City Hall did not respond to requests for comment.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
