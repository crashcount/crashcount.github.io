The city put back paint. Paint does not stop cars.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Department of Transportation built a new protected bike lane in Queens. A commuter said, &ldquo;The old street was very dangerous&mldr; the new path is definitely safer because he&rsquo;s no longer competing with trucks and cars for road space&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/27/eyes-on-the-street-new-bike-lane-puts-the-bliss-in-blissville>A commuter said</a>).

The project, titled 'Implementation of Queens Boulevard Great Streets Transformation and Supplemental Planning for Vision Zero,' aims to fix a deadly, car-dominated corridor. The final phase will remove one lane in each direction and add a protected bike lane along 1.2 miles between Union Turnpike and Hillside Avenue. According to city DOT data, 'pedestrian injuries decreased by 41 percent and total injuries by 22 percent on redesigned stretches.' Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg announced the grant, calling for 'urgent action' on the nation’s roads.

The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, called the lanes 'life-saving' and said they fill a critical gap, connecting cyclists to the Queensboro and Pulaski bridges. The project follows years of advocacy, including a 2019 push by then-Council Member Jimmy Van Bramer. Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives praised the concrete curbs and daylighting but warned that gaps remain—especially at confusing intersections and near truck routes. Shepard urged DOT to add more physical barriers and expand the network, noting, 'It’s exciting, but we still need a lot more.' The new lanes mark progress, but the area’s vulnerable road users still face danger from incomplete connections and blocked paths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, not yet in formal bill stage, covers neighborhoods like Long Island City, Astoria, Elmhurst, and Jackson Heights. It calls for a 'protected bike lane network, more pedestrian space, a ban on parking near intersections, more space for micromobility users, and policy changes to improve safety.' Lawmakers demand these projects by 2029, including opening the Queensboro Bridge’s south outer roadway to pedestrians, redesigning 31st Avenue, and universal daylighting. The plan also pushes for automated enforcement, lower speed limits, higher fees for heavy vehicles, and bus lanes on every major route. The lawmakers’ statement reads: 'Even one death is too many, and these 13 tragedies have had a major impact on Western Queens residents.' Their plan aims to hold officials accountable and make streets safer for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
