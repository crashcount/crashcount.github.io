Just last week, an eight-year-old boy was killed crossing Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights. His sister watched. His mother grieves. “He was a boy who loved life,” <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>said his mother</a>.</p><p>Scooter riders, teens on mopeds, and cyclists have all fallen.

The article compiles her past statements, where she called the plan 'powerful' and 'transformative.' Hochul said, 'Fewer cars mean less gridlock, traffic and pollution. Fewer cars means safer streets, cleaner air and more room to maneuver for pedestrians and bicyclists.' She also promised $1 billion yearly for transit upgrades. Despite this, Hochul now considers delaying the plan. The piece underscores the gap between her advocacy and current uncertainty. No council bill number or committee applies; this is a public statement. The article centers the impact on vulnerable road users: fewer cars mean safer streets, cleaner air, and more space for those outside vehicles. Hochul’s words set a standard.

The plan, designed to fund transit and reduce car traffic, now sits idle. Advocates and officials, including Reinvent Albany, Carlo Scissura, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, and Sara Lind, condemned the move. Williams warned, 'An indefinite pause on congestion pricing will do irreparable harm to the city while undermining public confidence.' Scissura called it 'a devastating blow' to commuters and workers. Lind slammed the decision as 'wrongheaded.' The delay blocks $15 billion for subways and buses. Streets remain clogged. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, bus riders—face more danger and unreliable service. No safety analyst has formally assessed the impact, but the message is clear: the city’s most at-risk are left behind.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal, revealed by DOT Director Ted Wright, creates a 'bike boulevard' with two-way protected bike lanes from Steinway Street to Vernon Boulevard. The plan shifts the avenue to one-way car traffic, adds painted pedestrian islands, curb extensions, and may include a car-free plaza. DOT aims to reduce vehicle presence and traffic violence, responding to local advocacy after several high-profile crashes. Residents and organizers, including Alana Herlands and John Surico, voiced strong support: 'We are going to advocate for the most ambitious plan that not only adds more space for the community... but also reduces traffic violence.' Implementation is set for summer and fall, with an extension east to 51st Street planned next year.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation (DOT) had promised a protected bike lane by 2023, but the project remains unfinished, with completion now pushed to summer 2024.

These repeated delays are killing us,' said Jada Yeboah of Transportation Alternatives. Local advocates and activists expressed anger and heartbreak, blaming the lack of safe infrastructure for the cyclist's death. Cyclists have been forced to share a narrow path with pedestrians or ride in the bus lane, neither designed for their safety. DOT cited 'complexities' and routine road work as reasons for the delay. The bridge was identified for safety upgrades in a 2018 DOT report, but the city failed to act in time.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, discussed at Bronx Community Board 11’s transportation committee, continues work started north of Burke Avenue in 2022. The DOT aims to 'bring predictability, visibility, and mobility benefits further south,' according to Chris Brunson, DOT Director of Safety Projects and Programs. Council members were not directly named, but local leaders and residents weighed in. The redesign will transform wide car lanes into protected bike lanes and parking, and install concrete bus boarding islands to fix ADA violations. DOT officials stressed that most injuries are caused by drivers, not cyclists, and that protected lanes have reduced injuries for seniors and pedestrians. The first phase saw a 15 percent drop in injuries and a 10 percent rise in cycling. Illegal parking remains a challenge, but the city pushes forward, centering safety for those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
