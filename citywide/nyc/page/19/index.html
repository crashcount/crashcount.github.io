The NYPD said the driver violated the cyclist’s right of way. The driver remained at the scene but was not charged. Families for Safe Streets condemned the city’s lack of intersection safety, calling for daylighting and leading walk signal intervals. They said, 'Crashes like these are a continuing failure of our mayor to provide safety at dangerous intersections.' Data shows cyclist injuries on Fourth Avenue have increased since the bike lane was installed, likely due to higher ridership. The crash highlights ongoing dangers for cyclists and the city’s failure to protect them at intersections obstructed by illegal parking.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal calls for a car-free busway, wider sidewalks, protected bike lanes, and more green space. The article states: 'Imagine if 42nd Street was transformed from a gritty through-route full of vehicles and fumes into one with much wider sidewalks with trees and benches to give pedestrians a more relaxed experience.' No council bill number or committee is attached; this is an advocacy push, not legislation. The campaign references the 14th Street Busway, which led to a 50% drop in crashes and a 33% drop in pedestrian injuries. No council members are named.

The plan, covered by Streetsblog NYC, would reduce car lanes from five to three in each direction, making room for eight-foot parking-protected bike lanes. Painted islands would shield cyclists at intersections and shorten pedestrian crossings. The proposal responds to years of crashes and injuries in a high-traffic area. Community advocates, including Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives and Joby Jacob of LaGuardia Community College, voiced strong support. Jacob called it 'absolutely necessary,' while Shepard said, 'This has been a missing link for a really long time.' The Thomson Avenue extension remains in early planning, with ongoing advocacy for more sidewalk space and safer access. Vision Zero funds are allocated, but advocates push for more.

Streets grew quiet. Bike lanes widened. Pedestrians took space. Crashes fell. Air cleared. Shops thrived. Stockholm’s crash rate is a third of New York’s. The lesson is blunt: fewer cars, safer streets, more life.</p><p class=mb3>This opinion piece, published May 13, 2024, in Streetsblog NYC, draws on Sweden’s decade of congestion pricing. The article, titled 'Congestion Pricing Will Make New York a World-Class City,' details how Gothenburg and Stockholm used tolls to reduce car traffic, fund transit, and reclaim streets for people. Per Bergström-Jonsson, a Swedish official, says, 'Congestion pricing improved travel times far more than all other road investments.' Stockholm’s crash deaths are a third of New York’s. Council members are not directly named, as this is an advocacy article, but the stance is clear: support for congestion pricing, bike infrastructure, transit, and pedestrianization. The Swedish experience shows that fewer cars mean safer, more vibrant streets for all vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The board called on the Department of Transportation to replace corner parking with physical infrastructure like curb extensions. The matter summary: 'Enforcing the Daylighting Law in our community would significantly increase visibility, which would protect pedestrians, drivers, cyclists and all other road users.' Lucia Deng, chair of the Municipal Services committee, led the push, saying, 'The focus was on intersections and why they are the most dangerous for car crashes and how this just benefits everybody.' The board’s vote was nearly unanimous, with no dissent and one abstention. The resolution highlights that more than half of pedestrian deaths and nearly eight in ten injuries occur at intersections. The board’s action joins a growing citywide movement to prioritize people over parking at dangerous corners.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
