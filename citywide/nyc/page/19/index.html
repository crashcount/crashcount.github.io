The city put back paint. Paint does not stop cars.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Department of Transportation built a new protected bike lane in Queens. A commuter said, &ldquo;The old street was very dangerous&mldr; the new path is definitely safer because he&rsquo;s no longer competing with trucks and cars for road space&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/27/eyes-on-the-street-new-bike-lane-puts-the-bliss-in-blissville>A commuter said</a>).

The proposal, revealed by DOT Director Ted Wright, creates a 'bike boulevard' with two-way protected bike lanes from Steinway Street to Vernon Boulevard. The plan shifts the avenue to one-way car traffic, adds painted pedestrian islands, curb extensions, and may include a car-free plaza. DOT aims to reduce vehicle presence and traffic violence, responding to local advocacy after several high-profile crashes. Residents and organizers, including Alana Herlands and John Surico, voiced strong support: 'We are going to advocate for the most ambitious plan that not only adds more space for the community... but also reduces traffic violence.' Implementation is set for summer and fall, with an extension east to 51st Street planned next year.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation (DOT) had promised a protected bike lane by 2023, but the project remains unfinished, with completion now pushed to summer 2024.

These repeated delays are killing us,' said Jada Yeboah of Transportation Alternatives. Local advocates and activists expressed anger and heartbreak, blaming the lack of safe infrastructure for the cyclist's death. Cyclists have been forced to share a narrow path with pedestrians or ride in the bus lane, neither designed for their safety. DOT cited 'complexities' and routine road work as reasons for the delay. The bridge was identified for safety upgrades in a 2018 DOT report, but the city failed to act in time.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, discussed at Bronx Community Board 11’s transportation committee, continues work started north of Burke Avenue in 2022. The DOT aims to 'bring predictability, visibility, and mobility benefits further south,' according to Chris Brunson, DOT Director of Safety Projects and Programs. Council members were not directly named, but local leaders and residents weighed in. The redesign will transform wide car lanes into protected bike lanes and parking, and install concrete bus boarding islands to fix ADA violations. DOT officials stressed that most injuries are caused by drivers, not cyclists, and that protected lanes have reduced injuries for seniors and pedestrians. The first phase saw a 15 percent drop in injuries and a 10 percent rise in cycling. Illegal parking remains a challenge, but the city pushes forward, centering safety for those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The NYPD said the driver violated the cyclist’s right of way. The driver remained at the scene but was not charged. Families for Safe Streets condemned the city’s lack of intersection safety, calling for daylighting and leading walk signal intervals. They said, 'Crashes like these are a continuing failure of our mayor to provide safety at dangerous intersections.' Data shows cyclist injuries on Fourth Avenue have increased since the bike lane was installed, likely due to higher ridership. The crash highlights ongoing dangers for cyclists and the city’s failure to protect them at intersections obstructed by illegal parking.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states the e-bike rider was 'thrown' and 'crushed,' dying at the scene. Both the pickup truck and the e-bike were cited for 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as contributing factors. The pickup, a 2007 Chevrolet, was making a left turn when it collided with the e-bike, which was traveling straight. The police report describes the aftermath: 'The bike lay twisted. The truck bore blood and silence.' The e-bike rider was ejected and suffered crush injuries to the entire body. The data does not specify helmet use or other victim behaviors as contributing factors.

The city’s heart needs less traffic, more room for people.</p><p class=mb3>On May 22, 2024, Streetsblog NYC published an opinion piece launching a campaign to transform 42nd Street. The proposal calls for a car-free busway, wider sidewalks, protected bike lanes, and more green space. The article states: 'Imagine if 42nd Street was transformed from a gritty through-route full of vehicles and fumes into one with much wider sidewalks with trees and benches to give pedestrians a more relaxed experience.' No council bill number or committee is attached; this is an advocacy push, not legislation. The campaign references the 14th Street Busway, which led to a 50% drop in crashes and a 33% drop in pedestrian injuries. No council members are named. The piece centers vulnerable road users, demanding the city prioritize people over cars on one of Manhattan’s busiest streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
