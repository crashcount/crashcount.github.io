The plan shifts the avenue to one-way car traffic, adds painted pedestrian islands, curb extensions, and may include a car-free plaza. DOT aims to reduce vehicle presence and traffic violence, responding to local advocacy after several high-profile crashes. Residents and organizers, including Alana Herlands and John Surico, voiced strong support: 'We are going to advocate for the most ambitious plan that not only adds more space for the community... but also reduces traffic violence.'

The incident occurred as the man stepped into the street, not at an intersection and without a crossing signal, as detailed in the report: 'A 70-year-old man stepped into the street without a signal. An eastbound SUV struck him head-on. He died from head and internal wounds. The driver held a license. The bumper bore the mark where he fell.' The vehicle involved was a 2023 Acura SUV, traveling straight ahead with two occupants. The point of impact was the center front end, and the right front bumper showed damage. The police report lists 'Unspecified' as the contributing factors for both the driver and the pedestrian, and does not cite any specific driver error. The pedestrian’s action—crossing without a signal or crosswalk—is noted after the absence of identified driver errors. The report does not mention any additional contributing factors or behaviors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation (DOT) had promised a protected bike lane by 2023, but the project remains unfinished, with completion now pushed to summer 2024. The matter centers on the city's failure to deliver: 'DOT promised to install a protected bike lane along the Washington Bridge last year, but the bike lane remains unfinished and the road remains dangerous. ... These repeated delays are killing us,' said Jada Yeboah of Transportation Alternatives. Local advocates and activists expressed anger and heartbreak, blaming the lack of safe infrastructure for the cyclist's death. Cyclists have been forced to share a narrow path with pedestrians or ride in the bus lane, neither designed for their safety. DOT cited 'complexities' and routine road work as reasons for the delay. The bridge was identified for safety upgrades in a 2018 DOT report, but the city failed to act in time.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, discussed at Bronx Community Board 11’s transportation committee, continues work started north of Burke Avenue in 2022. The DOT aims to 'bring predictability, visibility, and mobility benefits further south,' according to Chris Brunson, DOT Director of Safety Projects and Programs. Council members were not directly named, but local leaders and residents weighed in. The redesign will transform wide car lanes into protected bike lanes and parking, and install concrete bus boarding islands to fix ADA violations. DOT officials stressed that most injuries are caused by drivers, not cyclists, and that protected lanes have reduced injuries for seniors and pedestrians. The first phase saw a 15 percent drop in injuries and a 10 percent rise in cycling. Illegal parking remains a challenge, but the city pushes forward, centering safety for those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He opposes gas tax hikes, instead backing a vehicle miles traveled tax. He urges street design that slows drivers and protects people walking and biking.
