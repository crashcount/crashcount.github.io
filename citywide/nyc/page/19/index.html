Seven hundred thirty-four suffered wounds so grave they will never be the same. The dead are not numbers. A 76-year-old woman, struck by an SUV while crossing White Plains Road. A 32-year-old woman, crushed by a Jeep on Marcus Garvey Boulevard. A 79-year-old man, found dead in a parked car on West 77th.

The vehicle veered uncontrollably and collided with a parked 2016 Dodge pick-up truck. The report states, 'A BMW’s steering failed mid-turn. It veered into a parked Dodge. Metal screamed. The front crushed.' The sole occupant, a 56-year-old man, was found belted in the driver’s seat and was pronounced dead at the scene. The police report lists 'Steering Failure' and 'Driver Inexperience' as contributing factors. The parked Dodge was unoccupied at the time of the crash. The impact was severe, crushing the BMW’s front end and damaging the Dodge’s left side. The report does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor, keeping the focus on the mechanical and driver errors that led to the fatal outcome.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The plan, covered by Streetsblog NYC, would reduce car lanes from five to three in each direction, making room for eight-foot parking-protected bike lanes. Painted islands would shield cyclists at intersections and shorten pedestrian crossings. The proposal responds to years of crashes and injuries in a high-traffic area. Community advocates, including Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives and Joby Jacob of LaGuardia Community College, voiced strong support. Jacob called it 'absolutely necessary,' while Shepard said, 'This has been a missing link for a really long time.' The Thomson Avenue extension remains in early planning, with ongoing advocacy for more sidewalk space and safer access. Vision Zero funds are allocated, but advocates push for more. The city’s move follows years of criticism over insufficient safety measures.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article, titled 'Congestion Pricing Will Make New York a World-Class City,' details how Gothenburg and Stockholm used tolls to reduce car traffic, fund transit, and reclaim streets for people. Per Bergström-Jonsson, a Swedish official, says, 'Congestion pricing improved travel times far more than all other road investments.' Stockholm’s crash deaths are a third of New York’s.

Lucia Deng, chair of the Municipal Services committee, led the push, saying, 'The focus was on intersections and why they are the most dangerous for car crashes and how this just benefits everybody.' The board’s vote was nearly unanimous, with no dissent and one abstention. The resolution highlights that more than half of pedestrian deaths and nearly eight in ten injuries occur at intersections.

At 11:26 a.m., a 58-year-old pedestrian was crossing the intersection when an unlicensed man riding a Hurley e-scooter struck him head-on. The police report explicitly cites 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as a contributing factor. The e-scooter’s center front end hit the pedestrian, who suffered severe head lacerations and was found unconscious. He died at the scene. The report notes the pedestrian was crossing against the signal, but this is listed after the driver’s errors. The unlicensed status of the e-scooter operator and the failure to yield are central to the crash, underscoring the systemic dangers facing people on foot in New York City streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The report identifies 'Unsafe Speed' as the primary contributing factor. The driver was traveling northbound and lost control, resulting in a catastrophic impact that demolished the vehicle and twisted its frame beyond saving. The driver, who wore no seat belt, was ejected from the SUV and suffered fatal injuries including a shattered pelvis and severe lacerations. The police report explicitly notes the driver's unlicensed status and unsafe speed as causes of the crash. A front-seat passenger, a 34-year-old man wearing a lap belt and harness, was injured with internal complaints and shoulder-upper arm trauma but was not ejected. No victim behaviors contributed to the crash according to the report.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The DOJ’s letter, prompted by Streetsblog’s reporting, states: “NYPD vehicles and the personal vehicles of NYPD employees frequently obstruct sidewalks and crosswalks in the vicinity of NYPD precincts... the city’s pedestrian grid is not readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.” U.S. Attorney Damian Williams led the charge, citing widespread violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act and a lack of enforcement against placard abuse. The DOJ threatened a civil rights lawsuit if the NYPD fails to act. The NYPD has not announced new enforcement. Sidewalks remain blocked, endangering pedestrians and especially people with disabilities, who are forced into the street and exposed to traffic injuries.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The collision occurred as the e-bike rider was making a left turn, while the BMW was traveling straight ahead. The report lists 'Turning Improperly' as a contributing factor in the crash. The impact ejected the cyclist, causing fatal head injuries described as 'crush injuries.' The police report notes the victim was not wearing a helmet, but this detail is mentioned only after the driver error. The violence of the crash and the fatal outcome underscore the lethal consequences when drivers fail to yield or turn improperly. The report makes no mention of any contributing actions by the cyclist beyond his direction of travel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The law, named for Sammy Cohen Eckstein, killed by a driver in 2013, carves out wide, fast roads in the outer boroughs. Advocates call it progress, but not enough. Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On April 18, 2024, Governor Hochul announced a deal to pass Sammy’s Law in the state budget. The bill, named after 12-year-old Sammy Cohen Eckstein, lets New York City lower its maximum speed limit from 25 to 20 miles per hour. The measure, described as a 'hard-fought rule change,' exempts roads with three or more lanes outside Manhattan and requires 60 days of community notice before changes. Amy Cohen, Sammy’s mother and Families for Safe Streets co-founder, called the bill 'a step forward, though not perfect.' Sara Lind of Open Plans called it 'a huge victory,' but noted the carve-outs leave many dangerous streets untouched. Mayor Adams’s office praised the law, citing the need for more tools to protect New Yorkers. The law’s passage marks progress for vulnerable road users, but leaves key gaps where speed and risk remain high.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
