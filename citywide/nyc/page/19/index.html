The redesign narrows car space, adds concrete boarding islands, and aims to cut injuries. Locals welcome safer passage. Drivers remain the main threat. Change comes this summer.</p><p class=mb3>On May 28, 2024, the Department of Transportation announced plans to extend protected bike lanes on White Plains Road one mile south to Pelham Parkway. The project, discussed at Bronx Community Board 11’s transportation committee, continues work started north of Burke Avenue in 2022. The DOT aims to 'bring predictability, visibility, and mobility benefits further south,' according to Chris Brunson, DOT Director of Safety Projects and Programs. Council members were not directly named, but local leaders and residents weighed in. The redesign will transform wide car lanes into protected bike lanes and parking, and install concrete bus boarding islands to fix ADA violations. DOT officials stressed that most injuries are caused by drivers, not cyclists, and that protected lanes have reduced injuries for seniors and pedestrians. The first phase saw a 15 percent drop in injuries and a 10 percent rise in cycling. Illegal parking remains a challenge, but the city pushes forward, centering safety for those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Earl Blumenauer, founder and chair of the Congressional Bike Caucus, spoke on federal policy for safer, sustainable streets. In an interview, he declared, 'There are unprecedented resources available to promote a cycling agenda right now.' Blumenauer supports road diets, roundabouts, and the E-BIKE Act. He opposes gas tax hikes, instead backing a vehicle miles traveled tax. He urges street design that slows drivers and protects people walking and biking. Blumenauer stresses public engagement and evidence-based advocacy to overcome resistance to safety projects. He believes expanded cycling infrastructure and e-bikes are vital for livable, low-carbon communities.

The report states, 'The box truck hit him first. The SUV followed. Head shattered. Bones crushed. He died there, beneath the streetlights, far from the crosswalk, alone on the asphalt.' Both vehicles—a box truck and a sport utility vehicle—were traveling straight ahead at the time of the collision. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified' for both drivers, offering no further detail on specific driver errors. The pedestrian was crossing the street at a location not marked by a signal or crosswalk, but the report does not cite this as a contributing factor. The focus remains on the lethal impact of large vehicles moving unchecked through city streets, leaving a man dead and unanswered questions in their wake.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

No council bill number or committee is attached; this is an advocacy push, not legislation. The campaign references the 14th Street Busway, which led to a 50% drop in crashes and a 33% drop in pedestrian injuries. No council members are named.

The report states, "His SUV struck seven cars. Metal tore. Glass scattered. Airbags bloomed." The driver died at the scene, "strapped in his seat, still and silent, as traffic crawled past the wreckage." The sole contributing factor cited is "Lost Consciousness." The collision involved multiple vehicles traveling straight ahead, with impacts to center back ends, side doors, and quarter panels. Several occupants suffered neck injuries consistent with whiplash. The report does not list any driver errors or contributing factors for the other drivers. The crash was caused by the initial driver's loss of consciousness, triggering a deadly chain reaction.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The plan cuts car lanes, adds parking-protected bike lanes, and shortens crossings. Advocates and locals back the move. Cyclists and pedestrians face daily danger here. The city finally acts.</p><p class=mb3>On May 14, 2024, the Department of Transportation proposed protected bike lanes for the westernmost mile of Queens Boulevard, between Skillman Avenue and Roosevelt Avenue. The plan, covered by Streetsblog NYC, would reduce car lanes from five to three in each direction, making room for eight-foot parking-protected bike lanes. Painted islands would shield cyclists at intersections and shorten pedestrian crossings. The proposal responds to years of crashes and injuries in a high-traffic area. Community advocates, including Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives and Joby Jacob of LaGuardia Community College, voiced strong support. Jacob called it 'absolutely necessary,' while Shepard said, 'This has been a missing link for a really long time.' The Thomson Avenue extension remains in early planning, with ongoing advocacy for more sidewalk space and safer access. Vision Zero funds are allocated, but advocates push for more. The city’s move follows years of criticism over insufficient safety measures.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
