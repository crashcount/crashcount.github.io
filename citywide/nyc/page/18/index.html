A black SUV hit him. He died on the street. The driver stayed. Police said, &ldquo;They were walking, he was crossing the street with his sister&rdquo; (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>police said</a>). No arrest. The street is still open. The danger is still there.</p><p>The day before, in the Bronx, a man ran a red light. His car jumped the curb and crushed three people on the sidewalk. One is still fighting for life. The driver ran but police caught him. He faces charges for assault, fleeing, and driving without a license (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/driver-flees-bronx-car-stop-crash/>faces charges</a>).</p><p><strong>In the last 12 months, 244 people have died on New York City streets. 713 were seriously hurt.</strong> Thirteen of the dead were children. The city logs over 81,000 crashes a year. Each number is a name, a family, a future gone.</p><h3 id=the-policy-that-wasnt>The Policy That Wasn&rsquo;t</h3><p>Leaders talk. Streets stay the same. The mayor ripped out a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue after crashes involving children. He said he was listening to the community. Cyclists said, &ldquo;I don’t think he cares if we die&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/cyclists-fuming-over-mayor-adamss-removal-of-bedford-avenue-protected-bike-lane>Cyclists said</a>). The city put back paint. Paint does not stop cars.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Department of Transportation built a new protected bike lane in Queens. A commuter said, &ldquo;The old street was very dangerous&mldr; the new path is definitely safer because he&rsquo;s no longer competing with trucks and cars for road space&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/27/eyes-on-the-street-new-bike-lane-puts-the-bliss-in-blissville>A commuter said</a>). But these changes come slow. Too slow for the dead.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-that-dont-lie>The Numbers That Don&rsquo;t Lie</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks killed 299 people.</strong> Motorcycles and mopeds killed 21. Bikes killed 11. The city counts 182,570 injuries since 2022. The bodies pile up. The city debates.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call your council member. Call the mayor.

The policy, passed by the Legislature in 2019, was set to begin within weeks. It would have charged drivers entering Manhattan’s core, raising $1 billion yearly for transit repairs and upgrades. Hochul’s decision, made without legislative action, drew sharp criticism. Jumaane Williams, NYC Public Advocate, warned of 'irreparable harm to the city.' Natasha Elder of NYPIRG said, 'Gov. Hochul's decision to delay congestion pricing tells subway and bus riders they don't rank.' Advocates like the Tri-State Transportation Campaign called for 'bold, strong leadership.' The cancellation leaves the city’s streets jammed and transit funding gutted, with no relief for those most at risk: people on foot, on bikes, and on buses.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article compiles her past statements, where she called the plan 'powerful' and 'transformative.' Hochul said, 'Fewer cars mean less gridlock, traffic and pollution. Fewer cars means safer streets, cleaner air and more room to maneuver for pedestrians and bicyclists.' She also promised $1 billion yearly for transit upgrades. Despite this, Hochul now considers delaying the plan. The piece underscores the gap between her advocacy and current uncertainty. No council bill number or committee applies; this is a public statement. The article centers the impact on vulnerable road users: fewer cars mean safer streets, cleaner air, and more space for those outside vehicles. Hochul’s words set a standard. Her hesitation leaves safety gains unrealized.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, designed to fund transit and reduce car traffic, now sits idle. Advocates and officials, including Reinvent Albany, Carlo Scissura, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, and Sara Lind, condemned the move. Williams warned, 'An indefinite pause on congestion pricing will do irreparable harm to the city while undermining public confidence.' Scissura called it 'a devastating blow' to commuters and workers. Lind slammed the decision as 'wrongheaded.' The delay blocks $15 billion for subways and buses. Streets remain clogged. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, bus riders—face more danger and unreliable service. No safety analyst has formally assessed the impact, but the message is clear: the city’s most at-risk are left behind.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The right front bumper of the sedan hit the pedestrian’s head, causing severe lacerations and leaving him semiconscious and bleeding. The man died at the scene in the early morning hours.
