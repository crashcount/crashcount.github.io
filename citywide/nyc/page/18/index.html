The report states the pedestrian suffered head trauma and internal bleeding, dying at the scene under the streetlights. The vehicle, a 2022 Mercedes SUV, was traveling straight ahead at the time of the crash. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'unspecified,' offering no further detail on driver behavior, but the impact location and fatal injuries underscore the lethal force of the collision. The pedestrian was at the intersection when struck. No evidence in the report suggests any pedestrian action contributed to the crash.

According to the police report, the collision was caused by 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper.' The 35-year-old motorcycle rider, unlicensed but wearing a helmet, was ejected and suffered fatal crush injuries. The report states the rider was 'dead on scene.' Both trucks, registered in Indiana and driven by licensed New Jersey drivers, sustained no damage and continued westbound. The police narrative describes the motorcycle as 'demolished' and notes the trucks were 'untouched.'

Vulnerable New Yorkers lose again.</p><p class=mb3>On June 5, 2024, Governor Kathy Hochul announced the cancellation of New York’s congestion pricing program. The move came via a pre-taped video titled 'Addressing Affordability and the Cost of Living in New York.' Hochul argued the $15 charge would hurt working- and middle-class families and harm the city’s recovery. Streetsblog NYC fact-checked her claims, noting, 'The state's chief executive trotted out dubious claims about how the charge for drivers to enter Manhattan's central business district would 'undercut' the city's recovery from the pandemic, while giving no specifics about how she planned to raise money for the MTA or reduce the Big Apple's crippling gridlock.' The article points out that drivers are wealthier than transit riders, and congestion pricing would help low-income bus riders. Hochul offered no concrete plan to replace lost MTA funding. The decision leaves the city’s streets and its most vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The policy, passed by the Legislature in 2019, was set to begin within weeks. It would have charged drivers entering Manhattan’s core, raising $1 billion yearly for transit repairs and upgrades. Hochul’s decision, made without legislative action, drew sharp criticism. Jumaane Williams, NYC Public Advocate, warned of 'irreparable harm to the city.' Natasha Elder of NYPIRG said, 'Gov. Hochul's decision to delay congestion pricing tells subway and bus riders they don't rank.' Advocates like the Tri-State Transportation Campaign called for 'bold, strong leadership.' The cancellation leaves the city’s streets jammed and transit funding gutted, with no relief for those most at risk: people on foot, on bikes, and on buses.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article compiles her past statements, where she called the plan 'powerful' and 'transformative.' Hochul said, 'Fewer cars mean less gridlock, traffic and pollution. Fewer cars means safer streets, cleaner air and more room to maneuver for pedestrians and bicyclists.' She also promised $1 billion yearly for transit upgrades. Despite this, Hochul now considers delaying the plan. The piece underscores the gap between her advocacy and current uncertainty. No council bill number or committee applies; this is a public statement. The article centers the impact on vulnerable road users: fewer cars mean safer streets, cleaner air, and more space for those outside vehicles. Hochul’s words set a standard. Her hesitation leaves safety gains unrealized.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, designed to fund transit and reduce car traffic, now sits idle. Advocates and officials, including Reinvent Albany, Carlo Scissura, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, and Sara Lind, condemned the move. Williams warned, 'An indefinite pause on congestion pricing will do irreparable harm to the city while undermining public confidence.' Scissura called it 'a devastating blow' to commuters and workers. Lind slammed the decision as 'wrongheaded.' The delay blocks $15 billion for subways and buses. Streets remain clogged. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, bus riders—face more danger and unreliable service.

The incident occurred as the man stepped into the street, not at an intersection and without a crossing signal, as detailed in the report: 'A 70-year-old man stepped into the street without a signal. An eastbound SUV struck him head-on. He died from head and internal wounds. The driver held a license. The bumper bore the mark where he fell.' The vehicle involved was a 2023 Acura SUV, traveling straight ahead with two occupants. The point of impact was the center front end, and the right front bumper showed damage. The police report lists 'Unspecified' as the contributing factors for both the driver and the pedestrian, and does not cite any specific driver error. The pedestrian’s action—crossing without a signal or crosswalk—is noted after the absence of identified driver errors. The report does not mention any additional contributing factors or behaviors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bridge remains deadly for the vulnerable.</p><p class=mb3>On May 29, 2024, a hit-and-run driver killed cyclist Zenaido Rosas-Pinzon on the Washington Bridge, which links the Bronx and uptown Manhattan. The Department of Transportation (DOT) had promised a protected bike lane by 2023, but the project remains unfinished, with completion now pushed to summer 2024. The matter centers on the city's failure to deliver: 'DOT promised to install a protected bike lane along the Washington Bridge last year, but the bike lane remains unfinished and the road remains dangerous. ... These repeated delays are killing us,' said Jada Yeboah of Transportation Alternatives. Local advocates and activists expressed anger and heartbreak, blaming the lack of safe infrastructure for the cyclist's death. Cyclists have been forced to share a narrow path with pedestrians or ride in the bus lane, neither designed for their safety. DOT cited 'complexities' and routine road work as reasons for the delay. The bridge was identified for safety upgrades in a 2018 DOT report, but the city failed to act in time.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
