Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), launched a Government Accountability Office (GAO) investigation into vehicle safety standards and their deadly impact on pedestrians and cyclists. The probe, not tied to a specific bill number, follows record-high deaths among vulnerable road users in the U.S. The matter summary states: 'Congress has launched an investigation into whether America's limited vehicle safety standards are driving the rise in deaths of vulnerable road users.' Raskin, citing personal and constituent tragedies, criticized federal agencies for ignoring design flaws like high hoods, large blind zones, and the lack of side-underride guards. He called out regulators for focusing on advanced tech over basic, life-saving design changes. Raskin said, 'Nobody should be killed on our highways and roadways. That should not be some acceptable cost of doing business.'

The decision, covered in Streetsblog NYC, bypassed the voices of everyday New Yorkers. Hochul cited feedback from wealthy business owners, not the city’s transit riders or street users. The article quotes Hochul: "That is all I need to know." Council members were not directly involved, but the move drew sharp criticism from advocates and residents. The matter title: 'Cycle of Rage: Hochul’s ‘Diner Diplomacy’ is the Worst Kind of Lie.' The cancellation blocks a policy designed to cut traffic, reduce crashes, and fund transit. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, and bus riders—lose safer streets and cleaner air. The governor’s action protects drivers and business interests, leaving the city’s most exposed at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bicyclist suffered fatal crush injuries to his entire body and was ejected from the bike. The point of impact was the truck's right rear quarter panel, and the CitiBike's center front end. The police report lists 'Unspecified' as the contributing factor for both parties, but the narrative centers on the truck's right turn and the resulting deadly impact.

The move came via a pre-taped video titled 'Addressing Affordability and the Cost of Living in New York.' Hochul argued the $15 charge would hurt working- and middle-class families and harm the city’s recovery. Streetsblog NYC fact-checked her claims, noting, 'The state's chief executive trotted out dubious claims about how the charge for drivers to enter Manhattan's central business district would 'undercut' the city's recovery from the pandemic, while giving no specifics about how she planned to raise money for the MTA or reduce the Big Apple's crippling gridlock.' The article points out that drivers are wealthier than transit riders, and congestion pricing would help low-income bus riders. Hochul offered no concrete plan to replace lost MTA funding.

Hochul's decision to delay congestion pricing tells subway and bus riders they don't rank.' Advocates like the Tri-State Transportation Campaign called for 'bold, strong leadership.'
