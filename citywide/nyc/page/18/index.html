An SUV hit him at the intersection. His name is not in the data. His age is. The street is busy. The city calls it one of the most dangerous for walkers. The group said, <strong>"[Eastern Parkway] acts as a major thoroughfare for drivers, and is the sixth most dangerous street in Brooklyn for pedestrians"</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/01/tuesdays-headlines-another-child-sacrificed-to-the-suv-edition>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>Fourteen people were hurt when a van slammed into a tree in Brooklyn. Twelve of them were adults with special needs, headed to a day program. The driver swerved to avoid another car. A witness said, <strong>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sad because they definitely need a lot of attention more than anyone else. I hope that they&rsquo;re all OK at the end of the day&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/transport-van-crashes-tree-bath-beach-brooklyn-injuring-14-people/16903098/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>A 17-year-old died riding a moped. A 39-year-old was killed on a motorcycle. The list goes on. In the past 12 months, <strong>244 people have died</strong> on city streets. <strong>709 were seriously injured</strong>.

Governor Hochul said, <strong>&ldquo;Speed cameras save lives and keep New Yorkers safe. There is no greater priority for me than the safety of New Yorkers&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>amNY</a>). Cameras slow some drivers. But the dead keep coming.</p><p>Protected bike lanes work. The city’s own Department of Transportation warned, <strong>&ldquo;Removing the protected bike lane won&rsquo;t remove cyclists—it will only make the street less safe&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/dot-testimony-removing-bedford-ave-bike-lane-will-reduce-safety>Streetsblog NYC</a>).

The city risks more deaths, more grief.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-are-names>The Numbers Are Names</h3><p>SUVs and cars kill most. In three years, <strong>cars and SUVs killed 300 people</strong> and left thousands more broken. Trucks and buses killed 93. Motorcycles and mopeds killed 10. Bikes killed 11.

They are mothers, sons, neighbors.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another body on the street.</strong> Call your council member.

Inside the vehicle, a male occupant and an infant were found. The report states the infant showed no signs of life, and the man did not move. The narrative describes the scene as silent and still, with the street 'holding its breath.' The parked sedan was not in motion at the time of the crash, and the impact targeted the left side doors. The police report does not specify any driver errors or contributing factors from the striking vehicle, listing them as 'Unspecified.' No mention is made of victim behavior as a contributing factor. The data centers the violence inflicted upon vulnerable occupants by the force of a moving vehicle against a stationary car.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'There Is A Pedestrian Injury and Death Crisis Going On,' highlights 55 pedestrian deaths and more than 4,000 injuries this year. Brooklyn and Queens are most affected. Over 92 percent of injuries come from drivers of cars, trucks, and heavy vehicles. Council members and advocates, including Alexa Sledge of Transportation Alternatives and Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance, called for urgent safety upgrades: raised crosswalks, protected bike lanes, and turn calming. Jon Orcutt, a former DOT official, blamed slow city action, weak enforcement, and bigger vehicles. The cancellation of congestion pricing—expected to cut 100,000 cars a day—removes a key safety measure. The Department of Transportation did not comment. Advocates stress: the crisis is driver-caused, not the fault of cyclists or e-mobility users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Raskin, citing personal and constituent tragedies, criticized federal agencies for ignoring design flaws like high hoods, large blind zones, and the lack of side-underride guards. He called out regulators for focusing on advanced tech over basic, life-saving design changes. Raskin said, 'Nobody should be killed on our highways and roadways.

The report states, 'A box truck turned right. A 32-year-old man on a CitiBike was crushed beneath its weight. No helmet. No time. His body thrown clear. The truck rolled on, untouched.' The bicyclist suffered fatal crush injuries to his entire body and was ejected from the bike. The point of impact was the truck's right rear quarter panel, and the CitiBike's center front end. The police report lists 'Unspecified' as the contributing factor for both parties, but the narrative centers on the truck's right turn and the resulting deadly impact. The report notes the cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but does not cite this as a contributing factor. The truck sustained no damage and continued on after the crash.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the collision was caused by 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper.' The 35-year-old motorcycle rider, unlicensed but wearing a helmet, was ejected and suffered fatal crush injuries. The report states the rider was 'dead on scene.' Both trucks, registered in Indiana and driven by licensed New Jersey drivers, sustained no damage and continued westbound. The police narrative describes the motorcycle as 'demolished' and notes the trucks were 'untouched.'

She cited shaky reasons. Her video ignored facts: car traffic is up, drivers are wealthier, and bus riders suffer. She offered no plan for MTA funding. Streets stay clogged. Vulnerable New Yorkers lose again.</p><p class=mb3>On June 5, 2024, Governor Kathy Hochul announced the cancellation of New York’s congestion pricing program. The move came via a pre-taped video titled 'Addressing Affordability and the Cost of Living in New York.' Hochul argued the $15 charge would hurt working- and middle-class families and harm the city’s recovery. Streetsblog NYC fact-checked her claims, noting, 'The state's chief executive trotted out dubious claims about how the charge for drivers to enter Manhattan's central business district would 'undercut' the city's recovery from the pandemic, while giving no specifics about how she planned to raise money for the MTA or reduce the Big Apple's crippling gridlock.' The article points out that drivers are wealthier than transit riders, and congestion pricing would help low-income bus riders. Hochul offered no concrete plan to replace lost MTA funding. The decision leaves the city’s streets and its most vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
