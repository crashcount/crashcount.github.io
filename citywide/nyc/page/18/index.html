The report states the SUV's driver was inattentive or distracted at the moment of impact. The cyclist was ejected from her bike, suffering fatal head injuries. The narrative notes, 'Her head struck pavement. She died there, alone on the asphalt, her bike crumpled beside her.' The contributing factor listed is 'Driver Inattention/Distraction.'

The decision, covered in Streetsblog NYC, bypassed the voices of everyday New Yorkers. Hochul cited feedback from wealthy business owners, not the city’s transit riders or street users. The article quotes Hochul: "That is all I need to know." Council members were not directly involved, but the move drew sharp criticism from advocates and residents. The matter title: 'Cycle of Rage: Hochul’s ‘Diner Diplomacy’ is the Worst Kind of Lie.' The cancellation blocks a policy designed to cut traffic, reduce crashes, and fund transit. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, and bus riders—lose safer streets and cleaner air. The governor’s action protects drivers and business interests, leaving the city’s most exposed at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Hochul argued the $15 charge would hurt working- and middle-class families and harm the city’s recovery. Streetsblog NYC fact-checked her claims, noting, 'The state's chief executive trotted out dubious claims about how the charge for drivers to enter Manhattan's central business district would 'undercut' the city's recovery from the pandemic, while giving no specifics about how she planned to raise money for the MTA or reduce the Big Apple's crippling gridlock.' The article points out that drivers are wealthier than transit riders, and congestion pricing would help low-income bus riders. Hochul offered no concrete plan to replace lost MTA funding.

The Yamaha motorcycle, traveling straight ahead, struck the truck's right rear bumper. The 26-year-old motorcyclist, wearing a helmet, was ejected from his bike. The helmet cracked on impact, and the rider suffered fatal injuries to his entire body. The police report lists 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as a contributing factor, pointing to a critical driver error by the truck operator during the lane change. The report does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor.

Residents demand safety after deadly crashes.</p><p class=mb3>On May 31, 2024, the NYC Department of Transportation announced a redesign for 31st Avenue in Astoria, Queens. The proposal, revealed by DOT Director Ted Wright, creates a 'bike boulevard' with two-way protected bike lanes from Steinway Street to Vernon Boulevard. The plan shifts the avenue to one-way car traffic, adds painted pedestrian islands, curb extensions, and may include a car-free plaza. DOT aims to reduce vehicle presence and traffic violence, responding to local advocacy after several high-profile crashes. Residents and organizers, including Alana Herlands and John Surico, voiced strong support: 'We are going to advocate for the most ambitious plan that not only adds more space for the community... but also reduces traffic violence.' Implementation is set for summer and fall, with an extension east to 51st Street planned next year.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
