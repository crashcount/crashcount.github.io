Chairman Yidel Perlstein urged police to target cyclists, claiming, “police should focus on ticketing cyclists rather than drivers.” Resident Karen Chan blamed a speeding ticket on a nearby cyclist. Local Nina Sabghir countered, citing rampant driver misconduct: speeding, double parking, blocking bike lanes. Transportation Alternatives’ Jacob deCastro called for protected bike lanes, not scapegoating. The board opposes increased enforcement against drivers and rejects protected bike infrastructure, despite city data showing drivers are the main cause of crashes, injuries, and deaths.
