Chairman Yidel Perlstein urged police to target cyclists, claiming, “police should focus on ticketing cyclists rather than drivers.” Resident Karen Chan blamed a speeding ticket on a nearby cyclist. Local Nina Sabghir countered, citing rampant driver misconduct: speeding, double parking, blocking bike lanes. Transportation Alternatives’ Jacob deCastro called for protected bike lanes, not scapegoating. The board opposes increased enforcement against drivers and rejects protected bike infrastructure, despite city data showing drivers are the main cause of crashes, injuries, and deaths.

One victim was killed at an intersection where parked cars blocked visibility and the ADA ramp. Another, Zabina Gafoor, was struck by an NYPD vehicle responding to an emergency. Advocates, including Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives, condemned the city’s failure to implement proven safety measures, saying, 'Our city’s children deserve to grow up without the threat of traffic violence.'

He calls for smaller fleets, safer vehicles, and real accountability. Safety advocates back him. City Hall pushes back. The fight is over money, lives, and responsibility.</p><p class=mb3>On February 12, 2023, Comptroller Brad Lander released a report urging city agencies to bear financial responsibility for crash settlements involving their employees, instead of using the general city budget. The proposal, detailed in the report titled "Make City Drivers Safer By Punishing Agencies for Crashes," calls for accelerated adoption of vehicle safety technology, a direct vision standard for fleet vehicles, reduction in both fleet size and vehicle size, and stronger accountability for city drivers. Lander states, "The city should place the budgeted allocation for projected settlement costs within each agency's budget." Safety advocates, including Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives, support the move, calling it "an important step toward creating a safer city." City Hall responded by highlighting ongoing safety efforts and questioning the link between settlements and fleet crashes. The proposal has not yet advanced to a formal council stage or committee.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
