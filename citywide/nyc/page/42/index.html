Just last week, an eight-year-old boy was killed crossing Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights. His sister watched. His mother grieves. “He was a boy who loved life,” <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>said his mother</a>.</p><p>Scooter riders, teens on mopeds, and cyclists have all fallen.

The matter, described as 'significant street safety improvements,' drew outrage. Over 30,000 signed a petition for a stop light. Community voices—Dolma’s family, local parents, advocates—demanded more: pedestrian plazas, Open Streets, enforcement. Sarah Chu said, 'And if the family wants a stop light, just give it to them.' Ivana Bologna called for ticketing drivers. The city’s limited response, with only signage and paint, was widely seen as inadequate.

The plan pilots battery-swap programs, allows legal e-bikes in parks, and installs outdoor charging at NYCHA sites. Adams said, ‘This plan commits to designing a safe environment and access program that will help New Yorkers transition away from the illegal mopeds and uncertified bikes and batteries to safe, legal devices and batteries.’ The mayor stressed e-bikes’ role for delivery workers and congestion relief, while targeting unsafe batteries and illegal mopeds. The FDNY opposed Intro 722 over resource concerns.

The area, industrial but growing residential, has a long record of crashes. Transportation Alternatives and advocates spoke out, saying, 'Paint is not protection—especially from large trucks.' Elizabeth Adams called the road 'known-dangerous' and demanded protected bike lanes. Less than 2% of District 34’s streets have them. The 90th Precinct saw 1,966 crashes in 2022, injuring 170 cyclists and 145 pedestrians. Advocates say the city’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed.

The article, 'Cycle of Rage: One Hand Whitewashes the Other on NYPD Plate Defacing,' documents months of reporting by Gersh Kuntzman. He flagged over a dozen officers, but NYPD internal investigations led to only warnings or requests to fix plates—no formal punishment. The NYPD often closed cases without action, citing lack of evidence or officer retirement. Kuntzman’s Freedom of Information requests for discipline records were denied. The piece quotes, 'None of the eight cops was disciplined.' The pattern is clear: leniency, secrecy, and a lack of enforcement. Council members are not named; this is a matter of NYPD internal accountability. The lack of consequences leaves dangerous drivers on the street, putting pedestrians and cyclists at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
