The article, 'Cycle of Rage: One Hand Whitewashes the Other on NYPD Plate Defacing,' documents months of reporting by Gersh Kuntzman. He flagged over a dozen officers, but NYPD internal investigations led to only warnings or requests to fix plates—no formal punishment. The NYPD often closed cases without action, citing lack of evidence or officer retirement. Kuntzman’s Freedom of Information requests for discipline records were denied. The piece quotes, 'None of the eight cops was disciplined.' The pattern is clear: leniency, secrecy, and a lack of enforcement. Council members are not named; this is a matter of NYPD internal accountability.

The Department of Transportation opposes the bill. The issue gained urgency after three pedestrians, including 7-year-old Dolma Naadhun, died in separate crashes over the weekend of February 19, 2023. One victim was killed at an intersection where parked cars blocked visibility and the ADA ramp. Another, Zabina Gafoor, was struck by an NYPD vehicle responding to an emergency. Advocates, including Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives, condemned the city’s failure to implement proven safety measures, saying, 'Our city’s children deserve to grow up without the threat of traffic violence.' The bill remains pending.
