Chairman Yidel Perlstein urged police to target cyclists, claiming, “police should focus on ticketing cyclists rather than drivers.” Resident Karen Chan blamed a speeding ticket on a nearby cyclist. Local Nina Sabghir countered, citing rampant driver misconduct: speeding, double parking, blocking bike lanes. Transportation Alternatives’ Jacob deCastro called for protected bike lanes, not scapegoating. The board opposes increased enforcement against drivers and rejects protected bike infrastructure, despite city data showing drivers are the main cause of crashes, injuries, and deaths.

The Department of Transportation opposes the bill. The issue gained urgency after three pedestrians, including 7-year-old Dolma Naadhun, died in separate crashes over the weekend of February 19, 2023. One victim was killed at an intersection where parked cars blocked visibility and the ADA ramp. Another, Zabina Gafoor, was struck by an NYPD vehicle responding to an emergency. Advocates, including Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives, condemned the city’s failure to implement proven safety measures, saying, 'Our city’s children deserve to grow up without the threat of traffic violence.'

The proposal, detailed in the report titled "Make City Drivers Safer By Punishing Agencies for Crashes," calls for accelerated adoption of vehicle safety technology, a direct vision standard for fleet vehicles, reduction in both fleet size and vehicle size, and stronger accountability for city drivers. Lander states, "The city should place the budgeted allocation for projected settlement costs within each agency's budget." Safety advocates, including Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives, support the move, calling it "an important step toward creating a safer city." City Hall responded by highlighting ongoing safety efforts and questioning the link between settlements and fleet crashes. The proposal has not yet advanced to a formal council stage or committee.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He declared, 'Our ultimate goal is to get traffic deaths down to zero.' Buttigieg urged mayors to adopt Vision Zero, citing cities like Hoboken and Jersey City as proof that progress is possible. He called for lower speed limits, protected bike and bus lanes, curb extensions, high-visibility crosswalks, and more frequent signals.
