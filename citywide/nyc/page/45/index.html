It exposes failures in enforcement, road design, and political will.

The blood toll mounts.</p><p class=mb3>The Complete Streets Funding Bill (S3897/A8936) passed both the New York State Assembly and Senate in 2022. The bill sits unsigned on Governor Hochul's desk. It aims to make it easier for municipalities to fund and build complete streets—roads designed to slow cars and protect people walking or biking. The bill summary states it would 'make it easier for municipalities across New York State to invest in complete streets projects and save lives.' Sandi Vega, a member of Families for Safe Streets, wrote the opinion and called out the governor for inaction. Vega lost her daughter Brittany to a dangerous road. Advocates, including Vega, will rally outside Hochul’s Midtown office to demand action. Every day the bill is not signed, more New Yorkers risk death on unsafe streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
