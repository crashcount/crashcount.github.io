It exposes failures in enforcement, road design, and political will. The article singles out wide, dangerous streets like Linden Boulevard and Pennsylvania Avenue, noting the lack of turn-calming, pedestrian intervals, and bike lanes. No council member is named; the piece is a call to action, not a legislative bill. It urges stronger enforcement, better design, and accountability.
