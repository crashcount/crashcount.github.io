A black SUV hit him. He died on the street. The driver stayed. Police said, &ldquo;They were walking, he was crossing the street with his sister&rdquo; (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>police said</a>). No arrest. The street is still open. The danger is still there.</p><p>The day before, in the Bronx, a man ran a red light. His car jumped the curb and crushed three people on the sidewalk. One is still fighting for life. The driver ran but police caught him. He faces charges for assault, fleeing, and driving without a license (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/driver-flees-bronx-car-stop-crash/>faces charges</a>).</p><p><strong>In the last 12 months, 244 people have died on New York City streets. 713 were seriously hurt.</strong> Thirteen of the dead were children. The city logs over 81,000 crashes a year. Each number is a name, a family, a future gone.</p><h3 id=the-policy-that-wasnt>The Policy That Wasn&rsquo;t</h3><p>Leaders talk. Streets stay the same. The mayor ripped out a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue after crashes involving children. He said he was listening to the community. Cyclists said, &ldquo;I don’t think he cares if we die&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/cyclists-fuming-over-mayor-adamss-removal-of-bedford-avenue-protected-bike-lane>Cyclists said</a>). The city put back paint. Paint does not stop cars.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Department of Transportation built a new protected bike lane in Queens. A commuter said, &ldquo;The old street was very dangerous&mldr; the new path is definitely safer because he&rsquo;s no longer competing with trucks and cars for road space&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/27/eyes-on-the-street-new-bike-lane-puts-the-bliss-in-blissville>A commuter said</a>). But these changes come slow. Too slow for the dead.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-that-dont-lie>The Numbers That Don&rsquo;t Lie</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks killed 299 people.</strong> Motorcycles and mopeds killed 21. Bikes killed 11. The city counts 182,570 injuries since 2022. The bodies pile up. The city debates.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call your council member. Call the mayor.

The city stays silent.</p><p class=mb3>On April 7, 2022, NYPD Officers Orkhan Mamedov and Evan Siegel drove a police van on Eastern Parkway during a non-emergency prisoner transfer. Surveillance and body camera footage, released by Attorney General Letitia James on December 19, 2022, shows the van speeding, running a red light, and striking Ronald Smith, a pedestrian. The van dragged Smith 35-40 feet. The matter summary states: 'Video shows cop speeding in NYPD van—and may have been watching a soccer game before fatal crash.' Smith’s sister, Julie Floyd, and Justice Committee director Yul-san Liem condemned the officers’ actions and inaction. Floyd called for their firing and prosecution, saying, 'These officers drove an NYPD van so fast and recklessly... they dragged my brother... and had no regard for my brother’s life.' The NYPD declined to comment or disclose the officers’ status. No safety analyst assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
