Seven hundred thirty-four suffered wounds so grave they will never be the same. The dead are not numbers. A 76-year-old woman, struck by an SUV while crossing White Plains Road. A 32-year-old woman, crushed by a Jeep on Marcus Garvey Boulevard. A 79-year-old man, found dead in a parked car on West 77th.

They blame reckless driving, illegal parking, and weak action on bike lane violations. Calls grow for civilian and automated enforcement. Police chases, placard abuse, and racial bias put lives at risk. Change is urgent.</p><p class=mb3>On August 16, 2023, safe streets advocates responded to the forced retirement of NYPD Transportation Bureau Chief Kim Royster. The NYPD Transportation Bureau oversees safety for motorists, passengers, pedestrians, and cyclists. Advocates argue the Bureau has failed to prevent traffic violence and often worsens danger through reckless driving, illegal parking, and lax enforcement. The statement, titled 'Safe Streets Advocates: Incoming NYPD Transportation Chief Must Do Better,' calls for better officer education, consistent and equitable ticketing, transparency, and a shift from armed police to civilian and automated enforcement. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives said, 'We need to see a shift away from police officer enforcement to self-enforcing streets.' Michelle Feldman of the Center for Policing Equity added, 'You don’t need a person with a gun and a badge for all these incidents.' The statement criticizes placard abuse, police chases, and racial disparities. Advocates urge the NYPD to protect vulnerable road users by ending harmful practices and embracing proven reforms.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Local organizers, including Meghan Canale and Katie Denny Horowitz, praised the transformation. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno said, 'We're developing permanent designs for existing locations to create safer, more vibrant community spaces.' The North Brooklyn Parks Alliance partnered with DOT. The plaza adds bike corrals, movable furniture, and planters. While some residents oppose similar projects, the city continues to expand pedestrian and cycling infrastructure in the area.

The Manhattan DA indicted him for vehicular homicide and manslaughter. The crash left one dead, several hurt, and a city shaken by reckless driving. Justice now moves forward.</p><p class=mb3>On August 10, 2023, the Manhattan District Attorney indicted Mahbub Ali for killing a cyclist and injuring four others while driving drunk. The case is not a council bill but a prosecution, led by DA Alvin Bragg. The charges include vehicular homicide, manslaughter, assault, and drunk driving, with the top charge carrying up to 25 years. Bragg stated, 'Vehicular violence threatens the safety of New Yorkers who have the right to walk and bike without fear.' The indictment follows a June 4 crash on Third Avenue, where Ali struck and killed 22-year-old Abdulhekim Esiyok, then hit a pole, an NYPD van, and a garbage can. The crash injured another cyclist and two pedestrians. This case highlights the deadly threat drivers pose to vulnerable road users. NYPD data show 96 percent of pedestrian injuries are caused by drivers of cars and trucks, not micromobility users. The prosecution seeks accountability for violence behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She demanded Mayor Adams meet legal requirements for protected bike lanes, noting only five miles have been built in the Bronx out of 50 required citywide this year. The Bronx ranks third in traffic fatalities, eighth in injuries among 51 districts. The city's inaction leaves cyclists exposed.
