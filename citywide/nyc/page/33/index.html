The Calyer Compromise brings protected bike lanes, fewer car lanes south of Calyer, and offset crossings. It follows years of deadly crashes. Advocates call it a step forward. Some say it falls short.</p><p class=mb3>On August 29, 2023, the Department of Transportation announced work will begin on the McGuinness Boulevard redesign, known as the 'Calyer Compromise.' The plan, shaped by controversy and negotiation, keeps two lanes of car and truck traffic in both directions from the Pulaski Bridge to Calyer Street during the day, with a flex lane for parking at night. South of Calyer, the road narrows to one lane each way, with protected bike lanes, loading zones, and offset crossings. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said the compromise will 'save lives and make this corridor much easier to navigate for everyone, including drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists.' He thanked Mayor Adams, elected officials, and the community for their support. Supporters call it the biggest safety change since Robert Moses widened the road. Opponents, like Keep McGuinness Moving, say it ignores community concerns. The redesign comes after years of advocacy following multiple deaths and injuries on the corridor.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, not tied to a council bill but a DOT initiative, expands northbound bike lanes from eight to ten feet on the upper section. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, “This project will deliver much-needed safety upgrades to the Hell’s Kitchen corridor and help support more efficient transportation options.” Local advocate Christine Berthet praised the wider lanes, noting the old design could not safely carry regular bikes alongside cargo and e-bikes. The project adds pedestrian islands, dedicated left-turn lanes, and leading pedestrian intervals at key intersections. Berthet urged the city to install flex posts to keep drivers out of bike and pedestrian spaces, citing problems on nearby 11th Avenue. The changes aim to protect vulnerable road users but leave most space for cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No council bill number is attached; this is a public call to action, not legislation.

The author mapped safety features and hazards, proposing a new, proactive metric based on accessibility, comfort, and livability. The piece urges DOT to shift from counting casualties to preventing them, stating, 'we need a different metric to fix the underlying problem of safety on city streets—one that is community-centered and doesn’t reduce our assessment of a certain street’s needs to grim numbers.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Change is urgent.</p><p class=mb3>On August 16, 2023, safe streets advocates responded to the forced retirement of NYPD Transportation Bureau Chief Kim Royster. The NYPD Transportation Bureau oversees safety for motorists, passengers, pedestrians, and cyclists. Advocates argue the Bureau has failed to prevent traffic violence and often worsens danger through reckless driving, illegal parking, and lax enforcement. The statement, titled 'Safe Streets Advocates: Incoming NYPD Transportation Chief Must Do Better,' calls for better officer education, consistent and equitable ticketing, transparency, and a shift from armed police to civilian and automated enforcement. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives said, 'We need to see a shift away from police officer enforcement to self-enforcing streets.' Michelle Feldman of the Center for Policing Equity added, 'You don’t need a person with a gun and a badge for all these incidents.' The statement criticizes placard abuse, police chases, and racial disparities. Advocates urge the NYPD to protect vulnerable road users by ending harmful practices and embracing proven reforms.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
