His son stands over him, waiting for his eyes to open. They never do. Just days ago, Pasqual Tziquin was killed crossing New Utrecht Avenue in Brooklyn. The driver did not stop. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t stop. He just kept going,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/06/hit-and-run-driver-kills-brooklyn-restaurant-worker-in-front-of-son/>said Henry Tziquin</a>. Eight days later, Pasqual was dead. His family waits for justice.</p><p>Across the city, the violence does not let up. On the Belt Parkway, a BMW vaulted the median and slammed into oncoming cars. Six people were hurt, two left fighting for their lives. Police said, &ldquo;speed may have been an issue&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/05/us-news/six-hurt-when-car-barrels-into-oncoming-nyc-traffic/>in the crash</a>. In Crown Heights, an eight-year-old boy was struck and killed by an SUV. The street is a main road, built for speed. The boy is gone.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-behind-the-blood>The Numbers Behind the Blood</h3><p>In the last twelve months, 236 people have died on New York City streets. Another 704 suffered serious injuries. Children, elders, cyclists, pedestrians—no one is spared. SUVs and cars do the most harm: SUVs and cars killed 300 people, seriously injured 509, and hurt over 26,000 more in the last three years. Trucks and buses killed 93. Motorcycles and mopeds killed 10. Bikes killed 11. The numbers do not lie. The bodies pile up.</p><h3 id=leaders-actbut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Act—But Not Fast Enough</h3><p>Some leaders move. The city has started to lower speed limits, install more speed cameras, and build protected bike lanes. But too often, safety is ripped out as fast as it is built. When the city tried to remove the Bedford Avenue bike lane, the Department of Transportation warned: &ldquo;Removing the protected bike lane won&rsquo;t remove cyclists—it will only make the street less safe&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/dot-testimony-removing-bedford-ave-bike-lane-will-reduce-safety>testified DOT</a>.</p><p>Others push policies that punish the vulnerable. A 15 mph e-bike speed cap is on the table. Michael Replogle, former DOT official, calls it &ldquo;an ill-considered idea to improve safety which will be counterproductive&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/03/ex-dot-official-warns-nycs-counterproductive-e-bike-speed-limit-will-curb-biking-safety>said Replogle</a>. The city debates, the streets bleed.</p><h3 id=act-nowor-count-the-dead>Act Now—Or Count the Dead</h3><p>Every day of delay is another day of loss. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Tell them to protect bike lanes, not rip them out. Tell them to stop blaming the people on foot and on bikes. The bodies in the street are not statistics. They are your neighbors. They are your children.

The report states the pedestrian suffered a fatal head injury, with blood pooling on the pavement. She died at the scene. The report explicitly cites 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as a contributing factor, underscoring the driver's responsibility in the crash. 'Glare' is also listed as a contributing factor. The victim was crossing legally, with the light, when she was hit. The SUV was driven by a licensed driver and was occupied by two people at the time. The crash highlights the lethal consequences when drivers fail to yield to pedestrians, even when those pedestrians are following the law.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The report states, 'A Toyota sedan tore through the quiet night, slamming parked cars. A 29-year-old man was ejected and died in the street. Two others lay bleeding beside him, heads crushed.' The driver of the Toyota was unlicensed, as confirmed by the vehicle data: 'driver_license_status: Unlicensed.' Three passengers suffered severe injuries—one killed, two with major head trauma.

The project, highlighted in Streetsblog NYC, aims to double the number of car-free corridors for children. Deputy Mayor Anuela Ristani and Mayor Erion Veliaj lead the effort, stressing the need to shift street space from cars to people. The official summary states: 'Streets near schools should be for kids, not cars.' Simon Battisti, an urban planner, says school streets 'improve safety where children and parents need it most.' The program adds play spaces, lighting, benches, trees, and stormwater management. Tirana’s leaders call this a legacy of safety and a model for cities worldwide, including New York.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states, 'Traffic signal ignored.' The moped lay twisted in the dark, its rider showing no pulse. The contributing factor listed is 'Traffic Control Disregarded,' highlighting the BMW driver's failure to obey a traffic signal.

It cites missed legal benchmarks for bike and bus lanes, interference with DOT projects, and the prioritization of car storage over safety. The mayor and his chief adviser, Ingrid Lewis-Martin, are named for derailing safety efforts. The Council failed to renew the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program and weakened the outdoor dining program. Delays on the Queensboro Bridge pedestrian path and flawed bike lane designs left vulnerable road users exposed.

They set speed limits, design roads, control funding. Most choose cars over people. Texas and Georgia rank low. California and Massachusetts push safety. Without state action, deaths rise.

The article, 'States, We Need Your Vision to Get to ‘Zero’,' highlights how state Departments of Transportation shape safety outcomes. Texas and Georgia prioritize fast car travel, leading to more crashes and deaths. California and Massachusetts invest in transit and set design standards for pedestrians and cyclists. The piece states, 'States must lead. Whether it’s lowering speed limits, re-designing roadways to encourage safer speeds, adding speed safety cameras, or other proven safety countermeasures; states are usually loath to make change.' Advocates and local leaders push for accountability. The analysis finds that without state leadership, vulnerable road users remain at risk. States must lower speeds, redesign roads, and fund transit—or let cities act.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
