Seven hundred thirty-four suffered wounds so grave they will never be the same. The dead are not numbers. A 76-year-old woman, struck by an SUV while crossing White Plains Road. A 32-year-old woman, crushed by a Jeep on Marcus Garvey Boulevard. A 79-year-old man, found dead in a parked car on West 77th.

But the law that keeps speed cameras running is set to expire. If Albany fails, the cameras go dark. Streets go back to the way they were—fast, brutal, and unforgiving.

Progress, but not enough.</p><p class=mb3>On November 30, 2023, city officials unveiled new protected bike lanes along 11th Street, 44th Drive, and Jackson Avenue in Long Island City. The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, called the lanes 'life-saving' and said they fill a critical gap, connecting cyclists to the Queensboro and Pulaski bridges. The project follows years of advocacy, including a 2019 push by then-Council Member Jimmy Van Bramer. Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives praised the concrete curbs and daylighting but warned that gaps remain—especially at confusing intersections and near truck routes. Shepard urged DOT to add more physical barriers and expand the network, noting, 'It’s exciting, but we still need a lot more.' The new lanes mark progress, but the area’s vulnerable road users still face danger from incomplete connections and blocked paths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, not yet in formal bill stage, covers neighborhoods like Long Island City, Astoria, Elmhurst, and Jackson Heights. It calls for a 'protected bike lane network, more pedestrian space, a ban on parking near intersections, more space for micromobility users, and policy changes to improve safety.' Lawmakers demand these projects by 2029, including opening the Queensboro Bridge’s south outer roadway to pedestrians, redesigning 31st Avenue, and universal daylighting. The plan also pushes for automated enforcement, lower speed limits, higher fees for heavy vehicles, and bus lanes on every major route. The lawmakers’ statement reads: 'Even one death is too many, and these 13 tragedies have had a major impact on Western Queens residents.' Their plan aims to hold officials accountable and make streets safer for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter highlights, in Liao’s words, 'Streetsblog opened my eyes to a different way of looking at our streets.' He credits Streetsblog for exposing the city’s failure to protect children and for demanding driver accountability. Liao urges support for Streetsblog’s mission to transform city streets into safer spaces for everyone.
