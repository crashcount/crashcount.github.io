Now, leaders can lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not done it citywide. Speed cameras, proven to save lives, are at risk if Albany does not act.

They are choices. Choices to wait, to water down, to delay. Choices that kill. The city has the tools. The leaders have the power. They must use it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand the protection of speed cameras. Demand streets that do not kill.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name to be carved in stone. <a href=../../take_action/>Act now</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Progress, but not enough.</p><p class=mb3>On November 30, 2023, city officials unveiled new protected bike lanes along 11th Street, 44th Drive, and Jackson Avenue in Long Island City. The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, called the lanes 'life-saving' and said they fill a critical gap, connecting cyclists to the Queensboro and Pulaski bridges. The project follows years of advocacy, including a 2019 push by then-Council Member Jimmy Van Bramer. Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives praised the concrete curbs and daylighting but warned that gaps remain—especially at confusing intersections and near truck routes. Shepard urged DOT to add more physical barriers and expand the network, noting, 'It’s exciting, but we still need a lot more.' The new lanes mark progress, but the area’s vulnerable road users still face danger from incomplete connections and blocked paths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, not yet in formal bill stage, covers neighborhoods like Long Island City, Astoria, Elmhurst, and Jackson Heights. It calls for a 'protected bike lane network, more pedestrian space, a ban on parking near intersections, more space for micromobility users, and policy changes to improve safety.' Lawmakers demand these projects by 2029, including opening the Queensboro Bridge’s south outer roadway to pedestrians, redesigning 31st Avenue, and universal daylighting. The plan also pushes for automated enforcement, lower speed limits, higher fees for heavy vehicles, and bus lanes on every major route. The lawmakers’ statement reads: 'Even one death is too many, and these 13 tragedies have had a major impact on Western Queens residents.' Their plan aims to hold officials accountable and make streets safer for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
