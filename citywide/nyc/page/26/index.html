In the last twelve months, <strong>243 people died</strong> on New York streets. <strong>708 were left with serious injuries</strong>. Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—none are spared. Just last week, an eight-year-old boy was killed crossing Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights. His sister watched. His mother grieves. “He was a boy who loved life,” <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>said his mother</a>.</p><p>Scooter riders, teens on mopeds, and cyclists have all fallen. On June 26, a 39-year-old man was thrown from his scooter and died on 116th Avenue. No arrests. No comfort. The street is unchanged.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> In the last three years, they took <strong>299 lives</strong> and left thousands more broken. Trucks and buses killed <strong>93</strong>. Motorcycles and mopeds, <strong>10</strong>. Bikes, <strong>11</strong>. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not. Every crash is a family torn open.</p><h3 id=leaders-actbut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Act—But Not Fast Enough</h3><p>The city has moved, but the pace is slow. Speed cameras in school zones are now extended through 2030. “It’s simple: speed cameras save lives and keep New Yorkers safe,” <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>said Governor Hochul</a>. But cameras alone are not enough. Streets need to be rebuilt. Speed limits must drop. The city has the power to set a 20 mph limit. It has not used it.</p><p>Some leaders speak plain. “At this point, there are no questions, just facts: speeding kills, and speed cameras save lives,” <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>said State Senator Gounardes</a>. But others drag their feet, or worse, rip out bike lanes and leave riders exposed.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand that repeat speeders are stopped. Do not wait for another child’s name to be written in chalk on the street.</p><p><strong>Act now.

The report states the pedestrian suffered a fatal head injury, with blood pooling on the pavement. She died at the scene. The report explicitly cites 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as a contributing factor, underscoring the driver's responsibility in the crash. 'Glare' is also listed as a contributing factor. The victim was crossing legally, with the light, when she was hit. The SUV was driven by a licensed driver and was occupied by two people at the time. The crash highlights the lethal consequences when drivers fail to yield to pedestrians, even when those pedestrians are following the law.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The report states, 'A Toyota sedan tore through the quiet night, slamming parked cars. A 29-year-old man was ejected and died in the street. Two others lay bleeding beside him, heads crushed.' The driver of the Toyota was unlicensed, as confirmed by the vehicle data: 'driver_license_status: Unlicensed.' Three passengers suffered severe injuries—one killed, two with major head trauma. The report does not list any contributing factors beyond the unlicensed driver. The parked vehicles were struck with enough force to cause fatal and life-altering injuries to the sedan's occupants.

The project, highlighted in Streetsblog NYC, aims to double the number of car-free corridors for children. Deputy Mayor Anuela Ristani and Mayor Erion Veliaj lead the effort, stressing the need to shift street space from cars to people. The official summary states: 'Streets near schools should be for kids, not cars.' Simon Battisti, an urban planner, says school streets 'improve safety where children and parents need it most.' The program adds play spaces, lighting, benches, trees, and stormwater management. Tirana’s leaders call this a legacy of safety and a model for cities worldwide, including New York.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states, 'Traffic signal ignored.' The moped lay twisted in the dark, its rider showing no pulse.

It cites missed legal benchmarks for bike and bus lanes, interference with DOT projects, and the prioritization of car storage over safety. The mayor and his chief adviser, Ingrid Lewis-Martin, are named for derailing safety efforts. The Council failed to renew the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program and weakened the outdoor dining program. Delays on the Queensboro Bridge pedestrian path and flawed bike lane designs left vulnerable road users exposed.

They set speed limits, design roads, control funding. Most choose cars over people. Texas and Georgia rank low. California and Massachusetts push safety. Without state action, deaths rise.

The article, 'States, We Need Your Vision to Get to ‘Zero’,' highlights how state Departments of Transportation shape safety outcomes. Texas and Georgia prioritize fast car travel, leading to more crashes and deaths. California and Massachusetts invest in transit and set design standards for pedestrians and cyclists. The piece states, 'States must lead. Whether it’s lowering speed limits, re-designing roadways to encourage safer speeds, adding speed safety cameras, or other proven safety countermeasures; states are usually loath to make change.' Advocates and local leaders push for accountability. The analysis finds that without state leadership, vulnerable road users remain at risk. States must lower speeds, redesign roads, and fund transit—or let cities act.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
