The stretch is notorious for speeding, crashes, and one recent fatality. The plan adds sidewalk space, bus islands, and closes slip lanes. Some locals protest lost parking.</p><p class=mb3>On June 24, 2024, the NYC Department of Transportation (DOT) announced plans to install protected bike lanes on Seventh Avenue in Dyker Heights, Brooklyn. The project, pitched as a school safety upgrade, will replace painted bike lanes with a two-way protected lane, add sidewalk extensions, and close two slip lanes. DOT cited 110 injury crashes and one fatality in four years along the corridor. The redesign also includes concrete bus boarding islands and pedestrian improvements near schools and hospitals. DOT staffer Alex Ussery said, 'We’ve received some concerns from the community and various elected officials specifically regarding safety around students.' Community board attendees voiced anger over the loss of 28 parking spots, but some residents and advocates praised the safety upgrades, calling them 'desperately needed.' Installation will begin this summer and finish in the fall. No council member directly sponsored or voted on this DOT action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the collision occurred at 13:37 and resulted in a fatal head wound. The report states the driver’s actions included 'Traffic Control Disregarded,' highlighting a failure to obey traffic signals. The taxi’s center front end bore the impact, its nose crumpled from the force. The pedestrian was described as 'crossing against the signal,' but this detail appears only after the driver’s error is cited. The scene was marked by blood on hot concrete and the persistent hum of engines, underscoring the relentless danger faced by those on foot.

The report lists 'Unsafe Speed' as the primary contributing factor for both vehicles involved. The rider, who was helmeted, suffered fatal head injuries after being thrown from the motorcycle. The police report also notes 'Reaction to Uninvolved Vehicle' as a contributing factor. The crash underscores the lethal consequences of excessive speed on New York City’s bridges.

The police narrative describes the crash as sudden and final, with the driver dying alone in his seat. The data does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor; the focus remains on the driver’s loss of consciousness and the resulting collision.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'There Is A Pedestrian Injury and Death Crisis Going On,' highlights 55 pedestrian deaths and more than 4,000 injuries this year. Brooklyn and Queens are most affected. Over 92 percent of injuries come from drivers of cars, trucks, and heavy vehicles. Council members and advocates, including Alexa Sledge of Transportation Alternatives and Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance, called for urgent safety upgrades: raised crosswalks, protected bike lanes, and turn calming. Jon Orcutt, a former DOT official, blamed slow city action, weak enforcement, and bigger vehicles. The cancellation of congestion pricing—expected to cut 100,000 cars a day—removes a key safety measure. The Department of Transportation did not comment. Advocates stress: the crisis is driver-caused, not the fault of cyclists or e-mobility users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The probe, not tied to a specific bill number, follows record-high deaths among vulnerable road users in the U.S. The matter summary states: 'Congress has launched an investigation into whether America's limited vehicle safety standards are driving the rise in deaths of vulnerable road users.' Raskin, citing personal and constituent tragedies, criticized federal agencies for ignoring design flaws like high hoods, large blind zones, and the lack of side-underride guards. He called out regulators for focusing on advanced tech over basic, life-saving design changes. Raskin said, 'Nobody should be killed on our highways and roadways. That should not be some acceptable cost of doing business.'

She listened to wealthy diner owners, not city residents. The move keeps cars flowing, pollution rising, and streets dangerous. Cyclists and pedestrians lose. The city’s most vulnerable pay the price for political theater.</p><p class=mb3>On June 9, 2024, Governor Kathy Hochul canceled New York’s congestion pricing plan. The decision, covered in Streetsblog NYC, bypassed the voices of everyday New Yorkers. Hochul cited feedback from wealthy business owners, not the city’s transit riders or street users. The article quotes Hochul: "That is all I need to know." Council members were not directly involved, but the move drew sharp criticism from advocates and residents. The matter title: 'Cycle of Rage: Hochul’s ‘Diner Diplomacy’ is the Worst Kind of Lie.' The cancellation blocks a policy designed to cut traffic, reduce crashes, and fund transit. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, and bus riders—lose safer streets and cleaner air. The governor’s action protects drivers and business interests, leaving the city’s most exposed at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
