The stretch is notorious for speeding, crashes, and one recent fatality. The plan adds sidewalk space, bus islands, and closes slip lanes. Some locals protest lost parking.</p><p class=mb3>On June 24, 2024, the NYC Department of Transportation (DOT) announced plans to install protected bike lanes on Seventh Avenue in Dyker Heights, Brooklyn. The project, pitched as a school safety upgrade, will replace painted bike lanes with a two-way protected lane, add sidewalk extensions, and close two slip lanes. DOT cited 110 injury crashes and one fatality in four years along the corridor. The redesign also includes concrete bus boarding islands and pedestrian improvements near schools and hospitals. DOT staffer Alex Ussery said, 'We’ve received some concerns from the community and various elected officials specifically regarding safety around students.' Community board attendees voiced anger over the loss of 28 parking spots, but some residents and advocates praised the safety upgrades, calling them 'desperately needed.' Installation will begin this summer and finish in the fall. No council member directly sponsored or voted on this DOT action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He called out regulators for focusing on advanced tech over basic, life-saving design changes. Raskin said, 'Nobody should be killed on our highways and roadways.

The city’s most vulnerable pay the price for political theater.</p><p class=mb3>On June 9, 2024, Governor Kathy Hochul canceled New York’s congestion pricing plan. The decision, covered in Streetsblog NYC, bypassed the voices of everyday New Yorkers. Hochul cited feedback from wealthy business owners, not the city’s transit riders or street users. The article quotes Hochul: "That is all I need to know." Council members were not directly involved, but the move drew sharp criticism from advocates and residents. The matter title: 'Cycle of Rage: Hochul’s ‘Diner Diplomacy’ is the Worst Kind of Lie.' The cancellation blocks a policy designed to cut traffic, reduce crashes, and fund transit. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, and bus riders—lose safer streets and cleaner air. The governor’s action protects drivers and business interests, leaving the city’s most exposed at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
