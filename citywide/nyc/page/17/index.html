The report describes the victim as lying 'broken under the front of a westbound SUV,' with his head struck and body crushed. The collision occurred at 12:33 a.m. The pedestrian was not at an intersection, and there was no crosswalk or stoplight at the location. The vehicle, a 2020 Nissan SUV, was traveling straight ahead when its center front end hit the pedestrian. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified.' The victim was killed by the impact, suffering head and crush injuries. The report does not cite any driver errors or specific contributing factors beyond the absence of intersection controls, nor does it mention any victim behavior as a cause. The focus remains on the lethal interaction between a vulnerable pedestrian and a moving SUV in an unprotected stretch of road.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The contributing factors for both the driver and the pedestrian are listed as 'Unspecified.' The focus remains on the impact and the lethal danger present on this high-speed roadway, where a single misstep or moment of inattention can result in fatal consequences for those outside a vehicle.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The man was crossing the street when a northbound motorcycle, operated by an unlicensed rider, struck him head-on. The report states the impact was to the 'center front end' of the motorcycle, resulting in fatal head injuries to the pedestrian. The police report specifically notes the driver's license status as 'unlicensed,' highlighting a critical driver error. The narrative confirms the rider 'hit him square,' and the man died at the scene. While the report mentions the pedestrian was 'crossing without a signal,' it does not list this as a contributing factor, instead marking both contributing factors as 'unspecified.' The focus remains on the unlicensed operation of the motorcycle and the lethal consequences for a vulnerable road user.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
