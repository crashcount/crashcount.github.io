The report states the pedestrian suffered head trauma and internal bleeding, dying at the scene under the streetlights. The vehicle, a 2022 Mercedes SUV, was traveling straight ahead at the time of the crash. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'unspecified,' offering no further detail on driver behavior, but the impact location and fatal injuries underscore the lethal force of the collision. The pedestrian was at the intersection when struck. No evidence in the report suggests any pedestrian action contributed to the crash.

According to the police report, the collision was caused by 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper.' The 35-year-old motorcycle rider, unlicensed but wearing a helmet, was ejected and suffered fatal crush injuries. The report states the rider was 'dead on scene.' Both trucks, registered in Indiana and driven by licensed New Jersey drivers, sustained no damage and continued westbound. The police narrative describes the motorcycle as 'demolished' and notes the trucks were 'untouched.'

The move came via a pre-taped video titled 'Addressing Affordability and the Cost of Living in New York.' Hochul argued the $15 charge would hurt working- and middle-class families and harm the city’s recovery. Streetsblog NYC fact-checked her claims, noting, 'The state's chief executive trotted out dubious claims about how the charge for drivers to enter Manhattan's central business district would 'undercut' the city's recovery from the pandemic, while giving no specifics about how she planned to raise money for the MTA or reduce the Big Apple's crippling gridlock.' The article points out that drivers are wealthier than transit riders, and congestion pricing would help low-income bus riders. Hochul offered no concrete plan to replace lost MTA funding.

Hochul’s decision, made without legislative action, drew sharp criticism. Jumaane Williams, NYC Public Advocate, warned of 'irreparable harm to the city.' Natasha Elder of NYPIRG said, 'Gov. Hochul's decision to delay congestion pricing tells subway and bus riders they don't rank.' Advocates like the Tri-State Transportation Campaign called for 'bold, strong leadership.'

The impact buckled the taxi’s left side doors. No passengers were present in either vehicle. The narrative states, 'No escape. Just silence where breath once was.' The report does not cite any contributing behaviors from the taxi driver or any other victims. The focus remains on the sudden incapacitation of the SUV driver, which led directly to the collision and fatality.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The proposal, revealed by DOT Director Ted Wright, creates a 'bike boulevard' with two-way protected bike lanes from Steinway Street to Vernon Boulevard. The plan shifts the avenue to one-way car traffic, adds painted pedestrian islands, curb extensions, and may include a car-free plaza. DOT aims to reduce vehicle presence and traffic violence, responding to local advocacy after several high-profile crashes. Residents and organizers, including Alana Herlands and John Surico, voiced strong support: 'We are going to advocate for the most ambitious plan that not only adds more space for the community... but also reduces traffic violence.' Implementation is set for summer and fall, with an extension east to 51st Street planned next year.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The DOT had pledged to convert a car lane into a two-way protected bike path by fall 2023, but the project remains unfinished. The matter centers on the urgent need for safe cycling infrastructure: 'It's a crowded route, people are coming to and from work. It’s necessary to have a lane that is especially for the bikes,' said Cruz Rosas-Ponzon. Advocacy groups, including Transportation Alternatives, and delivery worker organizations highlight the deadly risk for working-class immigrants and deliveristas. DOT spokesman Vin Barone claims progress, but delays persist. The family’s demand is clear: finish the lane, prevent more deaths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident occurred as the man stepped into the street, not at an intersection and without a crossing signal, as detailed in the report: 'A 70-year-old man stepped into the street without a signal. An eastbound SUV struck him head-on. He died from head and internal wounds. The driver held a license. The bumper bore the mark where he fell.' The vehicle involved was a 2023 Acura SUV, traveling straight ahead with two occupants. The point of impact was the center front end, and the right front bumper showed damage. The police report lists 'Unspecified' as the contributing factors for both the driver and the pedestrian, and does not cite any specific driver error. The pedestrian’s action—crossing without a signal or crosswalk—is noted after the absence of identified driver errors. The report does not mention any additional contributing factors or behaviors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bridge remains deadly for the vulnerable.</p><p class=mb3>On May 29, 2024, a hit-and-run driver killed cyclist Zenaido Rosas-Pinzon on the Washington Bridge, which links the Bronx and uptown Manhattan. The Department of Transportation (DOT) had promised a protected bike lane by 2023, but the project remains unfinished, with completion now pushed to summer 2024. The matter centers on the city's failure to deliver: 'DOT promised to install a protected bike lane along the Washington Bridge last year, but the bike lane remains unfinished and the road remains dangerous. ... These repeated delays are killing us,' said Jada Yeboah of Transportation Alternatives. Local advocates and activists expressed anger and heartbreak, blaming the lack of safe infrastructure for the cyclist's death. Cyclists have been forced to share a narrow path with pedestrians or ride in the bus lane, neither designed for their safety. DOT cited 'complexities' and routine road work as reasons for the delay. The bridge was identified for safety upgrades in a 2018 DOT report, but the city failed to act in time.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
