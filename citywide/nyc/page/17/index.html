The report states the motorcyclist was traveling at an unsafe speed before slamming into the SUV, which was carrying five occupants. The impact ejected the motorcyclist from his bike, crushing his chest. He was wearing a helmet, as noted in the report. The narrative details that 'speed and failure to yield left silence in the street.' The police report explicitly lists 'Unsafe Speed' as a contributing factor in the crash. No actions or behaviors by the SUV occupants are cited as contributing factors. The collision left the motorcyclist dead at the scene, while the five SUV occupants survived. The crash underscores the deadly consequences when speed and failure to yield intersect on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), launched a Government Accountability Office (GAO) investigation into vehicle safety standards and their deadly impact on pedestrians and cyclists. The probe, not tied to a specific bill number, follows record-high deaths among vulnerable road users in the U.S. The matter summary states: 'Congress has launched an investigation into whether America's limited vehicle safety standards are driving the rise in deaths of vulnerable road users.' Raskin, citing personal and constituent tragedies, criticized federal agencies for ignoring design flaws like high hoods, large blind zones, and the lack of side-underride guards. He called out regulators for focusing on advanced tech over basic, life-saving design changes. Raskin said, 'Nobody should be killed on our highways and roadways. That should not be some acceptable cost of doing business.' The GAO will examine vehicle design and international safety approaches, aiming to force overdue change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The unlicensed, helmeted rider, 35, was ejected and crushed. The trucks rolled on, untouched. The bike lay shattered. One life ended in the roar and dark.</p><p class=mb3>A deadly crash unfolded on the Cross Bronx Expressway when a 2002 Harley-Davidson motorcycle slid beneath two westbound diesel tractor trucks. According to the police report, the collision was caused by 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper.' The 35-year-old motorcycle rider, unlicensed but wearing a helmet, was ejected and suffered fatal crush injuries. The report states the rider was 'dead on scene.' Both trucks, registered in Indiana and driven by licensed New Jersey drivers, sustained no damage and continued westbound. The police narrative describes the motorcycle as 'demolished' and notes the trucks were 'untouched.' The report highlights improper lane usage as the critical factor, underscoring the lethal consequences when massive trucks and vulnerable riders share high-speed expressways.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The report states the rider was 'ejected' and suffered fatal head injuries after his 'skull met pavement.' The e-scooter was described as 'demolished.' Contributing factors listed in the report include 'Driver Inexperience' and 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper.' The rider held only a permit, not a full license. The box truck was unoccupied and legally parked at the time of the crash. The police report notes the rider was not wearing a helmet, but this detail is mentioned after the driver errors. The crash left blood on the asphalt, underscoring the lethal risks faced by those navigating New York City streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The move came via a pre-taped video titled 'Addressing Affordability and the Cost of Living in New York.' Hochul argued the $15 charge would hurt working- and middle-class families and harm the city’s recovery. Streetsblog NYC fact-checked her claims, noting, 'The state's chief executive trotted out dubious claims about how the charge for drivers to enter Manhattan's central business district would 'undercut' the city's recovery from the pandemic, while giving no specifics about how she planned to raise money for the MTA or reduce the Big Apple's crippling gridlock.' The article points out that drivers are wealthier than transit riders, and congestion pricing would help low-income bus riders. Hochul offered no concrete plan to replace lost MTA funding. The decision leaves the city’s streets and its most vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The policy, passed by the Legislature in 2019, was set to begin within weeks. It would have charged drivers entering Manhattan’s core, raising $1 billion yearly for transit repairs and upgrades. Hochul’s decision, made without legislative action, drew sharp criticism. Jumaane Williams, NYC Public Advocate, warned of 'irreparable harm to the city.' Natasha Elder of NYPIRG said, 'Gov. Hochul's decision to delay congestion pricing tells subway and bus riders they don't rank.' Advocates like the Tri-State Transportation Campaign called for 'bold, strong leadership.' The cancellation leaves the city’s streets jammed and transit funding gutted, with no relief for those most at risk: people on foot, on bikes, and on buses.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article compiles her past statements, where she called the plan 'powerful' and 'transformative.' Hochul said, 'Fewer cars mean less gridlock, traffic and pollution. Fewer cars means safer streets, cleaner air and more room to maneuver for pedestrians and bicyclists.' She also promised $1 billion yearly for transit upgrades. Despite this, Hochul now considers delaying the plan. The piece underscores the gap between her advocacy and current uncertainty. No council bill number or committee applies; this is a public statement. The article centers the impact on vulnerable road users: fewer cars mean safer streets, cleaner air, and more space for those outside vehicles. Hochul’s words set a standard.

The plan, designed to fund transit and reduce car traffic, now sits idle. Advocates and officials, including Reinvent Albany, Carlo Scissura, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, and Sara Lind, condemned the move. Williams warned, 'An indefinite pause on congestion pricing will do irreparable harm to the city while undermining public confidence.' Scissura called it 'a devastating blow' to commuters and workers. Lind slammed the decision as 'wrongheaded.' The delay blocks $15 billion for subways and buses. Streets remain clogged. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, bus riders—face more danger and unreliable service. No safety analyst has formally assessed the impact, but the message is clear: the city’s most at-risk are left behind.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
