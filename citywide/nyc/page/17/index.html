According to the police report, the SUV 'slammed forward in the dark,' with the 'metal folded at the front.' The driver, who was alone in the vehicle and wearing a lap belt and harness, suffered fatal head crush injuries and was found dead behind the wheel. The report notes the driver was 'unlicensed,' a critical systemic failure. No other people were involved or injured in the crash. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified,' but the absence of a valid license stands out as a key driver error. No mention is made of any victim behavior contributing to the crash.

These states, already among the deadliest for walkers, set these targets under federal law, which mandates reporting but not ambition. The report states: 'Seven states have set formal federal goals to increase pedestrian fatalities in 2024.' Heidi Simon of Smart Growth America denounced the move, saying, 'I don't think there's any defensible reason to set targets that show an increase in fatalities.' Simon urges Congress to close the loophole and require states to set declining fatality targets. She highlights that regressive targets send a chilling message and fail to address racial disparities in pedestrian deaths. No council members are named; this is a policy critique and advocacy call.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, pitched as a school safety upgrade, will replace painted bike lanes with a two-way protected lane, add sidewalk extensions, and close two slip lanes. DOT cited 110 injury crashes and one fatality in four years along the corridor. The redesign also includes concrete bus boarding islands and pedestrian improvements near schools and hospitals. DOT staffer Alex Ussery said, 'We’ve received some concerns from the community and various elected officials specifically regarding safety around students.' Community board attendees voiced anger over the loss of 28 parking spots, but some residents and advocates praised the safety upgrades, calling them 'desperately needed.' Installation will begin this summer and finish in the fall.

No actions or behaviors by the SUV occupants are cited as contributing factors. The collision left the motorcyclist dead at the scene, while the five SUV occupants survived. The crash underscores the deadly consequences when speed and failure to yield intersect on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The 34-year-old male driver, riding a 2004 Kawasaki, was unlicensed and traveling eastbound when he was ejected from the vehicle. The report states the helmet cracked upon impact, and the man suffered severe head trauma, dying at the scene. The police report lists 'Driver Inexperience' as a contributing factor, underscoring the systemic danger when unlicensed, inexperienced individuals operate powerful vehicles. No other vehicles or road users were involved. The victim was wearing a helmet, as noted in the report, but this detail follows the primary driver error cited. The crash left the eastbound lane silent, marked by blood and shattered gear.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Rep. Jamie Raskin demanded answers. The probe targets vehicle size, blind zones, and weak safety rules. U.S. deaths keep rising. Regulators have failed to act.</p><p class=mb3>On June 17, 2024, Congress, at the request of Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), launched a Government Accountability Office (GAO) investigation into vehicle safety standards and their deadly impact on pedestrians and cyclists. The probe, not tied to a specific bill number, follows record-high deaths among vulnerable road users in the U.S. The matter summary states: 'Congress has launched an investigation into whether America's limited vehicle safety standards are driving the rise in deaths of vulnerable road users.' Raskin, citing personal and constituent tragedies, criticized federal agencies for ignoring design flaws like high hoods, large blind zones, and the lack of side-underride guards. He called out regulators for focusing on advanced tech over basic, life-saving design changes. Raskin said, 'Nobody should be killed on our highways and roadways. That should not be some acceptable cost of doing business.' The GAO will examine vehicle design and international safety approaches, aiming to force overdue change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crash occurred at 23:06. A 48-year-old woman, riding as a rear passenger, was ejected and suffered fatal head injuries after striking the pavement. The police report states she was 'unconscious' and 'lifeless beneath the streetlights.' The report cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor, highlighting a failure by the e-bike operator to remain alert. No helmet was worn by the victim, but this detail is mentioned only after the driver error. The report makes clear that the crash’s deadly outcome stemmed from the e-bike driver’s lack of attention, not the actions of the passenger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
