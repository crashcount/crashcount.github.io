The project, pitched as a school safety upgrade, will replace painted bike lanes with a two-way protected lane, add sidewalk extensions, and close two slip lanes. DOT cited 110 injury crashes and one fatality in four years along the corridor. The redesign also includes concrete bus boarding islands and pedestrian improvements near schools and hospitals. DOT staffer Alex Ussery said, 'We’ve received some concerns from the community and various elected officials specifically regarding safety around students.' Community board attendees voiced anger over the loss of 28 parking spots, but some residents and advocates praised the safety upgrades, calling them 'desperately needed.' Installation will begin this summer and finish in the fall. No council member directly sponsored or voted on this DOT action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the collision occurred at 13:37 and resulted in a fatal head wound. The report states the driver’s actions included 'Traffic Control Disregarded,' highlighting a failure to obey traffic signals. The taxi’s center front end bore the impact, its nose crumpled from the force. The pedestrian was described as 'crossing against the signal,' but this detail appears only after the driver’s error is cited. The scene was marked by blood on hot concrete and the persistent hum of engines, underscoring the relentless danger faced by those on foot.

Over 92 percent of injuries come from drivers of cars, trucks, and heavy vehicles. Council members and advocates, including Alexa Sledge of Transportation Alternatives and Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance, called for urgent safety upgrades: raised crosswalks, protected bike lanes, and turn calming. Jon Orcutt, a former DOT official, blamed slow city action, weak enforcement, and bigger vehicles. The cancellation of congestion pricing—expected to cut 100,000 cars a day—removes a key safety measure. The Department of Transportation did not comment.

Raskin, citing personal and constituent tragedies, criticized federal agencies for ignoring design flaws like high hoods, large blind zones, and the lack of side-underride guards. He called out regulators for focusing on advanced tech over basic, life-saving design changes. Raskin said, 'Nobody should be killed on our highways and roadways.
