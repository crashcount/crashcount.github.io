A black SUV hit him. He died on the street. The driver stayed. Police said, &ldquo;They were walking, he was crossing the street with his sister&rdquo; (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>police said</a>). No arrest. The street is still open. The danger is still there.</p><p>The day before, in the Bronx, a man ran a red light. His car jumped the curb and crushed three people on the sidewalk. One is still fighting for life. The driver ran but police caught him. He faces charges for assault, fleeing, and driving without a license (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/driver-flees-bronx-car-stop-crash/>faces charges</a>).</p><p><strong>In the last 12 months, 244 people have died on New York City streets. 713 were seriously hurt.</strong> Thirteen of the dead were children. The city logs over 81,000 crashes a year. Each number is a name, a family, a future gone.</p><h3 id=the-policy-that-wasnt>The Policy That Wasn&rsquo;t</h3><p>Leaders talk. Streets stay the same. The mayor ripped out a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue after crashes involving children. He said he was listening to the community. Cyclists said, &ldquo;I don’t think he cares if we die&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/cyclists-fuming-over-mayor-adamss-removal-of-bedford-avenue-protected-bike-lane>Cyclists said</a>). The city put back paint. Paint does not stop cars.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Department of Transportation built a new protected bike lane in Queens. A commuter said, &ldquo;The old street was very dangerous&mldr; the new path is definitely safer because he&rsquo;s no longer competing with trucks and cars for road space&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/27/eyes-on-the-street-new-bike-lane-puts-the-bliss-in-blissville>A commuter said</a>). But these changes come slow. Too slow for the dead.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-that-dont-lie>The Numbers That Don&rsquo;t Lie</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks killed 299 people.</strong> Motorcycles and mopeds killed 21. Bikes killed 11. The city counts 182,570 injuries since 2022. The bodies pile up. The city debates.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call your council member. Call the mayor.

No one is safe.</p><p class=mb3>On May 17, 2022, federal officials released a report showing a double-digit percentage increase in U.S. road fatalities for 2021, the highest since 2005. The summary states, '42,915 people dying in motor vehicle crashes—the most since 2005.' Deaths rose on all road types, especially in cities, with pedestrians and cyclists suffering the most. U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg responded, 'Zero is the only acceptable number of deaths and serious injuries on our roadways.' Advocates like Beth Osborne and Corinne Kisner called out dangerous road designs and large vehicles as key threats. The Biden Administration and U.S. DOT pledged a 'Safe System' and Vision Zero approach, promising infrastructure fixes and safety grants. The National Association of City Transportation Officials stressed the power of small, targeted interventions—sidewalks, curb extensions, raised crosswalks. The report makes clear: the system, not just drivers, is killing people.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It is a failure.</p><p class=mb3>This advocacy opinion, published May 12, 2022, calls for the extension of the Houston Street protected bike lane from the East River to Hudson River Park. The article, titled 'Extend the Houston Street Bike Lane from River to River,' highlights the deadly design of Houston Street—six lanes for cars, no safe space for cyclists or pedestrians. The author urges the Department of Transportation to extend both the Houston and Delancey Street bike lanes, citing the Streets Master Plan mandate. The piece names recent victims, including delivery worker Borkot Ullah and NYU student Raife Milligan, killed on Houston by reckless driving. The opinion stresses that the current street design is a choice—one that endangers children, seniors, and everyone crossing Houston.
