The 63-year-old box truck driver died, his body crushed by the force of the collision. According to the police report, 'A box truck plowed into a stopped tractor-trailer. The 63-year-old driver died behind the wheel, crushed by steel and speed.' The report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor. The tractor-trailer was stopped in traffic when the box truck, traveling straight, hit its rear. No other injuries were reported. The data shows distraction at the wheel led to the fatal impact.

Drivers strike them in crosswalks. City leaders promise action, but streets stay deadly. Crashes and injuries spike near schools, especially in poor and Black neighborhoods. City fixes are weak. Kids remain at risk.</p><p class=mb3>This report, published May 24, 2022, exposes the city’s failure to protect children near schools. The investigation finds, “streets near schools are uniquely dangerous, with rates of crashes and injuries that exceed city averages, particularly near schools where most students are poor or children of color.” No council bill is cited, but the critique targets the Department of Transportation and NYPD for inadequate redesigns and chronic understaffing of crossing guards. Community leaders like Wilfredo Florentino call the situation “absolutely unacceptable.” Charles T. Brown demands more investment in Black, brown, and low-income communities. The article documents that city interventions—speed cameras, crossing guards, minor redesigns—fall short. The safety impact is clear: children, especially in marginalized neighborhoods, face daily danger from traffic. The city’s response is insufficient. Systemic change is needed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The summary states, '42,915 people dying in motor vehicle crashes—the most since 2005.' Deaths rose on all road types, especially in cities, with pedestrians and cyclists suffering the most. U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg responded, 'Zero is the only acceptable number of deaths and serious injuries on our roadways.' Advocates like Beth Osborne and Corinne Kisner called out dangerous road designs and large vehicles as key threats. The Biden Administration and U.S. DOT pledged a 'Safe System' and Vision Zero approach, promising infrastructure fixes and safety grants. The National Association of City Transportation Officials stressed the power of small, targeted interventions—sidewalks, curb extensions, raised crosswalks.
