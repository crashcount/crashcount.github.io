The 63-year-old box truck driver died, his body crushed by the force of the collision. According to the police report, 'A box truck plowed into a stopped tractor-trailer. The 63-year-old driver died behind the wheel, crushed by steel and speed.' The report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor. The tractor-trailer was stopped in traffic when the box truck, traveling straight, hit its rear. No other injuries were reported. The data shows distraction at the wheel led to the fatal impact.

The investigation finds, “streets near schools are uniquely dangerous, with rates of crashes and injuries that exceed city averages, particularly near schools where most students are poor or children of color.” No council bill is cited, but the critique targets the Department of Transportation and NYPD for inadequate redesigns and chronic understaffing of crossing guards. Community leaders like Wilfredo Florentino call the situation “absolutely unacceptable.” Charles T. Brown demands more investment in Black, brown, and low-income communities. The article documents that city interventions—speed cameras, crossing guards, minor redesigns—fall short. The safety impact is clear: children, especially in marginalized neighborhoods, face daily danger from traffic. The city’s response is insufficient.

Advocates and officials push Albany to let the city run cameras all day, every day. The state stalls. Lives hang in the balance. The data is clear. Action lags.</p><p class=mb3>Senate Bill 5602, still pending in Albany, would let New York City control and expand speed camera enforcement to 24/7. The Transportation Alternatives report, 'Speeding Doesn’t Sleep,' warns that 59 percent of city road deaths occur when cameras are off. The report urges full-time operation, noting cameras cut speeding by 72 percent where installed. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez calls passage 'very important.' Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Governor Hochul support local control. Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives says, 'We need Albany to allow New York City to operate speed safety cameras 24/7 so every neighborhood is protected from speeding drivers every hour of the day, every day of the week.' Despite strong public support, the legislature has not acted. The evidence is stark: when cameras are off, people die.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
