He said, “There's more work that we have to continue doing,” and called addressing racial disparities in street safety his 'top priority.' Rodriguez supports restricting cars on school streets during arrival and departure and is open to any tool to protect children. He announced a new plan for safe routes to school. Rodriguez’s comments followed a Streetsblog investigation showing higher crash rates near schools, especially those serving poor children and children of color. He emphasized the personal stakes, noting his own daughters walk city streets.

The article identifies four main culprits: lack of sidewalks, dangerous arterials, structural racism, and the rise of large vehicles like SUVs and pickups. Pam Shadel Fischer of the Governors Highway Safety Association calls the toll 'shocking' and urges immediate sidewalk inventories and community reporting. The piece stresses that over two-thirds of deaths happened where walkers had no protection. Communities of color bear the brunt. Experts call for sidewalk upgrades, road redesign, vehicle regulation, and better data. The message is blunt: systemic failures kill.

The investigation finds, “streets near schools are uniquely dangerous, with rates of crashes and injuries that exceed city averages, particularly near schools where most students are poor or children of color.” No council bill is cited, but the critique targets the Department of Transportation and NYPD for inadequate redesigns and chronic understaffing of crossing guards. Community leaders like Wilfredo Florentino call the situation “absolutely unacceptable.” Charles T. Brown demands more investment in Black, brown, and low-income communities.

Six lanes of speeding cars, no safe path for cyclists. Advocates demand a protected bike lane from river to river. Delancey too. Kids, seniors, workers—all at risk. Death is not a feature. It is a failure.</p><p class=mb3>This advocacy opinion, published May 12, 2022, calls for the extension of the Houston Street protected bike lane from the East River to Hudson River Park. The article, titled 'Extend the Houston Street Bike Lane from River to River,' highlights the deadly design of Houston Street—six lanes for cars, no safe space for cyclists or pedestrians. The author urges the Department of Transportation to extend both the Houston and Delancey Street bike lanes, citing the Streets Master Plan mandate. The piece names recent victims, including delivery worker Borkot Ullah and NYU student Raife Milligan, killed on Houston by reckless driving. The opinion stresses that the current street design is a choice—one that endangers children, seniors, and everyone crossing Houston. Advocates demand physical infrastructure, not empty promises, to end the daily toll.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
