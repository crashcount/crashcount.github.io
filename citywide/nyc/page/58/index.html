The article identifies four main culprits: lack of sidewalks, dangerous arterials, structural racism, and the rise of large vehicles like SUVs and pickups. Pam Shadel Fischer of the Governors Highway Safety Association calls the toll 'shocking' and urges immediate sidewalk inventories and community reporting. The piece stresses that over two-thirds of deaths happened where walkers had no protection. Communities of color bear the brunt. Experts call for sidewalk upgrades, road redesign, vehicle regulation, and better data. The message is blunt: systemic failures kill. The time for action is now.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The 63-year-old box truck driver died, his body crushed by the force of the collision. According to the police report, 'A box truck plowed into a stopped tractor-trailer. The 63-year-old driver died behind the wheel, crushed by steel and speed.' The report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor. The tractor-trailer was stopped in traffic when the box truck, traveling straight, hit its rear. No other injuries were reported. The data shows distraction at the wheel led to the fatal impact.

The investigation finds, “streets near schools are uniquely dangerous, with rates of crashes and injuries that exceed city averages, particularly near schools where most students are poor or children of color.” No council bill is cited, but the critique targets the Department of Transportation and NYPD for inadequate redesigns and chronic understaffing of crossing guards. Community leaders like Wilfredo Florentino call the situation “absolutely unacceptable.” Charles T. Brown demands more investment in Black, brown, and low-income communities. The article documents that city interventions—speed cameras, crossing guards, minor redesigns—fall short. The safety impact is clear: children, especially in marginalized neighborhoods, face daily danger from traffic. The city’s response is insufficient.
