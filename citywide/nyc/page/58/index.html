The article identifies four main culprits: lack of sidewalks, dangerous arterials, structural racism, and the rise of large vehicles like SUVs and pickups. Pam Shadel Fischer of the Governors Highway Safety Association calls the toll 'shocking' and urges immediate sidewalk inventories and community reporting. The piece stresses that over two-thirds of deaths happened where walkers had no protection. Communities of color bear the brunt. Experts call for sidewalk upgrades, road redesign, vehicle regulation, and better data. The message is blunt: systemic failures kill.

The tractor-trailer was stopped in traffic when the box truck, traveling straight, hit its rear. No other injuries were reported. The data shows distraction at the wheel led to the fatal impact.

The investigation finds, “streets near schools are uniquely dangerous, with rates of crashes and injuries that exceed city averages, particularly near schools where most students are poor or children of color.” No council bill is cited, but the critique targets the Department of Transportation and NYPD for inadequate redesigns and chronic understaffing of crossing guards. Community leaders like Wilfredo Florentino call the situation “absolutely unacceptable.” Charles T. Brown demands more investment in Black, brown, and low-income communities. The article documents that city interventions—speed cameras, crossing guards, minor redesigns—fall short. The safety impact is clear: children, especially in marginalized neighborhoods, face daily danger from traffic. The city’s response is insufficient.

The report lists 'Passing Too Closely' as the contributing factor. The victim was not wearing a seatbelt, but the primary error cited is the Chrysler driver's unsafe passing. No pedestrians or cyclists were involved.

The Transportation Alternatives report, 'Speeding Doesn’t Sleep,' warns that 59 percent of city road deaths occur when cameras are off. The report urges full-time operation, noting cameras cut speeding by 72 percent where installed. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez calls passage 'very important.' Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Governor Hochul support local control. Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives says, 'We need Albany to allow New York City to operate speed safety cameras 24/7 so every neighborhood is protected from speeding drivers every hour of the day, every day of the week.' Despite strong public support, the legislature has not acted. The evidence is stark: when cameras are off, people die.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
