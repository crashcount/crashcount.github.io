The dead include children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians. The city keeps count, but the numbers do not bleed. A 17-year-old boy died in Brooklyn last week, thrown from a moped after a car turned left in front of him. His passenger, 14, left unconscious in the street. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/teen-boy-dead-man-critically-injured-in-moped-crash-in-brooklyn/>Jhoan later died at the hospital.</a> The driver stayed.

But the pace is slow. The city removed a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue. Cyclists <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/cyclists-fuming-over-mayor-adamss-removal-of-bedford-avenue-protected-bike-lane>asked</a>, &ldquo;What the fuck!

The article identifies four main culprits: lack of sidewalks, dangerous arterials, structural racism, and the rise of large vehicles like SUVs and pickups. Pam Shadel Fischer of the Governors Highway Safety Association calls the toll 'shocking' and urges immediate sidewalk inventories and community reporting. The piece stresses that over two-thirds of deaths happened where walkers had no protection. Communities of color bear the brunt.

Six lanes of speeding cars, no safe path for cyclists. Advocates demand a protected bike lane from river to river. Delancey too. Kids, seniors, workers—all at risk. Death is not a feature. It is a failure.</p><p class=mb3>This advocacy opinion, published May 12, 2022, calls for the extension of the Houston Street protected bike lane from the East River to Hudson River Park. The article, titled 'Extend the Houston Street Bike Lane from River to River,' highlights the deadly design of Houston Street—six lanes for cars, no safe space for cyclists or pedestrians. The author urges the Department of Transportation to extend both the Houston and Delancey Street bike lanes, citing the Streets Master Plan mandate. The piece names recent victims, including delivery worker Borkot Ullah and NYU student Raife Milligan, killed on Houston by reckless driving. The opinion stresses that the current street design is a choice—one that endangers children, seniors, and everyone crossing Houston. Advocates demand physical infrastructure, not empty promises, to end the daily toll.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Action lags.</p><p class=mb3>Senate Bill 5602, still pending in Albany, would let New York City control and expand speed camera enforcement to 24/7. The Transportation Alternatives report, 'Speeding Doesn’t Sleep,' warns that 59 percent of city road deaths occur when cameras are off. The report urges full-time operation, noting cameras cut speeding by 72 percent where installed. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez calls passage 'very important.' Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Governor Hochul support local control. Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives says, 'We need Albany to allow New York City to operate speed safety cameras 24/7 so every neighborhood is protected from speeding drivers every hour of the day, every day of the week.' Despite strong public support, the legislature has not acted. The evidence is stark: when cameras are off, people die.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
