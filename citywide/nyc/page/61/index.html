Children, elders, cyclists, and workers are struck down in the crosswalk, on the sidewalk, waiting for the light. The city keeps moving. The blood dries. The next crash comes.</p><p>Just days ago, an eight-year-old boy was killed by an SUV in Crown Heights. The street was wide, the car was heavy, the child was small. The city called it another tragedy. Advocates called it what it is: a failure. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/01/tuesdays-headlines-another-child-sacrificed-to-the-suv-edition>Eastern Parkway acts as a major thoroughfare for drivers, and is the sixth most dangerous street in Brooklyn for pedestrians</a>, said one group, demanding more safety infrastructure to stop the killing.</p><h2 id=policy-progress-and-sabotage>Policy: Progress and Sabotage</h2><p><strong>Some leaders move.

Still, the city tries to erase protection for the most vulnerable. On Review Avenue, a new protected bike lane opened after years of struggle. Cyclists now have a sliver of safety. &ldquo;The old street was very dangerous,&rdquo; said a daily rider. The new path is <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/27/eyes-on-the-street-new-bike-lane-puts-the-bliss-in-blissville>definitely safer because he no longer fights trucks for space</a>.</p><p>But for every step forward, another is lost. The mayor removes bike lanes. The council debates. Children die. The city counts bodies.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> Since 2022, they have caused 301 deaths and over 26,000 injuries to pedestrians and cyclists. Trucks and buses killed 93. Motorcycles and mopeds killed 10. Bikes killed 11. The numbers are cold. The pain is not.</p><h2 id=what-now-demand-action>What Now: Demand Action</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every death is preventable. The city has the power to lower speed limits, build real protection, and stop repeat offenders. <strong>Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph limit. Demand protected lanes. Demand enforcement that targets the real danger—drivers, not cyclists or children.</strong></p><p>The city will not save you. Only your voice, raised with others, can force their hand.

Blind spots, tall hoods, and thick pillars block sightlines. Federal rules ignore these dangers. The bigger the car, the deadlier the risk. Vulnerable lives pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On March 17, 2022, a research report from the Insurance Institute of Highway Safety revealed that SUV and pickup drivers are three to four times more likely to hit a pedestrian while turning than drivers of smaller cars. The study, titled 'Study: Megacar Drivers Up to 4x More Likely to Hit Walkers While Turning,' points to design flaws—especially wide A-pillars and high, boxy fronts—that create deadly blind spots. Dr. Wen Hu, senior transportation research engineer, said, 'We really need to systematically study the impact of A-pillar design on pedestrian visibility.' The report calls out federal regulators for failing to address these hazards. It urges action on vehicle design, left-turn bans in pedestrian areas, and right-on-red bans. The evidence is clear: megacars endanger walkers at every turn.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cops park on sidewalks, block ramps, erase bike lanes. Streets turn chaotic. Crash rates soar. Pedestrians, cyclists, wheelchair users face daily risk. The NYPD ignores safety, fueling danger for all who walk or ride.</p><p class=mb3>This media report, published March 7, 2022, by Streetsblog NYC, exposes the dangers caused by NYPD precinct parking practices. The annual 'March (Parking) Madness' tournament highlights how 16 precincts compete for the title of 'Worst Neighbor.' The article states: 'cops commandeer all the parking and leave their personal cars wherever they want, often blocking pedestrian ramps, bus lanes, bus stops, and bike lanes.' No council member is directly involved, but the report draws on public polling and crash data. Crash rates on precinct blocks are up to 232% higher than adjacent blocks, with protected bike lanes vanishing near stationhouses. The chaos is not just unsightly—it creates real, illegal danger for pedestrians, cyclists, and wheelchair users. Solutions like placard reform and residency requirements are suggested, but NYPD action remains lacking.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

New limits take effect after signs go up.</p><p class=mb3>On March 7, 2022, Mayor Eric Garcetti signed an ordinance reducing speed limits on 177 miles of Los Angeles streets. The measure, approved by the City Council Transportation Committee and full Council in February, follows the passage of State Assemblymember Laura Friedman's A.B. 43, which lets cities set safer speed limits. The ordinance states: 'Today, Mayor Garcetti signs Council File action to reduce speed limits in certain streets of Los Angeles.' Councilmembers Mike Bonin and Paul Koretz, along with Friedman, led the push. Garcetti said, 'Far too many Angelenos die in traffic collisions... [which] kill disproportionately in low income, Black, and Latinx communities.' LADOT General Manager Seleta Reynolds promised the new limits will be in place by June. The law aims to slow cars and protect people on foot, bike, and transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, a 2022 Honda sedan was changing lanes unsafely when it struck hard, crumpling metal and ending two lives. Both victims were inside the vehicle, one driving, one in the front passenger seat. The report lists 'Unsafe Lane Changing' as the primary contributing factor. The driver was not wearing safety equipment; the passenger wore a lap belt and harness. No other vehicles or road users were involved. The crash underscores the lethal risk of unsafe lane changes, as documented in the official report.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
