No council member is directly involved, but the report draws on public polling and crash data. Crash rates on precinct blocks are up to 232% higher than adjacent blocks, with protected bike lanes vanishing near stationhouses.

According to the police report, a box truck making a left turn collided with an e-scooter traveling straight. The e-scooter rider, a 32-year-old man, was ejected and suffered fatal head injuries. The report lists 'View Obstructed/Limited' and 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' as contributing factors. The truck’s left turn and the limited visibility played a role in the crash. The e-scooter rider was not wearing a helmet, as noted in the report, but the primary causes remain driver error and systemic hazards. The crash left one man dead and exposed the dangers faced by those outside steel and glass.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

No answers given.</p><p class=mb3>On February 28, 2022, city agencies responded to the death of Lin Wen-Chiang, 77, who was killed after his bike struck a caved-in section of 40th Drive in Elmhurst, Queens. The matter, titled 'City Covers Up Failure After Cyclist Death, With Hastily Made Repairs After Months of 311 Complaints,' details how residents filed at least eight 311 complaints to the Department of Transportation and 14 to the Department of Environmental Protection since 2019. Both agencies failed to fix the hazard. Only after Wen-Chiang’s death did city workers patch the road, but the repair was rushed and left uneven, creating a new danger. DOT spokesman Vin Barone called it 'a tragedy' and said an investigation is underway. DEP claimed the subsurface infrastructure was sound. No council members are named. The city’s neglect cost a life and left the street unsafe for cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
