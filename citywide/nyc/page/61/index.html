The study, titled 'Study: Megacar Drivers Up to 4x More Likely to Hit Walkers While Turning,' points to design flaws—especially wide A-pillars and high, boxy fronts—that create deadly blind spots. Dr. Wen Hu, senior transportation research engineer, said, 'We really need to systematically study the impact of A-pillar design on pedestrian visibility.' The report calls out federal regulators for failing to address these hazards. It urges action on vehicle design, left-turn bans in pedestrian areas, and right-on-red bans.

The annual 'March (Parking) Madness' tournament highlights how 16 precincts compete for the title of 'Worst Neighbor.' The article states: 'cops commandeer all the parking and leave their personal cars wherever they want, often blocking pedestrian ramps, bus lanes, bus stops, and bike lanes.' No council member is directly involved, but the report draws on public polling and crash data. Crash rates on precinct blocks are up to 232% higher than adjacent blocks, with protected bike lanes vanishing near stationhouses. The chaos is not just unsightly—it creates real, illegal danger for pedestrians, cyclists, and wheelchair users. Solutions like placard reform and residency requirements are suggested, but NYPD action remains lacking.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, approved by the City Council Transportation Committee and full Council in February, follows the passage of State Assemblymember Laura Friedman's A.B. 43, which lets cities set safer speed limits. The ordinance states: 'Today, Mayor Garcetti signs Council File action to reduce speed limits in certain streets of Los Angeles.' Councilmembers Mike Bonin and Paul Koretz, along with Friedman, led the push. Garcetti said, 'Far too many Angelenos die in traffic collisions... [which] kill disproportionately in low income, Black, and Latinx communities.' LADOT General Manager Seleta Reynolds promised the new limits will be in place by June. The law aims to slow cars and protect people on foot, bike, and transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
