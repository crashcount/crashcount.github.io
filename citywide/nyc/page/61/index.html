The annual 'March (Parking) Madness' tournament highlights how 16 precincts compete for the title of 'Worst Neighbor.' The article states: 'cops commandeer all the parking and leave their personal cars wherever they want, often blocking pedestrian ramps, bus lanes, bus stops, and bike lanes.' No council member is directly involved, but the report draws on public polling and crash data. Crash rates on precinct blocks are up to 232% higher than adjacent blocks, with protected bike lanes vanishing near stationhouses. The chaos is not just unsightly—it creates real, illegal danger for pedestrians, cyclists, and wheelchair users. Solutions like placard reform and residency requirements are suggested, but NYPD action remains lacking.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, approved by the City Council Transportation Committee and full Council in February, follows the passage of State Assemblymember Laura Friedman's A.B. 43, which lets cities set safer speed limits. The ordinance states: 'Today, Mayor Garcetti signs Council File action to reduce speed limits in certain streets of Los Angeles.' Councilmembers Mike Bonin and Paul Koretz, along with Friedman, led the push. Garcetti said, 'Far too many Angelenos die in traffic collisions... [which] kill disproportionately in low income, Black, and Latinx communities.' LADOT General Manager Seleta Reynolds promised the new limits will be in place by June.

The move comes after a reckless driver killed a baby and injured her mother. Officials and neighbors pushed for this change. Cars lose space. Pedestrians gain safety.</p><p class=mb3>On February 22, 2022, DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez confirmed the conversion of Gates Avenue’s stub end into 'Apolline's Garden,' a pedestrian plaza. The announcement followed a virtual Vanderbilt Avenue Block Association meeting. The plaza honors Apolline Mong-Guillemin, a 3-month-old killed by a wrong-way driver on September 11, 2021. Rodriguez stated, 'Traffic violence is a solvable crisis and I'm committed to carrying out Mayor's Adams's safety vision [by] expanding pedestrian plazas and open streets.' Assembly Member Rodneyse Bichotte called for unity, saying, 'There is no doubt that the creation of Apolline's Garden is the appropriate answer to honor the short life of this 3-month-old baby.' The plan aligns with the NYC 25X25 initiative to reclaim street space for pedestrians and cyclists. Community leaders and officials support the plaza as a step to prevent future tragedy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
