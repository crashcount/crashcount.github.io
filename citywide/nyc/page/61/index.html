Pedestrians gain safety.</p><p class=mb3>On February 22, 2022, DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez confirmed the conversion of Gates Avenue’s stub end into 'Apolline's Garden,' a pedestrian plaza. The announcement followed a virtual Vanderbilt Avenue Block Association meeting. The plaza honors Apolline Mong-Guillemin, a 3-month-old killed by a wrong-way driver on September 11, 2021. Rodriguez stated, 'Traffic violence is a solvable crisis and I'm committed to carrying out Mayor's Adams's safety vision [by] expanding pedestrian plazas and open streets.' Assembly Member Rodneyse Bichotte called for unity, saying, 'There is no doubt that the creation of Apolline's Garden is the appropriate answer to honor the short life of this 3-month-old baby.' The plan aligns with the NYC 25X25 initiative to reclaim street space for pedestrians and cyclists. Community leaders and officials support the plaza as a step to prevent future tragedy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The program, weakened by the de Blasio administration, only requires a safety course after 15 speeding or five red-light tickets. Jack Mikulincer’s killer had 10 school-zone speeding and four red-light tickets, yet faced no intervention. The original bill, drafted by then-Council Member Brad Lander, would have triggered action after five speeding tickets, but the threshold was raised. Lander, Marco Conner DiAquoi, Harris, and Cory Epstein all condemned the diluted law. Lander said, “It remains urgent now to strengthen the program.” Advocates demand the city lower thresholds and enforce real accountability to protect vulnerable New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
