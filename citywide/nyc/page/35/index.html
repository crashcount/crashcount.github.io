The campaign supports a stronger pedestrian safety rating system, automatic emergency braking that detects all road users, and side underride guards for trucks. It opposes the current NHTSA proposals, which allow dangerous vehicles to pass with top ratings and exclude cyclists from detection requirements.

The city’s timid plan leaves lives at risk.</p><p class=mb3>This opinion, published July 5, 2023, urges the city to go beyond the current Crosstown Bike Lane proposal. The piece highlights the lack of east-west protected bike lanes between 55th and 158th streets, except for two blocks. It quotes: 'A proposal for crosstown bike paths on the Upper West and East sides has potential to close that gap—but should go further by significantly reducing the presence of cars on the arterial transverses cutting across Central Park.' The author criticizes Community Boards 7 and 8 for only requesting lanes every ten blocks, calling this inadequate. The editorial calls for more frequent, concrete-protected bike lanes, expanded pedestrian space, and bus lanes. It demands car bans on select park transverses, citing the death of Carling Mott and widespread resident dissatisfaction. The call is clear: timid measures leave vulnerable road users exposed. Only bold action will save lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Her ‘Street Code’ puts pedestrians first. Sidewalks widen. Parking vanishes. School streets grow. SUVs face higher fees. E-bikes stay. Cars lose ground. Advocates urge New York to follow Paris’s bold lead.</p><p class=mb3>On June 30, 2023, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo announced a sweeping policy shift, introducing a new 'Street Code' that gives 'absolute priority for pedestrians.' The plan, detailed in committee and public remarks, promises to eliminate 70,000 surface parking spaces by 2026, daylight all intersections, and create 300 school streets. Hidalgo declared, 'We must protect pedestrians first.' The policy bans shared e-scooters but keeps private ones legal, expands bike infrastructure, and introduces progressive parking fees for SUVs. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives contrasted Paris’s action with New York’s inaction, noting, 'The number one danger to pedestrians is cars and trucks.' Advocates say Paris’s approach—shrinking car space, not blaming micromobility—shows how cities can save lives by putting vulnerable road users first.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
