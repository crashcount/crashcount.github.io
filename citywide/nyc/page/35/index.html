Advocates demand more: frequent protected lanes, concrete barriers, car bans on park transverses. Cyclists and pedestrians face daily danger. The city’s timid plan leaves lives at risk.</p><p class=mb3>This opinion, published July 5, 2023, urges the city to go beyond the current Crosstown Bike Lane proposal. The piece highlights the lack of east-west protected bike lanes between 55th and 158th streets, except for two blocks. It quotes: 'A proposal for crosstown bike paths on the Upper West and East sides has potential to close that gap—but should go further by significantly reducing the presence of cars on the arterial transverses cutting across Central Park.' The author criticizes Community Boards 7 and 8 for only requesting lanes every ten blocks, calling this inadequate. The editorial calls for more frequent, concrete-protected bike lanes, expanded pedestrian space, and bus lanes. It demands car bans on select park transverses, citing the death of Carling Mott and widespread resident dissatisfaction. The call is clear: timid measures leave vulnerable road users exposed. Only bold action will save lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, detailed in committee and public remarks, promises to eliminate 70,000 surface parking spaces by 2026, daylight all intersections, and create 300 school streets. Hidalgo declared, 'We must protect pedestrians first.' The policy bans shared e-scooters but keeps private ones legal, expands bike infrastructure, and introduces progressive parking fees for SUVs. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives contrasted Paris’s action with New York’s inaction, noting, 'The number one danger to pedestrians is cars and trucks.'

Danger grows at every corner.</p><p class=mb3>On June 26, 2023, Heather Beers-Dimitriadis, Chair of Queens Community Board 6, published an opinion blasting Mayor Adams’s decision to cut 500 crossing guard positions. The statement, titled 'Opinion: Mayor Adams’s Crossing Guard Cuts are Unconscionable,' highlights the urgent need for crossing guards, especially near busy roads and highways. Beers-Dimitriadis writes, 'The one thing we can't do is cut headcount without a workable plan to ensure that our students get to and from school safely.' She recounts years of unmet requests for more guards and points to a 2013 tragedy where a child was killed near school. The statement accuses the administration of lacking data, facts, and a plan to protect children, noting, 'By failing to release a plan that ensures that our children get to and from school unharmed, Adams has, in a sense, removed school-aged children from the Vision Zero policy.' The timing is dire: pedestrian and cyclist deaths are up.

Cyclists voiced concern over the removal of existing markings before the new lane is installed, urging better DOT communication. The project is part of the city's legal mandate to build 50 miles of protected bike lanes in 2023.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

At least 7,508 people on foot died. The toll is the highest in 41 years. Wide, fast roads and big vehicles fueled the carnage. Officials call for urgent change. Pleas to drivers are not enough.</p><p class=mb3>A June 22, 2023 report from the Governors Highway Safety Association revealed that pedestrian deaths in the U.S. reached 7,508 in 2022—the highest in four decades. The report, covered by Streetsblog NYC, states: 'Pedestrian deaths in the United States climbed once again in 2022, reaching their highest point in 41 years.' Safety analyst Pam Shadel Fischer called for a 'kitchen sink approach,' stressing road design, public education, and equitable enforcement. She warned, 'the onus is really on drivers to be on the lookout for people on foot.' The report blames wide arterials, large vehicles, and dark conditions for the spike. Officials admit that asking drivers to be careful is not enough. Federal regulators are considering new rules, but advocates say more must be done to protect those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
