Cars block ramps, endanger walkers, and hide danger. Advocates cheer. The city will hold a hearing. The change restores sight lines and puts people before parking.</p><p class=mb3>On July 27, 2023, the Department of Transportation (DOT) proposed a rule change to close a 2009 loophole that allowed drivers to park in unmarked crosswalks at T-intersections. The proposal, not yet finalized, will be discussed at a virtual hearing in early September. The matter summary states: 'The city wants to reverse a 2009 policy that allows drivers to park in unmarked crosswalks at T-intersections, undoing a decade-and-a-half giveaway to drivers that blocked pedestrian access and made streets less safe.' Former Council Member Vincent Gentile pushed for the original exemption, arguing it would create parking and increase safety. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno said, 'This proposed change will enhance safety and accessibility for pedestrians.' Disability and street safety advocates, including Jean Ryan, praised the move, saying the loophole blocked access for people with disabilities and endangered all pedestrians. The change will restore visibility at intersections, known as daylighting, and aligns city rules with state law requiring clear sight lines at crosswalks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates demand more: frequent protected lanes, concrete barriers, car bans on park transverses. Cyclists and pedestrians face daily danger. The city’s timid plan leaves lives at risk.</p><p class=mb3>This opinion, published July 5, 2023, urges the city to go beyond the current Crosstown Bike Lane proposal. The piece highlights the lack of east-west protected bike lanes between 55th and 158th streets, except for two blocks. It quotes: 'A proposal for crosstown bike paths on the Upper West and East sides has potential to close that gap—but should go further by significantly reducing the presence of cars on the arterial transverses cutting across Central Park.' The author criticizes Community Boards 7 and 8 for only requesting lanes every ten blocks, calling this inadequate. The editorial calls for more frequent, concrete-protected bike lanes, expanded pedestrian space, and bus lanes. It demands car bans on select park transverses, citing the death of Carling Mott and widespread resident dissatisfaction. The call is clear: timid measures leave vulnerable road users exposed. Only bold action will save lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
