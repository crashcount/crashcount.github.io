Cars block ramps, endanger walkers, and hide danger. Advocates cheer. The city will hold a hearing. The change restores sight lines and puts people before parking.</p><p class=mb3>On July 27, 2023, the Department of Transportation (DOT) proposed a rule change to close a 2009 loophole that allowed drivers to park in unmarked crosswalks at T-intersections. The proposal, not yet finalized, will be discussed at a virtual hearing in early September. The matter summary states: 'The city wants to reverse a 2009 policy that allows drivers to park in unmarked crosswalks at T-intersections, undoing a decade-and-a-half giveaway to drivers that blocked pedestrian access and made streets less safe.' Former Council Member Vincent Gentile pushed for the original exemption, arguing it would create parking and increase safety. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno said, 'This proposed change will enhance safety and accessibility for pedestrians.' Disability and street safety advocates, including Jean Ryan, praised the move, saying the loophole blocked access for people with disabilities and endangered all pedestrians. The change will restore visibility at intersections, known as daylighting, and aligns city rules with state law requiring clear sight lines at crosswalks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
