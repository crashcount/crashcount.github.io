Advocates demand more: frequent protected lanes, concrete barriers, car bans on park transverses. Cyclists and pedestrians face daily danger. The city’s timid plan leaves lives at risk.</p><p class=mb3>This opinion, published July 5, 2023, urges the city to go beyond the current Crosstown Bike Lane proposal. The piece highlights the lack of east-west protected bike lanes between 55th and 158th streets, except for two blocks. It quotes: 'A proposal for crosstown bike paths on the Upper West and East sides has potential to close that gap—but should go further by significantly reducing the presence of cars on the arterial transverses cutting across Central Park.' The author criticizes Community Boards 7 and 8 for only requesting lanes every ten blocks, calling this inadequate. The editorial calls for more frequent, concrete-protected bike lanes, expanded pedestrian space, and bus lanes. It demands car bans on select park transverses, citing the death of Carling Mott and widespread resident dissatisfaction. The call is clear: timid measures leave vulnerable road users exposed. Only bold action will save lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
