The right front bumper hit his head. Blood pooled on the dark asphalt. The child lay semiconscious, not yet one year old. The road offered no protection. The car did not stop.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a sedan traveling north near 75-11 150th Street in Queens struck an infant boy who was not yet one year old. The vehicle's right front bumper hit the child's head, causing severe bleeding and leaving him semiconscious on the roadway. The report states the crash occurred at 21:38, after dark. Driver inattention and distraction are cited as the sole contributing factors in both the vehicle and person records. The narrative confirms the driver was distracted at the time of impact. No contributing factors are attributed to the infant pedestrian. The police report describes the scene in stark terms: 'The right front bumper hit his head. He bled on the asphalt, semiconscious.' The data underscores the lethal consequences of driver distraction, especially for the most vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Failure to yield sealed his fate.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a 42-year-old man was walking outside the crosswalk on 89th Avenue near 168th Street in Queens when he was struck by two westbound vehicles—a sedan and an SUV. The narrative states, 'His leg crushed beneath steel. He stayed awake. The pain spoke plainly: amputation.' The report lists 'View Obstructed/Limited' and 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as contributing factors, explicitly citing driver error as central to the crash. The sedan was starting from parking, while the SUV was going straight ahead. The pedestrian suffered severe injury to his lower leg, resulting in amputation, but remained conscious throughout. The report does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor. The impact and aftermath underscore the lethal consequences of driver inattention and obstructed views on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
