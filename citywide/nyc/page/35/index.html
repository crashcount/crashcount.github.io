The plan, detailed in committee and public remarks, promises to eliminate 70,000 surface parking spaces by 2026, daylight all intersections, and create 300 school streets. Hidalgo declared, 'We must protect pedestrians first.' The policy bans shared e-scooters but keeps private ones legal, expands bike infrastructure, and introduces progressive parking fees for SUVs. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives contrasted Paris’s action with New York’s inaction, noting, 'The number one danger to pedestrians is cars and trucks.'

Danger grows at every corner.</p><p class=mb3>On June 26, 2023, Heather Beers-Dimitriadis, Chair of Queens Community Board 6, published an opinion blasting Mayor Adams’s decision to cut 500 crossing guard positions. The statement, titled 'Opinion: Mayor Adams’s Crossing Guard Cuts are Unconscionable,' highlights the urgent need for crossing guards, especially near busy roads and highways. Beers-Dimitriadis writes, 'The one thing we can't do is cut headcount without a workable plan to ensure that our students get to and from school safely.' She recounts years of unmet requests for more guards and points to a 2013 tragedy where a child was killed near school. The statement accuses the administration of lacking data, facts, and a plan to protect children, noting, 'By failing to release a plan that ensures that our children get to and from school unharmed, Adams has, in a sense, removed school-aged children from the Vision Zero policy.' The timing is dire: pedestrian and cyclist deaths are up.

Cyclists want clearer DOT communication during the switch.</p><p class=mb3>The Addabbo Bridge protected bike lane project, announced by the NYC Department of Transportation on June 22, 2023, ends years of jurisdictional confusion between city and state DOTs. The plan replaces a painted 'murderstrip' with an 11-foot-wide, two-way protected lane and a five-foot buffer, connecting to the Jamaica Bay Greenway. The matter summary states: 'The painted bike lane on the Addabbo Bridge, once dubbed a "murderstrip" for the danger it posed to cyclists, will soon be replaced by a barrier-protected, two-way bike lane.' Advocates like Brian Hedden (Brooklyn Greenway Initiative) and Laura Shepherd (Transportation Alternatives) praised the project, calling for more such infrastructure. Cyclists voiced concern over the removal of existing markings before the new lane is installed, urging better DOT communication. The project is part of the city's legal mandate to build 50 miles of protected bike lanes in 2023.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Pleas to drivers are not enough.</p><p class=mb3>A June 22, 2023 report from the Governors Highway Safety Association revealed that pedestrian deaths in the U.S. reached 7,508 in 2022—the highest in four decades. The report, covered by Streetsblog NYC, states: 'Pedestrian deaths in the United States climbed once again in 2022, reaching their highest point in 41 years.' Safety analyst Pam Shadel Fischer called for a 'kitchen sink approach,' stressing road design, public education, and equitable enforcement. She warned, 'the onus is really on drivers to be on the lookout for people on foot.' The report blames wide arterials, large vehicles, and dark conditions for the spike. Officials admit that asking drivers to be careful is not enough. Federal regulators are considering new rules, but advocates say more must be done to protect those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No opposition.</p><p class=mb3>On June 20, 2023, Queens Community Board 1 unanimously passed a resolution urging the city to implement universal daylighting—clearing parked cars from all intersections. The board’s letter to the Department of Transportation calls for physical barriers, not just paint, to keep corners clear. The matter, described as a call for 'standard installation,' was championed by Transportation Committee Chair Dominic Stiller. Board member Huge Ma stated, 'Ultimately, we are just asking DOT to follow the law. It will save lives.' The vote followed the court appearance of the driver who killed Dolma Naadhun, age 7, at a crosswalk blocked by parked cars. The board cited national guidelines and urged the city to include daylighting in all future street work. No members opposed or debated the measure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
