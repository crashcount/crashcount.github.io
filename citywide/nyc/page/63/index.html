The matter highlights 'institutional sluggishness'—even two deaths could not force change. Rodriguez attended a vigil, repeated his promise, but the street stays deadly.

The first crash, at Third Avenue and 76th Street, led to a failure-to-yield charge. The second, at W. 93rd Street and Amsterdam Avenue, saw no charges. These deaths followed Mayor Adams and NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell’s pledge to crack down on reckless drivers. Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine called for 'bold investment and redesign of these dangerous corners,' urging daylighting, calming, and investment in transit and bike infrastructure to reduce car use. Levine stressed, 'We need urgent action to protect pedestrians, including street redesigns and consistent enforcement.' He demanded a goal of zero deaths. The city’s promises remain unmet.
