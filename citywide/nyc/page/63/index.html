Homendy said, 'It ain’t 94 percent,' and criticized the statistic for ignoring systemic factors. She called for a 'Safe Systems' approach, stating, 'everybody needs to come to the table to prevent that death.' Homendy praised USDOT’s adoption of this approach and its commitment to zero roadway deaths. She stressed that responsibility is shared among road users, planners, engineers, and regulators. Homendy’s stance rejects blaming individuals alone and demands action from all levels of government to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The fight for safety surges again.</p><p class=mb3>On January 27, 2022, the New York State Safe Streets Coalition launched a campaign for the Crash Victim Rights and Safety Act. The coalition, made up of 14 advocacy groups, called on Albany lawmakers to pass a legislative package including 'Sammy's Law' (S524/A4655), statewide speed limit authority (S2021/A1007), Complete Streets funding and maintenance (S3897/A6454A, S5130/A7782), a three-foot passing law (S4529/A547), a DMV pre-licensing safety course (S1078A/A5084), and a Crash Victim Bill of Rights (S8152). The matter title reads: 'Activists are gathering under a new statewide umbrella... to once again demand that Albany lawmakers make roadways safer, force drivers to slow down, and protect victims.' Sara Lind of Open Plans and Amy Cohen of Families for Safe Streets led the call, demanding proven tools to end traffic violence. The coalition’s push highlights the urgent need for systemic change to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, promised swift action: 'quickly reinforce half of the city’s plastic-protected bike lanes with tougher materials.' But the city has not acted. The bike lane remains unprotected. Drivers invade it. Cyclists and pedestrians remain at risk. The matter highlights 'institutional sluggishness'—even two deaths could not force change. Rodriguez attended a vigil, repeated his promise, but the street stays deadly. Essential workers still rely on these lanes. Obstructions, poor markings, and conflicts with turning vehicles persist. The city’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed to the same lethal danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Secretary Buttigieg launches a new safety strategy. The plan backs Vision Zero, safer streets, and lower speeds. Critics say it ignores deadly vehicle size and leaves highway funds untouched. Action, not words, will decide lives.</p><p class=mb3>On January 27, 2022, the United States Department of Transportation announced the National Roadway Safety Strategy. Secretary Pete Buttigieg declared, "Zero is the only acceptable number of deaths and serious injuries on our roadways." The plan, rooted in the Safe System Approach, promises safer people, roads, vehicles, speeds, and post-crash care. It revises speed limit guidelines and launches a Complete Streets Initiative. Buttigieg’s move marks a shift from blaming individuals to fixing systems. But advocates like Beth Osborne warn the plan fails to address the rising danger of large vehicles and does not require all DOT funds to be spent on safety. Most federal money still flows to highways. The plan’s success depends on swift, sweeping action—not just promises.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
