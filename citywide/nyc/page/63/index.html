They criticized the agency for chasing mileage targets over safety and for letting police, film crews, and city vehicles block bike lanes. Bike New York called for physically protected lanes, more concrete, and an end to painted lanes and community board vetoes. Director Jon Orcutt said, "Bike lanes that are merely paint are obsolete and mostly useless to New Yorkers on bicycles in today’s city."

The board’s Transportation Committee led the effort, sending DOT a map with six east-west and four north-south protected routes. The matter, described as a call for 'the safest bike lanes, not just paint,' drew support from activists and DOT officials. Laura Shepard said, 'This unanimous vote shows the broad, popular support for protected bike lanes throughout Queens.' Joby Jacob added, 'It is a far better proposal that will keep folks safer than what DOT originally proposed.' DOT spokesperson Seth Stein agreed, saying, 'A bike lane network is exactly what our streets need.' The board’s action centers safety for cyclists and teens, rejecting half-measures.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
