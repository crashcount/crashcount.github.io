Both drivers were distracted. Her pelvis shattered. Blood pooled on the street. She died before help could arrive. The night swallowed her last breath.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a 45-year-old woman was crossing 111th Avenue near 158th Street in Queens when she was struck by two westbound SUVs. The crash occurred at 21:33. The report states both drivers were inattentive or distracted at the time of the collision. The pedestrian suffered fatal injuries, including a shattered pelvis and internal bleeding, and died at the scene. The police report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor for both vehicles. The victim was crossing without a signal, but this is only mentioned after the drivers' failures. The impact and aftermath are described in stark terms: 'Her pelvis shattered. Internal bleeding. She died on the street. Both drivers were distracted.' The sequence of events and the cited driver errors underscore the systemic danger faced by pedestrians on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
