Lawmakers say the law could save lives by ending the patchwork of protection that leaves riders exposed.</p><p class=mb3>The Sarah Debbink Langenkamp Active Transportation Act was introduced on March 30, 2023, by Reps. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) and Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). The bill, now in committee, amends the federal Highway Safety Improvement Program. It allows states to fully fund active transportation projects with federal dollars, removes local match requirements, and lets local governments nominate projects. The bill’s summary states it 'would tweak the regulations on the federal Highway Safety Improvement Program and spur states to spend that money to complete their protected bike and pedestrian networks.' Rep. Blumenauer, founder of the Congressional Bike Caucus, said, 'We have a responsibility to make our streets safer for cyclists and pedestrians.' The bill makes it explicit that states can and should use safety funds to connect existing bike and pedestrian infrastructure, not just for driver-focused projects. The law honors Sarah Langenkamp, killed while biking a gap between trails, and aims to prevent such deaths by closing the gaps that leave vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, detailed as 'Mayor Adams wants to build a seven-mile greenway along the Harlem River in the Bronx, turning the borough's wasteland western waterfront into a safe route for Boogie Down bicyclists and pedestrians from Van Cortlandt Park to Randalls Island,' aims to transform the car-dominated corridor into a haven for cyclists and pedestrians. Adams pledged to expand bike and pedestrian space on Harlem River bridges, reviving stalled efforts from the previous administration. The city will host virtual workshops for community input and plans to repurpose a car lane for a two-way bike lane on the Washington Bridge. Adams, who cycles the bridges himself, stressed the urgency of safer crossings. The plan faces hurdles: private and state land, property negotiations, and no set timeline or budget. Advocates say the Bronx deserves open space and safer routes, but connecting all segments could take years.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Community voices—Dolma’s family, local parents, advocates—demanded more: pedestrian plazas, Open Streets, enforcement. Sarah Chu said, 'And if the family wants a stop light, just give it to them.'

Change stalls.</p><p class=mb3>On March 10, 2023, a hit-and-run truck driver killed cyclist Eugene Schroeder in Williamsburg. The crash happened in a painted bike lane on Morgan Avenue. The area, industrial but growing residential, has a long record of crashes. Transportation Alternatives and advocates spoke out, saying, 'Paint is not protection—especially from large trucks.' Elizabeth Adams called the road 'known-dangerous' and demanded protected bike lanes. Less than 2% of District 34’s streets have them. The 90th Precinct saw 1,966 crashes in 2022, injuring 170 cyclists and 145 pedestrians. Advocates say the city’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed. No council bill is attached, but the call for real change is urgent.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
