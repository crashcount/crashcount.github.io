In the last twelve months, <strong>241 people died</strong> and <strong>701 suffered serious injuries</strong> on New York’s streets. The dead do not get second chances. The injured carry scars no policy can erase.

His head was wide open,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/brooklyn-90-year-old-man-hit-run-rider/>said an eyewitness</a>. The rider did not stop.

No charges filed. <strong>Fifty-five pedestrians have died this year</strong>. The number is lower than last year.

The group, led by Gib Veconi, demands the Adams administration finish the Underhill Avenue bike boulevard and support the Vanderbilt Avenue open street. Council Member Crystal Hudson called for daylighting all intersections within a half-mile of a school, covering all 54 intersections. The matter summary states, 'No intersections in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, are clear of parked cars as required under state law.' Veconi and the council cite recent pedestrian deaths, including a 7-year-old killed by an NYPD tow truck driver whose view was blocked by parked cars. The mayor’s office has delayed safety projects, citing outreach concerns. Residents and advocates say the city’s exemption from state daylighting law leaves streets unsafe, with 180 crashes and 75 injuries reported this year. They urge City Hall to act before another tragedy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation (DOT) has held workshops but released no plans, despite 101 crashes and 39 injuries in the past year. Advocates like Kate Nicholson and Juan Serra called Morgan Avenue 'a death trap' and demanded protected bike lanes with hard barriers.

They say it punishes the vulnerable, ignores reckless drivers, and threatens mobility. Riders demand safer streets, not more red tape. The fight is clear: people versus car-first policy.</p><p class=mb3>A proposed City Council bill would require license plates and registration for all electric bikes, scooters, and other legal motorized vehicles in New York City. The bill is not yet law and has drawn sharp criticism from e-bike users, advocates, and delivery workers. The matter, described as 'regressive' and 'unfairly targeting delivery workers,' has been opposed by community members including Ligia Guallpa, Nathaniel Bachalis, Selam Czebotar, Gustavo Ajche, and Charlie Todd. They argue the bill would reduce ridership, weaken the safety-in-numbers effect, and burden workers—especially people of color and migrants. Advocates urge the council to focus on infrastructure and education, not punitive measures. The bill’s critics say it fails to address real dangers: reckless driving and illegal mopeds.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as 'calling for the universal daylighting of the city's roughly 40,000 intersections,' urges the city to enforce state law prohibiting parking within 20 feet of crosswalks. Queens CB6 voted unanimously; Manhattan CB6 voted 38-3 in favor. Peter Beadle, chair of Queens CB6’s Transportation, Public Transit, and Street Safety committee, highlighted the risk of blocked sightlines, saying, 'People get that it can be hard to see someone who’s on the corner and on the other side of an SUV.' The boards join others in demanding action after recent pedestrian fatalities. The Department of Transportation claims daylighting is not always the answer, but advocates and board leaders insist the public’s concern for street safety must be taken seriously.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

We Need to Talk About It." The piece is not a council bill but a forceful policy statement. It highlights how car-centric planning and urban sprawl endanger children, stating, "Car drivers' rights are not more important than children's rights to be safe on our streets." The editorial opposes car-based infrastructure and victim-blaming, while supporting lower speed limits, car-free zones, and higher fees for large vehicles. It urges a public reckoning with the normalized violence of cars, especially around schools. The editorial demands urgent action to protect vulnerable road users and challenges the privileged status of drivers over children’s safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
