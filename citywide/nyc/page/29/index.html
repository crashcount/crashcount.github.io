We Need to Talk About It." The piece is not a council bill but a forceful policy statement. It highlights how car-centric planning and urban sprawl endanger children, stating, "Car drivers' rights are not more important than children's rights to be safe on our streets." The editorial opposes car-based infrastructure and victim-blaming, while supporting lower speed limits, car-free zones, and higher fees for large vehicles. It urges a public reckoning with the normalized violence of cars, especially around schools. The editorial demands urgent action to protect vulnerable road users and challenges the privileged status of drivers over children’s safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as a call to treat traffic violence with the same urgency as all violent crimes, highlights the city’s failure to upgrade a Senior Pedestrian Zone. Oss demanded safe infrastructure and responsible policies, saying, "Traffic crashes and fatalities need to be handled with the same urgency and prevention as all violent crimes." Transportation Alternatives’ Danny Harris condemned the city’s lack of political will, noting, "The city of New York has the tools to stop traffic violence, especially for older New Yorkers, but lacks the political will to make our streets safe." Oss also criticized delays to a critical bike lane project. The intersection remains unchanged, despite repeated crashes and injuries. So far this year, 207 people have died on city streets, including 26 cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident occurred at New York Avenue and Herkimer Street, where a 79-year-old woman was struck by two drivers who fled. Ossé stated, 'Traffic crashes and fatalities demand the same attention as other forms of violence in the city.' He urged the city to strengthen safe infrastructure and education.

The piece states, 'There is no safe, legal, and easy way to ride through downtown Jamaica. It's time for that to change.' The author supports busways but opposes the current streetscape plan, legalizing cycling on bus lanes, and expanding bike parking without access. The plan leaves the Queens Boulevard bike lane ending at Hillside Avenue, with no safe north-south or east-west bike routes. The author urges protected bike lanes on Sutphin, Parsons, Merrick, and 168th, plus Archer Avenue. The absence of safe infrastructure has left 255 cyclists injured since 2016. The message is clear: red paint is not protection.

Few reckless drivers faced real consequences. The law expired. Lander demands reauthorization, tougher penalties, and better enforcement. The Council reviews his call. Vulnerable road users remain exposed.</p><p class=mb3>On October 26, 2023, Comptroller Brad Lander, author of the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program (DVAP), criticized the city’s failed rollout of the law. The program, aimed at curbing reckless driving by mandating safety courses and allowing car seizures, expired without replacement. Lander’s report urges the City Council to reauthorize and expand DVAP, improve the safety course, and escalate consequences for repeat offenders. He states, “Without the [program]... the city’s DOT and traffic courts have no tools at their disposal to hold the most dangerous drivers accountable outside of a fine that is currently less than a parking ticket.” Lander supports pending Council and state bills for stricter penalties, including speed governors and registration suspensions. The Council acknowledged the program’s failures and is reviewing Lander’s recommendations, but has not committed to action. Vulnerable road users remain at risk while the city stalls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
