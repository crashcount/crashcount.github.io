Few reckless drivers faced real consequences. The law expired. Lander demands reauthorization, tougher penalties, and better enforcement. The Council reviews his call. Vulnerable road users remain exposed.</p><p class=mb3>On October 26, 2023, Comptroller Brad Lander, author of the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program (DVAP), criticized the city’s failed rollout of the law. The program, aimed at curbing reckless driving by mandating safety courses and allowing car seizures, expired without replacement. Lander’s report urges the City Council to reauthorize and expand DVAP, improve the safety course, and escalate consequences for repeat offenders. He states, “Without the [program]... the city’s DOT and traffic courts have no tools at their disposal to hold the most dangerous drivers accountable outside of a fine that is currently less than a parking ticket.” Lander supports pending Council and state bills for stricter penalties, including speed governors and registration suspensions. The Council acknowledged the program’s failures and is reviewing Lander’s recommendations, but has not committed to action. Vulnerable road users remain at risk while the city stalls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The driver, Hector Yepes, was charged with failure to yield and failure to exercise due care. Union leaders Donald Nesbit and Denise Ferrante condemned the city’s response, criticizing NYPD’s plan to cut guard posts and Mayor Adams for not redesigning streets near schools. Nesbit demanded more guards at dangerous corners, saying, "Corners like that, we need additional guards, not less." Ferrante called city officials neglectful, stating, "They ignore it – it’s like no big deal to them." Between 2012 and 2022, 73 crossing guards were struck, but most drivers faced only minor charges. The intersection has seen multiple crashes and injuries in 2023, highlighting the ongoing danger for those protecting children.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The resolution urges the city to daylight 'all possible' intersections with physical barriers, quoting: 'We don’t want to wait for tragedy, we know what works and we want to get it done.' Board co-chair Doug Gordon and member Marc Torrence led the push, highlighting the danger of blocked sightlines.

The board’s action follows deadly crashes and echoes similar calls from Queens and Manhattan boards.
