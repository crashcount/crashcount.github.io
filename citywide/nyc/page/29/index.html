An SUV hit him at the corner of Eastern Parkway and Albany Avenue. He was eight. The street is wide. The cars are fast. The city counts another child lost. Advocates <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/01/tuesdays-headlines-another-child-sacrificed-to-the-suv-edition>describe Eastern Parkway as a major thoroughfare for drivers and the sixth most dangerous street in Brooklyn for pedestrians</a>. The numbers do not stop. In the last twelve months, <strong>238 people have died</strong> on New York City streets. <strong>705 were seriously injured</strong>. Children, elders, cyclists, walkers—the city’s most vulnerable, crushed by steel and speed.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> In the current three-year period, they killed <strong>300 people</strong> and seriously injured <strong>509</strong> more. Trucks and buses killed <strong>93</strong> and seriously injured <strong>103</strong>. Motorcycles and mopeds killed <strong>10</strong> and seriously injured <strong>44</strong>. Bikes killed <strong>11</strong> and seriously injured <strong>54</strong>. The dead do not care about the make or model. They are gone all the same. The city’s own <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>data shows the pattern</a>. The violence is not random. It is built into the street.</p><h3 id=leaders-actor-dont>Leaders Act—Or Don’t</h3><p><strong>Some leaders move. Some stall. Some rip out what little safety we have.</strong> When the city tried to remove the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane, the Department of Transportation <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/dot-testimony-removing-bedford-ave-bike-lane-will-reduce-safety>warned that removing the protected bike lane won&rsquo;t remove cyclists—it will only make the street less safe</a>. The city risks legal liability for knowingly making a Vision Zero corridor more dangerous. Cyclists and parents begged to keep the lane. One parent <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/cyclists-tell-judge-carolyn-walker-diallo-the-bedford-ave-bike-lane-is-a-lifesaver>explained, &ldquo;Before the protected bike lane my wife made me promise to never bike the children on it because the driving behavior was so outrageous&mldr; Now the street is so much calmer.&rdquo;</a> Still, the fight drags on.</p><p>Elsewhere, the city installs new bike lanes, then threatens to cap e-bike speeds at 15 mph. A former DOT official <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/03/ex-dot-official-warns-nycs-counterproductive-e-bike-speed-limit-will-curb-biking-safety>called it &ldquo;a war on bikes, a war on immigrants, and it undermines traffic safety&rdquo;</a>. The city’s priorities shift with the wind. The bodies stay in the ground.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay, every rollback, every excuse is another name on a slab. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand streets where children can walk and live. Do not wait for the next siren.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The group, led by Gib Veconi, demands the Adams administration finish the Underhill Avenue bike boulevard and support the Vanderbilt Avenue open street. Council Member Crystal Hudson called for daylighting all intersections within a half-mile of a school, covering all 54 intersections. The matter summary states, 'No intersections in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, are clear of parked cars as required under state law.' Veconi and the council cite recent pedestrian deaths, including a 7-year-old killed by an NYPD tow truck driver whose view was blocked by parked cars. The mayor’s office has delayed safety projects, citing outreach concerns. Residents and advocates say the city’s exemption from state daylighting law leaves streets unsafe, with 180 crashes and 75 injuries reported this year.

The call is clear: end car dominance, reclaim safety for the young.</p><p class=mb3>On November 6, 2023, Streetsblog NYC published an editorial titled, "Drivers Are Killing Our Children. We Need to Talk About It." The piece is not a council bill but a forceful policy statement. It highlights how car-centric planning and urban sprawl endanger children, stating, "Car drivers' rights are not more important than children's rights to be safe on our streets." The editorial opposes car-based infrastructure and victim-blaming, while supporting lower speed limits, car-free zones, and higher fees for large vehicles. It urges a public reckoning with the normalized violence of cars, especially around schools. The editorial demands urgent action to protect vulnerable road users and challenges the privileged status of drivers over children’s safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as a call to treat traffic violence with the same urgency as all violent crimes, highlights the city’s failure to upgrade a Senior Pedestrian Zone. Oss demanded safe infrastructure and responsible policies, saying, "Traffic crashes and fatalities need to be handled with the same urgency and prevention as all violent crimes." Transportation Alternatives’ Danny Harris condemned the city’s lack of political will, noting, "The city of New York has the tools to stop traffic violence, especially for older New Yorkers, but lacks the political will to make our streets safe." Oss also criticized delays to a critical bike lane project. The intersection remains unchanged, despite repeated crashes and injuries. So far this year, 207 people have died on city streets, including 26 cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident occurred at New York Avenue and Herkimer Street, where a 79-year-old woman was struck by two drivers who fled. Ossé stated, 'Traffic crashes and fatalities demand the same attention as other forms of violence in the city.' He urged the city to strengthen safe infrastructure and education. Advocacy group Transportation Alternatives noted the city has the tools to stop traffic violence, especially for older New Yorkers, but lacks political will. The NYC Streets Plan legally requires intersection upgrades and car-free pedestrian spaces, yet this intersection remains unchanged. No arrests have been made.
