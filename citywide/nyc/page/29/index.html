Most people on foot are hit by drivers of cars and SUVs; together those drivers account for the largest share of pedestrian deaths and injuries in the period covered (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The Bronx, Queens, Manhattan. Same Story</p><p>In the Bronx, a man was struck and left to die near the Major Deegan and Mosholu Parkway. “The deadly collision happened just after 2 AM on Sunday,” a local report said (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/man-struck-killed-deadly-hit-run-crash-bronx-nyc/17765262/>ABC7</a>). In Queens, state records show a left‑turning SUV driver killed an e‑bike rider in Hollis Court earlier this summer; Manhattan saw a driver plow onto the Manhattan Bridge walkway in July, killing a cyclist and a pedestrian (both in the city crash log for this period) (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Different boroughs. The same wound.</p><p>The Worst Drivers Do Outsized Harm</p><p>A small group does the most damage. Research cited by advocates found that <strong>1.5% of motorists are tied to 21% of pedestrian deaths</strong>, and vehicles with <strong>16 camera tickets in a year are twice as likely</strong> to kill or seriously injure; <strong>30+ tickets multiplies the risk fifty‑fold</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/20/the-1-5-percent-of-drivers-who-cause-21-percent-of-pedestrian-deaths>Streetsblog</a>).

The city can lower the default residential limit to <strong>20 MPH</strong> under Sammy’s Law, and Albany has a bill—the <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045C/A2299C)</strong>—to require intelligent speed limiters for anyone who racks up <strong>11 DMV points in 18 months or 16 camera tickets in a year</strong> (<a href=/take_action/>CrashCount: Take Action</a>). Slower streets and governor devices do not bring back the dead. They stop the next call.</p><p>One more right turn. One more crosswalk. We know how this ends unless we choose otherwise.

Justice waits.</p><p class=mb3>ABC7 reported on April 2, 2025, that a crash in Brooklyn killed a mother and her two daughters, leaving another family injured and traumatized. The article states, “Shakhzod described ongoing back pain and fears of another accident.” The driver, Miriam Yarimi, had 93 violations, $10,000 in unpaid fines, and a suspended license. She struck an Uber, then hit families crossing Ocean Parkway, flipping her vehicle. Yarimi faces charges including manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. The crash exposes systemic failure: a driver with a long record remained on the road. Survivors suffer lasting physical and emotional wounds. The city’s enforcement and oversight remain under scrutiny.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
