The event, organized by Transportation Alternatives, highlighted the street’s deadly record: four deaths since 2016, including two in less than two years—delivery worker Danny Vidal and cyclist Eugene Schroeder, both struck by truck drivers. The Department of Transportation (DOT) has held workshops but released no plans, despite 101 crashes and 39 injuries in the past year. Advocates like Kate Nicholson and Juan Serra called Morgan Avenue 'a death trap' and demanded protected bike lanes with hard barriers. DOT claims the road must accommodate large trucks, but locals insist safety upgrades are overdue.

It highlights how car-centric planning and urban sprawl endanger children, stating, "Car drivers' rights are not more important than children's rights to be safe on our streets." The editorial opposes car-based infrastructure and victim-blaming, while supporting lower speed limits, car-free zones, and higher fees for large vehicles. It urges a public reckoning with the normalized violence of cars, especially around schools. The editorial demands urgent action to protect vulnerable road users and challenges the privileged status of drivers over children’s safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as a call to treat traffic violence with the same urgency as all violent crimes, highlights the city’s failure to upgrade a Senior Pedestrian Zone. Oss demanded safe infrastructure and responsible policies, saying, "Traffic crashes and fatalities need to be handled with the same urgency and prevention as all violent crimes." Transportation Alternatives’ Danny Harris condemned the city’s lack of political will, noting, "The city of New York has the tools to stop traffic violence, especially for older New Yorkers, but lacks the political will to make our streets safe." Oss also criticized delays to a critical bike lane project. The intersection remains unchanged, despite repeated crashes and injuries. So far this year, 207 people have died on city streets, including 26 cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The piece states, 'There is no safe, legal, and easy way to ride through downtown Jamaica. It's time for that to change.' The author supports busways but opposes the current streetscape plan, legalizing cycling on bus lanes, and expanding bike parking without access. The plan leaves the Queens Boulevard bike lane ending at Hillside Avenue, with no safe north-south or east-west bike routes. The author urges protected bike lanes on Sutphin, Parsons, Merrick, and 168th, plus Archer Avenue. The absence of safe infrastructure has left 255 cyclists injured since 2016.
