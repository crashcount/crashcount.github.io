His son stands over him, waiting for his eyes to open. They never do. Just days ago, Pasqual Tziquin was killed crossing New Utrecht Avenue in Brooklyn. The driver did not stop. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t stop. He just kept going,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/06/hit-and-run-driver-kills-brooklyn-restaurant-worker-in-front-of-son/>said Henry Tziquin</a>. Eight days later, Pasqual was dead. His family waits for justice.</p><p>Across the city, the violence does not let up. On the Belt Parkway, a BMW vaulted the median and slammed into oncoming cars. Six people were hurt, two left fighting for their lives. Police said, &ldquo;speed may have been an issue&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/05/us-news/six-hurt-when-car-barrels-into-oncoming-nyc-traffic/>in the crash</a>. In Crown Heights, an eight-year-old boy was struck and killed by an SUV. The street is a main road, built for speed. The boy is gone.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-behind-the-blood>The Numbers Behind the Blood</h3><p>In the last twelve months, 236 people have died on New York City streets. Another 704 suffered serious injuries. Children, elders, cyclists, pedestrians—no one is spared. SUVs and cars do the most harm: SUVs and cars killed 300 people, seriously injured 509, and hurt over 26,000 more in the last three years. Trucks and buses killed 93. Motorcycles and mopeds killed 10. Bikes killed 11. The numbers do not lie. The bodies pile up.</p><h3 id=leaders-actbut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Act—But Not Fast Enough</h3><p>Some leaders move. The city has started to lower speed limits, install more speed cameras, and build protected bike lanes. But too often, safety is ripped out as fast as it is built. When the city tried to remove the Bedford Avenue bike lane, the Department of Transportation warned: &ldquo;Removing the protected bike lane won&rsquo;t remove cyclists—it will only make the street less safe&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/dot-testimony-removing-bedford-ave-bike-lane-will-reduce-safety>testified DOT</a>.</p><p>Others push policies that punish the vulnerable. A 15 mph e-bike speed cap is on the table. Michael Replogle, former DOT official, calls it &ldquo;an ill-considered idea to improve safety which will be counterproductive&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/03/ex-dot-official-warns-nycs-counterproductive-e-bike-speed-limit-will-curb-biking-safety>said Replogle</a>. The city debates, the streets bleed.</p><h3 id=act-nowor-count-the-dead>Act Now—Or Count the Dead</h3><p>Every day of delay is another day of loss. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Tell them to protect bike lanes, not rip them out. Tell them to stop blaming the people on foot and on bikes. The bodies in the street are not statistics. They are your neighbors. They are your children. Act now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Parked cars choke corners. A child died. Locals demand action. Council Member Hudson calls for daylighting near schools. The mayor stalls. Crashes mount. Streets stay dangerous. Residents want the city to act now.</p><p class=mb3>On November 14, 2023, the Prospect Heights Neighborhood Development Council released a survey showing none of the neighborhood’s 54 intersections meet state daylighting standards. The group, led by Gib Veconi, demands the Adams administration finish the Underhill Avenue bike boulevard and support the Vanderbilt Avenue open street. Council Member Crystal Hudson called for daylighting all intersections within a half-mile of a school, covering all 54 intersections. The matter summary states, 'No intersections in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, are clear of parked cars as required under state law.' Veconi and the council cite recent pedestrian deaths, including a 7-year-old killed by an NYPD tow truck driver whose view was blocked by parked cars. The mayor’s office has delayed safety projects, citing outreach concerns. Residents and advocates say the city’s exemption from state daylighting law leaves streets unsafe, with 180 crashes and 75 injuries reported this year. They urge City Hall to act before another tragedy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation (DOT) has held workshops but released no plans, despite 101 crashes and 39 injuries in the past year.

Vision Zero’s promise fades as deaths mount.</p><p class=mb3>On November 3, 2023, Councilmember Chi Oss issued a statement after Yvonne Sandiford, a senior, was struck and killed by two hit-and-run drivers at New York Avenue and Herkimer Street. The matter, described as a call to treat traffic violence with the same urgency as all violent crimes, highlights the city’s failure to upgrade a Senior Pedestrian Zone. Oss demanded safe infrastructure and responsible policies, saying, "Traffic crashes and fatalities need to be handled with the same urgency and prevention as all violent crimes." Transportation Alternatives’ Danny Harris condemned the city’s lack of political will, noting, "The city of New York has the tools to stop traffic violence, especially for older New Yorkers, but lacks the political will to make our streets safe." Oss also criticized delays to a critical bike lane project. The intersection remains unchanged, despite repeated crashes and injuries. So far this year, 207 people have died on city streets, including 26 cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident occurred at New York Avenue and Herkimer Street, where a 79-year-old woman was struck by two drivers who fled. Ossé stated, 'Traffic crashes and fatalities demand the same attention as other forms of violence in the city.' He urged the city to strengthen safe infrastructure and education. Advocacy group Transportation Alternatives noted the city has the tools to stop traffic violence, especially for older New Yorkers, but lacks political will. The NYC Streets Plan legally requires intersection upgrades and car-free pedestrian spaces, yet this intersection remains unchanged. No arrests have been made. The case highlights systemic failure to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Bus lanes cut through, but bikes get no safe path. The city’s plan dead-ends bike lanes at Hillside Avenue. Riders face danger or break the law. Paint is not protection. Cyclists demand real lanes.</p><p class=mb3>This advocacy opinion, published November 3, 2023, calls out the Jamaica NOW: Urban Design Strategy and Streetscape Plan for failing cyclists. The piece states, 'There is no safe, legal, and easy way to ride through downtown Jamaica. It's time for that to change.' The author supports busways but opposes the current streetscape plan, legalizing cycling on bus lanes, and expanding bike parking without access. The plan leaves the Queens Boulevard bike lane ending at Hillside Avenue, with no safe north-south or east-west bike routes. The author urges protected bike lanes on Sutphin, Parsons, Merrick, and 168th, plus Archer Avenue. The absence of safe infrastructure has left 255 cyclists injured since 2016. The message is clear: red paint is not protection. Downtown Jamaica needs real, separated bike lanes to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
