In the last twelve months, <strong>243 people died</strong> on New York streets. <strong>708 were left with serious injuries</strong>. Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—none are spared. Just last week, an eight-year-old boy was killed crossing Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights. His sister watched. His mother grieves. “He was a boy who loved life,” <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>said his mother</a>.</p><p>Scooter riders, teens on mopeds, and cyclists have all fallen. On June 26, a 39-year-old man was thrown from his scooter and died on 116th Avenue. No arrests. No comfort. The street is unchanged.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> In the last three years, they took <strong>299 lives</strong> and left thousands more broken. Trucks and buses killed <strong>93</strong>. Motorcycles and mopeds, <strong>10</strong>. Bikes, <strong>11</strong>. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not. Every crash is a family torn open.</p><h3 id=leaders-actbut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Act—But Not Fast Enough</h3><p>The city has moved, but the pace is slow. Speed cameras in school zones are now extended through 2030. “It’s simple: speed cameras save lives and keep New Yorkers safe,” <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>said Governor Hochul</a>. But cameras alone are not enough. Streets need to be rebuilt. Speed limits must drop. The city has the power to set a 20 mph limit. It has not used it.</p><p>Some leaders speak plain. “At this point, there are no questions, just facts: speeding kills, and speed cameras save lives,” <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>said State Senator Gounardes</a>. But others drag their feet, or worse, rip out bike lanes and leave riders exposed.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand that repeat speeders are stopped. Do not wait for another child’s name to be written in chalk on the street.</p><p><strong>Act now.

Lives depend on it.</p><p class=mb3>On June 6, 2023, Queens Community Board 1's Transportation Committee issued a resolution demanding the Department of Transportation (DOT) end its exemption from state law requiring daylighting—removing parked cars from intersections. The committee cited the deaths of a 7-year-old and a 16-year-old at local crossings. The matter summary urges, 'The city must clear all intersections of parked cars that block visibility and endanger countless New Yorkers' lives.' Board members Huge Ma and Adam Fisher-Cox spoke out, with Ma stating, 'I think it will save lives.' The committee wants physical barriers, not just paint, and calls for daylighting and curb extensions as standard in all future roadwork. The City Council recently passed a bill mandating daylighting at 100 intersections per year starting in 2025, despite mayoral opposition. DOT says it will review the request and notes daylighting is a proven safety measure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, first promised in 2015, faced years of delay and political resistance.

The corridor is a Vision Zero priority, with high rates of pedestrian injuries and fatalities—233 people were injured on the targeted stretch in five years. The matter summary calls Queens Boulevard the 'Boulevard of Death.' Advocates, including Juan Restrepo and Peter Beadle of Transportation Alternatives, praised Mayor Adams and the DOT for finally acting. Community Board 8 chair Martha Taylor called the proposal 'well thought out' but voiced caution about bike lanes. DOT credits existing bike lanes with reducing injuries and boosting cycling.

No current guards lost jobs, but the risk grows.</p><p class=mb3>On May 25, 2023, Mayor Adams and the NYPD cut 483 vacant school crossing guard positions, reducing the authorized headcount to 2,219 for fiscal year 2024. The move, confirmed by NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell, came as a budget-saving measure, slashing $7.5 million from the $43-million crossing guard budget. The matter summary states, 'The NYPD has cut close to 500 crossing guard positions in a money-saving measure—a move that puts kids at risk on school roadways that were already more dangerous than other city streets.' Council members were not named, but union leaders like Donald Nesbit and Denise Ferrante condemned the cuts, citing chronic neglect and daily danger. Streets near schools see 57 percent more crashes and 25 percent more injuries per mile than other city roads. The city claims no active guards lost jobs, but the loss leaves children more exposed to reckless drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They urge a ban on northbound traffic between Dean and Bergen, warning of deadly conflict points. DOT says it will review. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On May 24, 2023, Brooklyn cycling advocates responded to the Department of Transportation’s proposed Bedford Avenue protected bike lane. The Transportation Alternatives Brooklyn Activist Committee praised the plan as 'a step toward creating a safer and more accessible transportation system,' but slammed a key flaw: cyclists must cross moving traffic where the lane shifts sides. The committee called this 'an unacceptable safety risk,' demanding DOT eliminate northbound car traffic between Dean and Bergen. Former DOT Deputy Commissioner Ryan Russo backed the ban, saying northbound Bedford isn’t needed. Advocates also pushed for a delayed bike signal, a pedestrian and cyclist-only crossing at Atlantic, and a concrete midblock island. DOT spokesman Vin Barone said the agency would review the proposals. The activists’ stance: don’t settle for half-measures—protect every vulnerable road user.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
