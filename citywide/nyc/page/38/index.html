The move, confirmed by NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell, came as a budget-saving measure, slashing $7.5 million from the $43-million crossing guard budget. The matter summary states, 'The NYPD has cut close to 500 crossing guard positions in a money-saving measure—a move that puts kids at risk on school roadways that were already more dangerous than other city streets.' Council members were not named, but union leaders like Donald Nesbit and Denise Ferrante condemned the cuts, citing chronic neglect and daily danger. Streets near schools see 57 percent more crashes and 25 percent more injuries per mile than other city roads. The city claims no active guards lost jobs, but the loss leaves children more exposed to reckless drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Transportation Alternatives Brooklyn Activist Committee praised the plan as 'a step toward creating a safer and more accessible transportation system,' but slammed a key flaw: cyclists must cross moving traffic where the lane shifts sides. The committee called this 'an unacceptable safety risk,' demanding DOT eliminate northbound car traffic between Dean and Bergen. Former DOT Deputy Commissioner Ryan Russo backed the ban, saying northbound Bedford isn’t needed. Advocates also pushed for a delayed bike signal, a pedestrian and cyclist-only crossing at Atlantic, and a concrete midblock island. DOT spokesman Vin Barone said the agency would review the proposals.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is reviewing this congressionally mandated rule, spurred by a 71 percent rise in truck deaths between 2009 and 2021. The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act requires AEB only for the largest trucks, leaving out medium-duty vehicles and not mandating systems that detect pedestrians and cyclists. Advocates, including Zach Cahalan, argue, 'To exclude medium-duty at this time is a big miss.' They highlight that AEB has slashed rear-end crashes in Europe and costs less than $300 per truck. Industry claims about cost and reliability are dismissed by safety experts.
