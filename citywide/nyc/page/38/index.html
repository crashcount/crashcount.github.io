The proposal, titled 'Advocates: City Must Make E-Mobility Safer and More Widespread — And Here’s How To Do It,' urges the city to expand and widen bike lanes, provide secure parking and charging, and offer financial incentives for New Yorkers to shift from cars. Transportation Alternatives, Deliveristas Unidos, and others called for at least 25% of bike lanes to be widened by 2025 and for bold leadership to meet surging demand. Powers was mentioned as a supporter. The Adams administration has made some progress but faces capacity challenges and opposes certain measures like daylighting all intersections. Advocates insist the city must act now to protect vulnerable road users and make e-mobility a real, safe option.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>Federal regulators are considering a rule to mandate automatic emergency braking (AEB) on all new heavy-duty trucks over 26,000 pounds. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is reviewing this congressionally mandated rule, spurred by a 71 percent rise in truck deaths between 2009 and 2021. The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act requires AEB only for the largest trucks, leaving out medium-duty vehicles and not mandating systems that detect pedestrians and cyclists. Advocates, including Zach Cahalan, argue, 'To exclude medium-duty at this time is a big miss.' They highlight that AEB has slashed rear-end crashes in Europe and costs less than $300 per truck. Industry claims about cost and reliability are dismissed by safety experts. The debate centers on whether NHTSA will act boldly to protect vulnerable road users from deadly truck crashes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lack of protected bike lanes and secure parking keep riders off the road. Riders want more safe routes, better parking, and real investment. The call is clear: build safe space or people stay home.</p><p class=mb3>On May 1, 2023, Urban Cycling Solutions released the New York Cycling Census, supported by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority. The report states, 'the lack of bike lanes or safe routes represents the most frequent barrier to cycling, according to 73.6 percent of respondents.' CEO Dan Suraci said, 'we see an overwhelming demand for more protected bike infrastructure and trails.' The census urges lawmakers to expand open streets, improve bike parking, and boost safety education. Over 70 percent of confident cyclists say unsafe streets keep them from riding. Forty-four percent cite poor bike parking. The report warns that focusing only on bike lanes misses other dangers. It calls for funding for parking, training, and maintenance. The message: without safe infrastructure, cycling remains a risk few will take.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
