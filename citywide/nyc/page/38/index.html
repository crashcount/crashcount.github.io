The dead include children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians. The city keeps count, but the numbers do not bleed. A 17-year-old boy died in Brooklyn last week, thrown from a moped after a car turned left in front of him.

But the pace is slow. The city removed a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue.

The project, first promised in 2015, faced years of delay and political resistance. The DOT will remove one car lane in each direction, add center-median bike paths, extend pedestrian medians, and install short bus lanes. The corridor is a Vision Zero priority, with high rates of pedestrian injuries and fatalities—233 people were injured on the targeted stretch in five years. The matter summary calls Queens Boulevard the 'Boulevard of Death.' Advocates, including Juan Restrepo and Peter Beadle of Transportation Alternatives, praised Mayor Adams and the DOT for finally acting. Community Board 8 chair Martha Taylor called the proposal 'well thought out' but voiced caution about bike lanes. DOT credits existing bike lanes with reducing injuries and boosting cycling. No timeline for capital upgrades was given.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move, confirmed by NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell, came as a budget-saving measure, slashing $7.5 million from the $43-million crossing guard budget. The matter summary states, 'The NYPD has cut close to 500 crossing guard positions in a money-saving measure—a move that puts kids at risk on school roadways that were already more dangerous than other city streets.' Council members were not named, but union leaders like Donald Nesbit and Denise Ferrante condemned the cuts, citing chronic neglect and daily danger. Streets near schools see 57 percent more crashes and 25 percent more injuries per mile than other city roads.

They urge a ban on northbound traffic between Dean and Bergen, warning of deadly conflict points. DOT says it will review. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On May 24, 2023, Brooklyn cycling advocates responded to the Department of Transportation’s proposed Bedford Avenue protected bike lane. The Transportation Alternatives Brooklyn Activist Committee praised the plan as 'a step toward creating a safer and more accessible transportation system,' but slammed a key flaw: cyclists must cross moving traffic where the lane shifts sides. The committee called this 'an unacceptable safety risk,' demanding DOT eliminate northbound car traffic between Dean and Bergen. Former DOT Deputy Commissioner Ryan Russo backed the ban, saying northbound Bedford isn’t needed. Advocates also pushed for a delayed bike signal, a pedestrian and cyclist-only crossing at Atlantic, and a concrete midblock island. DOT spokesman Vin Barone said the agency would review the proposals. The activists’ stance: don’t settle for half-measures—protect every vulnerable road user.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal, titled 'Advocates: City Must Make E-Mobility Safer and More Widespread — And Here’s How To Do It,' urges the city to expand and widen bike lanes, provide secure parking and charging, and offer financial incentives for New Yorkers to shift from cars. Transportation Alternatives, Deliveristas Unidos, and others called for at least 25% of bike lanes to be widened by 2025 and for bold leadership to meet surging demand. Powers was mentioned as a supporter. The Adams administration has made some progress but faces capacity challenges and opposes certain measures like daylighting all intersections. Advocates insist the city must act now to protect vulnerable road users and make e-mobility a real, safe option.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>Federal regulators are considering a rule to mandate automatic emergency braking (AEB) on all new heavy-duty trucks over 26,000 pounds. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is reviewing this congressionally mandated rule, spurred by a 71 percent rise in truck deaths between 2009 and 2021. The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act requires AEB only for the largest trucks, leaving out medium-duty vehicles and not mandating systems that detect pedestrians and cyclists. Advocates, including Zach Cahalan, argue, 'To exclude medium-duty at this time is a big miss.' They highlight that AEB has slashed rear-end crashes in Europe and costs less than $300 per truck. Industry claims about cost and reliability are dismissed by safety experts. The debate centers on whether NHTSA will act boldly to protect vulnerable road users from deadly truck crashes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
