Seven hundred thirty-four suffered wounds so grave they will never be the same. The dead are not numbers. A 76-year-old woman, struck by an SUV while crossing White Plains Road. A 32-year-old woman, crushed by a Jeep on Marcus Garvey Boulevard. A 79-year-old man, found dead in a parked car on West 77th.

But the law that keeps speed cameras running is set to expire. If Albany fails, the cameras go dark. Streets go back to the way they were—fast, brutal, and unforgiving.

The street is notorious for crashes. Uster rode in an unprotected bike lane. The driver remained at the scene, but police issued no tickets. Uster’s death marks the 13th cyclist fatality in New York City this year, the highest since Vision Zero began in 2014. Danny Harris, Executive Director of Transportation Alternatives, demanded, 'the city must build essential biking infrastructure and Albany must pass Sammy’s Law, to give New York City control of its own speed limits.' Uster’s family and advocates call for immediate action: protected bike lanes, lower speed limits, and an end to deadly streets.

The report states, 'the lack of bike lanes or safe routes represents the most frequent barrier to cycling, according to 73.6 percent of respondents.' CEO Dan Suraci said, 'we see an overwhelming demand for more protected bike infrastructure and trails.' The census urges lawmakers to expand open streets, improve bike parking, and boost safety education. Over 70 percent of confident cyclists say unsafe streets keep them from riding. Forty-four percent cite poor bike parking. The report warns that focusing only on bike lanes misses other dangers. It calls for funding for parking, training, and maintenance.

Cars get three lanes. Bikes get one. In half an hour, 321 bikes and 550 cars pass. The city promises wider lanes but delivers only shuffled paint. Riders squeeze, drivers sprawl. The imbalance endures.</p><p class=mb3>On April 20, 2023, Streetsblog NYC published 'SEE IT: 30 Minutes on Second Avenue Make the Case for Wider Bike Lanes.' The article documents a surge in micro-mobility on Second Avenue, where 321 bikes and 550 cars were counted in 30 minutes, yet bikes get just one lane to cars’ three. Clarence Eckerson’s count exposes the lopsided allocation. City transportation officials recently announced plans to 'explore' wider bike lane designs, but the first attempt merely repurposed buffer space, not expanding actual bike room. The National Association of City Transportation Officials recommends wider, clearer lanes for safety. The city’s promise remains unfulfilled. Vulnerable road users—cyclists and scooter riders—remain pressed and exposed while drivers dominate the street.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
