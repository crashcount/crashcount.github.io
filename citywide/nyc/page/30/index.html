The resolution urges the city to daylight 'all possible' intersections with physical barriers, quoting: 'We don’t want to wait for tragedy, we know what works and we want to get it done.' Board co-chair Doug Gordon and member Marc Torrence led the push, highlighting the danger of blocked sightlines. The board also backed a new city law requiring daylighting at 100 intersections per year starting in 2025. The measure passed 33-3. The board’s action follows deadly crashes and echoes similar calls from Queens and Manhattan boards. Daylighting is proven to reduce crashes and protect pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The block connects major cycling routes but remains unprotected. Advocates and politicians, including Andrew Matsuoka and Kathy Park Price of Transportation Alternatives, and Jon Orcutt of Bike New York, condemned the decision. Matsuoka said he was 'angry but unsurprised that Mayor Adams would put Two Trees’ interests ahead of safety.'

Fifth Avenue lags. Pedestrians squeeze past traffic. Cyclists dodge danger. The city once promised change—wider sidewalks, protected bike lanes. Then, progress stalled. Crowded streets remain. The call is clear: redesign Fifth Avenue for people, not cars.</p><p class=mb3>This advocacy push, highlighted on October 2, 2023, urges the city to transform Fifth Avenue. The article, 'Two Paths Forward: Broadway Shows What Could Be on Fifth Avenue,' compares Broadway’s pedestrian success to Fifth Avenue’s congestion. The authors cite survey data: most visitors walk, bike, or use transit, but face cramped sidewalks and unsafe cycling. They argue, 'Mayor Adams can help immediately by widening sidewalks and adding a protected bike lane.' The city began work in 2021, but then-Mayor de Blasio halted it. Council members are not named, but the piece calls for city leadership to act. The authors stress that redesigning Fifth Avenue would unite safety advocates, businesses, and the city, making Midtown safer and more vibrant for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
