He flew from his seat, arm crushed against steel. Blood marked the door. The helmet offered no shield. The street stayed quiet, danger lingering.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a 58-year-old man riding an e-bike was traveling north on 80th Street near 67th Drive in Queens when he struck the left side doors of a parked sedan. The impact ejected the rider, who suffered crush injuries to his arm. The report states the contributing factor as 'Driver Inattention/Distraction.' The sedan was unoccupied and legally parked at the time of the crash. The e-bike rider was wearing a helmet, but the report notes that it did not prevent injury. The sequence of events underscores the persistent danger posed by inattentive operation, even in the absence of moving vehicles. The police report makes no mention of any errors or contributing behaviors by the injured e-bike rider beyond the cited inattention.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The driver, a probationary firefighter, now faces manslaughter charges.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News reported on March 28, 2025, that Michael Pena, a probationary FDNY firefighter, was fired after being charged with vehicular manslaughter in a Queens crash. Prosecutors said Pena drove 83 mph in a 25 mph zone, ran a red light, and struck Justin Diaz, 23, who had the right-of-way. Pena's blood-alcohol content was 0.156%, nearly double the legal limit, and he tested positive for cocaine and marijuana. The article states, 'Pena was driving nearly 60 mph above the speed limit after a night of drinking at a bar.' Surveillance footage confirmed the sequence. Two passengers in Pena's car were hospitalized. The crash highlights ongoing risks from impaired and reckless driving, even among public servants.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
