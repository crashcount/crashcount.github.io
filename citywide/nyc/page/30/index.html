Just last week, an eight-year-old boy was killed crossing Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights. His sister watched. His mother grieves. “He was a boy who loved life,” <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>said his mother</a>.</p><p>Scooter riders, teens on mopeds, and cyclists have all fallen.

Bus lanes cut through, but bikes get no safe path. The city’s plan dead-ends bike lanes at Hillside Avenue. Riders face danger or break the law. Paint is not protection. Cyclists demand real lanes.</p><p class=mb3>This advocacy opinion, published November 3, 2023, calls out the Jamaica NOW: Urban Design Strategy and Streetscape Plan for failing cyclists. The piece states, 'There is no safe, legal, and easy way to ride through downtown Jamaica. It's time for that to change.' The author supports busways but opposes the current streetscape plan, legalizing cycling on bus lanes, and expanding bike parking without access. The plan leaves the Queens Boulevard bike lane ending at Hillside Avenue, with no safe north-south or east-west bike routes. The author urges protected bike lanes on Sutphin, Parsons, Merrick, and 168th, plus Archer Avenue. The absence of safe infrastructure has left 255 cyclists injured since 2016. The message is clear: red paint is not protection. Downtown Jamaica needs real, separated bike lanes to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The program, aimed at curbing reckless driving by mandating safety courses and allowing car seizures, expired without replacement. Lander’s report urges the City Council to reauthorize and expand DVAP, improve the safety course, and escalate consequences for repeat offenders. He states, “Without the [program]... the city’s DOT and traffic courts have no tools at their disposal to hold the most dangerous drivers accountable outside of a fine that is currently less than a parking ticket.” Lander supports pending Council and state bills for stricter penalties, including speed governors and registration suspensions. The Council acknowledged the program’s failures and is reviewing Lander’s recommendations, but has not committed to action. Vulnerable road users remain at risk while the city stalls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The driver, Hector Yepes, was charged with failure to yield and failure to exercise due care. Union leaders Donald Nesbit and Denise Ferrante condemned the city’s response, criticizing NYPD’s plan to cut guard posts and Mayor Adams for not redesigning streets near schools. Nesbit demanded more guards at dangerous corners, saying, "Corners like that, we need additional guards, not less." Ferrante called city officials neglectful, stating, "They ignore it – it’s like no big deal to them." Between 2012 and 2022, 73 crossing guards were struck, but most drivers faced only minor charges. The intersection has seen multiple crashes and injuries in 2023, highlighting the ongoing danger for those protecting children.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
