Neither does the violence on its streets. In the last twelve months, <strong>246 people died</strong> in crashes. <strong>715 were left with serious injuries</strong>. The numbers are cold. The pain is not. A cyclist is struck in Queens. A teenager dies on a Brooklyn street. A pedestrian is killed crossing Harlem River Drive. The city moves on.

Twenty-four people over 75 did not make it home. The city’s most vulnerable—walkers, riders, children—are left to fend for themselves. Cars and trucks do the most harm. In three years, they killed <strong>299 people</strong> and left thousands more injured. Motorcycles and mopeds killed 10. Bikes killed 11. The street is a gauntlet. The odds are not in your favor.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-doand-dont>What Leaders Do—And Don’t</h2><p>The city talks of Vision Zero.

The DOT promises new barriers, new designs, new hope. But the work is slow. Protected bike lanes are ripped out in Williamsburg. Cyclists are left with nothing but fear. “I don’t think he cares if we die,” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/cyclists-fuming-over-mayor-adamss-removal-of-bedford-avenue-protected-bike-lane>said Jeanette Samyn</a>.</p><p>Some leaders push for change.

The driver, Hector Yepes, was charged with failure to yield and failure to exercise due care. Union leaders Donald Nesbit and Denise Ferrante condemned the city’s response, criticizing NYPD’s plan to cut guard posts and Mayor Adams for not redesigning streets near schools. Nesbit demanded more guards at dangerous corners, saying, "Corners like that, we need additional guards, not less." Ferrante called city officials neglectful, stating, "They ignore it – it’s like no big deal to them." Between 2012 and 2022, 73 crossing guards were struck, but most drivers faced only minor charges. The intersection has seen multiple crashes and injuries in 2023, highlighting the ongoing danger for those protecting children.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The resolution urges the city to daylight 'all possible' intersections with physical barriers, quoting: 'We don’t want to wait for tragedy, we know what works and we want to get it done.' Board co-chair Doug Gordon and member Marc Torrence led the push, highlighting the danger of blocked sightlines. The board also backed a new city law requiring daylighting at 100 intersections per year starting in 2025. The measure passed 33-3. The board’s action follows deadly crashes and echoes similar calls from Queens and Manhattan boards.

The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, was an advocacy action, not a council bill.

No one else should die.' Uster-Hug plans to join a protest ride to City Hall, demanding urgent action to end cyclist deaths.
