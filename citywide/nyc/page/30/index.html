An SUV hit him at the intersection. His name is not in the data. His age is. The street is busy. The city calls it one of the most dangerous for walkers. The group said, <strong>"[Eastern Parkway] acts as a major thoroughfare for drivers, and is the sixth most dangerous street in Brooklyn for pedestrians"</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/01/tuesdays-headlines-another-child-sacrificed-to-the-suv-edition>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>Fourteen people were hurt when a van slammed into a tree in Brooklyn. Twelve of them were adults with special needs, headed to a day program. The driver swerved to avoid another car. A witness said, <strong>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sad because they definitely need a lot of attention more than anyone else. I hope that they&rsquo;re all OK at the end of the day&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/transport-van-crashes-tree-bath-beach-brooklyn-injuring-14-people/16903098/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>A 17-year-old died riding a moped. A 39-year-old was killed on a motorcycle. The list goes on. In the past 12 months, <strong>244 people have died</strong> on city streets. <strong>709 were seriously injured</strong>.

There is no greater priority for me than the safety of New Yorkers&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>amNY</a>). Cameras slow some drivers. But the dead keep coming.</p><p>Protected bike lanes work. The city’s own Department of Transportation warned, <strong>&ldquo;Removing the protected bike lane won&rsquo;t remove cyclists—it will only make the street less safe&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/dot-testimony-removing-bedford-ave-bike-lane-will-reduce-safety>Streetsblog NYC</a>).

In three years, <strong>cars and SUVs killed 300 people</strong> and left thousands more broken. Trucks and buses killed 93. Motorcycles and mopeds killed 10. Bikes killed 11.

They are mothers, sons, neighbors.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another body on the street.</strong> Call your council member.

Two drivers hit her. Neither stopped. Councilmember Chi Ossé demanded the city treat traffic deaths as violence. Advocates say the city has tools but lacks will. The intersection remains dangerous. No arrests.</p><p class=mb3>On November 3, 2023, Councilmember Chi Ossé (District 36) called for increased street safety after a fatal double hit-and-run in Bedford-Stuyvesant. The incident occurred at New York Avenue and Herkimer Street, where a 79-year-old woman was struck by two drivers who fled. Ossé stated, 'Traffic crashes and fatalities demand the same attention as other forms of violence in the city.' He urged the city to strengthen safe infrastructure and education. Advocacy group Transportation Alternatives noted the city has the tools to stop traffic violence, especially for older New Yorkers, but lacks political will. The NYC Streets Plan legally requires intersection upgrades and car-free pedestrian spaces, yet this intersection remains unchanged. No arrests have been made. The case highlights systemic failure to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Bus lanes cut through, but bikes get no safe path. The city’s plan dead-ends bike lanes at Hillside Avenue. Riders face danger or break the law. Paint is not protection. Cyclists demand real lanes.</p><p class=mb3>This advocacy opinion, published November 3, 2023, calls out the Jamaica NOW: Urban Design Strategy and Streetscape Plan for failing cyclists. The piece states, 'There is no safe, legal, and easy way to ride through downtown Jamaica. It's time for that to change.' The author supports busways but opposes the current streetscape plan, legalizing cycling on bus lanes, and expanding bike parking without access. The plan leaves the Queens Boulevard bike lane ending at Hillside Avenue, with no safe north-south or east-west bike routes. The author urges protected bike lanes on Sutphin, Parsons, Merrick, and 168th, plus Archer Avenue. The absence of safe infrastructure has left 255 cyclists injured since 2016. The message is clear: red paint is not protection. Downtown Jamaica needs real, separated bike lanes to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lander’s report urges the City Council to reauthorize and expand DVAP, improve the safety course, and escalate consequences for repeat offenders. He states, “Without the [program]... the city’s DOT and traffic courts have no tools at their disposal to hold the most dangerous drivers accountable outside of a fine that is currently less than a parking ticket.” Lander supports pending Council and state bills for stricter penalties, including speed governors and registration suspensions. The Council acknowledged the program’s failures and is reviewing Lander’s recommendations, but has not committed to action.

The intersection is notorious for crashes.</p><p class=mb3>On October 20, 2023, a dump truck driver struck and killed school crossing guard Krystyna Naprawa at Woodhaven Boulevard and Atlantic Avenue in Queens. The driver, Hector Yepes, was charged with failure to yield and failure to exercise due care. Union leaders Donald Nesbit and Denise Ferrante condemned the city’s response, criticizing NYPD’s plan to cut guard posts and Mayor Adams for not redesigning streets near schools. Nesbit demanded more guards at dangerous corners, saying, "Corners like that, we need additional guards, not less." Ferrante called city officials neglectful, stating, "They ignore it – it’s like no big deal to them." Between 2012 and 2022, 73 crossing guards were struck, but most drivers faced only minor charges. The intersection has seen multiple crashes and injuries in 2023, highlighting the ongoing danger for those protecting children.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
