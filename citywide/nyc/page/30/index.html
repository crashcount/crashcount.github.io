The program, aimed at curbing reckless driving by mandating safety courses and allowing car seizures, expired without replacement. Lander’s report urges the City Council to reauthorize and expand DVAP, improve the safety course, and escalate consequences for repeat offenders. He states, “Without the [program]... the city’s DOT and traffic courts have no tools at their disposal to hold the most dangerous drivers accountable outside of a fine that is currently less than a parking ticket.” Lander supports pending Council and state bills for stricter penalties, including speed governors and registration suspensions. The Council acknowledged the program’s failures and is reviewing Lander’s recommendations, but has not committed to action.

The driver, Hector Yepes, was charged with failure to yield and failure to exercise due care. Union leaders Donald Nesbit and Denise Ferrante condemned the city’s response, criticizing NYPD’s plan to cut guard posts and Mayor Adams for not redesigning streets near schools. Nesbit demanded more guards at dangerous corners, saying, "Corners like that, we need additional guards, not less." Ferrante called city officials neglectful, stating, "They ignore it – it’s like no big deal to them." Between 2012 and 2022, 73 crossing guards were struck, but most drivers faced only minor charges. The intersection has seen multiple crashes and injuries in 2023, highlighting the ongoing danger for those protecting children.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
