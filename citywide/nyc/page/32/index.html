The meeting followed a DOT survey showing 76% support for protected lanes and 74% for more pedestrian space. The area, a Vision Zero Priority Zone, saw 264 injuries and three deaths—including a 7-year-old and a 16-year-old cyclist—between 2016 and 2020. Local politicians and advocates like Huge Ma and Laura Shepard voiced strong support, calling the lack of safe routes 'an embarrassment.' DOT spokesman Scott Gastel said the agency will keep gathering feedback and present new designs to Community Board 1 by next spring or summer. Until then, Astoria’s streets remain perilous for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Action is overdue.</p><p class=mb3>On September 12, 2023, Astoria council members announced a proposal for a protected bike lane on 31st Avenue, along with car-free zones and traffic calming. The proposal follows a deadly year: three people, including two children, killed in Astoria’s streets in the first quarter alone. The matter summary reads, 'Astorians envision a 31st Avenue that contains a fully protected bike lane, multiple car-free zones, and traffic calming measures along the length of the corridor.' Council members have advocated for these changes in press conferences, letters, and meetings. They are partnering with DOT for a public workshop on September 14. The push comes as the city falls behind on its legal mandate to build 50 miles of new bike lanes in 2023—only ten miles completed so far. Advocates and officials cite evidence: protected lanes and daylighting save lives. The call is clear—Astoria demands real protection for its most vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Open Plans pushes for wider, protected bike lanes, bi-directional lanes, and people-centric traffic calming. The group calls for shutting down illegal moped dealers and updating state law to require registration before vehicles leave dealerships.

The issue, covered by Streetsblog, reveals that from 2012 to 2022, 73 crossing guards were hit and injured by drivers while working. The matter highlights that 'dozens of NYC school crossing guards have been injured by drivers since 2012.' Salamanca Jr. was mentioned in the discussion, which underscores the city’s failure to protect these workers—mostly women of color earning low wages. The NYPD is cutting 18 percent of guard positions this year. Few drivers are charged, and most face only minor violations. Guards and union leaders call for street redesigns and stronger protections. City officials praise guards but offer little action.

The matter summary reads: 'A city proposal to ban parking at curbs cuts in "T" intersections must go further by banning all parking at the edges of such intersections, advocates demanded.' Christine Serdjenian Yearwood, Jean Ryan, Rosamond Gianutsos, and Jackson Chabot spoke out, demanding a total ban and daylighting at all intersections. Advocates argue that parking at T intersections blocks visibility and endangers pedestrians, especially the disabled and children. DOT supports the rule change but gave no timeline.
