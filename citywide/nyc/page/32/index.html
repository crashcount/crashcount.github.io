Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—no one is spared. In June, a 17-year-old boy died after his moped collided with a car in Brooklyn. His passenger, 14, was thrown to the pavement and left unconscious. Days earlier, a cyclist named Amanda Servedio was killed in Astoria, struck by a man fleeing police through red lights and bike lanes. She was coming home from a ride. She never made it back. The <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/staten-island-man-charged-with-murder-in-hit-and-run-crash-with-queens-cyclist>chase lasted ten minutes</a>. Ten minutes of sirens, speed, and fear.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-policy-moves-but-the-blood-stays>The Pattern: Policy Moves, But the Blood Stays</h2><p><strong>The city talks safety. The city counts bodies.</strong> In June, Mayor Adams ripped out a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue. He said it was for safety. Cyclists saw it for what it was. “I don’t think he cares if we die,” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/cyclists-fuming-over-mayor-adamss-removal-of-bedford-avenue-protected-bike-lane>said Jeanette Samyn</a>. The city rolled out new intersection designs—mini-protected bike lanes, daylighting, barriers. “Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety,” <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/nyc-dot-cyclist-safety-intersections/>said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>. But the pace is slow. The danger is fast.</p><h2 id=the-blame-who-pays-who-waits>The Blame: Who Pays, Who Waits</h2><p><strong>Most deaths come from cars and trucks.</strong> In the last three and a half years, they killed 299 people and injured over 26,000. Bikes killed 11. Mopeds and motorcycles killed 10. The city blames speed, then delays lowering limits. The city blames e-bikes, then stalls on safe storage. The city blames the dead, then moves on.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-no-more-waiting>The Next Step: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Every day, someone else is lost.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits. The city can build real protection at every corner. The city can end the bloodletting. But only if you force their hand. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph limit. Demand hardened intersections. Demand action, not excuses.</p><p><strong>If you wait, the street will take someone you love.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The proposal follows a deadly year: three people, including two children, killed in Astoria’s streets in the first quarter alone. The matter summary reads, 'Astorians envision a 31st Avenue that contains a fully protected bike lane, multiple car-free zones, and traffic calming measures along the length of the corridor.' Council members have advocated for these changes in press conferences, letters, and meetings. They are partnering with DOT for a public workshop on September 14. The push comes as the city falls behind on its legal mandate to build 50 miles of new bike lanes in 2023—only ten miles completed so far. Advocates and officials cite evidence: protected lanes and daylighting save lives.

Christine Serdjenian Yearwood, Jean Ryan, Rosamond Gianutsos, and Jackson Chabot spoke out, demanding a total ban and daylighting at all intersections. Advocates argue that parking at T intersections blocks visibility and endangers pedestrians, especially the disabled and children. DOT supports the rule change but gave no timeline.
