Action is overdue.</p><p class=mb3>On September 12, 2023, Astoria council members announced a proposal for a protected bike lane on 31st Avenue, along with car-free zones and traffic calming. The proposal follows a deadly year: three people, including two children, killed in Astoria’s streets in the first quarter alone. The matter summary reads, 'Astorians envision a 31st Avenue that contains a fully protected bike lane, multiple car-free zones, and traffic calming measures along the length of the corridor.' Council members have advocated for these changes in press conferences, letters, and meetings. They are partnering with DOT for a public workshop on September 14. The push comes as the city falls behind on its legal mandate to build 50 miles of new bike lanes in 2023—only ten miles completed so far. Advocates and officials cite evidence: protected lanes and daylighting save lives. The call is clear—Astoria demands real protection for its most vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter highlights that 'dozens of NYC school crossing guards have been injured by drivers since 2012.' Salamanca Jr. was mentioned in the discussion, which underscores the city’s failure to protect these workers—mostly women of color earning low wages. The NYPD is cutting 18 percent of guard positions this year. Few drivers are charged, and most face only minor violations. Guards and union leaders call for street redesigns and stronger protections. City officials praise guards but offer little action.

The matter summary reads: 'A city proposal to ban parking at curbs cuts in "T" intersections must go further by banning all parking at the edges of such intersections, advocates demanded.' Christine Serdjenian Yearwood, Jean Ryan, Rosamond Gianutsos, and Jackson Chabot spoke out, demanding a total ban and daylighting at all intersections. Advocates argue that parking at T intersections blocks visibility and endangers pedestrians, especially the disabled and children. DOT supports the rule change but gave no timeline.
