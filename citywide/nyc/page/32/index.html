Some say it falls short.</p><p class=mb3>On August 29, 2023, the Department of Transportation announced work will begin on the McGuinness Boulevard redesign, known as the 'Calyer Compromise.' The plan, shaped by controversy and negotiation, keeps two lanes of car and truck traffic in both directions from the Pulaski Bridge to Calyer Street during the day, with a flex lane for parking at night. South of Calyer, the road narrows to one lane each way, with protected bike lanes, loading zones, and offset crossings. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said the compromise will 'save lives and make this corridor much easier to navigate for everyone, including drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists.' He thanked Mayor Adams, elected officials, and the community for their support. Supporters call it the biggest safety change since Robert Moses widened the road. Opponents, like Keep McGuinness Moving, say it ignores community concerns. The redesign comes after years of advocacy following multiple deaths and injuries on the corridor.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, not tied to a council bill but a DOT initiative, expands northbound bike lanes from eight to ten feet on the upper section. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, “This project will deliver much-needed safety upgrades to the Hell’s Kitchen corridor and help support more efficient transportation options.” Local advocate Christine Berthet praised the wider lanes, noting the old design could not safely carry regular bikes alongside cargo and e-bikes. The project adds pedestrian islands, dedicated left-turn lanes, and leading pedestrian intervals at key intersections. Berthet urged the city to install flex posts to keep drivers out of bike and pedestrian spaces, citing problems on nearby 11th Avenue. The changes aim to protect vulnerable road users but leave most space for cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
