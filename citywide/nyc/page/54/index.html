Just last week, an eight-year-old boy was killed crossing Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights. His sister watched. His mother grieves. “He was a boy who loved life,” <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>said his mother</a>.</p><p>Scooter riders, teens on mopeds, and cyclists have all fallen.

Paris, London, and Tirana have hundreds of car-free school streets. NYC has just 41. Streets near schools remain dangerous. City leaders lack urgency. Children, especially the most vulnerable, pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>This policy comparison, published August 1, 2022, highlights New York City's failure to match global peers on car-free school streets. The report notes, 'A movement to ban cars from streets near schools is taking off globally, with cities like London, Paris, and Tirana implementing hundreds of car-free school streets to protect children from traffic and air pollution.' In contrast, NYC has only 41 such streets. Advocates like Emily Stutts and Simon Battisti criticize the city’s lack of political will, funding, and urgency. Battisti points to Tirana’s swift removal of parking for safety, while David Belliard in Paris calls for cities to prioritize children and vulnerable people over cars. The report underscores that New York’s program is underfunded, limited, and absent from top officials’ agendas. Streets near schools remain hazardous, especially for children of color and low-income families. The city’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed to daily danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Victims get no say.</p><p class=mb3>On August 1, 2022, Senators Mike Rounds, Mike Braun, and John Cornyn introduced a bill to repeal a key safety measure. The proposal targets a Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provision that requires automakers to install passive drunk-driving detection systems in all new vehicles by 2024. The bill is not yet assigned to a committee. The senators have not issued public statements, but sources cite concerns over driver privacy. The bill’s summary states it would 'overturn a key provision in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that requires automakers to install passive drunk-driving detection mechanisms.' Safety advocates argue the technology could prevent up to 94 percent of alcohol-related crash deaths. They say removing the mandate puts vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, passengers—at greater risk. The debate pits privacy against public safety, but the cost will be measured in lives lost on the street.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Bronx waits. Danger grows.</p><p class=mb3>A new report from Transportation Alternatives, released July 20, 2022, shows a grim rise in Bronx road deaths. In the first half of 2022, 28 people died—up 22 percent from last year, and double the toll from 2014, when Vision Zero began. The report, titled 'Bronx Bummer: Road Deaths are Up in the Boogie Down, Report Shows,' calls out the city’s failure to protect its most vulnerable. Danny Harris, TA’s executive director, urges 'bold action to physically redesign streets' and pushes for measures like the NYC 25X25 plan, more bus lanes, daylighting corners, higher taxes on heavy vehicles, and stronger enforcement against dangerous drivers. The Department of Transportation, represented by Vin Barone, claims historic investments and promises new bike and bus lanes, especially in underserved Bronx neighborhoods. Still, the death count climbs. Advocates want car-free school streets and safer crossings. The city’s response lags behind the crisis.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The case, rooted in the fatal crash on a hazardous Fort Greene street, alleges city negligence: 'The city Department of Transportation and NYPD were negligent — and bear a substantial responsibility — regarding the death last year of a 3-month-old baby after an unlicensed driver with a long record of recklessness struck another car as he was being chased by police on a 'dangerous' Fort Greene road, a bombshell new lawsuit alleges.' The suit faults the city for failing to redesign the intersection of Vanderbilt and Gates Avenues, ignoring the Reckless Driver Accountability Act, and allowing unsafe police pursuit. The driver, Tyrik Mott, faces criminal charges. The city has since proposed closing part of Gates Avenue to cars.
