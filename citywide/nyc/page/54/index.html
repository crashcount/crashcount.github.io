Streets once deadly for walkers now belong to them.</p><p class=mb3>On July 19, 2022, the NYC Department of Transportation announced the full pedestrianization of Doyers Street in Chinatown, formalizing its status as a car-free plaza. The project builds on the success of Covid-era open streets and seasonal closures. DOT spokesman Vin Barone said, "DOT is proud to build on the success of our Open Streets with proposals to formalize spaces like the Doyers Open Street as a permanent pedestrian plaza." Wellington Chen, executive director of the Chinatown Partnership, praised the move, calling it "healthier and safer for both shopkeepers and customers." The plan includes new plaza features and changes to nearby parking for commercial loading. The effort is part of a broader city push, with BIDs leading similar projects across New York. The conversion gives crowded Chinatown a rare, needed refuge for pedestrians and local businesses.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city’s matter summary reads: officials 'began the process of lowering speed limits from 25 miles per hour to 20, as part of its effort to end all forms of traffic violence.' Mayor Ravi Bhalla backed the move, saying, 'that extra time could very well end up saving the life of a child or senior citizen.' Ryan Sharp, parking and transportation director, stressed the need to keep pushing for safer streets.

Beth Osborne, director of Transportation for America, highlights that over 70 percent of urban pedestrian fatalities occur on multi-lane arterial roads, which make up only 15 percent of streets. Osborne urges systemic change: 'Safety has to be the default.' The report calls for better data, stronger design standards, and smarter use of federal funds. No council members are named; this is a national policy report, not a local bill.

Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, citing Hylan's high crash rate and the epidemic of speeding, declared, 'I'm proud to announce that this safety project will move forward in the next couple of weeks.' The DOT maintains that reducing lanes and adding left-turn bays calms traffic and cuts crashes, with injury reductions seen on other city streets. Despite political pushback, the agency presses on, aiming to stem the tide of deadly crashes on Staten Island's most dangerous corridor.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

City drags its feet. Council set aside funds. DOT stalls. Pedestrians and cyclists wait. Business objections ring hollow. The mayor ignores the crisis. The call is clear: clear the streets for people, not cars.</p><p class=mb3>This is an opinion piece published July 11, 2022, titled 'Pedestrianize the Financial District Now!' It urges immediate action on the 'Make Way for Lower Manhattan' plan, which would turn streets below Chambers into shared spaces for walkers and cyclists. The Financial District Neighborhood Association backs the plan. Former Council Member Margaret Chin allocated $500,000 for early work in 2019. The Department of Transportation has not moved forward. The piece states, 'Any pedestrianization plan worth its salt will curtail the space for government-subsidized 'free' car storage.' The author slams the mayor for ignoring placard abuse and calls business objections a smokescreen. The plan’s delay keeps narrow, dangerous streets clogged with government vehicles, putting vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
