An SUV hit him at the intersection. His name is not in the data. His age is. The street is busy. The city calls it one of the most dangerous for walkers. The group said, <strong>"[Eastern Parkway] acts as a major thoroughfare for drivers, and is the sixth most dangerous street in Brooklyn for pedestrians"</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/01/tuesdays-headlines-another-child-sacrificed-to-the-suv-edition>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>Fourteen people were hurt when a van slammed into a tree in Brooklyn. Twelve of them were adults with special needs, headed to a day program. The driver swerved to avoid another car. A witness said, <strong>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sad because they definitely need a lot of attention more than anyone else. I hope that they&rsquo;re all OK at the end of the day&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/transport-van-crashes-tree-bath-beach-brooklyn-injuring-14-people/16903098/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>A 17-year-old died riding a moped. A 39-year-old was killed on a motorcycle. The list goes on. In the past 12 months, <strong>244 people have died</strong> on city streets. <strong>709 were seriously injured</strong>.

There is no greater priority for me than the safety of New Yorkers&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>amNY</a>). Cameras slow some drivers. But the dead keep coming.</p><p>Protected bike lanes work. The city’s own Department of Transportation warned, <strong>&ldquo;Removing the protected bike lane won&rsquo;t remove cyclists—it will only make the street less safe&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/dot-testimony-removing-bedford-ave-bike-lane-will-reduce-safety>Streetsblog NYC</a>).

In three years, <strong>cars and SUVs killed 300 people</strong> and left thousands more broken. Trucks and buses killed 93. Motorcycles and mopeds killed 10. Bikes killed 11.

They are mothers, sons, neighbors.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another body on the street.</strong> Call your council member.

Patel criticized Rep. Carolyn Maloney for lobbying against bike lanes at the crash site, stating, 'It's time to put people over cars.' He called for capping highways, expanding transit, and passing the Vision Zero and Complete Streets Acts. Patel accused Reps. Maloney and Nadler of fostering a 'culture of no' that blocks life-saving street redesigns.

Children, especially the most vulnerable, pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>This policy comparison, published August 1, 2022, highlights New York City's failure to match global peers on car-free school streets. The report notes, 'A movement to ban cars from streets near schools is taking off globally, with cities like London, Paris, and Tirana implementing hundreds of car-free school streets to protect children from traffic and air pollution.' In contrast, NYC has only 41 such streets. Advocates like Emily Stutts and Simon Battisti criticize the city’s lack of political will, funding, and urgency. Battisti points to Tirana’s swift removal of parking for safety, while David Belliard in Paris calls for cities to prioritize children and vulnerable people over cars. The report underscores that New York’s program is underfunded, limited, and absent from top officials’ agendas. Streets near schools remain hazardous, especially for children of color and low-income families. The city’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed to daily danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Victims get no say.</p><p class=mb3>On August 1, 2022, Senators Mike Rounds, Mike Braun, and John Cornyn introduced a bill to repeal a key safety measure. The proposal targets a Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provision that requires automakers to install passive drunk-driving detection systems in all new vehicles by 2024. The bill is not yet assigned to a committee. The senators have not issued public statements, but sources cite concerns over driver privacy. The bill’s summary states it would 'overturn a key provision in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that requires automakers to install passive drunk-driving detection mechanisms.' Safety advocates argue the technology could prevent up to 94 percent of alcohol-related crash deaths. They say removing the mandate puts vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, passengers—at greater risk. The debate pits privacy against public safety, but the cost will be measured in lives lost on the street.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

In the first half of 2022, 28 people died—up 22 percent from last year, and double the toll from 2014, when Vision Zero began. The report, titled 'Bronx Bummer: Road Deaths are Up in the Boogie Down, Report Shows,' calls out the city’s failure to protect its most vulnerable. Danny Harris, TA’s executive director, urges 'bold action to physically redesign streets' and pushes for measures like the NYC 25X25 plan, more bus lanes, daylighting corners, higher taxes on heavy vehicles, and stronger enforcement against dangerous drivers. The Department of Transportation, represented by Vin Barone, claims historic investments and promises new bike and bus lanes, especially in underserved Bronx neighborhoods. Still, the death count climbs. Advocates want car-free school streets and safer crossings. The city’s response lags behind the crisis.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The suit cites failure to fix a deadly street, enforce reckless driver laws, and stop a dangerous police chase. The city faces hard questions.</p><p class=mb3>On July 20, 2022, the parents of Apolline Mong Guillemin filed a lawsuit against the city Department of Transportation and NYPD. The case, rooted in the fatal crash on a hazardous Fort Greene street, alleges city negligence: 'The city Department of Transportation and NYPD were negligent — and bear a substantial responsibility — regarding the death last year of a 3-month-old baby after an unlicensed driver with a long record of recklessness struck another car as he was being chased by police on a 'dangerous' Fort Greene road, a bombshell new lawsuit alleges.' The suit faults the city for failing to redesign the intersection of Vanderbilt and Gates Avenues, ignoring the Reckless Driver Accountability Act, and allowing unsafe police pursuit. The driver, Tyrik Mott, faces criminal charges. The city has since proposed closing part of Gates Avenue to cars. No council members are named; this is a direct legal challenge to city agencies.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project builds on the success of Covid-era open streets and seasonal closures. DOT spokesman Vin Barone said, "DOT is proud to build on the success of our Open Streets with proposals to formalize spaces like the Doyers Open Street as a permanent pedestrian plaza." Wellington Chen, executive director of the Chinatown Partnership, praised the move, calling it "healthier and safer for both shopkeepers and customers." The plan includes new plaza features and changes to nearby parking for commercial loading. The effort is part of a broader city push, with BIDs leading similar projects across New York. The conversion gives crowded Chinatown a rare, needed refuge for pedestrians and local businesses.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
