Children, elders, cyclists, and workers are struck down in the crosswalk, on the sidewalk, waiting for the light. The city keeps moving. The blood dries. The next crash comes.</p><p>Just days ago, an eight-year-old boy was killed by an SUV in Crown Heights. The street was wide, the car was heavy, the child was small. The city called it another tragedy. Advocates called it what it is: a failure. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/01/tuesdays-headlines-another-child-sacrificed-to-the-suv-edition>Eastern Parkway acts as a major thoroughfare for drivers, and is the sixth most dangerous street in Brooklyn for pedestrians</a>, said one group, demanding more safety infrastructure to stop the killing.</p><h2 id=policy-progress-and-sabotage>Policy: Progress and Sabotage</h2><p><strong>Some leaders move.

Still, the city tries to erase protection for the most vulnerable. On Review Avenue, a new protected bike lane opened after years of struggle. Cyclists now have a sliver of safety. &ldquo;The old street was very dangerous,&rdquo; said a daily rider. The new path is <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/27/eyes-on-the-street-new-bike-lane-puts-the-bliss-in-blissville>definitely safer because he no longer fights trucks for space</a>.</p><p>But for every step forward, another is lost. The mayor removes bike lanes. The council debates. Children die. The city counts bodies.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> Since 2022, they have caused 301 deaths and over 26,000 injuries to pedestrians and cyclists. Trucks and buses killed 93. Motorcycles and mopeds killed 10. Bikes killed 11. The numbers are cold. The pain is not.</p><h2 id=what-now-demand-action>What Now: Demand Action</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every death is preventable. The city has the power to lower speed limits, build real protection, and stop repeat offenders. <strong>Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph limit. Demand protected lanes. Demand enforcement that targets the real danger—drivers, not cyclists or children.</strong></p><p>The city will not save you. Only your voice, raised with others, can force their hand.

Twenty-eight dead in six months. Kids hit harder. Hit-and-runs double. City promises action, but blood still runs. Advocates demand street redesign, car-free school zones, and tougher rules. The Bronx waits. Danger grows.</p><p class=mb3>A new report from Transportation Alternatives, released July 20, 2022, shows a grim rise in Bronx road deaths. In the first half of 2022, 28 people died—up 22 percent from last year, and double the toll from 2014, when Vision Zero began. The report, titled 'Bronx Bummer: Road Deaths are Up in the Boogie Down, Report Shows,' calls out the city’s failure to protect its most vulnerable. Danny Harris, TA’s executive director, urges 'bold action to physically redesign streets' and pushes for measures like the NYC 25X25 plan, more bus lanes, daylighting corners, higher taxes on heavy vehicles, and stronger enforcement against dangerous drivers. The Department of Transportation, represented by Vin Barone, claims historic investments and promises new bike and bus lanes, especially in underserved Bronx neighborhoods. Still, the death count climbs. Advocates want car-free school streets and safer crossings. The city’s response lags behind the crisis.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The case, rooted in the fatal crash on a hazardous Fort Greene street, alleges city negligence: 'The city Department of Transportation and NYPD were negligent — and bear a substantial responsibility — regarding the death last year of a 3-month-old baby after an unlicensed driver with a long record of recklessness struck another car as he was being chased by police on a 'dangerous' Fort Greene road, a bombshell new lawsuit alleges.' The suit faults the city for failing to redesign the intersection of Vanderbilt and Gates Avenues, ignoring the Reckless Driver Accountability Act, and allowing unsafe police pursuit. The driver, Tyrik Mott, faces criminal charges. The city has since proposed closing part of Gates Avenue to cars. No council members are named; this is a direct legal challenge to city agencies.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Now, city leaders slash speed limits to 20 mph. They target injuries next. Streets get daylighted corners, curb extensions, and raised intersections. No ticket blitz. Just slower cars. Safety comes first.</p><p class=mb3>On July 14, 2022, Hoboken’s city council unanimously approved a new law to lower the citywide speed limit from 25 to 20 mph. The measure, part of Hoboken’s Vision Zero push, aims to end all traffic violence by 2030. The city’s matter summary reads: officials 'began the process of lowering speed limits from 25 miles per hour to 20, as part of its effort to end all forms of traffic violence.' Mayor Ravi Bhalla backed the move, saying, 'that extra time could very well end up saving the life of a child or senior citizen.' Ryan Sharp, parking and transportation director, stressed the need to keep pushing for safer streets. The city focuses on infrastructure—daylighting, curb extensions, raised intersections—over enforcement. Police will educate, not ticket. Hoboken’s model shows small cities can make streets safe for walkers, cyclists, and all vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
