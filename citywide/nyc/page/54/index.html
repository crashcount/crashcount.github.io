In the first half of 2022, 28 people died—up 22 percent from last year, and double the toll from 2014, when Vision Zero began. The report, titled 'Bronx Bummer: Road Deaths are Up in the Boogie Down, Report Shows,' calls out the city’s failure to protect its most vulnerable. Danny Harris, TA’s executive director, urges 'bold action to physically redesign streets' and pushes for measures like the NYC 25X25 plan, more bus lanes, daylighting corners, higher taxes on heavy vehicles, and stronger enforcement against dangerous drivers. The Department of Transportation, represented by Vin Barone, claims historic investments and promises new bike and bus lanes, especially in underserved Bronx neighborhoods. Still, the death count climbs. Advocates want car-free school streets and safer crossings.

The case, rooted in the fatal crash on a hazardous Fort Greene street, alleges city negligence: 'The city Department of Transportation and NYPD were negligent — and bear a substantial responsibility — regarding the death last year of a 3-month-old baby after an unlicensed driver with a long record of recklessness struck another car as he was being chased by police on a 'dangerous' Fort Greene road, a bombshell new lawsuit alleges.'

The driver, Tyrik Mott, faces criminal charges. The city has since proposed closing part of Gates Avenue to cars.

Wellington Chen, executive director of the Chinatown Partnership, praised the move, calling it "healthier and safer for both shopkeepers and customers." The plan includes new plaza features and changes to nearby parking for commercial loading. The effort is part of a broader city push, with BIDs leading similar projects across New York. The conversion gives crowded Chinatown a rare, needed refuge for pedestrians and local businesses.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Safety comes first.</p><p class=mb3>On July 14, 2022, Hoboken’s city council unanimously approved a new law to lower the citywide speed limit from 25 to 20 mph. The measure, part of Hoboken’s Vision Zero push, aims to end all traffic violence by 2030. The city’s matter summary reads: officials 'began the process of lowering speed limits from 25 miles per hour to 20, as part of its effort to end all forms of traffic violence.' Mayor Ravi Bhalla backed the move, saying, 'that extra time could very well end up saving the life of a child or senior citizen.' Ryan Sharp, parking and transportation director, stressed the need to keep pushing for safer streets. The city focuses on infrastructure—daylighting, curb extensions, raised intersections—over enforcement. Police will educate, not ticket.

The report, covered by Streetsblog NYC, finds that 'it all starts with bad design.' Pedestrian deaths rose 4.7 percent in 2020, hitting a 40-year high in 2021. Beth Osborne, director of Transportation for America, highlights that over 70 percent of urban pedestrian fatalities occur on multi-lane arterial roads, which make up only 15 percent of streets. Osborne urges systemic change: 'Safety has to be the default.' The report calls for better data, stronger design standards, and smarter use of federal funds. No council members are named; this is a national policy report, not a local bill. The findings underline a simple truth: dangerous roads kill, and only bold redesign will save lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
