The dead include children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians. The city keeps count, but the numbers do not bleed. A 17-year-old boy died in Brooklyn last week, thrown from a moped after a car turned left in front of him. His passenger, 14, left unconscious in the street. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/teen-boy-dead-man-critically-injured-in-moped-crash-in-brooklyn/>Jhoan later died at the hospital.</a> The driver stayed.

But the pace is slow. The city removed a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue. Cyclists <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/cyclists-fuming-over-mayor-adamss-removal-of-bedford-avenue-protected-bike-lane>asked</a>, &ldquo;What the fuck!
