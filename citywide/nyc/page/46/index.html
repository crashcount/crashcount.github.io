The piece, titled 'On This World Day of Remembrance, Get Angry — And Take Action,' highlights a record number of U.S. cities demanding change as pedestrian deaths hit a 40-year high and overall fatalities set a 16-year record. The article urges readers to 'recognize deadly patterns, push for better data, demand action from transportation leaders, and not accept excuses.' It criticizes road design that prioritizes speed, the auto industry's push for larger vehicles, and the false promise of electric vehicles as a safety solution. The statement insists that Vision Zero is possible if political will and community demand align, and that every traffic death is preventable.
