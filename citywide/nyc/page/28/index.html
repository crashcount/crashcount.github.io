The project, described as a 'model for other streets,' included flipping one-way traffic, coral paint at intersections, curb extensions, and barriers to keep drivers out. The redesign faced delays from supply chain issues and local opposition. Brent Bovenzi, a volunteer with the North Brooklyn Open Streets Community Coalition, praised the changes, saying, 'Ultimately all of those physical things are what every local street in this city should have.' Residents like David Burgos noted, 'It did lower the traffic.' The street now has two-way bike markings, lower speed limits, and expanded pedestrian space.
