DOT resists, but pressure mounts.</p><p class=mb3>On November 9, 2023, Queens Community Board 6 and Manhattan Community Board 6 passed resolutions supporting universal daylighting at intersections. The matter, described as 'calling for the universal daylighting of the city's roughly 40,000 intersections,' urges the city to enforce state law prohibiting parking within 20 feet of crosswalks. Queens CB6 voted unanimously; Manhattan CB6 voted 38-3 in favor. Peter Beadle, chair of Queens CB6’s Transportation, Public Transit, and Street Safety committee, highlighted the risk of blocked sightlines, saying, 'People get that it can be hard to see someone who’s on the corner and on the other side of an SUV.' The boards join others in demanding action after recent pedestrian fatalities. The Department of Transportation claims daylighting is not always the answer, but advocates and board leaders insist the public’s concern for street safety must be taken seriously.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as a call to treat traffic violence with the same urgency as all violent crimes, highlights the city’s failure to upgrade a Senior Pedestrian Zone. Oss demanded safe infrastructure and responsible policies, saying, "Traffic crashes and fatalities need to be handled with the same urgency and prevention as all violent crimes." Transportation Alternatives’ Danny Harris condemned the city’s lack of political will, noting, "The city of New York has the tools to stop traffic violence, especially for older New Yorkers, but lacks the political will to make our streets safe." Oss also criticized delays to a critical bike lane project. The intersection remains unchanged, despite repeated crashes and injuries.

Ossé stated, 'Traffic crashes and fatalities demand the same attention as other forms of violence in the city.' He urged the city to strengthen safe infrastructure and education.

The piece states, 'There is no safe, legal, and easy way to ride through downtown Jamaica. It's time for that to change.' The author supports busways but opposes the current streetscape plan, legalizing cycling on bus lanes, and expanding bike parking without access. The plan leaves the Queens Boulevard bike lane ending at Hillside Avenue, with no safe north-south or east-west bike routes. The author urges protected bike lanes on Sutphin, Parsons, Merrick, and 168th, plus Archer Avenue. The absence of safe infrastructure has left 255 cyclists injured since 2016. The message is clear: red paint is not protection.
