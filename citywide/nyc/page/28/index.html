The Department of Transportation (DOT) has held workshops but released no plans, despite 101 crashes and 39 injuries in the past year. Advocates like Kate Nicholson and Juan Serra called Morgan Avenue 'a death trap' and demanded protected bike lanes with hard barriers.

Vision Zero’s promise fades as deaths mount.</p><p class=mb3>On November 3, 2023, Councilmember Chi Oss issued a statement after Yvonne Sandiford, a senior, was struck and killed by two hit-and-run drivers at New York Avenue and Herkimer Street. The matter, described as a call to treat traffic violence with the same urgency as all violent crimes, highlights the city’s failure to upgrade a Senior Pedestrian Zone. Oss demanded safe infrastructure and responsible policies, saying, "Traffic crashes and fatalities need to be handled with the same urgency and prevention as all violent crimes." Transportation Alternatives’ Danny Harris condemned the city’s lack of political will, noting, "The city of New York has the tools to stop traffic violence, especially for older New Yorkers, but lacks the political will to make our streets safe." Oss also criticized delays to a critical bike lane project. The intersection remains unchanged, despite repeated crashes and injuries. So far this year, 207 people have died on city streets, including 26 cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident occurred at New York Avenue and Herkimer Street, where a 79-year-old woman was struck by two drivers who fled. Ossé stated, 'Traffic crashes and fatalities demand the same attention as other forms of violence in the city.' He urged the city to strengthen safe infrastructure and education. Advocacy group Transportation Alternatives noted the city has the tools to stop traffic violence, especially for older New Yorkers, but lacks political will. The NYC Streets Plan legally requires intersection upgrades and car-free pedestrian spaces, yet this intersection remains unchanged. No arrests have been made. The case highlights systemic failure to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Bus lanes cut through, but bikes get no safe path. The city’s plan dead-ends bike lanes at Hillside Avenue. Riders face danger or break the law. Paint is not protection. Cyclists demand real lanes.</p><p class=mb3>This advocacy opinion, published November 3, 2023, calls out the Jamaica NOW: Urban Design Strategy and Streetscape Plan for failing cyclists. The piece states, 'There is no safe, legal, and easy way to ride through downtown Jamaica. It's time for that to change.' The author supports busways but opposes the current streetscape plan, legalizing cycling on bus lanes, and expanding bike parking without access. The plan leaves the Queens Boulevard bike lane ending at Hillside Avenue, with no safe north-south or east-west bike routes. The author urges protected bike lanes on Sutphin, Parsons, Merrick, and 168th, plus Archer Avenue. The absence of safe infrastructure has left 255 cyclists injured since 2016. The message is clear: red paint is not protection. Downtown Jamaica needs real, separated bike lanes to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
