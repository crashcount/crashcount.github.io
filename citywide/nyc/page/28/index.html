The toll mounts. Action lags.</p><p class=mb3>On November 11, 2023, North Brooklyn residents and advocates rallied for urgent safety upgrades on Morgan Avenue, a corridor linking Bushwick, Williamsburg, and Greenpoint. The event, organized by Transportation Alternatives, highlighted the street’s deadly record: four deaths since 2016, including two in less than two years—delivery worker Danny Vidal and cyclist Eugene Schroeder, both struck by truck drivers. The Department of Transportation (DOT) has held workshops but released no plans, despite 101 crashes and 39 injuries in the past year. Advocates like Kate Nicholson and Juan Serra called Morgan Avenue 'a death trap' and demanded protected bike lanes with hard barriers. DOT claims the road must accommodate large trucks, but locals insist safety upgrades are overdue. The city’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed to daily danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
