In the past three years, sedans and SUVs together took nearly 300 lives and left thousands more broken. Trucks and buses killed 93. Motorcycles and mopeds killed 10. Bikes killed 11.

Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. Each year, Albany must vote to keep them on.

The numbers do not fall fast enough.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. These are not accidents.

Both boards passed strong resolutions. They want the city to enforce no-parking zones near crosswalks. Their votes follow recent pedestrian deaths. Advocates say visibility saves lives. DOT resists, but pressure mounts.</p><p class=mb3>On November 9, 2023, Queens Community Board 6 and Manhattan Community Board 6 passed resolutions supporting universal daylighting at intersections. The matter, described as 'calling for the universal daylighting of the city's roughly 40,000 intersections,' urges the city to enforce state law prohibiting parking within 20 feet of crosswalks. Queens CB6 voted unanimously; Manhattan CB6 voted 38-3 in favor. Peter Beadle, chair of Queens CB6’s Transportation, Public Transit, and Street Safety committee, highlighted the risk of blocked sightlines, saying, 'People get that it can be hard to see someone who’s on the corner and on the other side of an SUV.' The boards join others in demanding action after recent pedestrian fatalities. The Department of Transportation claims daylighting is not always the answer, but advocates and board leaders insist the public’s concern for street safety must be taken seriously.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the driver was inattentive or distracted. In the back seat, a four-year-old boy suffered severe bleeding and died. He was wearing a seatbelt and the airbag deployed. The report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor. The child, a rear passenger, was not ejected.
