The plan sets deadlines and calls for policy changes to curb deaths and injuries on dangerous streets.</p><p class=mb3>On November 28, 2023, four city and state lawmakers released the Western Queens Street Safety Plan. The plan, not yet in formal bill stage, covers neighborhoods like Long Island City, Astoria, Elmhurst, and Jackson Heights. It calls for a 'protected bike lane network, more pedestrian space, a ban on parking near intersections, more space for micromobility users, and policy changes to improve safety.' Lawmakers demand these projects by 2029, including opening the Queensboro Bridge’s south outer roadway to pedestrians, redesigning 31st Avenue, and universal daylighting. The plan also pushes for automated enforcement, lower speed limits, higher fees for heavy vehicles, and bus lanes on every major route. The lawmakers’ statement reads: 'Even one death is too many, and these 13 tragedies have had a major impact on Western Queens residents.' Their plan aims to hold officials accountable and make streets safer for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, described as a 'model for other streets,' included flipping one-way traffic, coral paint at intersections, curb extensions, and barriers to keep drivers out. The redesign faced delays from supply chain issues and local opposition. Brent Bovenzi, a volunteer with the North Brooklyn Open Streets Community Coalition, praised the changes, saying, 'Ultimately all of those physical things are what every local street in this city should have.' Residents like David Burgos noted, 'It did lower the traffic.' The street now has two-way bike markings, lower speed limits, and expanded pedestrian space.
