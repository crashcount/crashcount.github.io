DOT resists, but pressure mounts.</p><p class=mb3>On November 9, 2023, Queens Community Board 6 and Manhattan Community Board 6 passed resolutions supporting universal daylighting at intersections. The matter, described as 'calling for the universal daylighting of the city's roughly 40,000 intersections,' urges the city to enforce state law prohibiting parking within 20 feet of crosswalks. Queens CB6 voted unanimously; Manhattan CB6 voted 38-3 in favor. Peter Beadle, chair of Queens CB6’s Transportation, Public Transit, and Street Safety committee, highlighted the risk of blocked sightlines, saying, 'People get that it can be hard to see someone who’s on the corner and on the other side of an SUV.' The boards join others in demanding action after recent pedestrian fatalities. The Department of Transportation claims daylighting is not always the answer, but advocates and board leaders insist the public’s concern for street safety must be taken seriously.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

We Need to Talk About It." The piece is not a council bill but a forceful policy statement. It highlights how car-centric planning and urban sprawl endanger children, stating, "Car drivers' rights are not more important than children's rights to be safe on our streets." The editorial opposes car-based infrastructure and victim-blaming, while supporting lower speed limits, car-free zones, and higher fees for large vehicles. It urges a public reckoning with the normalized violence of cars, especially around schools. The editorial demands urgent action to protect vulnerable road users and challenges the privileged status of drivers over children’s safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
