Locals demand real change.</p><p class=mb3>On February 23, 2024, Brooklyn’s Community Board 7 nearly unanimously endorsed the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) proposal to redesign Third Avenue, a corridor where 14 people have died since 2016. The board’s transportation committee chair called the changes 'long overdue.' The plan, discussed in workshops since spring 2023, would reduce the avenue from three to two moving lanes each way, add parking-protected bike lanes, and install painted pedestrian islands. Board members, including Katie Walsh and Gabino Morales, voiced strong support, with Morales stating, 'This is just a beginning of what we could do to fix our community.' Diana Gonzalez described the avenue as a place where 'they're gonna kill you.' The board will urge DOT to go beyond paint and install hard infrastructure. DOT aims to finalize plans after further traffic analysis, with implementation possible in late 2024.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The sole occupant, a 38-year-old male driver, suffered fatal head injuries and internal bleeding, dying at the scene. The report explicitly cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor. The SUV struck the truck's center rear while the truck was slowing or stopping. No other injuries were reported. The police narrative states, 'A Chevy SUV drove straight into a slowing freight truck. The driver, 38, unbelted, struck his head. Internal bleeding. No one else in the car. He died there, alone, before the lights came.' The data highlights driver distraction as the critical factor in this deadly collision.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The proposal, aimed at the Adams administration and City Council, calls for mandatory safety standards, paid time for workers, speed-limited e-bikes with safe batteries, and robust data sharing. Danny Harris, the group’s executive director, said, “Same-day delivery apps would be regulated by New York City and then charged for the privilege of operating.” The recommendations also demand safe charging stations, secure bike parking, and a ban on moped sales to unlicensed drivers. Harris stressed, “The industry’s created a race to the bottom which has made delivery worker the most dangerous profession in the city.” The proposal urges the city to phase out gas-powered delivery vehicles, ban immediate delivery promises, and prioritize protected bike lanes using delivery data. Industry representatives pushed back, but Harris insisted the current system endangers workers and the public.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

City employees must also complete safety courses and report crashes. The order exempts emergency agencies and cases of impracticability. The matter aims to address the high rate of pedestrian and cyclist deaths involving trucks. Department of Citywide Administrative Services Commissioner Dawn Pinnock called it 'a major step towards safer streets for New Yorkers, and a big win for our city.'
