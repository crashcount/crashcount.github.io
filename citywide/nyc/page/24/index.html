A westbound Ford pickup truck, making a left turn, struck her with its left front bumper, causing fatal head injuries. The report states she was crossing at the intersection, with no signal present. The driver was licensed and operating a 2010 Ford pickup. The police narrative notes the woman died at the scene. The contributing factors are listed as 'Unspecified' in the report, but the sequence of events centers on the driver’s left turn into the crosswalk where the pedestrian was present.

The bill, named for 12-year-old Sammy Cohen Eckstein, killed by a driver in 2013, failed in Albany last year. Hochul included the measure in her executive budget, stating, “I think it’s ridiculous that the City of New York is forced to ask the State’s permission to reduce speed limits.” Mayor Adams, advocates, and lawmakers rallied for the bill. Amy Cohen, Sammy’s mother, said, “We can’t wait any longer. People like Sammy, and so many others are dying on our streets.” The bill would allow, but not require, the city to lower its speed limit from 25 mph to 20 mph.
