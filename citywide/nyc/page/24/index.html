In an interview, de Blasio reviews ten years of Vision Zero, saying, 'lowering speed limits, speed cameras, traffic redesigns – they all contributed.' He singles out Queens Boulevard as a success. De Blasio urges stronger laws for reckless drivers and more freedom to place speed cameras. He insists the city must 'guarantee the safety of New Yorkers,' even over local opposition. He supports congestion pricing, mass transit, and equity in enforcement. De Blasio calls for 'common-sense safety measures' for e-bikes and e-scooters.

The article, titled 'Video Unmasks NYPD Lies About ‘Resolved’ Bike Lane Complaints,' documents how government workers used city-issued placards to block bike lanes. Between November 15 and January 25, 1,177 complaints were filed. In 27% of cases, NYPD officers falsely claimed the bike lane was clear, ignoring photographic evidence. The most common response—'took action to fix the condition'—resulted in no tickets or tows. Only five summonses were confirmed, despite NYPD claims of 66. Internal Affairs and the Brooklyn DA failed to hold officers accountable. The article calls for replacing NYPD with traffic enforcement agents for 311 bike lane complaints and requiring photographic proof of enforcement. Until consequences exist for lying, placard abuse and blocked bike lanes will endanger cyclists and pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Julianne Munford, a wheelchair user, said, 'To me, their attitude is like, So what you’re in a wheelchair. Deal with it.' Despite repeated complaints to the local precinct, DOT, and Mayor's Office for People with Disabilities, enforcement is absent. Official warnings and signage have failed.

The bill, named for 12-year-old Sammy Cohen Eckstein, killed by a driver in 2013, failed in Albany last year. Hochul included the measure in her executive budget, stating, “I think it’s ridiculous that the City of New York is forced to ask the State’s permission to reduce speed limits.” Mayor Adams, advocates, and lawmakers rallied for the bill. Amy Cohen, Sammy’s mother, said, “We can’t wait any longer. People like Sammy, and so many others are dying on our streets.” The bill would allow, but not require, the city to lower its speed limit from 25 mph to 20 mph. In 2014, a similar change led to a 36-percent drop in pedestrian deaths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the man stepped into the street where there was 'no light, no crosswalk.' A northbound Mercedes SUV struck him head-on. The pedestrian suffered head trauma and internal bleeding and died at the scene. The police report explicitly cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor in the crash. The SUV's point of impact was the center front end, consistent with a direct collision. The report notes the pedestrian was 'crossing, no signal, or crosswalk,' but lists driver inattention as the primary cause. The deadly outcome unfolded on a street lacking basic pedestrian infrastructure, with driver error at its core.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
