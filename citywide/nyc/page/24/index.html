A black SUV hit him. He died on the street. The driver stayed. Police said, &ldquo;They were walking, he was crossing the street with his sister&rdquo; (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>police said</a>). No arrest. The street is still open. The danger is still there.</p><p>The day before, in the Bronx, a man ran a red light. His car jumped the curb and crushed three people on the sidewalk. One is still fighting for life. The driver ran but police caught him. He faces charges for assault, fleeing, and driving without a license (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/driver-flees-bronx-car-stop-crash/>faces charges</a>).</p><p><strong>In the last 12 months, 244 people have died on New York City streets. 713 were seriously hurt.</strong> Thirteen of the dead were children. The city logs over 81,000 crashes a year. Each number is a name, a family, a future gone.</p><h3 id=the-policy-that-wasnt>The Policy That Wasn&rsquo;t</h3><p>Leaders talk. Streets stay the same. The mayor ripped out a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue after crashes involving children. He said he was listening to the community. Cyclists said, &ldquo;I don’t think he cares if we die&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/cyclists-fuming-over-mayor-adamss-removal-of-bedford-avenue-protected-bike-lane>Cyclists said</a>). The city put back paint. Paint does not stop cars.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Department of Transportation built a new protected bike lane in Queens. A commuter said, &ldquo;The old street was very dangerous&mldr; the new path is definitely safer because he&rsquo;s no longer competing with trucks and cars for road space&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/27/eyes-on-the-street-new-bike-lane-puts-the-bliss-in-blissville>A commuter said</a>). But these changes come slow. Too slow for the dead.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-that-dont-lie>The Numbers That Don&rsquo;t Lie</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks killed 299 people.</strong> Motorcycles and mopeds killed 21. Bikes killed 11. The city counts 182,570 injuries since 2022. The bodies pile up. The city debates.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call your council member. Call the mayor.

The board’s transportation committee chair called the changes 'long overdue.' The plan, discussed in workshops since spring 2023, would reduce the avenue from three to two moving lanes each way, add parking-protected bike lanes, and install painted pedestrian islands. Board members, including Katie Walsh and Gabino Morales, voiced strong support, with Morales stating, 'This is just a beginning of what we could do to fix our community.' Diana Gonzalez described the avenue as a place where 'they're gonna kill you.' The board will urge DOT to go beyond paint and install hard infrastructure.

The proposal, aimed at the Adams administration and City Council, calls for mandatory safety standards, paid time for workers, speed-limited e-bikes with safe batteries, and robust data sharing. Danny Harris, the group’s executive director, said, “Same-day delivery apps would be regulated by New York City and then charged for the privilege of operating.” The recommendations also demand safe charging stations, secure bike parking, and a ban on moped sales to unlicensed drivers. Harris stressed, “The industry’s created a race to the bottom which has made delivery worker the most dangerous profession in the city.” The proposal urges the city to phase out gas-powered delivery vehicles, ban immediate delivery promises, and prioritize protected bike lanes using delivery data. Industry representatives pushed back, but Harris insisted the current system endangers workers and the public.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crash occurred at 20:14. The report states the woman was crossing the street, not at an intersection or signal. The sedan hit her with its left front bumper. She died at the scene. Police cite 'Unsafe Speed' as a contributing factor, noting, 'His speed was too much.' The driver continued straight ahead. The report does not attribute any contributing factors to the pedestrian’s actions.

The order requires contractors with large vehicles to use high-vision trucks or install surround cameras, submit fleet-safety plans, ensure driver licensing, report crashes, and install telematics. City employees must also complete safety courses and report crashes. The order exempts emergency agencies and cases of impracticability. The matter aims to address the high rate of pedestrian and cyclist deaths involving trucks. Department of Citywide Administrative Services Commissioner Dawn Pinnock called it 'a major step towards safer streets for New Yorkers, and a big win for our city.' Kate Brockwehl of Families for Safe Streets said, 'We know these safety solutions will save lives in the five boroughs.' The order impacts over 23,000 trucks and expands on previous city safety pilots.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Experts like Leah Shahum and Terje Elvaas stress, "The foundation for reaching Vision Zero is to significantly reduce the number of cars on the road." The piece criticizes Adams for retreating from bold safety projects and contrasts New York’s inaction with decisive moves in Oslo, Hoboken, and Paris.
