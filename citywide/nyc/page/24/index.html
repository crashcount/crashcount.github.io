The incident occurred mid-block, away from any intersection or signal. The report describes head trauma and severe bleeding, with the victim dying at the scene, caught between the curb and the car’s front end. The police narrative states the pedestrian was 'crossing mid-block without a signal.' The vehicle’s point of impact and damage were both centered on the front end, consistent with a direct collision. The report lists 'unspecified' as the contributing factor for both driver and pedestrian, offering no further detail on driver actions. The focus remains on the lethal interaction between a moving sedan and a vulnerable pedestrian in daylight, with the system’s gaps leaving another life lost on Brooklyn’s streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'They Don’t Care: Cops, Placard Perps Block Disabled Drop-Off Zones,' highlights how city employees, including NYPD and Fire Department staff, routinely block spaces meant for disabled transit users. Activists and organizations like Independence Care System and the Brooklyn Center for Independence of the Disabled say these spots are almost never available. Julianne Munford, a wheelchair user, said, 'To me, their attitude is like, So what you’re in a wheelchair. Deal with it.' Despite repeated complaints to the local precinct, DOT, and Mayor's Office for People with Disabilities, enforcement is absent. Official warnings and signage have failed. City officials, including Rich Davey, express frustration but admit, 'Ultimately, nothing real has happened.' The ongoing placard abuse strips away safety and dignity from vulnerable New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A westbound Ford pickup truck, making a left turn, struck her with its left front bumper, causing fatal head injuries. The report states she was crossing at the intersection, with no signal present. The driver was licensed and operating a 2010 Ford pickup. The police narrative notes the woman died at the scene. The contributing factors are listed as 'Unspecified' in the report, but the sequence of events centers on the driver’s left turn into the crosswalk where the pedestrian was present.

The bill, named for 12-year-old Sammy Cohen Eckstein, killed by a driver in 2013, failed in Albany last year. Hochul included the measure in her executive budget, stating, “I think it’s ridiculous that the City of New York is forced to ask the State’s permission to reduce speed limits.” Mayor Adams, advocates, and lawmakers rallied for the bill. Amy Cohen, Sammy’s mother, said, “We can’t wait any longer. People like Sammy, and so many others are dying on our streets.” The bill would allow, but not require, the city to lower its speed limit from 25 mph to 20 mph.
