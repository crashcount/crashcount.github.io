Transportation Alternatives demands they pay to operate, meet safety standards, and protect workers. The group calls for data sharing, safer bikes, and new infrastructure. Industry protests. The city weighs action. Chaos persists. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On February 16, 2024, Transportation Alternatives released a policy recommendation urging New York City to regulate and charge delivery app companies like GrubHub, DoorDash, and Uber Eats for operating in the five boroughs. The proposal, aimed at the Adams administration and City Council, calls for mandatory safety standards, paid time for workers, speed-limited e-bikes with safe batteries, and robust data sharing. Danny Harris, the group’s executive director, said, “Same-day delivery apps would be regulated by New York City and then charged for the privilege of operating.” The recommendations also demand safe charging stations, secure bike parking, and a ban on moped sales to unlicensed drivers. Harris stressed, “The industry’s created a race to the bottom which has made delivery worker the most dangerous profession in the city.” The proposal urges the city to phase out gas-powered delivery vehicles, ban immediate delivery promises, and prioritize protected bike lanes using delivery data. Industry representatives pushed back, but Harris insisted the current system endangers workers and the public.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The order requires contractors with large vehicles to use high-vision trucks or install surround cameras, submit fleet-safety plans, ensure driver licensing, report crashes, and install telematics. City employees must also complete safety courses and report crashes. The order exempts emergency agencies and cases of impracticability. The matter aims to address the high rate of pedestrian and cyclist deaths involving trucks. Department of Citywide Administrative Services Commissioner Dawn Pinnock called it 'a major step towards safer streets for New Yorkers, and a big win for our city.' Kate Brockwehl of Families for Safe Streets said, 'We know these safety solutions will save lives in the five boroughs.' The order impacts over 23,000 trucks and expands on previous city safety pilots.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The collision occurred at 6:15 p.m., leaving the child dead at the scene. The report does not cite any pedestrian actions as contributing factors.

The incident occurred mid-block, away from any intersection or signal. The report describes head trauma and severe bleeding, with the victim dying at the scene, caught between the curb and the car’s front end. The police narrative states the pedestrian was 'crossing mid-block without a signal.' The vehicle’s point of impact and damage were both centered on the front end, consistent with a direct collision. The report lists 'unspecified' as the contributing factor for both driver and pedestrian, offering no further detail on driver actions. The focus remains on the lethal interaction between a moving sedan and a vulnerable pedestrian in daylight, with the system’s gaps leaving another life lost on Brooklyn’s streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Disabled riders lose curb access. Warnings and signs fail. City agencies ignore pleas. Placard abuse strips away hard-won safety for vulnerable New Yorkers. Officials express frustration. Nothing changes. Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On January 26, 2024, Streetsblog NYC reported widespread illegal parking in Access-A-Ride drop-off zones by police officers and city workers. The matter, titled 'They Don’t Care: Cops, Placard Perps Block Disabled Drop-Off Zones,' highlights how city employees, including NYPD and Fire Department staff, routinely block spaces meant for disabled transit users. Activists and organizations like Independence Care System and the Brooklyn Center for Independence of the Disabled say these spots are almost never available. Julianne Munford, a wheelchair user, said, 'To me, their attitude is like, So what you’re in a wheelchair. Deal with it.' Despite repeated complaints to the local precinct, DOT, and Mayor's Office for People with Disabilities, enforcement is absent. Official warnings and signage have failed. City officials, including Rich Davey, express frustration but admit, 'Ultimately, nothing real has happened.' The ongoing placard abuse strips away safety and dignity from vulnerable New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
