Twenty-eight dead in six months. Kids hit harder. Hit-and-runs double. City promises action, but blood still runs. Advocates demand street redesign, car-free school zones, and tougher rules. The Bronx waits. Danger grows.</p><p class=mb3>A new report from Transportation Alternatives, released July 20, 2022, shows a grim rise in Bronx road deaths. In the first half of 2022, 28 people died—up 22 percent from last year, and double the toll from 2014, when Vision Zero began. The report, titled 'Bronx Bummer: Road Deaths are Up in the Boogie Down, Report Shows,' calls out the city’s failure to protect its most vulnerable. Danny Harris, TA’s executive director, urges 'bold action to physically redesign streets' and pushes for measures like the NYC 25X25 plan, more bus lanes, daylighting corners, higher taxes on heavy vehicles, and stronger enforcement against dangerous drivers. The Department of Transportation, represented by Vin Barone, claims historic investments and promises new bike and bus lanes, especially in underserved Bronx neighborhoods. Still, the death count climbs. Advocates want car-free school streets and safer crossings. The city’s response lags behind the crisis.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city faces hard questions.</p><p class=mb3>On July 20, 2022, the parents of Apolline Mong Guillemin filed a lawsuit against the city Department of Transportation and NYPD. The case, rooted in the fatal crash on a hazardous Fort Greene street, alleges city negligence: 'The city Department of Transportation and NYPD were negligent — and bear a substantial responsibility — regarding the death last year of a 3-month-old baby after an unlicensed driver with a long record of recklessness struck another car as he was being chased by police on a 'dangerous' Fort Greene road, a bombshell new lawsuit alleges.' The suit faults the city for failing to redesign the intersection of Vanderbilt and Gates Avenues, ignoring the Reckless Driver Accountability Act, and allowing unsafe police pursuit. The driver, Tyrik Mott, faces criminal charges. The city has since proposed closing part of Gates Avenue to cars. No council members are named; this is a direct legal challenge to city agencies.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project builds on the success of Covid-era open streets and seasonal closures. DOT spokesman Vin Barone said, "DOT is proud to build on the success of our Open Streets with proposals to formalize spaces like the Doyers Open Street as a permanent pedestrian plaza." Wellington Chen, executive director of the Chinatown Partnership, praised the move, calling it "healthier and safer for both shopkeepers and customers." The plan includes new plaza features and changes to nearby parking for commercial loading. The effort is part of a broader city push, with BIDs leading similar projects across New York. The conversion gives crowded Chinatown a rare, needed refuge for pedestrians and local businesses.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city’s matter summary reads: officials 'began the process of lowering speed limits from 25 miles per hour to 20, as part of its effort to end all forms of traffic violence.' Mayor Ravi Bhalla backed the move, saying, 'that extra time could very well end up saving the life of a child or senior citizen.' Ryan Sharp, parking and transportation director, stressed the need to keep pushing for safer streets.

The report, covered by Streetsblog NYC, finds that 'it all starts with bad design.' Pedestrian deaths rose 4.7 percent in 2020, hitting a 40-year high in 2021. Beth Osborne, director of Transportation for America, highlights that over 70 percent of urban pedestrian fatalities occur on multi-lane arterial roads, which make up only 15 percent of streets. Osborne urges systemic change: 'Safety has to be the default.' The report calls for better data, stronger design standards, and smarter use of federal funds.
