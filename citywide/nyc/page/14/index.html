Just last week, an eight-year-old boy was killed crossing Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights. His sister watched. His mother grieves. “He was a boy who loved life,” <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>said his mother</a>.</p><p>Scooter riders, teens on mopeds, and cyclists have all fallen.

The project, first proposed in spring 2023, will run northbound from Dean Street to Flushing Avenue. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "The addition of a parking-protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue will create a critical cycling link in an area where bicycle ridership is booming, while making the road safer for everyone." City Council Member Chi Oss, who criticized delays, now calls the project "a win for everyone." The plan uses concrete barriers, flex-posts, and painted pedestrian islands to shield vulnerable users. Since 2020, five pedestrians have died on this stretch. The project responds to years of advocacy and high crash rates, aiming to protect walkers and cyclists in a busy, dangerous corridor.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Change could save dozens of lives each year.</p><p class=mb3>On September 10, 2024, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) proposed new federal safety standards for vehicles, aiming to "reduce fatalities and serious injuries among pedestrians struck by vehicles." The rules would apply to all new passenger vehicles under 10,000 pounds, including most SUVs and light trucks. The proposal comes after a 75 percent rise in pedestrian deaths since 2009, much of it linked to the high, blocky fronts of modern vehicles. The new standard would require carmakers to design hoods and grilles to reduce the risk of serious or fatal head injuries in crashes up to 25 mph. NHTSA estimates the rule could save 67 lives per year at a cost of about $3 per vehicle. Deputy Administrator Sophie Shulman said, "We have a crisis of roadway deaths, and it’s even worse among vulnerable road users like pedestrians." The move could finally force U.S. automakers to prioritize people outside the car.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, now in committee, would require the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to set strict vehicle safety standards that protect pedestrians and cyclists. The measure calls for benchmarks on vehicle height, hood and bumper design, and blind zone size. It also demands that federal consumer safety ratings reflect how dangerous cars are to people outside them. Scanlon said, “Just the raw statistics make a really compelling case about the incredible, exponential rise in pedestrian and bicyclist deaths.” She acknowledged automaker resistance but insisted, “clearly, we need to do something in order to improve safety.” The bill takes aim at the deadly rise of large vehicles and the federal government’s failure to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
