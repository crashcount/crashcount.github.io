Children, elders, cyclists, and workers are struck down in the crosswalk, on the sidewalk, waiting for the light. The city keeps moving. The blood dries. The next crash comes.</p><p>Just days ago, an eight-year-old boy was killed by an SUV in Crown Heights. The street was wide, the car was heavy, the child was small. The city called it another tragedy. Advocates called it what it is: a failure. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/01/tuesdays-headlines-another-child-sacrificed-to-the-suv-edition>Eastern Parkway acts as a major thoroughfare for drivers, and is the sixth most dangerous street in Brooklyn for pedestrians</a>, said one group, demanding more safety infrastructure to stop the killing.</p><h2 id=policy-progress-and-sabotage>Policy: Progress and Sabotage</h2><p><strong>Some leaders move.

Still, the city tries to erase protection for the most vulnerable. On Review Avenue, a new protected bike lane opened after years of struggle. Cyclists now have a sliver of safety. &ldquo;The old street was very dangerous,&rdquo; said a daily rider. The new path is <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/27/eyes-on-the-street-new-bike-lane-puts-the-bliss-in-blissville>definitely safer because he no longer fights trucks for space</a>.</p><p>But for every step forward, another is lost. The mayor removes bike lanes. The council debates. Children die. The city counts bodies.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> Since 2022, they have caused 301 deaths and over 26,000 injuries to pedestrians and cyclists. Trucks and buses killed 93. Motorcycles and mopeds killed 10. Bikes killed 11. The numbers are cold. The pain is not.</p><h2 id=what-now-demand-action>What Now: Demand Action</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every death is preventable. The city has the power to lower speed limits, build real protection, and stop repeat offenders. <strong>Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph limit. Demand protected lanes. Demand enforcement that targets the real danger—drivers, not cyclists or children.</strong></p><p>The city will not save you. Only your voice, raised with others, can force their hand.

New rules target deadly SUV fronts. Pedestrian deaths soared 75 percent since 2009. The agency wants safer hoods, fewer fatal head injuries. Change could save dozens of lives each year.</p><p class=mb3>On September 10, 2024, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) proposed new federal safety standards for vehicles, aiming to "reduce fatalities and serious injuries among pedestrians struck by vehicles." The rules would apply to all new passenger vehicles under 10,000 pounds, including most SUVs and light trucks. The proposal comes after a 75 percent rise in pedestrian deaths since 2009, much of it linked to the high, blocky fronts of modern vehicles. The new standard would require carmakers to design hoods and grilles to reduce the risk of serious or fatal head injuries in crashes up to 25 mph. NHTSA estimates the rule could save 67 lives per year at a cost of about $3 per vehicle. Deputy Administrator Sophie Shulman said, "We have a crisis of roadway deaths, and it’s even worse among vulnerable road users like pedestrians." The move could finally force U.S. automakers to prioritize people outside the car.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Councilmember Chi Ossé, who represents Bed-Stuy, praised the move as a 'public policy decision with only winners.' The project replaces a painted lane that was 'chronically parked in by drivers,' leaving cyclists exposed. The new 1.5-mile stretch, between Dean Street and Flushing Avenue, will include pedestrian islands and loading zones. Kathy Park Price of Transportation Alternatives called it 'a critical step towards creating an actual safe cycling network.' DOT spokesperson Vincent Barone cited data: protected bike lanes cut pedestrian deaths and injuries by 29.2%, and pedestrian islands by 29.9%. Construction starts this week, with completion expected by year’s end.

Reilly Owens, CB2 transportation chair, praised the plan: 'It is nice when DOT presents something to us that's just completely wonderful.' Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives called the area unsafe: 'There's a lot of trucks and other industrial activity and no protection for cyclists.'

The bill, now in committee, would require the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to set strict vehicle safety standards that protect pedestrians and cyclists. The measure calls for benchmarks on vehicle height, hood and bumper design, and blind zone size. It also demands that federal consumer safety ratings reflect how dangerous cars are to people outside them. Scanlon said, “Just the raw statistics make a really compelling case about the incredible, exponential rise in pedestrian and bicyclist deaths.” She acknowledged automaker resistance but insisted, “clearly, we need to do something in order to improve safety.” The bill takes aim at the deadly rise of large vehicles and the federal government’s failure to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
