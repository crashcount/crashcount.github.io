Transportation Alternatives called the crash 'entirely preventable,' blasting Mayor Adams for slow progress and broken promises. 'If Mayor Adams wants to save lives, he only has to build the streets and intersections that our city needs and our children deserve,' said co-interim director Elizabeth Adams. Despite a 2022 mayoral pledge and DOT promises, no real safety improvements have been made. Activists demand protected bike lanes and street redesign.

The report states the van was 'slowing or stopping' when the motorcycle, traveling southbound, struck its center back end. The 33-year-old motorcyclist, who was unlicensed and wore no helmet, died at the scene after hitting head-first. The police report lists 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' as a contributing factor in the crash, highlighting a critical driver error. The van driver was licensed and operating within the law, while the motorcycle rider's lack of a license and helmet are noted in the report after the primary driver error. The crash left the rider dead in the road, underscoring the lethal consequences of improper lane usage and systemic vulnerability for those outside the protection of steel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

No more quick road reopenings. Streets become sites of failure, not business as usual. The goal: force drivers to slow down, save lives.</p><p class=mb3>This policy proposal, discussed on August 6, 2024, introduces the 'Emergency Streets' intervention. The plan, outlined by Kevin Krizek and Tila Duhaime, demands that after a fatal crash, city officials halve speed limits and install temporary, modular traffic-calming infrastructure within a half-mile radius of the site. These changes would remain for at least two weeks or until the community addresses permanent safety upgrades. The proposal challenges current protocols, which prioritize rapid road reopening over thorough investigation and public awareness. Krizek questions whether returning roads to 'normal' is wise, while Duhaime insists that physical changes—not police enforcement—will force drivers to slow down. The matter summary reads: 'What if, instead, they treated those streets as the site of a catastrophic transportation failure and took immediate action to prevent the worst from happening again?' No council bill number or committee is assigned, as this is a policy concept, not legislation. The proposal centers vulnerable road users and aims to shift responsibility for traffic violence from individuals to the system itself.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
