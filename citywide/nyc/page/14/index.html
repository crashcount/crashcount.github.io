Police say an 84‑year‑old Toyota driver went north on 42nd Street at 19th Avenue and hit a food truck. Two men died there. The driver died too. The police told amNY the driver had suffered a stroke two weeks earlier and had been told not to drive. The victims were identified as 41‑year‑old Joaquin Venancio‑Mendez and 70‑year‑old Santiago Baires. <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/queens/carnage-queens-senior-driver-stroke-crash/>amNY reported</a> the car “careened at a high speed into a nearby food truck, ramming into two men.”</p><p>City data logs the crash with three deaths: two pedestrians and one driver. Both pedestrians were listed as “Other Actions in Roadway.” The driver was unconscious at the scene. Four vehicles were involved. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a> tags it as CrashID 4834594.</p><p>Just after 2:30 AM the next day in Springfield Gardens, a driver struck a 52‑year‑old man at South Conduit Avenue and 155th Street and fled. “The operator of the vehicle fled the scene after hitting the man,” police told <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/police-investigate-hit-run-death-springfield-gardens-queens-john-kennedy-international-airport/17524816/>ABC7</a>. Cops searched for video, but as of that day there were no arrests, the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/13/queens-hit-and-run-driver-kills-52-year-old-man-near-jfk-airport/>Daily News wrote</a>.</p><p>Elsewhere, three more people died in separate crashes this month.

Cameras now run 24/7 through 2030. The worst harm comes from a small set of drivers. Vehicles with piles of camera tickets are far more likely to kill or maim. City leaders have tools. Use them. Make 20 MPH the rule on local streets. Require speed limiters for repeat offenders. Then enforce it.</p><p>If you want those steps now, tell them now.
