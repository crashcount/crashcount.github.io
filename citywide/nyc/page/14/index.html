The report states, 'A van turned right. A man, 59, walked with the light. Steel struck him head-on.' The impact was so severe that the victim suffered injuries to his entire body and died at the scene. The police report notes there were 'no skid marks' and 'no damage to the van.' The contributing factor listed is 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way.' The pedestrian’s lawful crossing is mentioned only after the driver’s error, underscoring the systemic danger posed by vehicles failing to yield at intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
