The impact came from the vehicle’s right front bumper, crushing the man’s arm and causing fatal injuries. The report states the driver did not stop after the collision. Police cite 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor. The pedestrian was crossing against the signal, as noted in the report, but the primary error listed is the driver’s failure to pay attention. The man died at the scene, his blood left on the pavement. The crash underscores the lethal consequences of driver distraction and the systemic dangers faced by people crossing New York City streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The report states the driver was unlicensed. The woman died at the scene, suffering injuries to her entire body. The report notes the pedestrian was not at an intersection and was crossing without a signal or crosswalk, but does not list this as a contributing factor. The police narrative underscores the quiet of the street and the absence of other traffic. The critical failure cited in the report is the driver operating the vehicle without a valid license.

The bill, now in committee, would require the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to set strict vehicle safety standards that protect pedestrians and cyclists. The measure calls for benchmarks on vehicle height, hood and bumper design, and blind zone size. It also demands that federal consumer safety ratings reflect how dangerous cars are to people outside them. Scanlon said, “Just the raw statistics make a really compelling case about the incredible, exponential rise in pedestrian and bicyclist deaths.” She acknowledged automaker resistance but insisted, “clearly, we need to do something in order to improve safety.” The bill takes aim at the deadly rise of large vehicles and the federal government’s failure to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
