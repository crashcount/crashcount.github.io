Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—no one is spared. In June, a 17-year-old boy died after his moped collided with a car in Brooklyn. His passenger, 14, was thrown to the pavement and left unconscious. Days earlier, a cyclist named Amanda Servedio was killed in Astoria, struck by a man fleeing police through red lights and bike lanes. She was coming home from a ride. She never made it back. The <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/staten-island-man-charged-with-murder-in-hit-and-run-crash-with-queens-cyclist>chase lasted ten minutes</a>. Ten minutes of sirens, speed, and fear.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-policy-moves-but-the-blood-stays>The Pattern: Policy Moves, But the Blood Stays</h2><p><strong>The city talks safety. The city counts bodies.</strong> In June, Mayor Adams ripped out a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue. He said it was for safety. Cyclists saw it for what it was. “I don’t think he cares if we die,” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/cyclists-fuming-over-mayor-adamss-removal-of-bedford-avenue-protected-bike-lane>said Jeanette Samyn</a>. The city rolled out new intersection designs—mini-protected bike lanes, daylighting, barriers. “Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety,” <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/nyc-dot-cyclist-safety-intersections/>said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>. But the pace is slow. The danger is fast.</p><h2 id=the-blame-who-pays-who-waits>The Blame: Who Pays, Who Waits</h2><p><strong>Most deaths come from cars and trucks.</strong> In the last three and a half years, they killed 299 people and injured over 26,000. Bikes killed 11. Mopeds and motorcycles killed 10. The city blames speed, then delays lowering limits. The city blames e-bikes, then stalls on safe storage. The city blames the dead, then moves on.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-no-more-waiting>The Next Step: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Every day, someone else is lost.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits. The city can build real protection at every corner. The city can end the bloodletting. But only if you force their hand. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph limit. Demand hardened intersections. Demand action, not excuses.</p><p><strong>If you wait, the street will take someone you love.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The plan, which narrows the boulevard from four lanes to two, faces opposition from local elected officials, including Council Member Joe Borelli, who called it a 'recurring bad idea.' Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, citing Hylan's high crash rate and the epidemic of speeding, declared, 'I'm proud to announce that this safety project will move forward in the next couple of weeks.' The DOT maintains that reducing lanes and adding left-turn bays calms traffic and cuts crashes, with injury reductions seen on other city streets.

The piece states, 'Any pedestrianization plan worth its salt will curtail the space for government-subsidized 'free' car storage.'

The danger is clear. The toll is rising.</p><p class=mb3>On July 7, 2022, a University of Illinois study revealed the lethal impact of SUVs on vulnerable road users. The report, titled 'SUVs Are Indeed Death Machines for Children and Black Road Users,' found that SUVs, though involved in only 16.9% of crashes with children, caused 40% of childhood fatalities. Passenger cars, by contrast, made up 62% of such crashes but only 19% of deaths. The study states, 'Children are eight times more likely to be killed if struck by an SUV as opposed to a standard passenger car.' Black residents, just 14.2% of the population, made up 27% of crash victims. The study highlights systemic danger: the size and poor visibility of SUVs, rising fatalities since 2009, and federal inaction. Proposals to increase registration fees and redesign SUV fronts have stalled.
