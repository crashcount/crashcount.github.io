Children hit by SUVs die eight times more often than those struck by cars. Black residents face a higher risk. The rise of large vehicles brings more death. Federal action is missing. The danger is clear. The toll is rising.</p><p class=mb3>On July 7, 2022, a University of Illinois study revealed the lethal impact of SUVs on vulnerable road users. The report, titled 'SUVs Are Indeed Death Machines for Children and Black Road Users,' found that SUVs, though involved in only 16.9% of crashes with children, caused 40% of childhood fatalities. Passenger cars, by contrast, made up 62% of such crashes but only 19% of deaths. The study states, 'Children are eight times more likely to be killed if struck by an SUV as opposed to a standard passenger car.' Black residents, just 14.2% of the population, made up 27% of crash victims. The study highlights systemic danger: the size and poor visibility of SUVs, rising fatalities since 2009, and federal inaction. Proposals to increase registration fees and redesign SUV fronts have stalled. Tom Flood, a former auto marketer, blames manufacturers for fueling demand for these deadly vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Seven injured. Brooklyn streets ran red this weekend. Drivers struck, dragged, and killed. Victims included a child and an elder. Officials spoke. Promises made. The toll climbs. Vision Zero falters. Blood on the asphalt. The crisis deepens.</p><p class=mb3>On June 26, 2022, Mayor Eric Adams and Department of Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez issued a joint statement after a weekend of deadly crashes in Brooklyn. The statement followed a spate of violence: 'Car drivers killed at least three people and injured seven others, including an 11-year-old boy.' The carnage included hit-and-runs, reckless driving, and unlicensed operators. Adams and Rodriguez said they are 'working every day to deliver true public safety for pedestrians, cyclists, and everyone who uses our streets.' They acknowledged recent progress but warned, 'the disturbing incidents we've seen in recent weeks and the last 48 hours remind us just how fragile those positive steps are and how much more work remains.' The city faces one of its most violent years since Vision Zero began. The numbers: 106 killed citywide in the first half of 2022, surpassing 2015. The crisis is not over. The danger remains.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
