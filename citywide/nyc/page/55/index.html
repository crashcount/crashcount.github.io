Safety comes first.</p><p class=mb3>On July 14, 2022, Hoboken’s city council unanimously approved a new law to lower the citywide speed limit from 25 to 20 mph. The measure, part of Hoboken’s Vision Zero push, aims to end all traffic violence by 2030. The city’s matter summary reads: officials 'began the process of lowering speed limits from 25 miles per hour to 20, as part of its effort to end all forms of traffic violence.' Mayor Ravi Bhalla backed the move, saying, 'that extra time could very well end up saving the life of a child or senior citizen.' Ryan Sharp, parking and transportation director, stressed the need to keep pushing for safer streets. The city focuses on infrastructure—daylighting, curb extensions, raised intersections—over enforcement. Police will educate, not ticket.

The report, covered by Streetsblog NYC, finds that 'it all starts with bad design.' Pedestrian deaths rose 4.7 percent in 2020, hitting a 40-year high in 2021. Beth Osborne, director of Transportation for America, highlights that over 70 percent of urban pedestrian fatalities occur on multi-lane arterial roads, which make up only 15 percent of streets. Osborne urges systemic change: 'Safety has to be the default.' The report calls for better data, stronger design standards, and smarter use of federal funds. No council members are named; this is a national policy report, not a local bill.

Children hit by SUVs die eight times more often than those struck by cars. Black residents face a higher risk. The rise of large vehicles brings more death. Federal action is missing. The danger is clear. The toll is rising.</p><p class=mb3>On July 7, 2022, a University of Illinois study revealed the lethal impact of SUVs on vulnerable road users. The report, titled 'SUVs Are Indeed Death Machines for Children and Black Road Users,' found that SUVs, though involved in only 16.9% of crashes with children, caused 40% of childhood fatalities. Passenger cars, by contrast, made up 62% of such crashes but only 19% of deaths. The study states, 'Children are eight times more likely to be killed if struck by an SUV as opposed to a standard passenger car.' Black residents, just 14.2% of the population, made up 27% of crash victims. The study highlights systemic danger: the size and poor visibility of SUVs, rising fatalities since 2009, and federal inaction. Proposals to increase registration fees and redesign SUV fronts have stalled. Tom Flood, a former auto marketer, blames manufacturers for fueling demand for these deadly vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
