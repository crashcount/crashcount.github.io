Seven hundred thirty-four suffered wounds so grave they will never be the same. The dead are not numbers. A 76-year-old woman, struck by an SUV while crossing White Plains Road. A 32-year-old woman, crushed by a Jeep on Marcus Garvey Boulevard. A 79-year-old man, found dead in a parked car on West 77th.

The incident reignited calls for pedestrian safety from business improvement districts (BIDs) and advocates. The matter, described as 'renewed calls from BIDs and safe-streets advocates for accelerated pedestrian improvements and full pedestrianization of Broadway,' highlights the slow progress of the city's 'Broadway Vision' project, which began in 2009 and has only fully pedestrianized six blocks. BID leaders James Mettham, Jennifer Falk, and Tom Harris voiced strong support for expanding pedestrian areas and protected bike lanes. Cory Epstein of Transportation Alternatives called pedestrianization a 'win-win.' Mayor Adams, however, showed reluctance, deferring decisions to the transportation commissioner. The Department of Transportation promised more information soon. Advocates and BIDs continue to push for a car-free Broadway, citing proven safety and business benefits.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary states, 'The city will install a two-way protected bike lane along Ashland Place and Navy Street, a dangerous, narrow stretch of roadway.'

Jeanette Brown, a local resident, called for more sidewalk space for pedestrians. Since 2018, 297 crashes have caused 111 injuries, including 22 cyclists and 28 pedestrians.

Streets kill, not tents. Sweeps push people into danger. Advocates demand safer roads, lower speeds, better lighting, and housing. Systemic neglect, reckless driving, and bad design fuel the crisis. The fix: redesign, not displacement.</p><p class=mb3>This policy analysis, released June 13, 2022, by Portland State University, exposes the deadly toll of car crashes on unhoused pedestrians. Seventy percent of pedestrians killed in Portland last year lacked permanent housing. The report states: 'The presence of unhoused people does not make our streets unsafe. Rather, poor roadway design, ongoing neglect and deferred maintenance, recklessness in the form of speeding, operating a vehicle while impaired by drugs or alcohol, and other dangerous driving behavior are all well-documented reasons why there is this alarming uptick in deaths.' No council member is named; the report draws on research and advocates’ voices. The analysis condemns sweeps and bans on campsites, arguing these policies force people into more dangerous corridors and away from services. The study calls for ending sweeps, providing housing, redesigning streets, lowering speed limits, improving lighting, and closing high-crash roads to cars. The message: systemic change, not scapegoating, will save lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
