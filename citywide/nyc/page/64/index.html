In the last twelve months, <strong>243 people died</strong> on New York streets. <strong>708 were left with serious injuries</strong>. Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—none are spared. Just last week, an eight-year-old boy was killed crossing Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights. His sister watched. His mother grieves. “He was a boy who loved life,” <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>said his mother</a>.</p><p>Scooter riders, teens on mopeds, and cyclists have all fallen. On June 26, a 39-year-old man was thrown from his scooter and died on 116th Avenue. No arrests. No comfort. The street is unchanged.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> In the last three years, they took <strong>299 lives</strong> and left thousands more broken. Trucks and buses killed <strong>93</strong>. Motorcycles and mopeds, <strong>10</strong>. Bikes, <strong>11</strong>. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not. Every crash is a family torn open.</p><h3 id=leaders-actbut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Act—But Not Fast Enough</h3><p>The city has moved, but the pace is slow. Speed cameras in school zones are now extended through 2030. “It’s simple: speed cameras save lives and keep New Yorkers safe,” <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>said Governor Hochul</a>. But cameras alone are not enough. Streets need to be rebuilt. Speed limits must drop. The city has the power to set a 20 mph limit. It has not used it.</p><p>Some leaders speak plain. “At this point, there are no questions, just facts: speeding kills, and speed cameras save lives,” <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>said State Senator Gounardes</a>. But others drag their feet, or worse, rip out bike lanes and leave riders exposed.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand that repeat speeders are stopped. Do not wait for another child’s name to be written in chalk on the street.</p><p><strong>Act now.

The first crash, at Third Avenue and 76th Street, led to a failure-to-yield charge. The second, at W. 93rd Street and Amsterdam Avenue, saw no charges. These deaths followed Mayor Adams and NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell’s pledge to crack down on reckless drivers. Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine called for 'bold investment and redesign of these dangerous corners,' urging daylighting, calming, and investment in transit and bike infrastructure to reduce car use. Levine stressed, 'We need urgent action to protect pedestrians, including street redesigns and consistent enforcement.' He demanded a goal of zero deaths. The city’s promises remain unmet.

Bike New York called for physically protected lanes, more concrete, and an end to painted lanes and community board vetoes. Director Jon Orcutt said, "Bike lanes that are merely paint are obsolete and mostly useless to New Yorkers on bicycles in today’s city."

The board’s Transportation Committee led the effort, sending DOT a map with six east-west and four north-south protected routes. The matter, described as a call for 'the safest bike lanes, not just paint,' drew support from activists and DOT officials. Laura Shepard said, 'This unanimous vote shows the broad, popular support for protected bike lanes throughout Queens.' Joby Jacob added, 'It is a far better proposal that will keep folks safer than what DOT originally proposed.' DOT spokesperson Seth Stein agreed, saying, 'A bike lane network is exactly what our streets need.' The board’s action centers safety for cyclists and teens, rejecting half-measures.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
