Advocates demand real protection, more concrete, and fewer painted lanes. They call for action, not excuses. The city’s cyclists face danger. The city must do better.</p><p class=mb3>On January 7, 2022, Bike New York sent a letter to new DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. The advocacy group declared, "The DOT bike program you inherit today is no longer a global leader or effective innovator." They criticized the agency for chasing mileage targets over safety and for letting police, film crews, and city vehicles block bike lanes. Bike New York called for physically protected lanes, more concrete, and an end to painted lanes and community board vetoes. Director Jon Orcutt said, "Bike lanes that are merely paint are obsolete and mostly useless to New Yorkers on bicycles in today’s city." DOT spokesman Seth Stein said Rodriguez agrees that a world-class protected bike lane network is key to safer streets and will consider the recommendations. The push is clear: vulnerable cyclists need real protection, not empty promises.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as a call for 'the safest bike lanes, not just paint,' drew support from activists and DOT officials.
