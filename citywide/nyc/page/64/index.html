The advocacy group declared, "The DOT bike program you inherit today is no longer a global leader or effective innovator." They criticized the agency for chasing mileage targets over safety and for letting police, film crews, and city vehicles block bike lanes. Bike New York called for physically protected lanes, more concrete, and an end to painted lanes and community board vetoes. Director Jon Orcutt said, "Bike lanes that are merely paint are obsolete and mostly useless to New Yorkers on bicycles in today’s city." DOT spokesman Seth Stein said Rodriguez agrees that a world-class protected bike lane network is key to safer streets and will consider the recommendations.
