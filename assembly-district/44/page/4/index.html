In this district since 2022, there have been 3,421 crashes, with 10 people killed and 1,978 injured (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data rollup</a>). Bikes and pedestrians take a heavy share: bicyclists had 337 injuries and 2 deaths; pedestrians had 365 injuries and 3 deaths. SUVs and cars led the harm to pedestrians, with trucks next (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>period stats</a>).</p><p>Peak pain comes in the afternoon and evening. Injuries stack up at 2 p.m., 3 p.m., 6 p.m., and 8 p.m. Deaths strike at 1 a.m., 10 a.m., noon, 1 p.m., 3 p.m., 6 p.m., 9 p.m., and 10 p.m. The clock does not save you (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hourly distribution</a>).</p><p>Three corners.

Distraction is logged. Alcohol is logged. A red light blown is logged. These are the inputs the city collects; the outcomes are on the street (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>contributing factors</a>).</p><p>Trucks and turns.</p><p>A 2017 Hino box truck turned right at Ditmas and Coney Island Ave. The teen on the e‑bike was crushed.

Seven Brooklyn officials, including Council Member Shahana Hanif and Assembly Member Robert Carroll, already urged “universal daylighting with hardened materials” at intersections (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/17/seven-brooklyn-electeds-join-growing-calls-for-universal-daylighting>their letter</a>).</li><li>Harden turns and slow right turns on <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Coney Island Avenue</a> and Caton Avenue where trucks cut in and people die.</li><li>Target repeat hotspots like <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Atlantic Avenue</a> with concrete, not paint, and enforce distracted driving where deaths are logged.</li></ul><p>Officials know what works — do they?</p><p>Albany extended the 24‑hour school speed safety program through 2030, a technical bill that kept protections alive (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>S 8344</a>). Another bill would force chronic speeders to slow down with intelligent speed assistance. The proposal, framed as the Stop Super Speeders Act, would require devices for drivers with heavy point totals or camera tickets (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">policy file</a>). Advocates say a tiny pool of drivers does outsized harm and linked high camera‑ticket counts to fatal risk (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/20/the-1-5-percent-of-drivers-who-cause-21-percent-of-pedestrian-deaths>analysis and coverage</a>).</p><p>Lower the speed. Save a life.</p><p>New York City has the power to set safer speeds under Sammy’s Law, and groups are pushing for a default 20 mph limit and controls on repeat speeders.

Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymember Bobby Carroll, would require all new drivers in New York State to complete six hours of professional driving instruction before taking the road test. The bill was announced on March 29, 2022. Gounardes slammed the current rules as too lenient, saying, "For some drivers, the first time they take the wheel [as a licensed driver] they are in sole control of their car." Carroll called the requirement "reasonable." Stephen Walling, president of the New York State Association of Professional Driving Schools, said the bill would "go a long way towards keeping all New Yorkers safer on our roads." The NYC Department of Transportation called driver education "crucial" for the safety of pedestrians, cyclists, and other road users, and is reviewing the proposal. The bill awaits committee action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The effort is described as 'an unprecedented effort to collect detailed data on bicycle transportation across the state.' The survey asks about riding frequency, infrastructure, barriers, and connections to transit. Assembly Member Robert Carroll and State Senator Julia Salazar have backed related legislation for an e-bike rebate program. The survey’s results will be shared with governments and advocacy groups. Officials say the data will help planners and policymakers 'invest in safer, more equitable multimodal streets.'

The incident, covered by Streetsblog, exposed how reporting traffic violations can put New Yorkers at risk. City Hall called the harassment 'extremely disturbing' and promised to review a Department of Investigation probe, but did not commit to changing NYPD’s handling of 311 complaints. Assembly Member Robert Carroll condemned the threats and demanded accountability if city staff leaked Melone’s information. Council Member Shahana Hanif echoed concern, urging that harassment not silence those reporting dangerous driving. The NYPD did not comment. The city’s lack of action leaves vulnerable road users exposed, as illegal parking blocks sightlines, sidewalks, and bike lanes, endangering lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
