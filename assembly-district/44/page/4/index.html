The violence does not care about age.</p><h3 id=the-most-vulnerable-pay-the-price>The Most Vulnerable Pay the Price</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> SUVs and cars are the main killers, causing the most deaths and injuries. Trucks and buses crush bodies. Bikes and mopeds add to the wounded. The streets are not safe for those outside a steel shell. The old, the young, the ones on foot or on two wheels—these are the ones who bleed.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h3><p>Assembly Member <strong>Robert Carroll</strong> has taken steps. He <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">backed a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters</a>.

Insurance helps after the crash, not before. The streets remain dangerous. The pace of change is slow. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by those in power. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It can end the reign of repeat speeders. It can build real protection at every corner. It can put people before cars. But it will not happen unless you demand it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call Assembly Member Carroll. Tell them to act.</strong> Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a warning.

The effort is described as 'an unprecedented effort to collect detailed data on bicycle transportation across the state.' The survey asks about riding frequency, infrastructure, barriers, and connections to transit. Assembly Member Robert Carroll and State Senator Julia Salazar have backed related legislation for an e-bike rebate program. The survey’s results will be shared with governments and advocacy groups. Officials say the data will help planners and policymakers 'invest in safer, more equitable multimodal streets.'

The incident, covered by Streetsblog, exposed how reporting traffic violations can put New Yorkers at risk. City Hall called the harassment 'extremely disturbing' and promised to review a Department of Investigation probe, but did not commit to changing NYPD’s handling of 311 complaints. Assembly Member Robert Carroll condemned the threats and demanded accountability if city staff leaked Melone’s information. Council Member Shahana Hanif echoed concern, urging that harassment not silence those reporting dangerous driving. The NYPD did not comment. The city’s lack of action leaves vulnerable road users exposed, as illegal parking blocks sightlines, sidewalks, and bike lanes, endangering lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
