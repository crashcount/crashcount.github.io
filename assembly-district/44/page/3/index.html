In this district since 2022, there have been 3,421 crashes, with 10 people killed and 1,978 injured (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data rollup</a>). Bikes and pedestrians take a heavy share: bicyclists had 337 injuries and 2 deaths; pedestrians had 365 injuries and 3 deaths. SUVs and cars led the harm to pedestrians, with trucks next (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>period stats</a>).</p><p>Peak pain comes in the afternoon and evening. Injuries stack up at 2 p.m., 3 p.m., 6 p.m., and 8 p.m. Deaths strike at 1 a.m., 10 a.m., noon, 1 p.m., 3 p.m., 6 p.m., 9 p.m., and 10 p.m. The clock does not save you (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hourly distribution</a>).</p><p>Three corners.

Distraction is logged. Alcohol is logged. A red light blown is logged. These are the inputs the city collects; the outcomes are on the street (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>contributing factors</a>).</p><p>Trucks and turns.</p><p>A 2017 Hino box truck turned right at Ditmas and Coney Island Ave. The teen on the e‑bike was crushed.

Another bill would force chronic speeders to slow down with intelligent speed assistance. The proposal, framed as the Stop Super Speeders Act, would require devices for drivers with heavy point totals or camera tickets (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">policy file</a>). Advocates say a tiny pool of drivers does outsized harm and linked high camera‑ticket counts to fatal risk (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/20/the-1-5-percent-of-drivers-who-cause-21-percent-of-pedestrian-deaths>analysis and coverage</a>).</p><p>Lower the speed. Save a life.</p><p>New York City has the power to set safer speeds under Sammy’s Law, and groups are pushing for a default 20 mph limit and controls on repeat speeders.

He says all regions use transit, all must pay. Exempting suburbs would gut MTA funding. Carroll demands shared cost, warns against service cuts, and calls for real revenue.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Member Robert Carroll issued a legislative statement on April 28, 2023, urging equal cost-sharing for the MTA Payroll Mobility Tax (PMT) increase. The proposal, discussed in the Assembly, faces suburban resistance. Carroll’s statement, titled "When It Comes to Transit, Everyone Must Pay Their Fair Share," argues that exempting suburbs would cost the MTA $325 million and undermine regional transit. Carroll and NYC Assembly colleagues wrote to Speaker Heastie, demanding the PMT hike apply to both city and suburbs or, failing that, that new revenue go only to NYC Transit. Carroll said, "It is unwise and bad policy to abandon the principle of an integrated regional transportation system funded through cost sharing across the jurisdictions that benefit most from the MTA." He warns that letting only city businesses pay would be unfair and would threaten transit service. No formal safety analyst note was provided, but the statement centers on funding the transit system that protects vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>State Senator Andrew Gounardes introduced a bill on March 23, 2023, proposing a 25-cent surcharge on every online delivery package in New York City. The bill, now under review, aims to raise $226 million yearly for city infrastructure. Gounardes said, "We're proposing an infrastructure fund to help pay for some of the capital costs to mitigate some of the consequences of last-mile trucking, and freight growth." The bill responds to a surge in daily package deliveries, now at 2.3 million, and forecasts of 200,000 trucks a day by 2045. Gounardes, the bill's sponsor, wants the city—not the MTA—to control the funds. City Hall has not taken a position but said it welcomes ideas to limit emissions and advance infrastructure. The bill joins other efforts to regulate last-mile delivery and warehouse placement.

The matter: 'Advocates and legislators raced up the stairs...to press their case for Gov. Hochul to do more to fill the MTA's fiscal gap.' Hochul’s plan stabilizes finances but does not boost service or halt fare hikes. Mamdani and Gounardes called for six-minute off-peak trains and new taxes on the wealthy. Gounardes said, 'We all know that we need better service and we need more service.' The proposal remains under negotiation.

Lives depend on it.</p><p class=mb3>On September 27, 2022, Assembly Member Robert Carroll made a public statement supporting congestion pricing in New York City. The matter, titled 'I’m Willing to Take the Heat to Support Congestion Pricing,' was reported by Streetsblog NYC. Carroll opposes broad exemptions, saying, 'Simplicity is key and exemptions should be limited.' He supports only yellow cab drivers for additional exemptions, citing their medallion fees and capped numbers. Carroll insists Uber and Lyft drivers pay every time they enter the zone, regardless of fare. He also backs time-based charges for taxis, for-hire vehicles, and trucks, especially in busy corridors. Carroll acknowledges the financial burden but argues the cost of congestion is greater. He urges swift action, naming London, Milan, Stockholm, and Singapore as models.
