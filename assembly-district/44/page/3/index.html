The violence does not care about age.</p><h3 id=the-most-vulnerable-pay-the-price>The Most Vulnerable Pay the Price</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> SUVs and cars are the main killers, causing the most deaths and injuries. Trucks and buses crush bodies. Bikes and mopeds add to the wounded. The streets are not safe for those outside a steel shell. The old, the young, the ones on foot or on two wheels—these are the ones who bleed.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h3><p>Assembly Member <strong>Robert Carroll</strong> has taken steps. He <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">backed a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters</a>. He <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted to extend school speed zones</a>.

Insurance helps after the crash, not before. The streets remain dangerous. The pace of change is slow. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by those in power. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It can end the reign of repeat speeders. It can build real protection at every corner. It can put people before cars. But it will not happen unless you demand it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call Assembly Member Carroll. Tell them to act.</strong> Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a warning.

The proposal, discussed in the Assembly, faces suburban resistance. Carroll’s statement, titled "When It Comes to Transit, Everyone Must Pay Their Fair Share," argues that exempting suburbs would cost the MTA $325 million and undermine regional transit. Carroll and NYC Assembly colleagues wrote to Speaker Heastie, demanding the PMT hike apply to both city and suburbs or, failing that, that new revenue go only to NYC Transit. Carroll said, "It is unwise and bad policy to abandon the principle of an integrated regional transportation system funded through cost sharing across the jurisdictions that benefit most from the MTA." He warns that letting only city businesses pay would be unfair and would threaten transit service. No formal safety analyst note was provided, but the statement centers on funding the transit system that protects vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Ford carried seven occupants, including five children and two adults, none of whom were reported injured. The police report lists no specific driver errors or contributing factors for either vehicle. The motorcyclist’s helmet is noted in the data, but the impact proved fatal.

The bill, now under review, aims to raise $226 million yearly for city infrastructure. Gounardes said, "We're proposing an infrastructure fund to help pay for some of the capital costs to mitigate some of the consequences of last-mile trucking, and freight growth." The bill responds to a surge in daily package deliveries, now at 2.3 million, and forecasts of 200,000 trucks a day by 2045. Gounardes, the bill's sponsor, wants the city—not the MTA—to control the funds. City Hall has not taken a position but said it welcomes ideas to limit emissions and advance infrastructure. The bill joins other efforts to regulate last-mile delivery and warehouse placement.

The crash involved a truck and a sedan, both making right turns. The police report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor. No other injuries were reported. The data does not list any helmet or signal use as a factor. The deadly impact and driver inattention underline the danger faced by pedestrians on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'I’m Willing to Take the Heat to Support Congestion Pricing,' was reported by Streetsblog NYC. Carroll opposes broad exemptions, saying, 'Simplicity is key and exemptions should be limited.' He supports only yellow cab drivers for additional exemptions, citing their medallion fees and capped numbers. Carroll insists Uber and Lyft drivers pay every time they enter the zone, regardless of fare. He also backs time-based charges for taxis, for-hire vehicles, and trucks, especially in busy corridors. Carroll acknowledges the financial burden but argues the cost of congestion is greater. He urges swift action, naming London, Milan, Stockholm, and Singapore as models.

Carroll called the requirement "reasonable." Stephen Walling, president of the New York State Association of Professional Driving Schools, said the bill would "go a long way towards keeping all New Yorkers safer on our roads." The NYC Department of Transportation called driver education "crucial" for the safety of pedestrians, cyclists, and other road users, and is reviewing the proposal.
