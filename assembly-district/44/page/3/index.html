An 88-year-old woman killed in a crash on Atlantic Avenue. A 46-year-old pedestrian struck dead at an intersection on Fort Hamilton Parkway. A 35-year-old motorcyclist thrown and killed on Caton Avenue. In the last twelve months alone, two people died and six suffered serious injuries in Assembly District 44. Over 500 more were hurt.

In three years, SUVs and cars caused over 280 injuries and one death to pedestrians. Trucks and buses added another death and 18 injuries. Bikes, mopeds, and motorcycles left their own trail—one serious injury, 19 injuries. The streets are not safe for the vulnerable. The pattern is not new. It is relentless.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Assembly Member Robert Carroll has stood with advocates for safer streets. He co-sponsored a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting tech, aiming to stop the worst offenders. He backed universal daylighting—removing parked cars from corners to give children and elders a fighting chance to cross. He pushed for congestion pricing to cut traffic and fund transit. But progress is slow. A bill to require delivery apps to insure workers and pedestrians <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/doordash-lobbying-sunk-bill-to-require-apps-to-insure-delivery-workers>died after corporate lobbying</a>. Another bill to lower the speed threshold for camera enforcement <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A6225&amp;term=2025">sits in committee</a>. Each delay means another family waits for the call that never should come.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every crash is a choice made by leaders, by laws, by what we build and what we ignore. Call your council member. Call your assembly member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real daylighting. Demand action on repeat offenders. The dead cannot call. The living must.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The city’s response left dangerous gaps for those who report reckless driving.</p><p class=mb3>On February 10, 2022, City Hall responded to threats against Tony Melone, a Park Slope resident who filed a 311 complaint about illegal parking. The incident, covered by Streetsblog, exposed how reporting traffic violations can put New Yorkers at risk. City Hall called the harassment 'extremely disturbing' and promised to review a Department of Investigation probe, but did not commit to changing NYPD’s handling of 311 complaints. Assembly Member Robert Carroll condemned the threats and demanded accountability if city staff leaked Melone’s information. Council Member Shahana Hanif echoed concern, urging that harassment not silence those reporting dangerous driving. The NYPD did not comment. The city’s lack of action leaves vulnerable road users exposed, as illegal parking blocks sightlines, sidewalks, and bike lanes, endangering lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
