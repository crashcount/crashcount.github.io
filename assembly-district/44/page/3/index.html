An 88-year-old woman killed in a crash on Atlantic Avenue. A 46-year-old pedestrian struck dead at an intersection on Fort Hamilton Parkway. A 35-year-old motorcyclist thrown and killed on Caton Avenue. In the last twelve months alone, two people died and six suffered serious injuries in Assembly District 44. Over 500 more were hurt. The numbers do not stop. They do not care about age. Children, elders, cyclists, walkers, drivers—all marked by the same violence. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=the-pattern-is-clear>The Pattern Is Clear</h3><p>SUVs and trucks do the most harm. In three years, SUVs and cars caused over 280 injuries and one death to pedestrians. Trucks and buses added another death and 18 injuries. Bikes, mopeds, and motorcycles left their own trail—one serious injury, 19 injuries. The streets are not safe for the vulnerable. The pattern is not new. It is relentless.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Assembly Member Robert Carroll has stood with advocates for safer streets. He co-sponsored a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting tech, aiming to stop the worst offenders. He backed universal daylighting—removing parked cars from corners to give children and elders a fighting chance to cross. He pushed for congestion pricing to cut traffic and fund transit. But progress is slow. A bill to require delivery apps to insure workers and pedestrians <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/doordash-lobbying-sunk-bill-to-require-apps-to-insure-delivery-workers>died after corporate lobbying</a>. Another bill to lower the speed threshold for camera enforcement <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A6225&amp;term=2025">sits in committee</a>. Each delay means another family waits for the call that never should come.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every crash is a choice made by leaders, by laws, by what we build and what we ignore. Call your council member. Call your assembly member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real daylighting. Demand action on repeat offenders. The dead cannot call. The living must.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Carroll insists Uber and Lyft drivers pay every time they enter the zone, regardless of fare. He also backs time-based charges for taxis, for-hire vehicles, and trucks, especially in busy corridors.

Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymember Bobby Carroll, would require all new drivers in New York State to complete six hours of professional driving instruction before taking the road test. The bill was announced on March 29, 2022. Gounardes slammed the current rules as too lenient, saying, "For some drivers, the first time they take the wheel [as a licensed driver] they are in sole control of their car." Carroll called the requirement "reasonable." Stephen Walling, president of the New York State Association of Professional Driving Schools, said the bill would "go a long way towards keeping all New Yorkers safer on our roads." The NYC Department of Transportation called driver education "crucial" for the safety of pedestrians, cyclists, and other road users, and is reviewing the proposal. The bill awaits committee action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The effort is described as 'an unprecedented effort to collect detailed data on bicycle transportation across the state.' The survey asks about riding frequency, infrastructure, barriers, and connections to transit. Assembly Member Robert Carroll and State Senator Julia Salazar have backed related legislation for an e-bike rebate program. The survey’s results will be shared with governments and advocacy groups. Officials say the data will help planners and policymakers 'invest in safer, more equitable multimodal streets.'

The incident, covered by Streetsblog, exposed how reporting traffic violations can put New Yorkers at risk. City Hall called the harassment 'extremely disturbing' and promised to review a Department of Investigation probe, but did not commit to changing NYPD’s handling of 311 complaints. Assembly Member Robert Carroll condemned the threats and demanded accountability if city staff leaked Melone’s information. Council Member Shahana Hanif echoed concern, urging that harassment not silence those reporting dangerous driving. The NYPD did not comment. The city’s lack of action leaves vulnerable road users exposed, as illegal parking blocks sightlines, sidewalks, and bike lanes, endangering lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
