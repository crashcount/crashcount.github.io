An old woman in a car. A man crossing the street. In Assembly District 44, the story repeats. In the last twelve months, two people died and six suffered serious injuries in 817 crashes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The numbers are blunt. Children are not spared—one under 18 killed, two more seriously hurt. Cyclists, pedestrians, passengers: none are safe. The street does not care who you are.</p><p>SUVs and trucks hit hardest. In this period, SUVs killed one, trucks another. Bikes and motorcycles left more with broken bodies. The pain spreads across ages. From teenagers to the old, no one is immune.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-bills-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Promises, Bills, and Missed Chances</h3><p>Assembly Member Robert Carroll has stood up for some safety measures. He backed <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/17/seven-brooklyn-electeds-join-growing-calls-for-universal-daylighting>universal daylighting</a>, calling for barriers at corners to keep sightlines clear. He co-sponsored a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting tech in their cars (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">File A 7979</a>). He has spoken out for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/07/two-assembly-pols-congestion-pricing-is-good-policy-democrats-should-embrace-it>congestion pricing</a> to fund transit and cut traffic.</p><p>But not every move helps the most vulnerable. Carroll sponsored a bill to lower the speed threshold for camera tickets (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A6225&amp;term=2025">File A 6225</a>), a step forward. Yet he also supported a teen helmet mandate for e-bikes, a law that puts the onus on young riders, not the drivers or the street. The danger comes from cars and trucks, not from bare heads.</p><h3 id=the-disaster-is-not-over>The Disaster Is Not Over</h3><p>Eight people have died in AD 44 since 2022. Over 1,700 have been hurt. The crashes keep coming. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has the tools to redesign streets, to harden corners, to keep children safe. But the pace is slow. The pain is fast.</p><p>Call your leaders. Demand action. Tell them to use every tool—lower speed limits, daylight every corner, protect every crossing.

The matter, titled 'I’m Willing to Take the Heat to Support Congestion Pricing,' was reported by Streetsblog NYC. Carroll opposes broad exemptions, saying, 'Simplicity is key and exemptions should be limited.' He supports only yellow cab drivers for additional exemptions, citing their medallion fees and capped numbers. Carroll insists Uber and Lyft drivers pay every time they enter the zone, regardless of fare. He also backs time-based charges for taxis, for-hire vehicles, and trucks, especially in busy corridors. Carroll acknowledges the financial burden but argues the cost of congestion is greater. He urges swift action, naming London, Milan, Stockholm, and Singapore as models.

Carroll pushes back on critics who call e-bikes a luxury, stating, 'They don’t realize that this is not a luxury item.' The program would use NYSERDA funds from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, mirroring the Drive Clean program for electric cars. Advocates cite European and U.S. models.
