An 88-year-old woman killed in a crash on Atlantic Avenue. A 46-year-old pedestrian struck dead at an intersection on Fort Hamilton Parkway. A 35-year-old motorcyclist thrown and killed on Caton Avenue. In the last twelve months alone, two people died and six suffered serious injuries in Assembly District 44. Over 500 more were hurt. The numbers do not stop. They do not care about age. Children, elders, cyclists, walkers, drivers—all marked by the same violence. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=the-pattern-is-clear>The Pattern Is Clear</h3><p>SUVs and trucks do the most harm. In three years, SUVs and cars caused over 280 injuries and one death to pedestrians. Trucks and buses added another death and 18 injuries. Bikes, mopeds, and motorcycles left their own trail—one serious injury, 19 injuries. The streets are not safe for the vulnerable. The pattern is not new. It is relentless.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Assembly Member Robert Carroll has stood with advocates for safer streets. He co-sponsored a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting tech, aiming to stop the worst offenders. He backed universal daylighting—removing parked cars from corners to give children and elders a fighting chance to cross. He pushed for congestion pricing to cut traffic and fund transit. But progress is slow. A bill to require delivery apps to insure workers and pedestrians <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/doordash-lobbying-sunk-bill-to-require-apps-to-insure-delivery-workers>died after corporate lobbying</a>. Another bill to lower the speed threshold for camera enforcement <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A6225&amp;term=2025">sits in committee</a>. Each delay means another family waits for the call that never should come.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every crash is a choice made by leaders, by laws, by what we build and what we ignore. Call your council member. Call your assembly member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real daylighting. Demand action on repeat offenders. The dead cannot call. The living must.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The plan recommends a $1.50 per-ride fee for taxis and $2.75 for Uber and Lyft in Lower Manhattan. Carroll tweeted, 'TMRB's recommendation to charge passengers of @Uber/@lyft an additional $1/$2 to be ferried around the congestion zone is a joke.' He argued these low fees would not curb for-hire vehicle trips, saying, 'We can't stop congestion if we don't limit FHV trips.' The matter, titled 'Analysis: Congestion Pricing Fee May Be Too Low for Taxi and Uber Riders,' highlights a split: some experts want higher surcharges to push riders to transit, while others want yellow cabs exempted.

The Traffic Mobility Review Board (TMRB) proposed per-ride fees—$1.50 for taxis, $2.75 for Uber/Lyft—far below the full congestion toll. Assemblymember Robert Carroll called the charges 'a joke,' arguing, 'We can't stop congestion if we don't limit FHV trips. Taxis shld be exempt & FHVs shld pay more.' Bruce Schaller, a former DOT official, warned, 'If you have a low fee for the taxis and the for-hires, people just switch modes.' Charles Komanoff and Sam Schwartz both support exempting yellow cabs, citing economic hardship and market imbalance. The TMRB's focus on keeping tolls low may undermine efforts to reduce traffic and protect vulnerable road users.

He argues riders are wealthier. The MTA’s plan faces pushback. Advocates warn exempting cabs could shift traffic, undermining safety and policy goals.</p><p class=mb3>On June 21, 2023, Assembly Member Robert Carroll (District 44) weighed in on congestion pricing for taxis and for-hire vehicles (FHVs). The Traffic Mobility Review Board and MTA are debating whether to charge drivers or passengers. Carroll, joined by advocate Alex Matthiessen, proposed replacing the $2.75 FHV surcharge with a two-tiered fee on Uber/Lyft passengers, exempting drivers and yellow cabs. Carroll said, "We think that this will go to the passengers who are disproportionately wealthier than the average New Yorker and significantly wealthier than the driver." The MTA has not considered this per-trip customer fee, and it is unclear if it can be implemented. Taxi advocates support exempting drivers, but experts warn that exempting yellow cabs could shift congestion, undermining the policy’s intent. The debate continues in committee, with no final decision.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Traffic Mobility Review Board must decide if yellow cab and Uber/Lyft drivers will be tolled, or if only passengers will pay. Assembly Member Robert Carroll and advocate Alex Matthiessen back a higher passenger surcharge for Uber/Lyft rides, exempting drivers and yellow cabs. Carroll argues, 'passengers are disproportionately wealthier than the average New Yorker and significantly wealthier than the driver.' Taxi advocate Bhairavi Desai supports exempting drivers to protect jobs. Economist Charles Komanoff and analyst Bruce Schaller warn that exempting yellow cabs could shift congestion, undermining safety and policy goals. The matter’s outcome will shape who pays—and who faces the danger—on Manhattan’s streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal, discussed in the Assembly, faces suburban resistance. Carroll’s statement, titled "When It Comes to Transit, Everyone Must Pay Their Fair Share," argues that exempting suburbs would cost the MTA $325 million and undermine regional transit. Carroll and NYC Assembly colleagues wrote to Speaker Heastie, demanding the PMT hike apply to both city and suburbs or, failing that, that new revenue go only to NYC Transit. Carroll said, "It is unwise and bad policy to abandon the principle of an integrated regional transportation system funded through cost sharing across the jurisdictions that benefit most from the MTA." He warns that letting only city businesses pay would be unfair and would threaten transit service. No formal safety analyst note was provided, but the statement centers on funding the transit system that protects vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, now under review, aims to raise $226 million yearly for city infrastructure. Gounardes said, "We're proposing an infrastructure fund to help pay for some of the capital costs to mitigate some of the consequences of last-mile trucking, and freight growth." The bill responds to a surge in daily package deliveries, now at 2.3 million, and forecasts of 200,000 trucks a day by 2045. Gounardes, the bill's sponsor, wants the city—not the MTA—to control the funds. City Hall has not taken a position but said it welcomes ideas to limit emissions and advance infrastructure. The bill joins other efforts to regulate last-mile delivery and warehouse placement.
