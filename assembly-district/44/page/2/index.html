The violence does not care about age.</p><h3 id=the-most-vulnerable-pay-the-price>The Most Vulnerable Pay the Price</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> SUVs and cars are the main killers, causing the most deaths and injuries. Trucks and buses crush bodies. Bikes and mopeds add to the wounded. The streets are not safe for those outside a steel shell. The old, the young, the ones on foot or on two wheels—these are the ones who bleed.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h3><p>Assembly Member <strong>Robert Carroll</strong> has taken steps. He <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">backed a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters</a>.

Insurance helps after the crash, not before. The streets remain dangerous. The pace of change is slow. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by those in power. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It can end the reign of repeat speeders. It can build real protection at every corner. It can put people before cars. But it will not happen unless you demand it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call Assembly Member Carroll. Tell them to act.</strong> Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a warning.

They called for 'universal daylighting with hardened materials such as boulders, planters, and bike corrals' at intersections. The officials cited recent fatal crashes and urged the city to opt into a state law banning parking within 20 feet of corners. They want federal funds used for these changes. The group opposes DOT’s slow pace and reliance on paint, demanding physical barriers. Community board leaders and advocates support the move.

The plan risks more danger for people on foot and bike.</p><p class=mb3>On October 25, 2023, Councilmember Robert Carroll (District 44) criticized the Traffic Mobility Review Board’s congestion pricing proposal. The plan recommends a $1.50 per-ride fee for taxis and $2.75 for Uber and Lyft in Lower Manhattan. Carroll tweeted, 'TMRB's recommendation to charge passengers of @Uber/@lyft an additional $1/$2 to be ferried around the congestion zone is a joke.' He argued these low fees would not curb for-hire vehicle trips, saying, 'We can't stop congestion if we don't limit FHV trips.' The matter, titled 'Analysis: Congestion Pricing Fee May Be Too Low for Taxi and Uber Riders,' highlights a split: some experts want higher surcharges to push riders to transit, while others want yellow cabs exempted. The debate centers on how pricing shapes traffic and, by extension, the safety of vulnerable road users in crowded city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Critics say the charges are too weak. Cheap surcharges could push more cars into crowded streets, squeezing out walkers and cyclists. The city risks more danger, not less.</p><p class=mb3>This policy debate centers on congestion pricing surcharges for taxis and for-hire vehicles (FHVs) in New York City. The Traffic Mobility Review Board (TMRB) proposed per-ride fees—$1.50 for taxis, $2.75 for Uber/Lyft—far below the full congestion toll. Assemblymember Robert Carroll called the charges 'a joke,' arguing, 'We can't stop congestion if we don't limit FHV trips. Taxis shld be exempt & FHVs shld pay more.' Bruce Schaller, a former DOT official, warned, 'If you have a low fee for the taxis and the for-hires, people just switch modes.' Charles Komanoff and Sam Schwartz both support exempting yellow cabs, citing economic hardship and market imbalance. The TMRB's focus on keeping tolls low may undermine efforts to reduce traffic and protect vulnerable road users. No board member addressed the impact on street safety or congestion.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The MTA has not considered this per-trip customer fee, and it is unclear if it can be implemented.
