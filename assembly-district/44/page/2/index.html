The plan recommends a $1.50 per-ride fee for taxis and $2.75 for Uber and Lyft in Lower Manhattan. Carroll tweeted, 'TMRB's recommendation to charge passengers of @Uber/@lyft an additional $1/$2 to be ferried around the congestion zone is a joke.' He argued these low fees would not curb for-hire vehicle trips, saying, 'We can't stop congestion if we don't limit FHV trips.' The matter, titled 'Analysis: Congestion Pricing Fee May Be Too Low for Taxi and Uber Riders,' highlights a split: some experts want higher surcharges to push riders to transit, while others want yellow cabs exempted. The debate centers on how pricing shapes traffic and, by extension, the safety of vulnerable road users in crowded city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Critics say the charges are too weak. Cheap surcharges could push more cars into crowded streets, squeezing out walkers and cyclists. The city risks more danger, not less.</p><p class=mb3>This policy debate centers on congestion pricing surcharges for taxis and for-hire vehicles (FHVs) in New York City. The Traffic Mobility Review Board (TMRB) proposed per-ride fees—$1.50 for taxis, $2.75 for Uber/Lyft—far below the full congestion toll. Assemblymember Robert Carroll called the charges 'a joke,' arguing, 'We can't stop congestion if we don't limit FHV trips. Taxis shld be exempt & FHVs shld pay more.' Bruce Schaller, a former DOT official, warned, 'If you have a low fee for the taxis and the for-hires, people just switch modes.' Charles Komanoff and Sam Schwartz both support exempting yellow cabs, citing economic hardship and market imbalance. The TMRB's focus on keeping tolls low may undermine efforts to reduce traffic and protect vulnerable road users.

The bill sits in the Assembly, awaiting committee action. Its summary reads: 'Requires the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices if a driver accumulates eleven or more points on their driving record during an eighteen month period, or receives 6 speed camera or red light camera tickets during a twelve month period.' The primary sponsor is Emily Gallagher (District 50), joined by co-sponsors Rebecca Seawright, Andrew Hevesi, Tony Simone, Jo Anne Simon, Patricia Fahy, Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, MaryJane Shimsky, Yudelka Tapia, Steven Raga, Anna Kelles, Robert C. Carroll, and Sarahana Shrestha. The bill cracks down on repeat offenders, forcing them to install technology that blocks speeding. No safety analyst note is available, but the bill’s intent is clear: rein in drivers who endanger others again and again.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The money would fund city infrastructure. Trucks crowd streets. Packages pile up. The bill aims to slow the flood. City Hall will review. Delivery giants face new rules. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>State Senator Andrew Gounardes introduced a bill on March 23, 2023, proposing a 25-cent surcharge on every online delivery package in New York City. The bill, now under review, aims to raise $226 million yearly for city infrastructure. Gounardes said, "We're proposing an infrastructure fund to help pay for some of the capital costs to mitigate some of the consequences of last-mile trucking, and freight growth." The bill responds to a surge in daily package deliveries, now at 2.3 million, and forecasts of 200,000 trucks a day by 2045. Gounardes, the bill's sponsor, wants the city—not the MTA—to control the funds. City Hall has not taken a position but said it welcomes ideas to limit emissions and advance infrastructure. The bill joins other efforts to regulate last-mile delivery and warehouse placement. No formal safety analysis for vulnerable road users was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, 'A Toyota’s brakes failed. It plowed into two stopped sedans. Metal crumpled. A 51-year-old man sat belted, his face crushed. Six others waited in silence, the night split by sirens and bent steel.' The report lists 'Brakes Defective' as the contributing factor. Injuries included a 51-year-old man with facial crush injuries, a 79-year-old woman with a fractured leg, and several children and adults with pain to the head, back, and legs.

Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On February 5, 2023, legislators and advocates rallied for increased MTA funding and more frequent subway service. The event, led by Assembly Members Zohran Mamdani and Robert Carroll, State Senator Andrew Gounardes, and Riders Alliance’s Betsy Plum, responded to Governor Hochul’s budget proposal. The matter: 'Advocates and legislators raced up the stairs...to press their case for Gov. Hochul to do more to fill the MTA's fiscal gap.' Hochul’s plan stabilizes finances but does not boost service or halt fare hikes. Mamdani and Gounardes called for six-minute off-peak trains and new taxes on the wealthy. Gounardes said, 'We all know that we need better service and we need more service.' The proposal remains under negotiation. No safety analyst has assessed the direct impact on vulnerable road users, but frequent, reliable transit is vital for their safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
