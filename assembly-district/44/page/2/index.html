He died at the scene (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash 4749410</a>).</li><li>A 71‑year‑old cyclist was killed on West Drive at Center Drive in Prospect Park.

In this district since 2022, there have been 3,421 crashes, with 10 people killed and 1,978 injured (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data rollup</a>). Bikes and pedestrians take a heavy share: bicyclists had 337 injuries and 2 deaths; pedestrians had 365 injuries and 3 deaths. SUVs and cars led the harm to pedestrians, with trucks next (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>period stats</a>).</p><p>Peak pain comes in the afternoon and evening. Injuries stack up at 2 p.m., 3 p.m., 6 p.m., and 8 p.m. Deaths strike at 1 a.m., 10 a.m., noon, 1 p.m., 3 p.m., 6 p.m., 9 p.m., and 10 p.m. The clock does not save you (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hourly distribution</a>).</p><p>Three corners.

Distraction is logged. Alcohol is logged. A red light blown is logged. These are the inputs the city collects; the outcomes are on the street (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>contributing factors</a>).</p><p>Trucks and turns.</p><p>A 2017 Hino box truck turned right at Ditmas and Coney Island Ave. The teen on the e‑bike was crushed.

Seven Brooklyn officials, including Council Member Shahana Hanif and Assembly Member Robert Carroll, already urged “universal daylighting with hardened materials” at intersections (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/17/seven-brooklyn-electeds-join-growing-calls-for-universal-daylighting>their letter</a>).</li><li>Harden turns and slow right turns on <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Coney Island Avenue</a> and Caton Avenue where trucks cut in and people die.</li><li>Target repeat hotspots like <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Atlantic Avenue</a> with concrete, not paint, and enforce distracted driving where deaths are logged.</li></ul><p>Officials know what works — do they?</p><p>Albany extended the 24‑hour school speed safety program through 2030, a technical bill that kept protections alive (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>S 8344</a>). Another bill would force chronic speeders to slow down with intelligent speed assistance. The proposal, framed as the Stop Super Speeders Act, would require devices for drivers with heavy point totals or camera tickets (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">policy file</a>). Advocates say a tiny pool of drivers does outsized harm and linked high camera‑ticket counts to fatal risk (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/20/the-1-5-percent-of-drivers-who-cause-21-percent-of-pedestrian-deaths>analysis and coverage</a>).</p><p>Lower the speed. Save a life.</p><p>New York City has the power to set safer speeds under Sammy’s Law, and groups are pushing for a default 20 mph limit and controls on repeat speeders.

The plan recommends a $1.50 per-ride fee for taxis and $2.75 for Uber and Lyft in Lower Manhattan. Carroll tweeted, 'TMRB's recommendation to charge passengers of @Uber/@lyft an additional $1/$2 to be ferried around the congestion zone is a joke.' He argued these low fees would not curb for-hire vehicle trips, saying, 'We can't stop congestion if we don't limit FHV trips.' The matter, titled 'Analysis: Congestion Pricing Fee May Be Too Low for Taxi and Uber Riders,' highlights a split: some experts want higher surcharges to push riders to transit, while others want yellow cabs exempted. The debate centers on how pricing shapes traffic and, by extension, the safety of vulnerable road users in crowded city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Critics say the charges are too weak. Cheap surcharges could push more cars into crowded streets, squeezing out walkers and cyclists. The city risks more danger, not less.</p><p class=mb3>This policy debate centers on congestion pricing surcharges for taxis and for-hire vehicles (FHVs) in New York City. The Traffic Mobility Review Board (TMRB) proposed per-ride fees—$1.50 for taxis, $2.75 for Uber/Lyft—far below the full congestion toll. Assemblymember Robert Carroll called the charges 'a joke,' arguing, 'We can't stop congestion if we don't limit FHV trips. Taxis shld be exempt & FHVs shld pay more.' Bruce Schaller, a former DOT official, warned, 'If you have a low fee for the taxis and the for-hires, people just switch modes.' Charles Komanoff and Sam Schwartz both support exempting yellow cabs, citing economic hardship and market imbalance. The TMRB's focus on keeping tolls low may undermine efforts to reduce traffic and protect vulnerable road users.

Their letter to the Traffic Mobility Review Board states: 'No one community should disproportionately bear the burden of the cars and trucks passing through their neighborhood.' Hanif, along with Lincoln Restler, Alexa Avilés, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Crystal Hudson, joined borough, state, and federal colleagues in this push. They propose a credit system to balance costs between DOT bridges and MTA tunnels, aiming to protect neighborhoods like the Brooklyn waterfront and the BQE corridor from traffic surges. The MTA declined comment. The Board will soon set final toll rates and rules. The federal government has approved the congestion pricing plan, with tolls for cars expected between $9 and $23. Over 100 exemption requests, including from taxi and for-hire vehicle drivers, are under review.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The MTA has not considered this per-trip customer fee, and it is unclear if it can be implemented.
