An old woman in a car. A man crossing the street. In Assembly District 44, the story repeats. In the last twelve months, two people died and six suffered serious injuries in 817 crashes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The numbers are blunt. Children are not spared—one under 18 killed, two more seriously hurt. Cyclists, pedestrians, passengers: none are safe. The street does not care who you are.</p><p>SUVs and trucks hit hardest. In this period, SUVs killed one, trucks another. Bikes and motorcycles left more with broken bodies. The pain spreads across ages. From teenagers to the old, no one is immune.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-bills-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Promises, Bills, and Missed Chances</h3><p>Assembly Member Robert Carroll has stood up for some safety measures. He backed <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/17/seven-brooklyn-electeds-join-growing-calls-for-universal-daylighting>universal daylighting</a>, calling for barriers at corners to keep sightlines clear. He co-sponsored a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting tech in their cars (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">File A 7979</a>). He has spoken out for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/07/two-assembly-pols-congestion-pricing-is-good-policy-democrats-should-embrace-it>congestion pricing</a> to fund transit and cut traffic.</p><p>But not every move helps the most vulnerable. Carroll sponsored a bill to lower the speed threshold for camera tickets (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A6225&amp;term=2025">File A 6225</a>), a step forward. Yet he also supported a teen helmet mandate for e-bikes, a law that puts the onus on young riders, not the drivers or the street. The danger comes from cars and trucks, not from bare heads.</p><h3 id=the-disaster-is-not-over>The Disaster Is Not Over</h3><p>Eight people have died in AD 44 since 2022. Over 1,700 have been hurt. The crashes keep coming. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has the tools to redesign streets, to harden corners, to keep children safe. But the pace is slow. The pain is fast.</p><p>Call your leaders. Demand action. Tell them to use every tool—lower speed limits, daylight every corner, protect every crossing. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The plan recommends a $1.50 per-ride fee for taxis and $2.75 for Uber and Lyft in Lower Manhattan. Carroll tweeted, 'TMRB's recommendation to charge passengers of @Uber/@lyft an additional $1/$2 to be ferried around the congestion zone is a joke.' He argued these low fees would not curb for-hire vehicle trips, saying, 'We can't stop congestion if we don't limit FHV trips.' The matter, titled 'Analysis: Congestion Pricing Fee May Be Too Low for Taxi and Uber Riders,' highlights a split: some experts want higher surcharges to push riders to transit, while others want yellow cabs exempted. The debate centers on how pricing shapes traffic and, by extension, the safety of vulnerable road users in crowded city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Traffic Mobility Review Board (TMRB) proposed per-ride fees—$1.50 for taxis, $2.75 for Uber/Lyft—far below the full congestion toll. Assemblymember Robert Carroll called the charges 'a joke,' arguing, 'We can't stop congestion if we don't limit FHV trips. Taxis shld be exempt & FHVs shld pay more.' Bruce Schaller, a former DOT official, warned, 'If you have a low fee for the taxis and the for-hires, people just switch modes.' Charles Komanoff and Sam Schwartz both support exempting yellow cabs, citing economic hardship and market imbalance. The TMRB's focus on keeping tolls low may undermine efforts to reduce traffic and protect vulnerable road users.

The primary sponsor is Emily Gallagher (District 50), joined by co-sponsors Rebecca Seawright, Andrew Hevesi, Tony Simone, Jo Anne Simon, Patricia Fahy, Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, MaryJane Shimsky, Yudelka Tapia, Steven Raga, Anna Kelles, Robert C.

He says all regions use transit, all must pay. Exempting suburbs would gut MTA funding. Carroll demands shared cost, warns against service cuts, and calls for real revenue.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Member Robert Carroll issued a legislative statement on April 28, 2023, urging equal cost-sharing for the MTA Payroll Mobility Tax (PMT) increase. The proposal, discussed in the Assembly, faces suburban resistance. Carroll’s statement, titled "When It Comes to Transit, Everyone Must Pay Their Fair Share," argues that exempting suburbs would cost the MTA $325 million and undermine regional transit. Carroll and NYC Assembly colleagues wrote to Speaker Heastie, demanding the PMT hike apply to both city and suburbs or, failing that, that new revenue go only to NYC Transit. Carroll said, "It is unwise and bad policy to abandon the principle of an integrated regional transportation system funded through cost sharing across the jurisdictions that benefit most from the MTA." He warns that letting only city businesses pay would be unfair and would threaten transit service. No formal safety analyst note was provided, but the statement centers on funding the transit system that protects vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the 24-year-old motorcyclist, who wore a helmet, was thrown from his bike and crushed under the SUV’s front, suffering injuries to his entire body. The Ford carried seven occupants, including five children and two adults, none of whom were reported injured. The police report lists no specific driver errors or contributing factors for either vehicle. The motorcyclist’s helmet is noted in the data, but the impact proved fatal.

Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>State Senator Andrew Gounardes introduced a bill on March 23, 2023, proposing a 25-cent surcharge on every online delivery package in New York City. The bill, now under review, aims to raise $226 million yearly for city infrastructure. Gounardes said, "We're proposing an infrastructure fund to help pay for some of the capital costs to mitigate some of the consequences of last-mile trucking, and freight growth." The bill responds to a surge in daily package deliveries, now at 2.3 million, and forecasts of 200,000 trucks a day by 2045. Gounardes, the bill's sponsor, wants the city—not the MTA—to control the funds. City Hall has not taken a position but said it welcomes ideas to limit emissions and advance infrastructure. The bill joins other efforts to regulate last-mile delivery and warehouse placement.
