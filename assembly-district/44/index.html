Prevention takes a back seat.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13, 2025, the New York State Senate passed a bill requiring food delivery apps to provide insurance for delivery workers, pedestrians, and cyclists. The bill, sponsored by Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger, mandates up to $50,000 per person for basic economic loss, regardless of citizenship or employment status. Assembly Member Robert Carroll authored the original Assembly version, stating, 'It is time we require delivery apps to take responsibility for keeping delivery workers and pedestrians safe.' Sen. Andrew Gounardes defended a related speed-limiting bill, but it was weakened. Safety analysts warn: 'Focusing on insurance rather than speed limits shifts responsibility away from prevention and system design, failing to reduce crash risk and potentially discouraging mode shift by not addressing the root causes of danger for pedestrians and cyclists.'

The bill moves forward despite evidence of harm to vulnerable road users.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Bill 590, sponsored by Amy Paulin (D-Westchester), advanced in a Transportation Committee hearing on May 7, 2025. The bill would require 16- and 17-year-olds riding Class 1 or 2 e-bikes, including Citi Bikes, to wear helmets. Committee Chair William Magnarelli (D-Syracuse) defended the bill, stating, "My only concern is the safety of the people riding the bike." The bill summary notes, 'studies have shown [helmet mandates] can dramatically reduce ridership of the city’s bike share system.' Experts warn such laws lead to fewer cyclists and open the door to discriminatory enforcement, especially against youth of color. Seattle dropped its helmet law in 2022 for these reasons. Despite evidence that helmet laws hurt vulnerable road users, the committee advanced the bill without addressing these harms.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The noise never stops. Assembly Member Carroll’s bill, A2583, would tax non-essential flights. The aim: cut flights, cut noise, cut harm. Governor Hochul stays silent. The city waits. The damage mounts.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Bill A2583, sponsored by Brooklyn Assembly Member Robert Carroll, seeks to impose hefty fees on non-essential helicopter flights over New York City. The bill remains pending, with no endorsement yet from Governor Hochul. The Streetsblog article, 'Helicopter Deaths, Fast and Slow,' highlights the recent fatal crash near Jersey City that killed six and draws a stark comparison to the ongoing economic and human toll of helicopter noise. Carroll’s bill is described as the 'gold-standard' for taxing helicopter noise, with estimates that it could reduce flights by 30 to 50 percent. Carroll urges action, calling on the public to pressure Hochul to support the measure. The article underscores that the distress over crash deaths should extend to the daily suffering caused by helicopter noise, which inflicts millions in damages and degrades quality of life for city residents.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
