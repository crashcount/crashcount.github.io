The bill aimed to cover injuries from crashes and bar retaliation against workers filing claims. DoorDash lobbied against it, backing a weaker bill.

Lawmakers tout support for the injured. But insurance comes after the hit. Speeders keep driving. Danger stays on the street. Prevention takes a back seat.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13, 2025, the New York State Senate passed a bill requiring food delivery apps to provide insurance for delivery workers, pedestrians, and cyclists. The bill, sponsored by Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger, mandates up to $50,000 per person for basic economic loss, regardless of citizenship or employment status. Assembly Member Robert Carroll authored the original Assembly version, stating, 'It is time we require delivery apps to take responsibility for keeping delivery workers and pedestrians safe.' Sen. Andrew Gounardes defended a related speed-limiting bill, but it was weakened. Safety analysts warn: 'Focusing on insurance rather than speed limits shifts responsibility away from prevention and system design, failing to reduce crash risk and potentially discouraging mode shift by not addressing the root causes of danger for pedestrians and cyclists.' Lawmakers back insurance, but leave the streets risky.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Critics warn helmet laws slash ridership and invite biased policing. The bill moves forward despite evidence of harm to vulnerable road users.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Bill 590, sponsored by Amy Paulin (D-Westchester), advanced in a Transportation Committee hearing on May 7, 2025. The bill would require 16- and 17-year-olds riding Class 1 or 2 e-bikes, including Citi Bikes, to wear helmets. Committee Chair William Magnarelli (D-Syracuse) defended the bill, stating, "My only concern is the safety of the people riding the bike." The bill summary notes, 'studies have shown [helmet mandates] can dramatically reduce ridership of the city’s bike share system.' Experts warn such laws lead to fewer cyclists and open the door to discriminatory enforcement, especially against youth of color. Seattle dropped its helmet law in 2022 for these reasons. Despite evidence that helmet laws hurt vulnerable road users, the committee advanced the bill without addressing these harms.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill remains pending, with no endorsement yet from Governor Hochul. The Streetsblog article, 'Helicopter Deaths, Fast and Slow,' highlights the recent fatal crash near Jersey City that killed six and draws a stark comparison to the ongoing economic and human toll of helicopter noise. Carroll’s bill is described as the 'gold-standard' for taxing helicopter noise, with estimates that it could reduce flights by 30 to 50 percent. Carroll urges action, calling on the public to pressure Hochul to support the measure. The article underscores that the distress over crash deaths should extend to the daily suffering caused by helicopter noise, which inflicts millions in damages and degrades quality of life for city residents.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The rider, not wearing a helmet, was ejected from the bike upon impact, suffering a severe head injury and heavy bleeding. The narrative describes the aftermath: 'Head split open. Blood on the pavement. He lay conscious. The bike was fine. He was not.' The police report does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor until after listing the driver errors. The e-bike itself sustained no damage, underscoring the force absorbed by the rider’s body.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The op-ed, titled 'Two Assembly Pols: Congestion Pricing is Good Policy — Democrats Should Embrace It,' argues the governor’s action is 'effectively a cancellation.' Gallagher and Carroll stress that congestion pricing is essential for funding the MTA and improving public transit. They write, 'Congestion pricing does both and there is no fair or viable alternative way to fund the MTA’s capital needs at this juncture.' The statement warns that the delay will shelve critical projects and worsen conditions for all who rely on safe, accessible streets. Gallagher’s stance is clear: the city’s future depends on prioritizing transit and public space over traffic and private cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They call it a blow to transit, air quality, and city life. They say New York needs fewer cars, more trains, and streets for people, not traffic. The fight continues.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Members Robert Carroll and Emily Gallagher issued a public statement on June 7, 2024, supporting congestion pricing and condemning Governor Hochul’s indefinite delay of the program. The statement, published as an op-ed, argues, 'the Governor’s announcement to indefinitely delay implementation is effectively a cancellation of congestion pricing.' Carroll and Gallagher, both long-time supporters, stress that congestion pricing is vital for funding the MTA’s capital needs and for reducing traffic and pollution. They warn that the governor’s move will stall key transit projects and harm New Yorkers who rely on public transportation. The members urge Democrats to embrace the policy, stating, 'It is past time for New York to join such cities as London, Milan, Stockholm, and Singapore and implement congestion pricing without further delay.' The statement does not mince words: the city’s future depends on streets for people, not cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
