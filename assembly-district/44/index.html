A 35-year-old motorcyclist thrown and killed on Caton Avenue. In the last twelve months alone, two people died and six suffered serious injuries in Assembly District 44. Over 500 more were hurt.

He co-sponsored a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting tech, aiming to stop the worst offenders.

But progress is slow.

Every crash is a choice made by leaders, by laws, by what we build and what we ignore. Call your council member. Call your assembly member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real daylighting. Demand action on repeat offenders. The dead cannot call.

Prevention takes a back seat.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13, 2025, the New York State Senate passed a bill requiring food delivery apps to provide insurance for delivery workers, pedestrians, and cyclists. The bill, sponsored by Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger, mandates up to $50,000 per person for basic economic loss, regardless of citizenship or employment status. Assembly Member Robert Carroll authored the original Assembly version, stating, 'It is time we require delivery apps to take responsibility for keeping delivery workers and pedestrians safe.' Sen. Andrew Gounardes defended a related speed-limiting bill, but it was weakened. Safety analysts warn: 'Focusing on insurance rather than speed limits shifts responsibility away from prevention and system design, failing to reduce crash risk and potentially discouraging mode shift by not addressing the root causes of danger for pedestrians and cyclists.'

The bill would require 16- and 17-year-olds riding Class 1 or 2 e-bikes, including Citi Bikes, to wear helmets. Committee Chair William Magnarelli (D-Syracuse) defended the bill, stating, "My only concern is the safety of the people riding the bike." The bill summary notes, 'studies have shown [helmet mandates] can dramatically reduce ridership of the city’s bike share system.' Experts warn such laws lead to fewer cyclists and open the door to discriminatory enforcement, especially against youth of color. Seattle dropped its helmet law in 2022 for these reasons. Despite evidence that helmet laws hurt vulnerable road users, the committee advanced the bill without addressing these harms.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill remains pending, with no endorsement yet from Governor Hochul. The Streetsblog article, 'Helicopter Deaths, Fast and Slow,' highlights the recent fatal crash near Jersey City that killed six and draws a stark comparison to the ongoing economic and human toll of helicopter noise. Carroll’s bill is described as the 'gold-standard' for taxing helicopter noise, with estimates that it could reduce flights by 30 to 50 percent. Carroll urges action, calling on the public to pressure Hochul to support the measure. The article underscores that the distress over crash deaths should extend to the daily suffering caused by helicopter noise, which inflicts millions in damages and degrades quality of life for city residents.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Gridlock wins.</p><p class=mb3>On June 6, 2024, Senator Liz Krueger (District 28) condemned Governor Hochul’s last-minute reversal on congestion pricing. The policy, approved by the MTA Board and set for June 30, now faces indefinite delay. Krueger called the decision 'a staggering error' that creates a financial crisis for the MTA. The matter at hand: 'Gov. Hochul revoked her support for congestion pricing less than a month before it was supposed to start.' Assembly Member Robert Carroll also criticized the governor, rejecting her proposal to hike the payroll mobility tax on city businesses. The MTA’s capital plan now faces a $15 billion shortfall, with no replacement funding in sight. The delay leaves vulnerable road users exposed, as congestion pricing aimed to cut traffic and fund safer transit. The council’s response is clear: the city needs congestion pricing, now.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The delay, announced without legislative action, sparked backlash. MTA Board member Midori Valdivia vowed, 'I'm going to vote yes to congestion pricing, and that it should start as soon as possible.' Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi echoed, 'It needs to happen now.' Senator Liz Krueger called Hochul's move 'a staggering error.' Assembly Member Robert Carroll and business leader Kathy Wylde criticized the governor’s floated payroll tax hike as unfair to city businesses. The MTA faces a $15 billion shortfall, with no replacement funding in sight. The delay keeps streets clogged and transit underfunded, risking more danger for those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crash occurred as both vehicles were 'going straight ahead.' The cyclist was ejected and suffered severe lacerations and injuries to his entire body. The police report describes the impact as 'steel front met soft flesh,' with the teen thrown hard and left in shock. The SUV's center front end struck the cyclist, causing the bike to overturn. The report lists 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a contributing factor, but does not cite any specific driver error. The cyclist was not wearing a helmet, as noted in the report, but this is mentioned only after the details of the crash and the SUV's involvement. The focus remains on the violent collision and the systemic dangers faced by vulnerable road users at this intersection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The report states the driver was unlicensed and failed to yield the right-of-way. The impact broke the woman’s hip and caused severe lacerations, leaving her conscious but immobilized on the pavement. The police report lists 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Driver Inexperience' as contributing factors. The collision occurred when the sedan’s right front bumper hit the pedestrian, who was in the crosswalk. No evidence in the report suggests any pedestrian error contributed to the crash. The focus remains on the unlicensed driver’s actions and the systemic danger posed by drivers who disregard basic traffic laws.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The impact ejected the 32-year-old male cyclist from his bike, leaving him semiconscious and bleeding severely from the head. The report notes that the SUV’s front end caved in, while the bicycle was left twisted at the scene. Police cite 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as contributing factors, highlighting driver error as central to the crash. The narrative describes blood pooling from the cyclist’s head and confirms he was not wearing a helmet, but this detail is mentioned only after the driver’s actions.
