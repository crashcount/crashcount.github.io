The violence does not care about age.</p><h3 id=the-most-vulnerable-pay-the-price>The Most Vulnerable Pay the Price</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> SUVs and cars are the main killers, causing the most deaths and injuries. Trucks and buses crush bodies. Bikes and mopeds add to the wounded. The streets are not safe for those outside a steel shell. The old, the young, the ones on foot or on two wheels—these are the ones who bleed.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h3><p>Assembly Member <strong>Robert Carroll</strong> has taken steps. He <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">backed a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters</a>.

Insurance helps after the crash, not before. The streets remain dangerous. The pace of change is slow. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by those in power. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It can end the reign of repeat speeders. It can build real protection at every corner. It can put people before cars. But it will not happen unless you demand it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call Assembly Member Carroll. Tell them to act.</strong> Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a warning.

The bill aimed to cover injuries from crashes and bar retaliation against workers filing claims. DoorDash lobbied against it, backing a weaker bill. The safety analyst notes this defeat reduces accountability and weakens protections for pedestrians and cyclists. Corporate pressure won.

Lawmakers tout support for the injured. But insurance comes after the hit. Speeders keep driving. Danger stays on the street. Prevention takes a back seat.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13, 2025, the New York State Senate passed a bill requiring food delivery apps to provide insurance for delivery workers, pedestrians, and cyclists. The bill, sponsored by Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger, mandates up to $50,000 per person for basic economic loss, regardless of citizenship or employment status. Assembly Member Robert Carroll authored the original Assembly version, stating, 'It is time we require delivery apps to take responsibility for keeping delivery workers and pedestrians safe.' Sen. Andrew Gounardes defended a related speed-limiting bill, but it was weakened. Safety analysts warn: 'Focusing on insurance rather than speed limits shifts responsibility away from prevention and system design, failing to reduce crash risk and potentially discouraging mode shift by not addressing the root causes of danger for pedestrians and cyclists.' Lawmakers back insurance, but leave the streets risky.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill would require 16- and 17-year-olds riding Class 1 or 2 e-bikes, including Citi Bikes, to wear helmets. Committee Chair William Magnarelli (D-Syracuse) defended the bill, stating, "My only concern is the safety of the people riding the bike." The bill summary notes, 'studies have shown [helmet mandates] can dramatically reduce ridership of the city’s bike share system.' Experts warn such laws lead to fewer cyclists and open the door to discriminatory enforcement, especially against youth of color. Seattle dropped its helmet law in 2022 for these reasons. Despite evidence that helmet laws hurt vulnerable road users, the committee advanced the bill without addressing these harms.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill remains pending, with no endorsement yet from Governor Hochul. The Streetsblog article, 'Helicopter Deaths, Fast and Slow,' highlights the recent fatal crash near Jersey City that killed six and draws a stark comparison to the ongoing economic and human toll of helicopter noise. Carroll’s bill is described as the 'gold-standard' for taxing helicopter noise, with estimates that it could reduce flights by 30 to 50 percent. Carroll urges action, calling on the public to pressure Hochul to support the measure. The article underscores that the distress over crash deaths should extend to the daily suffering caused by helicopter noise, which inflicts millions in damages and degrades quality of life for city residents.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
