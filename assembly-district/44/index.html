An old woman in a car. A man crossing the street. In Assembly District 44, the story repeats. In the last twelve months, two people died and six suffered serious injuries in 817 crashes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The numbers are blunt. Children are not spared—one under 18 killed, two more seriously hurt. Cyclists, pedestrians, passengers: none are safe. The street does not care who you are.</p><p>SUVs and trucks hit hardest. In this period, SUVs killed one, trucks another. Bikes and motorcycles left more with broken bodies. The pain spreads across ages. From teenagers to the old, no one is immune.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-bills-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Promises, Bills, and Missed Chances</h3><p>Assembly Member Robert Carroll has stood up for some safety measures. He backed <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/17/seven-brooklyn-electeds-join-growing-calls-for-universal-daylighting>universal daylighting</a>, calling for barriers at corners to keep sightlines clear. He co-sponsored a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting tech in their cars (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">File A 7979</a>). He has spoken out for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/07/two-assembly-pols-congestion-pricing-is-good-policy-democrats-should-embrace-it>congestion pricing</a> to fund transit and cut traffic.</p><p>But not every move helps the most vulnerable. Carroll sponsored a bill to lower the speed threshold for camera tickets (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A6225&amp;term=2025">File A 6225</a>), a step forward. Yet he also supported a teen helmet mandate for e-bikes, a law that puts the onus on young riders, not the drivers or the street. The danger comes from cars and trucks, not from bare heads.</p><h3 id=the-disaster-is-not-over>The Disaster Is Not Over</h3><p>Eight people have died in AD 44 since 2022. Over 1,700 have been hurt. The crashes keep coming. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has the tools to redesign streets, to harden corners, to keep children safe. But the pace is slow. The pain is fast.</p><p>Call your leaders. Demand action. Tell them to use every tool—lower speed limits, daylight every corner, protect every crossing.

Lawmakers tout support for the injured. But insurance comes after the hit. Speeders keep driving. Danger stays on the street. Prevention takes a back seat.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13, 2025, the New York State Senate passed a bill requiring food delivery apps to provide insurance for delivery workers, pedestrians, and cyclists. The bill, sponsored by Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger, mandates up to $50,000 per person for basic economic loss, regardless of citizenship or employment status. Assembly Member Robert Carroll authored the original Assembly version, stating, 'It is time we require delivery apps to take responsibility for keeping delivery workers and pedestrians safe.' Sen. Andrew Gounardes defended a related speed-limiting bill, but it was weakened. Safety analysts warn: 'Focusing on insurance rather than speed limits shifts responsibility away from prevention and system design, failing to reduce crash risk and potentially discouraging mode shift by not addressing the root causes of danger for pedestrians and cyclists.' Lawmakers back insurance, but leave the streets risky.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill would require 16- and 17-year-olds riding Class 1 or 2 e-bikes, including Citi Bikes, to wear helmets. Committee Chair William Magnarelli (D-Syracuse) defended the bill, stating, "My only concern is the safety of the people riding the bike." The bill summary notes, 'studies have shown [helmet mandates] can dramatically reduce ridership of the city’s bike share system.' Experts warn such laws lead to fewer cyclists and open the door to discriminatory enforcement, especially against youth of color. Seattle dropped its helmet law in 2022 for these reasons. Despite evidence that helmet laws hurt vulnerable road users, the committee advanced the bill without addressing these harms.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The damage mounts.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Bill A2583, sponsored by Brooklyn Assembly Member Robert Carroll, seeks to impose hefty fees on non-essential helicopter flights over New York City. The bill remains pending, with no endorsement yet from Governor Hochul. The Streetsblog article, 'Helicopter Deaths, Fast and Slow,' highlights the recent fatal crash near Jersey City that killed six and draws a stark comparison to the ongoing economic and human toll of helicopter noise. Carroll’s bill is described as the 'gold-standard' for taxing helicopter noise, with estimates that it could reduce flights by 30 to 50 percent. Carroll urges action, calling on the public to pressure Hochul to support the measure. The article underscores that the distress over crash deaths should extend to the daily suffering caused by helicopter noise, which inflicts millions in damages and degrades quality of life for city residents.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states the driver was unlicensed and failed to yield the right-of-way. The impact broke the woman’s hip and caused severe lacerations, leaving her conscious but immobilized on the pavement. The police report lists 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Driver Inexperience' as contributing factors. The collision occurred when the sedan’s right front bumper hit the pedestrian, who was in the crosswalk. No evidence in the report suggests any pedestrian error contributed to the crash. The focus remains on the unlicensed driver’s actions and the systemic danger posed by drivers who disregard basic traffic laws.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The impact ejected the 32-year-old male cyclist from his bike, leaving him semiconscious and bleeding severely from the head. The report notes that the SUV’s front end caved in, while the bicycle was left twisted at the scene. Police cite 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as contributing factors, highlighting driver error as central to the crash. The narrative describes blood pooling from the cyclist’s head and confirms he was not wearing a helmet, but this detail is mentioned only after the driver’s actions. Systemic danger persists on Atlantic Avenue, where vulnerable road users face lethal force from vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Advocates back the push.</p><p class=mb3>On January 17, 2024, seven Brooklyn elected officials—including Council Member Shahana Hanif, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, Assembly Members Marcela Mitaynes, Jo Anne Simon, Robert Carroll, and State Senators Zellnor Myrie and Andrew Gounardes—issued a joint letter to the NYC Department of Transportation. They called for 'universal daylighting with hardened materials such as boulders, planters, and bike corrals' at intersections. The officials cited recent fatal crashes and urged the city to opt into a state law banning parking within 20 feet of corners. They want federal funds used for these changes. The group opposes DOT’s slow pace and reliance on paint, demanding physical barriers. Community board leaders and advocates support the move. DOT says it will review the letter and remains committed to evidence-based daylighting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
