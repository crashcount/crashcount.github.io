An old woman in a car. A man crossing the street. In Assembly District 44, the story repeats. In the last twelve months, two people died and six suffered serious injuries in 817 crashes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The numbers are blunt. Children are not spared—one under 18 killed, two more seriously hurt. Cyclists, pedestrians, passengers: none are safe. The street does not care who you are.</p><p>SUVs and trucks hit hardest. In this period, SUVs killed one, trucks another. Bikes and motorcycles left more with broken bodies. The pain spreads across ages. From teenagers to the old, no one is immune.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-bills-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Promises, Bills, and Missed Chances</h3><p>Assembly Member Robert Carroll has stood up for some safety measures. He backed <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/17/seven-brooklyn-electeds-join-growing-calls-for-universal-daylighting>universal daylighting</a>, calling for barriers at corners to keep sightlines clear. He co-sponsored a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting tech in their cars (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">File A 7979</a>). He has spoken out for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/07/two-assembly-pols-congestion-pricing-is-good-policy-democrats-should-embrace-it>congestion pricing</a> to fund transit and cut traffic.</p><p>But not every move helps the most vulnerable. Carroll sponsored a bill to lower the speed threshold for camera tickets (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A6225&amp;term=2025">File A 6225</a>), a step forward. Yet he also supported a teen helmet mandate for e-bikes, a law that puts the onus on young riders, not the drivers or the street.

The bill, sponsored by Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger, mandates up to $50,000 per person for basic economic loss, regardless of citizenship or employment status. Assembly Member Robert Carroll authored the original Assembly version, stating, 'It is time we require delivery apps to take responsibility for keeping delivery workers and pedestrians safe.' Sen. Andrew Gounardes defended a related speed-limiting bill, but it was weakened. Safety analysts warn: 'Focusing on insurance rather than speed limits shifts responsibility away from prevention and system design, failing to reduce crash risk and potentially discouraging mode shift by not addressing the root causes of danger for pedestrians and cyclists.'

Committee Chair William Magnarelli (D-Syracuse) defended the bill, stating, "My only concern is the safety of the people riding the bike." The bill summary notes, 'studies have shown [helmet mandates] can dramatically reduce ridership of the city’s bike share system.' Experts warn such laws lead to fewer cyclists and open the door to discriminatory enforcement, especially against youth of color. Seattle dropped its helmet law in 2022 for these reasons.

The bill remains pending, with no endorsement yet from Governor Hochul. The Streetsblog article, 'Helicopter Deaths, Fast and Slow,' highlights the recent fatal crash near Jersey City that killed six and draws a stark comparison to the ongoing economic and human toll of helicopter noise. Carroll’s bill is described as the 'gold-standard' for taxing helicopter noise, with estimates that it could reduce flights by 30 to 50 percent. Carroll urges action, calling on the public to pressure Hochul to support the measure.

The incident occurred as she stepped down from a parked SUV. The report states, 'A Ford strikes her head with its front bumper. Blood pools on the curb. She is conscious.' The child suffered severe lacerations to her head and was listed as injured but conscious. The police report explicitly notes that 'the driver was distracted' and that 'alcohol was involved.' These driver errors—distraction and alcohol use—are central to the crash. The report does not cite any contributing factors related to the victim’s behavior. The impact and aftermath underscore the ongoing systemic danger faced by the city’s most vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
