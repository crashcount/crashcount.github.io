Thirty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 2,500 hurt since 2022. The bodies are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. They are the woman crushed by a dump truck turning on Butler Street. The cyclist, 24, thrown from his bike and killed on Sackett and 4th. The 72-year-old woman, struck by a taxi at Flatbush and 5th, never made it home. These are not accidents. They are the cost of inaction.</p><h3 id=the-usual-suspects>The Usual Suspects</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most harm.</strong> They killed two, seriously injured eleven, and left over 300 battered. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt nineteen. Bikes, too, left their mark—one dead, one seriously injured, thirty-seven hurt. The street does not care who you are. It only cares how fast and how heavy.</p><h3 id=leadership-small-steps-big-gaps>Leadership: Small Steps, Big Gaps</h3><p>Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon has moved. She voted to extend school speed zones, a step to protect children near schools (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>extended school speed zones</a>). She co-sponsored bills to force repeat speeders to install limiters (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">speed limiter bills</a>). She called for daylighting—removing parked cars from corners—calling it a <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/26/no-brainer-state-pol-seeks-citywide-parking-ban-near-intersections>&ldquo;no-brainer&rdquo;</a> because &ldquo;people feel a lot safer crossing those intersections.&rdquo; But the pace is slow. The deaths keep coming. The city waits for the next name, the next number.</p><h3 id=the-call-no-more-waiting>The Call: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day without action is another day someone does not come home. Call your Assembly Member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed limiters for repeat offenders. Demand daylight at every corner. <strong>Do not wait for another body in the road.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
