The truck kept going. The rider, an off‑duty NYPD officer, died at the hospital, police said. Days later, a driver was arrested and charged with leaving the scene that caused a death (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/truck-driver-charged-off-duty-nypd-officer-killed-hit-run-crash-home-84th-precinct-brooklyn/17676103/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>They were one of the people killed on these roads since 2022.

The BQE is a top danger zone in this district, with a recorded death and 245 injuries. Flatbush Avenue shows another death and 132 injuries. Atlantic Avenue, another death and 120 injuries (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data – crashes</a>).</p><p>Speed and turning movements tell their own story. Mid‑afternoons run hot: injuries crest from 2 PM through the rush, peaking at 190 injuries in the 2 PM hour alone. Evening brings more pain (133 injuries at 8 PM) before the streets finally quiet (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data – crashes</a>).</p><p>Buses, trucks, taxis, SUVs, sedans — all of it mixes with feet and bikes.

On Atlantic Avenue, new mid‑block crossings are going in with lights and ramps after deadly speeds took a life. “A great step forward,” said Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon, who represents this district (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/atlantic-avenue-mid-block-crossings-safety/>Brooklyn Paper</a>).</p><p>The tools are on the table. Simon co‑sponsors a bill to unmask drivers who hide their plates and extends speed‑camera authority (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">A7997</a>). She also backs speed‑limiter mandates for repeat offenders (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">A7979</a>; <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>A2299</a>). At a Borough Hall rally after a mother and two daughters were killed in Gravesend, she said: “The speed limiter technology is available to us. Let’s use it. It will save lives.” (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/stop-super-speeders-brooklyn-borough-hall/>Brooklyn Paper</a>).</p><p>The City Council Member for most of this area is Lincoln Restler. He’s pushed for safer crossings on Atlantic (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/atlantic-avenue-mid-block-crossings-safety/>Brooklyn Paper</a>). State Senator Zellnor Myrie covers part of this district. Albany also moved to keep school speed zones in force; the Assembly passed the fix in June 2025 (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>S8344</a>).</p><p>—</p><p>What would help here now:</p><ul><li>Daylight every corner on Flatbush, Atlantic, and the downtown grid. Use hardened materials, not paint (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/26/no-brainer-state-pol-seeks-citywide-parking-ban-near-intersections>Streetsblog</a>).</li><li>Protect mid‑block crossings on Atlantic with raised islands and tighter turns (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/atlantic-avenue-mid-block-crossings-safety/>Brooklyn Paper</a>).</li><li>Target afternoon rush on the BQE approaches. The injury curve says when and where to show up (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data – crashes</a>).</li></ul><p>Citywide, the next moves are clear. Lower speeds save lives. So do speed limiters on the worst repeat offenders. The laws to do both are on desks right now — and some are already sponsored by the people who represent you here. The death near Atlantic was one morning. The rest of the day kept going.</p><p>Take one step today. Tell City Hall and Albany to act. Start here: <strong><a href=/take_action/>Take action</a></strong>.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The MTA’s $68.4 billion capital plan for 2025-2029 funds the project. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes said, “With elevators coming to the Smith-9th Street station, that’s finally going to change.” Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon praised the MTA for prioritizing accessibility. The upgrades follow a court settlement requiring 95% ADA-accessible stations by 2055. Safety analysts note: elevator installation boosts access for people with mobility challenges but does not directly impact street safety for pedestrians or cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The station, nearly 90 feet above ground, is the city’s tallest and lacks elevators. The matter: 'New York City's tallest subway station will soon have elevators, ending the difficult climb to the platform.' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes led the announcement. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon praised the move. MTA chief accessibility officer Quemuel Arroyo backed the upgrade. Adding elevators boosts access for people with mobility challenges. It makes transit a real option, shifting trips away from cars and easing danger for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Concrete islands promise safer crossings. Details remain thin. Cars may still block buses. The street could change. Pedestrians and riders wait. The city holds its breath.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC (2025-06-09) reports the Department of Transportation plans a center-running bus lane on Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn. The project aims to connect neighborhoods and calm traffic. DOT Assistant Director Dustin Khuu said the goal is a 'high performing transit priority street.' The plan includes concrete bus boarding islands and may reduce car lanes, giving more space to pedestrians and buses. However, the article notes gaps: 'DOT didn't share a block-by-block breakdown,' and curbside parking may remain, risking bus lane obstruction by double-parked vehicles. The city may physically protect the lane, but details are pending. The B41 bus, serving 28,000 daily trips, crawls at 4 mph during rush hour. The proposal highlights the need for clear enforcement and design to keep cars out of bus lanes and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city moves to fix a deadly, clogged corridor.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist reported on June 4, 2025, that New York City's Department of Transportation plans to overhaul Flatbush Avenue between Livingston Street and Grand Army Plaza. The redesign replaces two car lanes with 24/7 bus-only lanes and adds pedestrian islands. DOT officials said, 'almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles.' Since 2019, 55 people have been killed or severely injured in crashes along this stretch. The plan removes curbside parking and bans cars from bus lanes, aiming to speed up twelve bus routes and protect people on foot. Most residents in the area do not own cars and depend on slow buses. The proposal reflects a shift toward prioritizing vulnerable road users and addressing systemic danger on one of Brooklyn's busiest corridors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The letter called the block a 'missing link in Brooklyn’s protected bike lane network.' Brooklyn Community Board 2 backed the demand.

He struck pedestrian Katherine Harris, 31, killing her instantly, then rear-ended another car and crashed into an outdoor dining shed. Trujillo's blood alcohol level was .17, more than twice the legal limit. The article quotes Brooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez: "This defendant made a disastrous decision when he got behind the wheel of a car while intoxicated." The case highlights the lethal consequences of impaired driving and excessive speed, underscoring systemic risks for pedestrians in New York City.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states that a motorcycle 'clipped a sedan pulling into a spot.' The impact left a 52-year-old woman, riding as a rear passenger on the motorcycle, with crush injuries to her leg. She was helmeted and remained conscious after the crash. Both vehicles were traveling northbound; the sedan was entering a parked position while the motorcycle was passing.
