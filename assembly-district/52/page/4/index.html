Eight left with life-changing injuries.</strong> In the last year alone, 667 hurt, 1,461 crashes. In Assembly District 52, the violence comes steady—old, young, walking, riding, waiting. A woman, 83, crossing Butler Street. A 74-year-old man, ejected from his e-bike on Tillary. A right rear passenger, crushed in a car on State Street. The numbers are not just numbers.

The event came as the public comment period for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Central Business District Tolling Program ended. The plan would toll drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street, aiming to cut traffic and pollution. Restler said, “This is a tangible, major, sweeping policy that will dramatically reduce the number of cars and trucks on the street in New York City.” He supported limited exemptions, especially for taxis and for-hire vehicles, but stressed the need to keep cars off the road. The rally urged the Federal Highway Administration to approve the plan, which is expected to shift commuters to mass transit and modernize city infrastructure. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon also backed a taxi carveout.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
