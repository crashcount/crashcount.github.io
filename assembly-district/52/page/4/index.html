The truck kept going. The rider, an off‑duty NYPD officer, died at the hospital, police said. Days later, a driver was arrested and charged with leaving the scene that caused a death (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/truck-driver-charged-off-duty-nypd-officer-killed-hit-run-crash-home-84th-precinct-brooklyn/17676103/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>They were one of the people killed on these roads since 2022. In the same span, people walking and biking here absorbed the blows: <strong>451 pedestrians injured, 467 cyclists injured</strong>, and at least <strong>4 killed</strong> among them (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data – crashes</a>).</p><p>BQE, Flatbush, Atlantic: names that keep showing up. The BQE is a top danger zone in this district, with a recorded death and 245 injuries. Flatbush Avenue shows another death and 132 injuries. Atlantic Avenue, another death and 120 injuries (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data – crashes</a>).</p><p>Speed and turning movements tell their own story. Mid‑afternoons run hot: injuries crest from 2 PM through the rush, peaking at 190 injuries in the 2 PM hour alone. Evening brings more pain (133 injuries at 8 PM) before the streets finally quiet (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data – crashes</a>).</p><p>Buses, trucks, taxis, SUVs, sedans — all of it mixes with feet and bikes. Pedestrians here are most often hit by sedans and SUVs, but trucks and buses still leave a mark (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data – persons</a>).</p><p>—</p><p>BQE at Atlantic is not a surprise. Reporters wrote that morning bluntly: struck near the exit, motorcycle into a wall, flames, and a driver who didn’t stop (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/27/nypd-cop-dies-in-fiery-bqe-motorcycle-crash-on-way-to-work/>NY Daily News</a>; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/off-duty-nypd-officer-killed-hit-run-crash-work-brooklyn/17664404/>ABC7</a>). The arrest followed the next day (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/truck-driver-charged-off-duty-nypd-officer-killed-hit-run-crash-home-84th-precinct-brooklyn/17676103/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>At street level, the pattern is plain. A 59‑year‑old woman, killed in a marked crosswalk at Kent and Taylor by a left‑turning SUV. Police coded it as failure to yield and improper lane use (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data – crash 4585564</a>). An 83‑year‑old woman, killed by a right‑turning dump truck at Butler and Bond (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data – crash 4735930</a>). A 24‑year‑old e‑biker, killed at 4th Avenue and Sackett in a multi‑vehicle crush (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data – crash 4767852</a>).</p><p>—</p><p>Corners hide people. Cars park to the edge. Advocates and electeds have been pushing the city to clear sightlines. One called daylighting “a no‑brainer,” adding, “people feel a lot safer crossing those intersections” (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/26/no-brainer-state-pol-seeks-citywide-parking-ban-near-intersections>Streetsblog</a>). On Atlantic Avenue, new mid‑block crossings are going in with lights and ramps after deadly speeds took a life. “A great step forward,” said Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon, who represents this district (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/atlantic-avenue-mid-block-crossings-safety/>Brooklyn Paper</a>).</p><p>The tools are on the table. Simon co‑sponsors a bill to unmask drivers who hide their plates and extends speed‑camera authority (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">A7997</a>). She also backs speed‑limiter mandates for repeat offenders (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">A7979</a>; <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>A2299</a>). At a Borough Hall rally after a mother and two daughters were killed in Gravesend, she said: “The speed limiter technology is available to us. Let’s use it. It will save lives.” (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/stop-super-speeders-brooklyn-borough-hall/>Brooklyn Paper</a>).</p><p>The City Council Member for most of this area is Lincoln Restler. He’s pushed for safer crossings on Atlantic (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/atlantic-avenue-mid-block-crossings-safety/>Brooklyn Paper</a>). State Senator Zellnor Myrie covers part of this district. Albany also moved to keep school speed zones in force; the Assembly passed the fix in June 2025 (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>S8344</a>).</p><p>—</p><p>What would help here now:</p><ul><li>Daylight every corner on Flatbush, Atlantic, and the downtown grid. Use hardened materials, not paint (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/26/no-brainer-state-pol-seeks-citywide-parking-ban-near-intersections>Streetsblog</a>).</li><li>Protect mid‑block crossings on Atlantic with raised islands and tighter turns (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/atlantic-avenue-mid-block-crossings-safety/>Brooklyn Paper</a>).</li><li>Target afternoon rush on the BQE approaches. The injury curve says when and where to show up (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data – crashes</a>).</li></ul><p>Citywide, the next moves are clear. Lower speeds save lives. So do speed limiters on the worst repeat offenders. The laws to do both are on desks right now — and some are already sponsored by the people who represent you here. The death near Atlantic was one morning. The rest of the day kept going.</p><p>Take one step today. Tell City Hall and Albany to act.

The debate rages on.</p><p class=mb3>On March 4, 2023, a closed-door City Hall meeting gathered Brooklyn political figures to debate the future of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The event, organized by Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi, focused on whether to reduce the BQE from three lanes to two. Former Brooklyn Democratic Party Chair Frank Seddio opposed the lane reduction, urging allies to resist the change. The meeting excluded some officials who support shrinking the highway, such as Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon and State Senator Andrew Gounardes, who cite environmental and community health concerns. Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized the city for favoring a three-lane solution and sidelining affected communities. City Hall denied taking a side, stating, 'the decision would be based on a DOT traffic study.' No formal council bill or vote was recorded, and no safety analyst assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They reject piecemeal fixes. They call out decades of harm. The state’s refusal leaves neighborhoods exposed. The city’s hands are tied. The highway’s danger remains. Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On February 10, 2023, eighteen Brooklyn lawmakers issued a joint letter demanding New York State Department of Transportation (DOT) participate in comprehensive planning for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens. Jabari Brisport, Julia Salazar, Kristen Gonzalez, Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Members Bobby Carroll, Maritza Davila, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Emily Gallagher, Jo Anne Simon, Marcela Mitaynes, and Council Members Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Lincoln Restler. Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint. Without state action, only city-owned segments see attention. The city’s efforts are limited. The state’s inaction leaves systemic danger unaddressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT Deputy Commissioner Margaret Forgione said, 'There is not really a safe level of drinking and driving, but the law suggests there is.' In 2021, 42 people died in drunk driving crashes, up 60 percent from previous years. Officials promise enforcement and education, but their messaging targets drinking, not the act of driving.
