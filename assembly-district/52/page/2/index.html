So do the crashes.</p><p><strong>Eleven people have died here since 2022.</strong> The city’s own files show three pedestrians, one cyclist, one on an e‑bike, one on a moped, and five vehicle occupants in Assembly District 52. The injury count is in the thousands. The map doesn’t blink.</p><h3 id=where-the-blood-pools>Where the blood pools</h3><p>The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Brooklyn‑Queens Expressway</a> is the district’s top hotspot, with the most injuries and three serious injuries tallied; two separate motorcycle deaths were reported there this year, one near Emerson Place where, police said, the rider “was zipping west” before losing control (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/03/motorcyclist-dies-after-losing-control-in-crash-on-brooklyn-queens-expressway/>Daily News</a>). Another BQE case ended with an arrest for unlicensed driving and no ignition interlock where one man died at Tillary Street (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/bqe-traffic-collision-arrest-05102025/>amNY</a>).</p><p>At <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Tillary Street</a> and Jay, a bus turning right hit a 74‑year‑old man on an e‑bike. He died there on November 6, 2024, the record says. Tillary is the second‑worst location in the district by serious injuries.</p><p>On <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Flatbush Avenue</a>, one person died and more than a hundred were hurt. Flatbush carries buses and trucks and families. It also carries the weight of bad choices; DOT now plans center bus lanes and boarding islands to separate modes and slow conflict points (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/flatbush-avenue-bus-lanes-dot-redesign-plan/>amNY</a>).</p><h3 id=the-hours-that-break-bones>The hours that break bones</h3><p>The pain peaks in daylight. Injuries stack up from late morning into the evening commute: 10 a.m. through 6 p.m. shows repeated spikes, with deaths logged at 10, 11, 3, 4, and 5 p.m., plus nights at 8 and 11 p.m. The city’s file shows more than 170 injuries in the 3 p.m. hour alone, and another 170 at 4 p.m. (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). School lets out. Workers head home. Sirens follow.</p><p>Heavy vehicles hit hard. Trucks and buses account for dozens of pedestrian injuries here, including a pedestrian death by a dump truck turning right at Butler and Bond on June 26, 2024 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash record</a>).</p><h3 id=what-kills-again-and-again>What kills, again and again</h3><p>The data doesn’t hedge. “Other” driver factors top the chart, linked to six deaths and 700 injuries. “Vulnerable road user error” appears in two deaths and 108 injuries. Inattention and red‑light running follow with smaller but steady counts. This is the ledger, not an excuse. The dead can’t answer checkboxes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>On Fourth Avenue at Sackett, a 24‑year‑old cyclist on an e‑bike was crushed in October 2024, with a pickup truck listed “going straight ahead.” On Tillary and Jay, a bus turned and a rider never got up. On Flatbush at State, a 45‑year‑old passenger died in a two‑car crash just before midnight this February. The forms say “apparent death.” They say “crush injuries.” They don’t say who waited for them at home (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=officials-talk-the-road-keeps-taking>Officials talk. The road keeps taking.</h3><p>“Overweight trucks cause wear and tear on our roadways and we all pay the price,” said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez as the city moved to ticket overloaded BQE trucks with sensors and $650 fines (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-to-ticket-overweight-staten-island-bound-trucks-on-bqe-starting-sunday>Gothamist</a>). That protects steel and concrete. People need more than that.</p><p>“The speed limiter technology is available to us. Let’s use it. It will save lives,” Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon said while backing a bill to require intelligent speed assistance for repeat speed offenders, modeled on state proposals by Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/stop-super-speeders-brooklyn-borough-hall/>Brooklyn Paper</a>). Simon has also sponsored measures to extend school‑zone speed rules and expand enforcement against obscured plates (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>S 8344</a>, <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">A 7997</a>).</p><h3 id=fix-the-corners-fix-the-turns-fix-the-speed>Fix the corners. Fix the turns. Fix the speed.</h3><p>Tillary. Flatbush. Atlantic. Daylight the corners citywide to open sight lines, as Simon and others have urged; take cars back from intersections with hardened materials, not paint (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/17/seven-brooklyn-electeds-join-growing-calls-for-universal-daylighting>Streetsblog</a>, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/26/no-brainer-state-pol-seeks-citywide-parking-ban-near-intersections>‘No‑Brainer’ bill</a>).</p><p>On Atlantic Avenue, the city added mid‑block crossings after a high‑speed death; leaders called it a “step forward.” Build more. Curb extensions and protected islands force slower turns and shorter crossings (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/atlantic-avenue-mid-block-crossings-safety/>Brooklyn Paper</a>).</p><p>Keep trucks in check on the BQE and route the biggest rigs off local streets; the sensors are a start. Then narrow lanes and add protected space where the injuries stack up.</p><h3 id=stop-the-next-obituary>Stop the next obituary</h3><p>Citywide rules decide who lives. Albany extended school‑zone protections (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>S 8344</a>). The Council and DOT can go further. Lower speeds save lives. And the worst repeat speeders need cars that won’t let them speed—full stop. Advocates say the tech is ready. The death toll says the clock ran out a long time ago (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/stop-super-speeders-brooklyn-borough-hall/>Brooklyn Paper</a>).</p><p>One more name, one more corner. Same streets. Same ending.</p><p>Take one step today. Tell City Hall to slow the cars and back speed limiters for repeat offenders. Start here: <a href=/take_action/>take action</a>.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The victim leapt onto the hood and was carried nearly 330 feet before being thrown onto the roadway, suffering serious injuries. Angstadt fled the scene.

The report states she was 'crossing with the light' when a speeding e-bike struck her, causing 'severe lacerations' to her entire body. She remained conscious after the impact. The e-bike operator, described as unlicensed, did not stop at the scene. The police report lists 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' as contributing factors. The e-bike showed no visible damage. The victim’s action—crossing with the signal—is noted in the report, but the primary focus remains on the rider’s speed, improper lane usage, and lack of a valid license. The crash underscores the dangers posed by reckless operation and systemic failures to control unlicensed riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

She was helmeted and remained conscious after the crash. Both vehicles were traveling northbound; the sedan was entering a parked position while the motorcycle was passing.

The bill, now under consideration, has strong support: sixteen community boards and over three dozen elected officials have signed on. The measure aims to remove parked cars from corners, a practice called 'daylighting,' to improve visibility and cut intersection crashes. Simon called it a 'no-brainer,' saying, 'people feel a lot safer crossing those intersections.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez has voiced concerns that daylighting could lead to faster, more dangerous turns, but advocates like Sara Lind of Open Plans counter that daylighting is 'proven and widely popular.' The DOT missed a deadline for a daylighting safety study but claims it will daylight 1,000 intersections this year. Advocates urge the city to follow the law and protect vulnerable road users at every intersection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Disability advocates like Elizabeth Valdez and Joe Rappaport stressed that most disabled New Yorkers rely on subways and buses, not private cars.

Seven people were inside. In the right rear seat, a 27-year-old man screamed as his leg was crushed. He wore a lap belt and harness. The report lists 'Tire Failure/Inadequate' and 'Outside Car Distraction' as contributing factors. No driver errors such as speeding or failure to yield were cited. The injured passenger suffered severe crush injuries to his lower leg and foot and was in shock. The crash shows the brutal cost of mechanical failure and distraction for those inside.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
