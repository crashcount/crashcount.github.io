So do the crashes.</p><p><strong>Eleven people have died here since 2022.</strong> The city’s own files show three pedestrians, one cyclist, one on an e‑bike, one on a moped, and five vehicle occupants in Assembly District 52. The injury count is in the thousands. The map doesn’t blink.</p><h3 id=where-the-blood-pools>Where the blood pools</h3><p>The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Brooklyn‑Queens Expressway</a> is the district’s top hotspot, with the most injuries and three serious injuries tallied; two separate motorcycle deaths were reported there this year, one near Emerson Place where, police said, the rider “was zipping west” before losing control (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/03/motorcyclist-dies-after-losing-control-in-crash-on-brooklyn-queens-expressway/>Daily News</a>). Another BQE case ended with an arrest for unlicensed driving and no ignition interlock where one man died at Tillary Street (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/bqe-traffic-collision-arrest-05102025/>amNY</a>).</p><p>At <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Tillary Street</a> and Jay, a bus turning right hit a 74‑year‑old man on an e‑bike. He died there on November 6, 2024, the record says. Tillary is the second‑worst location in the district by serious injuries.</p><p>On <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Flatbush Avenue</a>, one person died and more than a hundred were hurt. Flatbush carries buses and trucks and families. It also carries the weight of bad choices; DOT now plans center bus lanes and boarding islands to separate modes and slow conflict points (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/flatbush-avenue-bus-lanes-dot-redesign-plan/>amNY</a>).</p><h3 id=the-hours-that-break-bones>The hours that break bones</h3><p>The pain peaks in daylight. Injuries stack up from late morning into the evening commute: 10 a.m. through 6 p.m. shows repeated spikes, with deaths logged at 10, 11, 3, 4, and 5 p.m., plus nights at 8 and 11 p.m. The city’s file shows more than 170 injuries in the 3 p.m. hour alone, and another 170 at 4 p.m. (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). School lets out. Workers head home. Sirens follow.</p><p>Heavy vehicles hit hard. Trucks and buses account for dozens of pedestrian injuries here, including a pedestrian death by a dump truck turning right at Butler and Bond on June 26, 2024 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash record</a>).</p><h3 id=what-kills-again-and-again>What kills, again and again</h3><p>The data doesn’t hedge. “Other” driver factors top the chart, linked to six deaths and 700 injuries. “Vulnerable road user error” appears in two deaths and 108 injuries. Inattention and red‑light running follow with smaller but steady counts. This is the ledger, not an excuse. The dead can’t answer checkboxes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>On Fourth Avenue at Sackett, a 24‑year‑old cyclist on an e‑bike was crushed in October 2024, with a pickup truck listed “going straight ahead.” On Tillary and Jay, a bus turned and a rider never got up. On Flatbush at State, a 45‑year‑old passenger died in a two‑car crash just before midnight this February. The forms say “apparent death.” They say “crush injuries.” They don’t say who waited for them at home (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=officials-talk-the-road-keeps-taking>Officials talk. The road keeps taking.</h3><p>“Overweight trucks cause wear and tear on our roadways and we all pay the price,” said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez as the city moved to ticket overloaded BQE trucks with sensors and $650 fines (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-to-ticket-overweight-staten-island-bound-trucks-on-bqe-starting-sunday>Gothamist</a>). That protects steel and concrete. People need more than that.</p><p>“The speed limiter technology is available to us. Let’s use it. It will save lives,” Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon said while backing a bill to require intelligent speed assistance for repeat speed offenders, modeled on state proposals by Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/stop-super-speeders-brooklyn-borough-hall/>Brooklyn Paper</a>). Simon has also sponsored measures to extend school‑zone speed rules and expand enforcement against obscured plates (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>S 8344</a>, <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">A 7997</a>).</p><h3 id=fix-the-corners-fix-the-turns-fix-the-speed>Fix the corners. Fix the turns. Fix the speed.</h3><p>Tillary. Flatbush. Atlantic. Daylight the corners citywide to open sight lines, as Simon and others have urged; take cars back from intersections with hardened materials, not paint (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/17/seven-brooklyn-electeds-join-growing-calls-for-universal-daylighting>Streetsblog</a>, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/26/no-brainer-state-pol-seeks-citywide-parking-ban-near-intersections>‘No‑Brainer’ bill</a>).</p><p>On Atlantic Avenue, the city added mid‑block crossings after a high‑speed death; leaders called it a “step forward.” Build more. Curb extensions and protected islands force slower turns and shorter crossings (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/atlantic-avenue-mid-block-crossings-safety/>Brooklyn Paper</a>).</p><p>Keep trucks in check on the BQE and route the biggest rigs off local streets; the sensors are a start. Then narrow lanes and add protected space where the injuries stack up.</p><h3 id=stop-the-next-obituary>Stop the next obituary</h3><p>Citywide rules decide who lives. Albany extended school‑zone protections (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>S 8344</a>). The Council and DOT can go further. Lower speeds save lives. And the worst repeat speeders need cars that won’t let them speed—full stop. Advocates say the tech is ready. The death toll says the clock ran out a long time ago (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/stop-super-speeders-brooklyn-borough-hall/>Brooklyn Paper</a>).</p><p>One more name, one more corner. Same streets. Same ending.</p><p>Take one step today. Tell City Hall to slow the cars and back speed limiters for repeat offenders. Start here: <a href=/take_action/>take action</a>.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The move targets deadly corners where cars block sightlines. Sixteen community boards and dozens of officials back it. DOT drags its feet. Advocates demand action.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon introduced a bill to end New York City's exemption from the state law banning parking within 20 feet of intersections. The bill, now under consideration, has strong support: sixteen community boards and over three dozen elected officials have signed on. The measure aims to remove parked cars from corners, a practice called 'daylighting,' to improve visibility and cut intersection crashes. Simon called it a 'no-brainer,' saying, 'people feel a lot safer crossing those intersections.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez has voiced concerns that daylighting could lead to faster, more dangerous turns, but advocates like Sara Lind of Open Plans counter that daylighting is 'proven and widely popular.' The DOT missed a deadline for a daylighting safety study but claims it will daylight 1,000 intersections this year. Advocates urge the city to follow the law and protect vulnerable road users at every intersection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The system fails those who need it most.</p><p class=mb3>On February 23, 2024, at a press conference, Brooklyn State Senator Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymember Jo Anne Simon condemned lawsuits blocking the MTA’s congestion pricing plan. The matter, titled 'Congestion Pricing Opponents Are Blocking Disabled Access to Mass Transit, Politicians Charge,' highlights how legal challenges from New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, the United Federation of Teachers, and others have forced the MTA to halt critical accessibility upgrades. Gounardes declared, 'That’s not gonna happen if the money’s not there.' The MTA earmarked $6 billion for accessibility, aiming to make 70 stations ADA accessible and modernize 78 elevators. Disability advocates like Elizabeth Valdez and Joe Rappaport stressed that most disabled New Yorkers rely on subways and buses, not private cars. Christopher Schuyler noted congestion pricing would speed up paratransit and wheelchair-accessible vehicles. Without funding, the city’s most vulnerable remain stranded.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city’s hand finally moves after years of blood.</p><p class=mb3>On February 5, 2024, Council Member Lincoln Restler announced new mid-block pedestrian crossings on Atlantic Avenue, Brooklyn’s so-called 'Boulevard of Death.' The crossings, between Nevins and Bond, Bond and Hoyt, and Hoyt and Smith streets, add crosswalks, traffic lights, and ramps. Restler said, 'These new mid-block crossings will create a greater sense of safety and community for Boerum Hill.' The Department of Transportation acted after Restler and others demanded change following the death of Katherine Harris, killed by a speeding driver. DOT’s study found hundreds of people crossing mid-block every weekend. Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called the project a way to 'enhance safety by better managing traffic.' Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon called the improvements 'a great step forward.' The city has finished installing signals and is completing ramps and crosswalks. Leaders want more: curb extensions, redesigned crossings, and further traffic calming. Atlantic Avenue remains a battleground for the city’s most vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists now dodge cars and illegal parking. Elected officials and advocates demand action. DOT cites traffic, but danger grows. Pedestrians lose safe crossings. The agency stays silent. Streets stay deadly.</p><p class=mb3>On September 18, 2023, a coalition of elected officials and advocates called out the Department of Transportation for removing protected bike lanes on Brooklyn’s Fourth Avenue during construction. The matter, described as 'DOT continues to ignore dangers it created on Brooklyn’s Fourth Ave,' centers on DOT’s decision to replace bike lanes with a second car lane, violating a city law that requires temporary bike lanes during such work. Council Members Lincoln Restler, Alexa Aviles, Shahana Hanif, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, State Senator Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, and groups like Bike New York and Transportation Alternatives sent a letter demanding the bike lane’s return and physical barriers to stop illegal parking on pedestrian islands. The letter urges DOT to 'ensure curb lanes be preserved for safe cyclist passage' and to 'deploy quick-build physical elements' for pedestrian safety. DOT has not responded. Cyclists and pedestrians remain at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
