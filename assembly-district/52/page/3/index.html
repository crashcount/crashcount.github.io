Eight left with life-changing injuries.</strong> In the last year alone, 667 hurt, 1,461 crashes. In Assembly District 52, the violence comes steady—old, young, walking, riding, waiting. A woman, 83, crossing Butler Street. A 74-year-old man, ejected from his e-bike on Tillary. A right rear passenger, crushed in a car on State Street. The numbers are not just numbers. They are names, faces, families who do not get to go home.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-do-the-damage>The Machines That Do the Damage</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do most of the killing.</strong> In this district, SUVs and sedans caused 2 deaths and 10 serious injuries to pedestrians. Trucks and buses, 1 death and 1 serious injury. Bikes, 1 serious injury. The street is not a fair fight. The bigger machine wins. The pedestrian loses. The cyclist loses. The child loses.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon has not been silent.

It will save lives.&rdquo; Simon <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/stop-super-speeders-brooklyn-borough-hall/>urged action</a>.

The carnage does not wait.</p><h3 id=the-call-that-cannot-wait>The Call That Cannot Wait</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of blood on the street.</strong> Call Jo Anne Simon. Call your council member. Demand the city use its new power to lower speed limits. Demand Albany pass the speed limiter bill. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand the city stop making excuses. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Their letter to the Traffic Mobility Review Board states: 'No one community should disproportionately bear the burden of the cars and trucks passing through their neighborhood.' Hanif, along with Lincoln Restler, Alexa Avilés, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Crystal Hudson, joined borough, state, and federal colleagues in this push. They propose a credit system to balance costs between DOT bridges and MTA tunnels, aiming to protect neighborhoods like the Brooklyn waterfront and the BQE corridor from traffic surges. The MTA declined comment. The Board will soon set final toll rates and rules. The federal government has approved the congestion pricing plan, with tolls for cars expected between $9 and $23. Over 100 exemption requests, including from taxi and for-hire vehicle drivers, are under review.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plans, discussed in committee, propose new highway off-ramps on Hicks Street. The matter summary states: 'DOT proposals rely on outdated approaches by building new highway ramps instead of eliminating them.' Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon criticized the plan for increasing traffic and pollution near homes, urging a new approach: 'They need to go back to the drawing board.' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes called out the reliance on old infrastructure, saying, 'The proposals should not be doubling down on the infrastructure and transportation of the past.' Former DOT Commissioner Hank Gutman said, 'They don't improve safety, they don't improve traffic, and they certainly don't improve any of the surrounding communities.'

The bill lingers in committee. Drunk drivers killed 42 New Yorkers last year. Messaging still centers on not drinking, not on not driving.</p><p class=mb3>Senate Bill sponsored by John Liu and Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon seeks to lower New York’s DWI blood-alcohol threshold from 0.08% to 0.05%. The bill, re-submitted in the last legislative session, remains stuck in committee. At a December 22, 2022 press conference, DOT Deputy Commissioner Margaret Forgione said, 'There is not really a safe level of drinking and driving, but the law suggests there is.' Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and NYPD’s Kim Royster also spoke, focusing on enforcement and urging drivers to avoid drinking before driving. Advocates like Alisa McMorris of Mothers Against Drunk Driving called for stronger messaging: 'We want people to make choices before they leave their home.' Despite evidence that lowering the threshold could cut traffic deaths by 10%, city messaging still stops short of telling people not to drive to events where they plan to drink.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
