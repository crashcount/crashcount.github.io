So do the crashes.</p><p><strong>Eleven people have died here since 2022.</strong> The city’s own files show three pedestrians, one cyclist, one on an e‑bike, one on a moped, and five vehicle occupants in Assembly District 52. The injury count is in the thousands. The map doesn’t blink.</p><h3 id=where-the-blood-pools>Where the blood pools</h3><p>The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Brooklyn‑Queens Expressway</a> is the district’s top hotspot, with the most injuries and three serious injuries tallied; two separate motorcycle deaths were reported there this year, one near Emerson Place where, police said, the rider “was zipping west” before losing control (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/03/motorcyclist-dies-after-losing-control-in-crash-on-brooklyn-queens-expressway/>Daily News</a>). Another BQE case ended with an arrest for unlicensed driving and no ignition interlock where one man died at Tillary Street (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/bqe-traffic-collision-arrest-05102025/>amNY</a>).</p><p>At <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Tillary Street</a> and Jay, a bus turning right hit a 74‑year‑old man on an e‑bike. He died there on November 6, 2024, the record says. Tillary is the second‑worst location in the district by serious injuries.</p><p>On <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Flatbush Avenue</a>, one person died and more than a hundred were hurt. Flatbush carries buses and trucks and families. It also carries the weight of bad choices; DOT now plans center bus lanes and boarding islands to separate modes and slow conflict points (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/flatbush-avenue-bus-lanes-dot-redesign-plan/>amNY</a>).</p><h3 id=the-hours-that-break-bones>The hours that break bones</h3><p>The pain peaks in daylight. Injuries stack up from late morning into the evening commute: 10 a.m. through 6 p.m. shows repeated spikes, with deaths logged at 10, 11, 3, 4, and 5 p.m., plus nights at 8 and 11 p.m. The city’s file shows more than 170 injuries in the 3 p.m. hour alone, and another 170 at 4 p.m. (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). School lets out. Workers head home. Sirens follow.</p><p>Heavy vehicles hit hard. Trucks and buses account for dozens of pedestrian injuries here, including a pedestrian death by a dump truck turning right at Butler and Bond on June 26, 2024 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash record</a>).</p><h3 id=what-kills-again-and-again>What kills, again and again</h3><p>The data doesn’t hedge. “Other” driver factors top the chart, linked to six deaths and 700 injuries. “Vulnerable road user error” appears in two deaths and 108 injuries. Inattention and red‑light running follow with smaller but steady counts. This is the ledger, not an excuse. The dead can’t answer checkboxes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>On Fourth Avenue at Sackett, a 24‑year‑old cyclist on an e‑bike was crushed in October 2024, with a pickup truck listed “going straight ahead.” On Tillary and Jay, a bus turned and a rider never got up. On Flatbush at State, a 45‑year‑old passenger died in a two‑car crash just before midnight this February. The forms say “apparent death.” They say “crush injuries.” They don’t say who waited for them at home (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=officials-talk-the-road-keeps-taking>Officials talk. The road keeps taking.</h3><p>“Overweight trucks cause wear and tear on our roadways and we all pay the price,” said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez as the city moved to ticket overloaded BQE trucks with sensors and $650 fines (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-to-ticket-overweight-staten-island-bound-trucks-on-bqe-starting-sunday>Gothamist</a>). That protects steel and concrete. People need more than that.</p><p>“The speed limiter technology is available to us. Let’s use it. It will save lives,” Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon said while backing a bill to require intelligent speed assistance for repeat speed offenders, modeled on state proposals by Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/stop-super-speeders-brooklyn-borough-hall/>Brooklyn Paper</a>). Simon has also sponsored measures to extend school‑zone speed rules and expand enforcement against obscured plates (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>S 8344</a>, <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">A 7997</a>).</p><h3 id=fix-the-corners-fix-the-turns-fix-the-speed>Fix the corners. Fix the turns. Fix the speed.</h3><p>Tillary. Flatbush. Atlantic. Daylight the corners citywide to open sight lines, as Simon and others have urged; take cars back from intersections with hardened materials, not paint (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/17/seven-brooklyn-electeds-join-growing-calls-for-universal-daylighting>Streetsblog</a>, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/26/no-brainer-state-pol-seeks-citywide-parking-ban-near-intersections>‘No‑Brainer’ bill</a>).</p><p>On Atlantic Avenue, the city added mid‑block crossings after a high‑speed death; leaders called it a “step forward.” Build more. Curb extensions and protected islands force slower turns and shorter crossings (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/atlantic-avenue-mid-block-crossings-safety/>Brooklyn Paper</a>).</p><p>Keep trucks in check on the BQE and route the biggest rigs off local streets; the sensors are a start. Then narrow lanes and add protected space where the injuries stack up.</p><h3 id=stop-the-next-obituary>Stop the next obituary</h3><p>Citywide rules decide who lives. Albany extended school‑zone protections (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>S 8344</a>). The Council and DOT can go further. Lower speeds save lives. And the worst repeat speeders need cars that won’t let them speed—full stop. Advocates say the tech is ready. The death toll says the clock ran out a long time ago (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/stop-super-speeders-brooklyn-borough-hall/>Brooklyn Paper</a>).</p><p>One more name, one more corner. Same streets. Same ending.</p><p>Take one step today. Tell City Hall to slow the cars and back speed limiters for repeat offenders. Start here: <a href=/take_action/>take action</a>.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter, described as 'DOT continues to ignore dangers it created on Brooklyn’s Fourth Ave,' centers on DOT’s decision to replace bike lanes with a second car lane, violating a city law that requires temporary bike lanes during such work. Council Members Lincoln Restler, Alexa Aviles, Shahana Hanif, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, State Senator Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, and groups like Bike New York and Transportation Alternatives sent a letter demanding the bike lane’s return and physical barriers to stop illegal parking on pedestrian islands. The letter urges DOT to 'ensure curb lanes be preserved for safe cyclist passage' and to 'deploy quick-build physical elements' for pedestrian safety. DOT has not responded. Cyclists and pedestrians remain at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation (DOT) unveiled three concepts for the Atlantic Avenue interchange, restoring three lanes each way and adding a new off-ramp on Hicks Street. The coalition’s letter called this 'extremely misguided.' Former DOT Commissioner Hank Gutman said the proposals 'don’t improve safety, they don’t improve traffic, and they certainly don’t improve any of the surrounding communities.' Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon backed a corridor-wide approach and prolonging the cantilever’s life for better planning. The groups urge immediate repairs, less traffic, and more transit. DOT Press Secretary Vin Barone defended the plan, citing federal funding and green space. The community’s message is clear: the city’s current approach puts vulnerable road users at risk and fails to meet safety or environmental needs.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Their letter to the Traffic Mobility Review Board states: 'No one community should disproportionately bear the burden of the cars and trucks passing through their neighborhood.' Hanif, along with Lincoln Restler, Alexa Avilés, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Crystal Hudson, joined borough, state, and federal colleagues in this push. They propose a credit system to balance costs between DOT bridges and MTA tunnels, aiming to protect neighborhoods like the Brooklyn waterfront and the BQE corridor from traffic surges. The MTA declined comment. The Board will soon set final toll rates and rules. The federal government has approved the congestion pricing plan, with tolls for cars expected between $9 and $23. Over 100 exemption requests, including from taxi and for-hire vehicle drivers, are under review.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Bike lanes appear, but real safety gains remain unclear.</p><p class=mb3>On July 7, 2023, the Department of Transportation unveiled redesign concepts for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway’s Atlantic Avenue interchange. The plans, discussed in committee, propose new highway off-ramps on Hicks Street. The matter summary states: 'DOT proposals rely on outdated approaches by building new highway ramps instead of eliminating them.' Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon criticized the plan for increasing traffic and pollution near homes, urging a new approach: 'They need to go back to the drawing board.' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes called out the reliance on old infrastructure, saying, 'The proposals should not be doubling down on the infrastructure and transportation of the past.' Former DOT Commissioner Hank Gutman said, 'They don't improve safety, they don't improve traffic, and they certainly don't improve any of the surrounding communities.' All concepts include a buffered or protected bike lane on Atlantic Avenue, but the impact on vulnerable road users remains uncertain.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

NYPD Chief Kim Royster and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez echoed the urgency. The bill awaits action in Albany.

The danger remains for those outside the car.</p><p class=mb3>Senate and Assembly bill, sponsored by Sen. John Liu and Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon, seeks to lower New York’s drunk driving threshold from 0.08 to 0.05 percent BAC. Announced at a December 22, 2022 press conference, the bill has stalled in committee for years. The matter aims to redefine DWI: 'driving while intoxicated would be defined as anything above a blood-alcohol content of 0.05 percent.' Simon and Liu back the measure; city DOT and NYPD leaders joined them. DOT Deputy Commissioner Margaret Forgione said, 'There is not really a safe level of drinking and driving, but the law suggests there is.' In 2021, 42 people died in drunk driving crashes, up 60 percent from previous years. Officials promise enforcement and education, but their messaging targets drinking, not the act of driving. Vulnerable road users remain at risk while the law lags.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
