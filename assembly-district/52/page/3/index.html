The truck kept going. The rider, an off‑duty NYPD officer, died at the hospital, police said. Days later, a driver was arrested and charged with leaving the scene that caused a death (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/truck-driver-charged-off-duty-nypd-officer-killed-hit-run-crash-home-84th-precinct-brooklyn/17676103/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>They were one of the people killed on these roads since 2022. In the same span, people walking and biking here absorbed the blows: <strong>451 pedestrians injured, 467 cyclists injured</strong>, and at least <strong>4 killed</strong> among them (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data – crashes</a>).</p><p>BQE, Flatbush, Atlantic: names that keep showing up. The BQE is a top danger zone in this district, with a recorded death and 245 injuries. Flatbush Avenue shows another death and 132 injuries. Atlantic Avenue, another death and 120 injuries (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data – crashes</a>).</p><p>Speed and turning movements tell their own story. Mid‑afternoons run hot: injuries crest from 2 PM through the rush, peaking at 190 injuries in the 2 PM hour alone. Evening brings more pain (133 injuries at 8 PM) before the streets finally quiet (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data – crashes</a>).</p><p>Buses, trucks, taxis, SUVs, sedans — all of it mixes with feet and bikes. Pedestrians here are most often hit by sedans and SUVs, but trucks and buses still leave a mark (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data – persons</a>).</p><p>—</p><p>BQE at Atlantic is not a surprise. Reporters wrote that morning bluntly: struck near the exit, motorcycle into a wall, flames, and a driver who didn’t stop (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/27/nypd-cop-dies-in-fiery-bqe-motorcycle-crash-on-way-to-work/>NY Daily News</a>; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/off-duty-nypd-officer-killed-hit-run-crash-work-brooklyn/17664404/>ABC7</a>).

A 59‑year‑old woman, killed in a marked crosswalk at Kent and Taylor by a left‑turning SUV. Police coded it as failure to yield and improper lane use (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data – crash 4585564</a>). An 83‑year‑old woman, killed by a right‑turning dump truck at Butler and Bond (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data – crash 4735930</a>). A 24‑year‑old e‑biker, killed at 4th Avenue and Sackett in a multi‑vehicle crush (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data – crash 4767852</a>).</p><p>—</p><p>Corners hide people. Cars park to the edge. Advocates and electeds have been pushing the city to clear sightlines. One called daylighting “a no‑brainer,” adding, “people feel a lot safer crossing those intersections” (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/26/no-brainer-state-pol-seeks-citywide-parking-ban-near-intersections>Streetsblog</a>). On Atlantic Avenue, new mid‑block crossings are going in with lights and ramps after deadly speeds took a life. “A great step forward,” said Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon, who represents this district (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/atlantic-avenue-mid-block-crossings-safety/>Brooklyn Paper</a>).</p><p>The tools are on the table. Simon co‑sponsors a bill to unmask drivers who hide their plates and extends speed‑camera authority (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">A7997</a>). She also backs speed‑limiter mandates for repeat offenders (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">A7979</a>; <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>A2299</a>). At a Borough Hall rally after a mother and two daughters were killed in Gravesend, she said: “The speed limiter technology is available to us. Let’s use it. It will save lives.” (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/stop-super-speeders-brooklyn-borough-hall/>Brooklyn Paper</a>).</p><p>The City Council Member for most of this area is Lincoln Restler. He’s pushed for safer crossings on Atlantic (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/atlantic-avenue-mid-block-crossings-safety/>Brooklyn Paper</a>). State Senator Zellnor Myrie covers part of this district.

They called it car- and truck-centric. The city wants more lanes and a new off-ramp. Critics say this endangers communities and ignores transit. Local leaders demand fewer cars, safer streets, and real change.</p><p class=mb3>On August 18, 2023, civic groups and local officials criticized Mayor Adams’s Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE) plan. The Department of Transportation (DOT) unveiled three concepts for the Atlantic Avenue interchange, restoring three lanes each way and adding a new off-ramp on Hicks Street. The coalition’s letter called this 'extremely misguided.' Former DOT Commissioner Hank Gutman said the proposals 'don’t improve safety, they don’t improve traffic, and they certainly don’t improve any of the surrounding communities.' Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon backed a corridor-wide approach and prolonging the cantilever’s life for better planning. The groups urge immediate repairs, less traffic, and more transit. DOT Press Secretary Vin Barone defended the plan, citing federal funding and green space. The community’s message is clear: the city’s current approach puts vulnerable road users at risk and fails to meet safety or environmental needs.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Their letter to the Traffic Mobility Review Board states: 'No one community should disproportionately bear the burden of the cars and trucks passing through their neighborhood.' Hanif, along with Lincoln Restler, Alexa Avilés, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Crystal Hudson, joined borough, state, and federal colleagues in this push. They propose a credit system to balance costs between DOT bridges and MTA tunnels, aiming to protect neighborhoods like the Brooklyn waterfront and the BQE corridor from traffic surges. The MTA declined comment. The Board will soon set final toll rates and rules. The federal government has approved the congestion pricing plan, with tolls for cars expected between $9 and $23. Over 100 exemption requests, including from taxi and for-hire vehicle drivers, are under review.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They reject piecemeal fixes. They call out decades of harm. The state’s refusal leaves neighborhoods exposed. The city’s hands are tied. The highway’s danger remains. Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On February 10, 2023, eighteen Brooklyn lawmakers issued a joint letter demanding New York State Department of Transportation (DOT) participate in comprehensive planning for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens. Jabari Brisport, Julia Salazar, Kristen Gonzalez, Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Members Bobby Carroll, Maritza Davila, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Emily Gallagher, Jo Anne Simon, Marcela Mitaynes, and Council Members Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Lincoln Restler. Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint. Without state action, only city-owned segments see attention. The city’s efforts are limited. The state’s inaction leaves systemic danger unaddressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The danger remains for those outside the car.</p><p class=mb3>Senate and Assembly bill, sponsored by Sen. John Liu and Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon, seeks to lower New York’s drunk driving threshold from 0.08 to 0.05 percent BAC. Announced at a December 22, 2022 press conference, the bill has stalled in committee for years. The matter aims to redefine DWI: 'driving while intoxicated would be defined as anything above a blood-alcohol content of 0.05 percent.' Simon and Liu back the measure; city DOT and NYPD leaders joined them. DOT Deputy Commissioner Margaret Forgione said, 'There is not really a safe level of drinking and driving, but the law suggests there is.' In 2021, 42 people died in drunk driving crashes, up 60 percent from previous years. Officials promise enforcement and education, but their messaging targets drinking, not the act of driving. Vulnerable road users remain at risk while the law lags.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and NYPD’s Kim Royster also spoke, focusing on enforcement and urging drivers to avoid drinking before driving. Advocates like Alisa McMorris of Mothers Against Drunk Driving called for stronger messaging: 'We want people to make choices before they leave their home.' Despite evidence that lowering the threshold could cut traffic deaths by 10%, city messaging still stops short of telling people not to drive to events where they plan to drink.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
