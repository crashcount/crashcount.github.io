Fourteen people were hurt. Twelve were adults with special needs, on their way to an adult daycare. The driver swerved to avoid another car and hit the tree. One man watching said, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/transport-van-crashes-tree-bath-beach-brooklyn-injuring-14-people/16903098/>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sad because they definitely need a lot of attention more than anyone else. I hope that they&rsquo;re all OK at the end of the day.&rdquo;</a></p><p>In January, a 95-year-old woman was killed crossing Cropsey Avenue with her home health aide. The driver turned and struck them both. The aide survived. The woman did not. Her granddaughter <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/woman-who-survived-nazis-chernobyl-covid-killed-while-crossing-brooklyn-street-police-say>described her as &ldquo;the kindest, most generous person I&rsquo;ve ever met.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>In the last twelve months, AD 47 saw 732 crashes, 442 injuries, and 1 death.</strong> Four people suffered serious injuries. The dead are mostly the old, the young, the ones who walk. The ones who do not get a second chance.</p><h2 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h2><p>Since 2022, six people have died and 1,231 have been injured on these streets. Twelve suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Cars and trucks did most of the harm—294 crashes, 1 death, 2 serious injuries. Trucks and buses killed two and seriously hurt one. Bikes and mopeds injured, but did not kill.</p><h2 id=what-has-colton-done>What Has Colton Done?</h2><p>Assembly Member William Colton has voted to extend and expand school speed cameras, <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>boosting pedestrian safety</a>. He co-sponsored bills to require safer street designs for all users. He voted yes on driver education. But he also voted to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S7785>weaken bus rules</a>, a move that puts people walking and biking at greater risk. He has not led the charge for a 20 mph citywide speed limit. He has not pushed for the Stop Super Speeders Act. The work is not done.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a failure. Call Assembly Member Colton. Tell him to fight for a 20 mph speed limit and real penalties for repeat dangerous drivers. Join <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p><p><strong>The dead cannot speak.
