The report states she suffered severe head trauma and crush injuries to her limbs, and was found unconscious on the pavement. Police cite 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as contributing factors. The driver, licensed in New York, was operating a Pennsylvania-registered pickup and was reportedly looking elsewhere at the moment of impact. The pedestrian was crossing at the intersection with the signal, as noted in the report.
