Twelve left with serious injuries.</strong> Over a thousand hurt since 2022. The dead are not numbers. They are elders, children, neighbors. They are the woman crossing Cropsey Avenue with her aide, struck down by a turning van. Police did not charge the driver. Her daughter <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/woman-who-survived-nazis-chernobyl-covid-killed-while-crossing-brooklyn-street-police-say>described her as &ldquo;a very active lady.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>Most victims are on foot or bike.</strong> Trucks, SUVs, taxis, and bikes all play their part. The street does not forgive. A mother and her two daughters, ages eight and five, lost their lives in Gravesend. Their brother, four, is still fighting for his. The <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/06/us-news/unhinged-wigmaker-accused-of-attacking-brooklyn-neighbor-with-hammer-before-killing-mom-kids-in-nyc-car-crash-court-docs/>driver is being held without bail on manslaughter charges</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-what-has-william-colton-done>Leadership: What Has William Colton Done?</h3><p>Assembly Member William Colton has <strong>co-sponsored bills</strong> that call for safer streets. He backed <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">A 1077</a> and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1280&amp;term=2023">A 1280</a>, both demanding roads built for people, not just cars. He also voted yes on <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">A 7652</a>, bringing speed cameras to school zones. These are steps, but the blood on the asphalt says more is needed. Colton has also signed on to efforts that could undermine safety, like supporting <a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/chinatown-pols-seek-to-exempt-dollar-vans-from-congestion-pricing/>exemptions for dollar vans from congestion pricing</a>. Every carve-out is a risk.</p><h3 id=the-road-ahead-what-needs-to-change>The Road Ahead: What Needs to Change</h3><p><strong>The carnage is not fate.</strong> Lower speed limits. More cameras. Safer crossings. These are not dreams. They are demands. The city now has the power to set 20 mph limits. The law is there. The will is not. Every day of delay is another family broken.</p><p><strong>Call your Assembly Member. Call your Council Member. Demand safer streets.</strong> The dead cannot speak. The living must not wait.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The city swallowed the sound.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a BMW SUV was 'pulling from parking' near 1770 West 6th Street when a motorcycle traveling south struck the SUV’s front. The 47-year-old motorcyclist suffered severe lacerations to his leg and was found conscious and bleeding. The report cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor, placing the focus on the actions of the SUV driver. The narrative notes, 'Distraction. Inexperience. The street held the silence.' The motorcyclist was wearing a helmet, but the report makes clear that distraction behind the wheel set the crash in motion. No contributing factors are attributed to the motorcyclist.
