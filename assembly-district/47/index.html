Twelve left with serious injuries.</strong> Over a thousand hurt since 2022. The dead are not numbers. They are elders, children, neighbors. They are the woman crossing Cropsey Avenue with her aide, struck down by a turning van. Police did not charge the driver.

He also voted yes on <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">A 7652</a>, bringing speed cameras to school zones. These are steps, but the blood on the asphalt says more is needed. Colton has also signed on to efforts that could undermine safety, like supporting <a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/chinatown-pols-seek-to-exempt-dollar-vans-from-congestion-pricing/>exemptions for dollar vans from congestion pricing</a>. Every carve-out is a risk.</p><h3 id=the-road-ahead-what-needs-to-change>The Road Ahead: What Needs to Change</h3><p><strong>The carnage is not fate.</strong> Lower speed limits. More cameras. Safer crossings. These are not dreams. They are demands. The city now has the power to set 20 mph limits. The law is there. The will is not. Every day of delay is another family broken.</p><p><strong>Call your Assembly Member. Call your Council Member. Demand safer streets.</strong> The dead cannot speak.

The moped rider, age 52, was ejected and suffered severe lacerations across the body but remained conscious at the scene. The narrative states, 'A GMC SUV struck a turning moped. The rider, 52, was thrown hard to the pavement. He lay conscious, helmeted, bleeding, torn across the body beneath the cold white glare of the streetlight.' Both vehicles were making left turns at the time of the crash. The police report lists 'Other Vehicular' and 'Unsafe Lane Changing' as contributing factors, highlighting driver error as a key cause. The moped rider was wearing a helmet, as noted in the report, but the primary focus remains on the unsafe actions that led to the collision.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
