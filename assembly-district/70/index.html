Her mother was hurt beside her. The SUV kept turning left. That was July 2024. Four months later, a 66-year-old man died on 5th Avenue. He was not at the intersection. The car kept going.

He did not get up.</p><p><strong>In the last twelve months, three people died on these streets. Thirteen more were left with serious injuries.</strong> Most were walking or riding.
