He also backed more cameras in school zones. But Wright voted yes to weaken bus rules, a change that puts <strong>pedestrians and cyclists at greater risk</strong>. He missed votes on other bills that could have made school zones safer. The work is not finished. The streets are not safe.</p><h3 id=the-call-that-cannot-wait>The Call That Cannot Wait</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a policy failure.

According to the police report, the child was 'crossing with the signal' when the 2020 Nissan SUV hit her in the head at the 'center front end' of the vehicle, which sustained damage there. The driver was licensed and operating the vehicle legally. The report lists contributing factors as 'Unspecified' but highlights the driver’s action of making a left turn into a crosswalk occupied by a pedestrian. The narrative states, 'She died there on the street. The front end bore the mark of her final moment.' No victim error is cited, focusing attention on the lethal consequences of the driver’s maneuver.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
