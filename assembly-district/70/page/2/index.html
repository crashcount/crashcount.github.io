He also backed more cameras in school zones. But Wright voted yes to weaken bus rules, a change that puts <strong>pedestrians and cyclists at greater risk</strong>. He missed votes on other bills that could have made school zones safer. The work is not finished. The streets are not safe.</p><h3 id=the-call-that-cannot-wait>The Call That Cannot Wait</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a policy failure.

The victim's helmet use is noted in the report, but only after the driver's error is cited. No evidence suggests any action by the cyclist contributed to the crash. The deadly impact underscores the danger posed when large vehicles ignore basic traffic controls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
