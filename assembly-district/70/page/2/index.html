Her mother, bleeding, left standing in the street <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>on July 11, 2024</a>. Five months later, a 73-year-old man, crossing at 523 W 135th, hit by an SUV. He never made it home <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>on May 10, 2025</a>. A cyclist, age 59, crushed by a bus at Lenox and 138th in January. The list does not end. In the last twelve months, <strong>three people killed, six left with life-changing injuries</strong>. Over 300 hurt. The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross the street.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-behind-the-blood>The Numbers Behind the Blood</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> In the last three years, they killed four, seriously injured five, and left hundreds more with broken bodies. Trucks and buses hit thirty more. Bikes and mopeds add to the toll, but the weight of death rides on four wheels. The numbers are not just numbers. They are names, families, empty chairs at dinner tables.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Assembly Member Jordan Wright voted to extend and expand school speed cameras, a move that keeps children safer near schools. He voted yes on <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>S 8344</a>, a bill that keeps protections in place for kids and other vulnerable people. He also backed more cameras in school zones. But Wright voted yes to weaken bus rules, a change that puts <strong>pedestrians and cyclists at greater risk</strong>. He missed votes on other bills that could have made school zones safer. The work is not finished. The streets are not safe.</p><h3 id=the-call-that-cannot-wait>The Call That Cannot Wait</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a policy failure. As one official <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/new-york-city-expands-efforts-to-combat-deadly-lithium-ion-battery-fires-with-certified-e-bike-program-EE4710402>said</a>, &ldquo;Fires from unregulated e-bike batteries have already caused too much harm, including tragic loss of life.&rdquo; The same is true for cars and trucks. The time for half-measures is over. <strong>Call Assembly Member Wright. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for every person on foot or bike. Do not wait for another child’s name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
