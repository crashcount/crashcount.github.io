A cyclist pedals through the light. A child waits at the corner. In Assembly District 67, these moments end in blood too often. <strong>In the last twelve months, three people died and seven were left with serious injuries on these streets.</strong> Two of the dead were over 55. One was over 75. <strong>254 people were hurt.</strong> The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about age or time of day. They keep coming.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs hit hardest.</strong> In this district, SUVs and sedans caused the most deaths and injuries. Trucks, bikes, and mopeds left their own scars. The dead do not get to tell their stories. The living carry them.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Assembly Member Linda Rosenthal has stood up for change. She backed <a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/albany-lawmakers-sammys-law-allow-nyc-lower-speed-limit-20-mph/>Sammy’s Law</a>, which lets New York City lower speed limits to 20 mph. She co-sponsored bills to <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A324&amp;term=2025">require safer street designs</a> and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">force speed limiters on repeat offenders</a>. She voted yes on <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">school speed cameras</a>. These are steps. They are not the finish line.</p><p>But the city moves slow. <strong>Sammy’s Law passed, but the speed limit has not dropped.</strong> Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk. Each delay is a risk. Each risk is a name on a slab.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>The crisis is not over. <strong>Three dead in a year is not safety.</strong> The numbers are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors. The city has the power to slow the cars. It has the power to harden the streets. It has the power to save lives. It must use it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that put people first.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name to be carved in stone. Act now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The moped vanished south, leaving injury behind.</p><p class=mb3>A 33-year-old man was crossing Columbus Avenue near West 70th Street in Manhattan when a southbound moped struck him head-on. According to the police report, 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' was a contributing factor. The pedestrian suffered a severe leg injury and remained conscious at the scene. The moped did not stop and continued south. The report notes the pedestrian was not in a crosswalk or at a signal, but lists driver inattention as a primary cause. The crash left the man bleeding on the asphalt while the moped rider fled, unmarked and unaccounted for.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Local boards and lawmakers back the move.</p><p class=mb3>On August 1, 2022, Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine demanded the state Department of Transportation repurpose a lane on the West Side Highway for a two-way protected bike lane. Levine wrote, 'The Hudson River Greenway is one of the most heavily used bike paths in the country... congestion has worsened significantly.' He sent his letter to state DOT Commissioner Therese Dominguez and city DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. Local elected officials and Community Board 1, which voted 41-3 in May 2020 to support the change, also back the plan. State senators, assembly members, and council members signed a letter urging the same. Levine and supporters argue the new lane would ease crowding and give e-bike delivery workers—many of them immigrants—a safe, legal route. The state DOT has resisted, citing car congestion. Advocates say more space for cyclists is overdue.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
