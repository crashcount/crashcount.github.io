The incident occurred at 19:48 and resulted in severe lacerations to the cyclist’s knee and lower leg. The report states, 'A sedan door flung open. Steel caught his leg. Flesh tore. Blood pooled on the asphalt. He wore a helmet. He stayed conscious. The driver hadn’t looked.' The police report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor for the crash. The sedan’s driver opened the door without checking for oncoming traffic, causing the impact. The cyclist was wearing a helmet, as noted in the report, but the primary cause cited is the driver’s failure to pay attention before opening the door.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Rosenthal and other officials pushed for local control. Amy Cohen, Sammy’s mother, said, 'Lower speed limits save lives.' Studies show pedestrian death risk rises sharply as speed increases.

The measure, known as Sammy’s Law, is part of the state budget deal and awaits final publication. Sponsored by Assemblymember Linda Rosenthal and Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal, the bill allows the City Council to set lower limits on most streets, but excludes roads with three or more lanes in one direction. The bill’s title honors Sammy Cohen Eckstein, a 12-year-old killed by a speeding driver in 2013. Rosenthal said, “This is about trying to eliminate all unnecessary deaths, and one of the ways you do that is by making the speed limit lower.” Hoylman-Sigal credited persistent advocacy by Sammy’s mother and Families for Safe Streets. The City Council and Mayor must still approve the change. Advocates and city officials say the law gives New York City a vital tool to prevent traffic violence and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill’s sponsor, Assemblymember Linda Rosenthal, did not comment.

Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives called the decision a failure to join 'more than 130 unions, hospitals, business leaders, and community-led organizations that recognize the urgent need for this common-sense legislation.'

The truck itself sustained no damage and continued on after the collision.

The fight continues in Albany.</p><p class=mb3>Sammy’s Law, a state bill, would let New York City control its own speed limits. The measure stalled last year when Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie blocked a vote, despite support from Governor Hochul, the state Senate, Mayor Adams, and the City Council. Assembly Member Linda Rosenthal, who sponsors the bill, rallied outside Heastie’s office, saying, 'Last year, 257 people were killed on New York City streets by reckless and speeding drivers. Each of these deaths was preventable.' Amy Cohen, whose son Sammy was killed in 2013, called for urgent action: 'We can’t wait any longer. People like Sammy, and so many others are dying on our streets.' Advocates point to a 36-percent drop in pedestrian deaths after the city lowered speed limits in 2014. The bill would not set new limits automatically, but would give the city the power to act.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Speaker Adrienne Adams has not signed on. Assembly Member Linda Rosenthal sponsors the bill in Albany. Sammy’s Law is named for a child killed by a reckless driver.
