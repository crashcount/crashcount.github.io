A cyclist pedals through the light. A child waits at the corner. In Assembly District 67, these moments end in blood too often. <strong>In the last twelve months, three people died and seven were left with serious injuries on these streets.</strong> Two of the dead were over 55. One was over 75. <strong>254 people were hurt.</strong> The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about age or time of day. They keep coming.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs hit hardest.</strong> In this district, SUVs and sedans caused the most deaths and injuries. Trucks, bikes, and mopeds left their own scars. The dead do not get to tell their stories. The living carry them.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Assembly Member Linda Rosenthal has stood up for change. She backed <a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/albany-lawmakers-sammys-law-allow-nyc-lower-speed-limit-20-mph/>Sammy’s Law</a>, which lets New York City lower speed limits to 20 mph. She co-sponsored bills to <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A324&amp;term=2025">require safer street designs</a> and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">force speed limiters on repeat offenders</a>. She voted yes on <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">school speed cameras</a>. These are steps. They are not the finish line.</p><p>But the city moves slow. <strong>Sammy’s Law passed, but the speed limit has not dropped.</strong> Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk. Each delay is a risk. Each risk is a name on a slab.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>The crisis is not over. <strong>Three dead in a year is not safety.</strong> The numbers are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors. The city has the power to slow the cars. It has the power to harden the streets. It has the power to save lives. It must use it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that put people first.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name to be carved in stone. Act now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The measure urges the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, A.1679/S.561, which would 'increase the penalty for leaving the scene of an accident involving an e-scooter and further calls upon the New York State Legislature to include e-bikes in such legislation.' Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary sponsor), Gale A. Brewer, Shaun Abreu, Lynn C. Schulman, and Amanda Farías backed the resolution. The bill would raise penalties for e-scooter hit-and-runs from a violation to a misdemeanor or felony, and seeks to add e-bikes to the law.

She said, 'Lowering speed limits works best when paired with traffic calming and street safety infrastructure.' The resolution now has 23 co-sponsors, three short of a majority. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams has not signed on. Assembly Member Linda Rosenthal sponsors the bill in Albany. Sammy’s Law is named for a child killed by a reckless driver. Last year, the Council failed to pass a home rule message under Speaker Adams.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The board, once resistant, now shifts toward safety for riders.</p><p class=mb3>"Andrew Rosenthal said that Mott 'was killed because of the inaction of this community board.'" -- Linda Rosenthal</p><p class=mb3>On September 22, 2022, Manhattan Community Board 8 (CB8) voted 38-3 to request 'fully protected crosstown bike lanes approximately every 10 blocks between 60th and 110th streets on both sides of Central Park, and a two-way protected bikeway around Central Park.' The resolution had earlier cleared the Transportation Committee 12-2. The measure follows the killing of cyclist Carling Mott by a truck driver on E. 85th Street, where a bike lane had been rejected in 2016. Council Members Julie Menin and Keith Powers, along with Borough President Mark Levine, backed the push. Advocates, including Mott’s boyfriend and parents of student cyclists, spoke out for safety, condemning the board’s past inaction. Only one board member, Marco Tamayo, opposed the resolution. The vote marks a sharp turn for CB8, which had long resisted protected lanes, citing security fears and local opposition. Now, the board calls for comprehensive, protected infrastructure to shield vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
