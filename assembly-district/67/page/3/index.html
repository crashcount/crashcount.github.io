The move follows a cyclist’s death on E. 85th. Advocates demanded action. The board, once resistant, now shifts toward safety for riders.</p><p class=mb3>"Andrew Rosenthal said that Mott 'was killed because of the inaction of this community board.'" -- Linda Rosenthal</p><p class=mb3>On September 22, 2022, Manhattan Community Board 8 (CB8) voted 38-3 to request 'fully protected crosstown bike lanes approximately every 10 blocks between 60th and 110th streets on both sides of Central Park, and a two-way protected bikeway around Central Park.' The resolution had earlier cleared the Transportation Committee 12-2. The measure follows the killing of cyclist Carling Mott by a truck driver on E. 85th Street, where a bike lane had been rejected in 2016. Council Members Julie Menin and Keith Powers, along with Borough President Mark Levine, backed the push. Advocates, including Mott’s boyfriend and parents of student cyclists, spoke out for safety, condemning the board’s past inaction. Only one board member, Marco Tamayo, opposed the resolution. The vote marks a sharp turn for CB8, which had long resisted protected lanes, citing security fears and local opposition. Now, the board calls for comprehensive, protected infrastructure to shield vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The survey, which polled 2,073 U.S. adults, found that 86 percent of those driving for work used a device, and nearly a third joined video calls while driving. The matter summary states: 'A whopping 70 percent of drivers used their cellphones while driving in the last three months, according to a new survey—a startling statistic amid a nationwide spike in traffic crashes and fatalities.' Cathy Chase, president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, called for advanced safety technologies in all new vehicles. Brenda Hall of Selective Insurance urged employers to enforce distracted driving policies. The survey highlights broad public support for stricter distracted driving enforcement, advanced vehicle safety tech, and higher penalties. No council bill or committee action is attached, but the findings fuel calls for urgent policy change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
