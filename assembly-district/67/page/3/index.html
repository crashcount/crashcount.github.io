Twenty-three left with serious injuries.</strong> Nearly a thousand hurt since 2022. The dead are not just numbers. A 74-year-old man on a bike, struck and killed by a bus at West 70th and West End. A 57-year-old pedestrian, crushed by an SUV at Broadway and West 86th. A 79-year-old driver, dead behind the wheel on West 77th. Each loss is a hole in the city that does not close.</p><h3 id=streets-built-for-cars-not-people>Streets Built for Cars, Not People</h3><p><strong>Most of the blood is spilled by cars and trucks.</strong> SUVs and sedans alone account for more than 170 injuries and deaths to pedestrians. Trucks and buses add to the toll. Bikes and mopeds hurt people too, but the carnage is driven by heavy metal and speed. The city talks of safety, but the streets tell another story. Painted lanes where there should be protection. Promises where there should be action.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>Assembly Member Linda Rosenthal has moved. She backed <a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/albany-lawmakers-sammys-law-allow-nyc-lower-speed-limit-20-mph/>Sammy’s Law</a>, giving New York City the power to lower speed limits. &ldquo;This is about trying to eliminate all unnecessary deaths, and one of the ways you do that is by making the speed limit lower,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/lawmakers-to-allow-nyc-to-lower-speed-limit-to-20-mph>she said</a>. She co-sponsored bills to <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">expand speed cameras</a> and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">force repeat speeders to install limiters</a>. She voted to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>extend school speed zones</a>. These are steps. But the blood keeps running. The city drags its feet. Painted lines do not stop a two-ton SUV.</p><h3 id=the-call-no-more-waiting>The Call: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay means another family shattered.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to use the power they have. Demand a 20 mph speed limit, real protected lanes, and action against repeat offenders. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The board, once resistant, now shifts toward safety for riders.</p><p class=mb3>"Andrew Rosenthal said that Mott 'was killed because of the inaction of this community board.'" -- Linda Rosenthal</p><p class=mb3>On September 22, 2022, Manhattan Community Board 8 (CB8) voted 38-3 to request 'fully protected crosstown bike lanes approximately every 10 blocks between 60th and 110th streets on both sides of Central Park, and a two-way protected bikeway around Central Park.' The resolution had earlier cleared the Transportation Committee 12-2. The measure follows the killing of cyclist Carling Mott by a truck driver on E. 85th Street, where a bike lane had been rejected in 2016. Council Members Julie Menin and Keith Powers, along with Borough President Mark Levine, backed the push. Advocates, including Mott’s boyfriend and parents of student cyclists, spoke out for safety, condemning the board’s past inaction. Only one board member, Marco Tamayo, opposed the resolution. The vote marks a sharp turn for CB8, which had long resisted protected lanes, citing security fears and local opposition. Now, the board calls for comprehensive, protected infrastructure to shield vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Calls, texts, video chats—nothing stops them. Distracted driving kills. The public wants action. Advocates demand tougher rules, better tech, and higher fines. The toll mounts. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On March 30, 2022, a survey commissioned by Selective Insurance and Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety revealed that 70 percent of licensed drivers used a mobile device while driving in the past three months. The survey, which polled 2,073 U.S. adults, found that 86 percent of those driving for work used a device, and nearly a third joined video calls while driving. The matter summary states: 'A whopping 70 percent of drivers used their cellphones while driving in the last three months, according to a new survey—a startling statistic amid a nationwide spike in traffic crashes and fatalities.' Cathy Chase, president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, called for advanced safety technologies in all new vehicles. Brenda Hall of Selective Insurance urged employers to enforce distracted driving policies. The survey highlights broad public support for stricter distracted driving enforcement, advanced vehicle safety tech, and higher penalties. No council bill or committee action is attached, but the findings fuel calls for urgent policy change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
