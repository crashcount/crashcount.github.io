Twenty-three left with serious injuries.</strong> Nearly a thousand hurt since 2022. The dead are not just numbers. A 74-year-old man on a bike, struck and killed by a bus at West 70th and West End. A 57-year-old pedestrian, crushed by an SUV at Broadway and West 86th. A 79-year-old driver, dead behind the wheel on West 77th. Each loss is a hole in the city that does not close.</p><h3 id=streets-built-for-cars-not-people>Streets Built for Cars, Not People</h3><p><strong>Most of the blood is spilled by cars and trucks.</strong> SUVs and sedans alone account for more than 170 injuries and deaths to pedestrians. Trucks and buses add to the toll. Bikes and mopeds hurt people too, but the carnage is driven by heavy metal and speed. The city talks of safety, but the streets tell another story. Painted lanes where there should be protection. Promises where there should be action.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>Assembly Member Linda Rosenthal has moved. She backed <a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/albany-lawmakers-sammys-law-allow-nyc-lower-speed-limit-20-mph/>Sammy’s Law</a>, giving New York City the power to lower speed limits. &ldquo;This is about trying to eliminate all unnecessary deaths, and one of the ways you do that is by making the speed limit lower,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/lawmakers-to-allow-nyc-to-lower-speed-limit-to-20-mph>she said</a>. She co-sponsored bills to <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">expand speed cameras</a> and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">force repeat speeders to install limiters</a>. She voted to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>extend school speed zones</a>. These are steps. But the blood keeps running. The city drags its feet. Painted lines do not stop a two-ton SUV.</p><h3 id=the-call-no-more-waiting>The Call: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay means another family shattered.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to use the power they have. Demand a 20 mph speed limit, real protected lanes, and action against repeat offenders. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Lawmakers tout support for the injured. But insurance comes after the hit. Speeders keep driving. Danger stays on the street. Prevention takes a back seat.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13, 2025, the New York State Senate passed a bill requiring food delivery apps to provide insurance for delivery workers, pedestrians, and cyclists. The bill, sponsored by Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger, mandates up to $50,000 per person for basic economic loss, regardless of citizenship or employment status. Assembly Member Robert Carroll authored the original Assembly version, stating, 'It is time we require delivery apps to take responsibility for keeping delivery workers and pedestrians safe.' Sen. Andrew Gounardes defended a related speed-limiting bill, but it was weakened. Safety analysts warn: 'Focusing on insurance rather than speed limits shifts responsibility away from prevention and system design, failing to reduce crash risk and potentially discouraging mode shift by not addressing the root causes of danger for pedestrians and cyclists.' Lawmakers back insurance, but leave the streets risky.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It 'permits the use of photo speed violation monitoring systems in New York City for the purposes of enforcement of license plate obstruction, concealment, and/or distortion; extends provisions permitting the use of speed cameras in certain school zones.' By targeting plate obstruction, the bill seeks to stop drivers from dodging speed camera enforcement, a move that could help protect pedestrians and cyclists from repeat offenders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
