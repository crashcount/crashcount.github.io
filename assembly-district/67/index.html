A cyclist pedals through the light. A child waits at the corner. In Assembly District 67, these moments end in blood too often. <strong>In the last twelve months, three people died and seven were left with serious injuries on these streets.</strong> Two of the dead were over 55. One was over 75. <strong>254 people were hurt.</strong> The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about age or time of day. They keep coming.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs hit hardest.</strong> In this district, SUVs and sedans caused the most deaths and injuries. Trucks, bikes, and mopeds left their own scars. The dead do not get to tell their stories. The living carry them.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Assembly Member Linda Rosenthal has stood up for change. She backed <a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/albany-lawmakers-sammys-law-allow-nyc-lower-speed-limit-20-mph/>Sammy’s Law</a>, which lets New York City lower speed limits to 20 mph. She co-sponsored bills to <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A324&amp;term=2025">require safer street designs</a> and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">force speed limiters on repeat offenders</a>. She voted yes on <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">school speed cameras</a>. These are steps. They are not the finish line.</p><p>But the city moves slow. <strong>Sammy’s Law passed, but the speed limit has not dropped.</strong> Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk. Each delay is a risk. Each risk is a name on a slab.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>The crisis is not over. <strong>Three dead in a year is not safety.</strong> The numbers are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors. The city has the power to slow the cars. It has the power to harden the streets. It has the power to save lives. It must use it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that put people first.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name to be carved in stone. Act now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Lawmakers tout support for the injured. But insurance comes after the hit. Speeders keep driving. Danger stays on the street. Prevention takes a back seat.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13, 2025, the New York State Senate passed a bill requiring food delivery apps to provide insurance for delivery workers, pedestrians, and cyclists. The bill, sponsored by Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger, mandates up to $50,000 per person for basic economic loss, regardless of citizenship or employment status. Assembly Member Robert Carroll authored the original Assembly version, stating, 'It is time we require delivery apps to take responsibility for keeping delivery workers and pedestrians safe.' Sen. Andrew Gounardes defended a related speed-limiting bill, but it was weakened. Safety analysts warn: 'Focusing on insurance rather than speed limits shifts responsibility away from prevention and system design, failing to reduce crash risk and potentially discouraging mode shift by not addressing the root causes of danger for pedestrians and cyclists.' Lawmakers back insurance, but leave the streets risky.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The group’s ranks swell with each tragedy. No specific bill or committee is named in this event. Kuntzman’s statement underscores the relentless danger faced by pedestrians and cyclists. The safety analyst notes: the event describes a new member joining an advocacy group, which does not directly affect pedestrian or cyclist safety at the population level.

The bill’s title honors Sammy Cohen Eckstein, a 12-year-old killed by a speeding driver in 2013. Rosenthal said, “This is about trying to eliminate all unnecessary deaths, and one of the ways you do that is by making the speed limit lower.” Hoylman-Sigal credited persistent advocacy by Sammy’s mother and Families for Safe Streets.

Grief and anger mount.</p><p class=mb3>On March 13, 2024, the New York State Assembly declined to advance Sammy’s Law (no bill number cited), which would let New York City set its own speed limit. The measure was left out of the Assembly’s budget, despite support from the State Senate, Governor Hochul, Mayor Adams, and the City Council. The bill’s sponsor, Assemblymember Linda Rosenthal, did not comment. The Assembly’s move angered advocates and families, including Amy Cohen of Families for Safe Streets, who said, 'We are very disappointed that the Assembly didn’t follow suit.' Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives called the decision a failure to join 'more than 130 unions, hospitals, business leaders, and community-led organizations that recognize the urgent need for this common-sense legislation.' The Assembly’s inaction keeps city streets dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists. A rally is planned to push for the bill’s passage.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The 57-year-old woman riding the e-bike, who was wearing a helmet, was struck and crushed at the hip. She died at the scene. The report lists 'Passing Too Closely' as the primary contributing factor, underscoring a critical driver error by the truck operator. The truck itself sustained no damage and continued on after the collision. The e-bike rider’s helmet use is noted in the report, but the fatal outcome was driven by the truck driver's failure to maintain a safe passing distance. The report offers no evidence of any error or contributing action by the e-bike rider.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill gives New York City power to set its own speed limits. Advocates cite 257 lives lost to reckless drivers. Lower speeds mean fewer deaths. The fight continues in Albany.</p><p class=mb3>Sammy’s Law, a state bill, would let New York City control its own speed limits. The measure stalled last year when Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie blocked a vote, despite support from Governor Hochul, the state Senate, Mayor Adams, and the City Council. Assembly Member Linda Rosenthal, who sponsors the bill, rallied outside Heastie’s office, saying, 'Last year, 257 people were killed on New York City streets by reckless and speeding drivers. Each of these deaths was preventable.' Amy Cohen, whose son Sammy was killed in 2013, called for urgent action: 'We can’t wait any longer. People like Sammy, and so many others are dying on our streets.' Advocates point to a 36-percent drop in pedestrian deaths after the city lowered speed limits in 2014. The bill would not set new limits automatically, but would give the city the power to act.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
