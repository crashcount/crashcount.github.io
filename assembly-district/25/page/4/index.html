Named driver causes keep repeating: failure to yield, inattention, following too closely, and alcohol involvement appear throughout the severe cases here (same source).</p><p>Hotspots are no secret: the <strong>Clearview Expressway</strong>, <strong>Long Island Expressway</strong>, and <strong>Grand Central Parkway</strong> sit at the top for injuries and deaths in this area (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).

Police recorded failure to yield by the driver at Union Turnpike and 164th Street in a bike–bus crash this spring (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>The afternoon squeeze. Multiple deaths in the 1–2 PM hours; kids walking home are in this window too, whether the state logs it or not (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>High‑speed corridors. The expressways dominate the worst outcomes in the district (same source).</li></ul><p>Proven local fixes are simple: daylight corners and ban parking at crosswalks; give pedestrians a head start (LPIs); harden left turns with slow‑turn geometry; slow the expressway service roads; route and manage trucks away from schools. Target enforcement for failure to yield and distraction at the listed hotspots.</p><h3 id=the-people-paid-to-act>The people paid to act</h3><p>Assembly Member Nily Rozic represents this district. She is a co‑sponsor of <strong><a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">A 2299</a></strong>, a bill to require intelligent speed assistance for repeat speeders (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">Open States</a>). State lawmakers also moved to extend and clean up NYC school speed‑zone provisions in <strong><a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>S 8344</a></strong> in June 2025 (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Open States</a>).</p><p>Citywide, the next step is not theory. Lower the default speed limit on residential streets. Then pass speed limiters for the worst repeat offenders. Both actions match the pattern of harm on these blocks and at these hours. The tools are on the table. The numbers do not wait.</p><p>Take one step today.
