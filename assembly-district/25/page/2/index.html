Committee: State legislature, with final approval by the Capital Program Review Board. The OBTA, created in 2018, collects a taxi surcharge as 'Phase I' of congestion pricing. The first $300 million funded subway repairs; the next $50 million now goes to projects chosen by state legislators and the governor. The bill summary notes, 'A special fund created in 2018 to pay for transportation 'carrots' intended to counteract the supposed stick of congestion pricing finally has a balance of tens of millions of dollars.' Assembly Member Nily Rozic (D-Queens) secured restored Q46 bus service. Lisa Daglian of the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the MTA called for a weekly City Ticket. Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance demanded better bus service, saying, 'The most important thing is better bus service.'

The crash left a 21-year-old woman pinned behind the wheel, her legs crushed, conscious but trapped. The report states, 'Two sedans collided head-on. A 21-year-old woman, belted and conscious, was pinned behind the wheel. Her legs crushed. Parked cars took the blow. The right-of-way was not given.' The collision’s contributing factor is listed as 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way.' This failure to yield directly led to the impact, sending one or both vehicles into parked cars and causing severe injury. The data does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor. The report centers the systemic danger when drivers disregard right-of-way, turning a street into a site of violence.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
