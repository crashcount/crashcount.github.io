A 63-year-old on a moped died in the street. A 21-year-old, thrown from a seat, never stood up again. In three and a half years, <strong>12 people have died</strong> in Assembly District 25. <strong>31 more were left with serious injuries</strong>. The numbers do not flinch. <strong>Over 2,000 people have been hurt</strong>. The streets do not forgive mistakes, but they punish the vulnerable most.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the killing.</strong> Sedans and SUVs caused the most pedestrian injuries and deaths. Trucks and vans followed. No bikes killed anyone. The dead are not just numbers. They are parents, children, neighbors. Their absence is a hole that does not close.</p><h3 id=leadership-bills-silence-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Bills, Silence, and Missed Chances</h3><p>Assembly Member Nily Rozic has signed on to bills that promise safer streets. She co-sponsored <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">A 1077</a> and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1280&amp;term=2023">A 1280</a>, both calling for roads built for people, not just cars. These bills have not become law. Rozic was excused from voting on <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">A 7652</a>, a bill to put speed cameras near schools. The cameras would have caught drivers who speed where children walk. The vote passed. Rozic was not there.</p><p>Rozic has pushed for more bus service and transit funding, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/24/the-money-for-congestion-pricing-carrots-is-finally-here>backing improvements</a> and <a href=https://nypost.com/2024/05/16/us-news/queens-lawmakers-demand-more-mta-bus-service-to-manhattan-before-15-congestion-toll-begins/>calling for better access</a>.

The disaster is slow, but it does not stop.</p><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These deaths are not random. They are the result of choices—by drivers, by lawmakers, by those who design and police our streets.</p><p><strong>Call to Action:</strong></p><p><strong>Demand more.</strong> Call Nily Rozic. Tell her to show up, to vote for speed cameras, to fight for lower speed limits and safer crossings. Do not wait for another name to become a number.
