Her vehicle collided with a parked Jeep, striking the left rear bumper and damaging the Jeep’s left rear quarter panel. The report lists 'Fell Asleep' as the contributing factor. The force of the crash triggered the airbag, and the driver suffered a head injury with severe bleeding but remained conscious at the scene. No other occupants or bystanders were involved. The parked Jeep was unoccupied. The police report does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor.

The report states, 'A man lay in the road. Three cars struck. His chest crushed. He died there.' Another 56-year-old man, driving one of the vehicles, was injured and pinned, suffering chest injuries described as 'crush injuries.' The police report lists 'Following Too Closely' and 'Reaction to Uninvolved Vehicle' as contributing factors, along with 'Pavement Slippery.' These driver errors—specifically following too closely—are cited as direct contributors to the crash. The narrative highlights the systemic danger posed by multiple vehicles traveling straight ahead on a slick roadway, with no mention of pedestrian error as a contributing factor. The deadly sequence unfolded on a rain-slicked expressway, where human error and hazardous conditions combined with fatal results.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The money will fund toll rebates and transit projects. Some cash backs driving. Some boosts buses. Advocates push for more bus service. Riders need better, faster, safer options now.</p><p class=mb3>Bill: Outer Borough Transportation Account (OBTA) funding allocation. Status: Active as of January 24, 2024. Committee: State legislature, with final approval by the Capital Program Review Board. The OBTA, created in 2018, collects a taxi surcharge as 'Phase I' of congestion pricing. The first $300 million funded subway repairs; the next $50 million now goes to projects chosen by state legislators and the governor. The bill summary notes, 'A special fund created in 2018 to pay for transportation 'carrots' intended to counteract the supposed stick of congestion pricing finally has a balance of tens of millions of dollars.' Assembly Member Nily Rozic (D-Queens) secured restored Q46 bus service. Lisa Daglian of the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the MTA called for a weekly City Ticket. Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance demanded better bus service, saying, 'The most important thing is better bus service.' The fund will shape how New Yorkers travel as congestion pricing nears.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crash left a 21-year-old woman pinned behind the wheel, her legs crushed, conscious but trapped. The report states, 'Two sedans collided head-on. A 21-year-old woman, belted and conscious, was pinned behind the wheel. Her legs crushed. Parked cars took the blow. The right-of-way was not given.' The collision’s contributing factor is listed as 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way.' This failure to yield directly led to the impact, sending one or both vehicles into parked cars and causing severe injury. The data does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor. The report centers the systemic danger when drivers disregard right-of-way, turning a street into a site of violence.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
