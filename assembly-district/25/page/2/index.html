Thirty-seven seriously hurt.</strong> These are not numbers. They are neighbors, parents, children. In the last twelve months alone, three people were killed and seventeen left with life-altering injuries in Assembly District 25. The violence does not stop. Just last week, a bus in Flushing jumped the curb and sent eight people to the hospital. The driver, only 25, told investigators he &ldquo;misjudged the curb.&rdquo; But after reviewing the footage, officials said he had fallen asleep at the wheel. The MTA pulled him from service. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>&ldquo;I was all the way in the back and all of a sudden the bus hit the curb, I guess, jumped the curb, I went this way and that way and banged into the side of the bus,&rdquo;</a> said a shaken passenger.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> Cars and SUVs caused most of the pain: 276 crashes, 2 deaths, 11 serious injuries. Trucks and buses hit ten more. Motorcycles and mopeds, four. Bikes, four. The old and the young are not spared. In the last year, one person over 65 was killed. Fifty children and teens were injured. Every week, another family gets the call.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-gaps>Leadership: Promises and Gaps</h3><p>Assembly Member Nily Rozic has voted to extend school speed zones and co-sponsored bills for safer streets and speed limiters. She backed funding for better street design and supported expanding bus service. But she also missed key votes that allowed unsafe bus regulation exemptions to advance. The work is not finished. <strong>Every delay is another risk.</strong></p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-ours>The Next Step Is Ours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is preventable. Lower the speed limit. End repeat speeding. Build streets for people, not just cars. Call Rozic. Call your council member.
