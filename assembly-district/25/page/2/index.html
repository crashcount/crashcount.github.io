In three and a half years, <strong>12 people have died</strong> in Assembly District 25. <strong>31 more were left with serious injuries</strong>. The numbers do not flinch. <strong>Over 2,000 people have been hurt</strong>. The streets do not forgive mistakes, but they punish the vulnerable most.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the killing.</strong> Sedans and SUVs caused the most pedestrian injuries and deaths. Trucks and vans followed. No bikes killed anyone. The dead are not just numbers. They are parents, children, neighbors. Their absence is a hole that does not close.</p><h3 id=leadership-bills-silence-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Bills, Silence, and Missed Chances</h3><p>Assembly Member Nily Rozic has signed on to bills that promise safer streets.

The crash left a 21-year-old woman pinned behind the wheel, her legs crushed, conscious but trapped. The report states, 'Two sedans collided head-on. A 21-year-old woman, belted and conscious, was pinned behind the wheel. Her legs crushed. Parked cars took the blow. The right-of-way was not given.' The collision’s contributing factor is listed as 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way.' This failure to yield directly led to the impact, sending one or both vehicles into parked cars and causing severe injury. The data does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor. The report centers the systemic danger when drivers disregard right-of-way, turning a street into a site of violence.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
