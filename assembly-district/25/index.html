In three and a half years, <strong>12 people have died</strong> in Assembly District 25. <strong>31 more were left with serious injuries</strong>. The numbers do not flinch. <strong>Over 2,000 people have been hurt</strong>. The streets do not forgive mistakes, but they punish the vulnerable most.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the killing.</strong> Sedans and SUVs caused the most pedestrian injuries and deaths. Trucks and vans followed. No bikes killed anyone. The dead are not just numbers. They are parents, children, neighbors. Their absence is a hole that does not close.</p><h3 id=leadership-bills-silence-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Bills, Silence, and Missed Chances</h3><p>Assembly Member Nily Rozic has signed on to bills that promise safer streets.
