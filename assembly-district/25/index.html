In three and a half years, <strong>12 people have died</strong> in Assembly District 25. <strong>31 more were left with serious injuries</strong>. The numbers do not flinch. <strong>Over 2,000 people have been hurt</strong>. The streets do not forgive mistakes, but they punish the vulnerable most.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the killing.</strong> Sedans and SUVs caused the most pedestrian injuries and deaths. Trucks and vans followed. No bikes killed anyone. The dead are not just numbers. They are parents, children, neighbors. Their absence is a hole that does not close.</p><h3 id=leadership-bills-silence-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Bills, Silence, and Missed Chances</h3><p>Assembly Member Nily Rozic has signed on to bills that promise safer streets.

The report states the collision occurred at 6:40 a.m. The pedestrian suffered severe lacerations to his head, with blood visible on the street, but remained conscious at the scene. The driver of the Audi did not stop after the impact. The police narrative notes the pedestrian was crossing without a signal, but the report does not list this as a contributing factor to the crash. Instead, both contributing factors are marked as 'Unspecified.' The driver’s failure to remain at the scene stands out as a critical failure in duty and responsibility. The focus remains on the driver’s actions and the systemic dangers present at this intersection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Committee: State legislature, with final approval by the Capital Program Review Board. The OBTA, created in 2018, collects a taxi surcharge as 'Phase I' of congestion pricing. The first $300 million funded subway repairs; the next $50 million now goes to projects chosen by state legislators and the governor. The bill summary notes, 'A special fund created in 2018 to pay for transportation 'carrots' intended to counteract the supposed stick of congestion pricing finally has a balance of tens of millions of dollars.' Assembly Member Nily Rozic (D-Queens) secured restored Q46 bus service. Lisa Daglian of the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the MTA called for a weekly City Ticket. Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance demanded better bus service, saying, 'The most important thing is better bus service.' The fund will shape how New Yorkers travel as congestion pricing nears.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crash left a 21-year-old woman pinned behind the wheel, her legs crushed, conscious but trapped. The report states, 'Two sedans collided head-on. A 21-year-old woman, belted and conscious, was pinned behind the wheel. Her legs crushed. Parked cars took the blow. The right-of-way was not given.' The collision’s contributing factor is listed as 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way.' This failure to yield directly led to the impact, sending one or both vehicles into parked cars and causing severe injury. The data does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor. The report centers the systemic danger when drivers disregard right-of-way, turning a street into a site of violence.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
