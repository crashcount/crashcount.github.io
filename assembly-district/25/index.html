The bus did.</p><p>At Main Street and 57th Road in Flushing, an MTA bus jumped the curb and injured eight. The driver first said he misjudged the curb. After video review, investigators now believe he fell asleep at the wheel. The MTA pulled him from service. “I was all the way in the back and all of a sudden the bus hit the curb,” a rider said. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>ABC7</a>.</p><p>HOLLIS COURT, 50TH AVE: ONE CYCLIST DOWN</p><p>A 55-year-old woman on an e-bike and a 2015 SUV met at Hollis Court Boulevard and 50th Avenue.

The Clearview and LIE ramps need tighter geometry and better yield control. At neighborhood corners, give people a head start with LPIs and protect the crosswalks with concrete, not paint. Repeat hotspots need repeat fixes, not warnings. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>LAWMAKERS MOVE, SLOWLY</p><p>Albany kept school-zone cameras alive through 2030.

They do not bury the dead.</p><p>There is a bill to force the worst repeat offenders to install speed limiters. Assembly file A 2299 would require intelligent speed assistance after heavy points or camera tickets. It sits in committee. <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">A 2299</a>.</p><p>CITYWIDE STEPS THAT WOULD MATTER HERE</p><p>Lower the default speed. Slow every block where people live and walk. Use Sammy’s Law powers and set 20. Then make it stick with cameras and design. When a bus can jump a curb on Main, speed and fatigue have too much room. The tools exist. Use them. <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
