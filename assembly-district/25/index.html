Thirty-seven left with injuries so grave they may never walk the same.</strong> In just the last twelve months, three people died and seventeen suffered serious wounds. The youngest lost was 18. The oldest, 74. <strong>No one is spared.</strong></p><p>The carnage does not slow. On July 11, a city bus in Flushing jumped the curb. Eight people were hurt. The driver, just 25, told investigators he had a green light. Video showed he had fallen asleep. &ldquo;I was all the way in the back and all of a sudden the bus hit the curb, I guess, jumped the curb, I went this way and that way and banged into the side of the bus,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>said a passenger</a>. The pole at the stop still stands. Two people almost did not.</p><h3 id=the-usual-weapons-cars-suvs-and-speed>The Usual Weapons: Cars, SUVs, and Speed</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the killing.</strong> In this district, sedans and SUVs together have taken at least two lives and left over 300 people with injuries. Trucks, buses, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll. Speed is the silent accomplice. In December, a 72-year-old woman died when a sedan tore through Peck Avenue at unsafe speed. Another crash on the expressway crushed a 56-year-old man. The numbers pile up. The bodies do too.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Assembly Member Nily Rozic has voted for and co-sponsored bills to extend school speed zones, require safer street designs, and clamp down on repeat speeders with speed-limiting tech. She voted yes to extend school speed cameras, a move that <strong>boosts pedestrian safety</strong>. She co-sponsors the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force the worst repeat offenders to slow down. But some votes have missed the mark. Rozic missed a committee vote that allowed an unsafe bus regulation exemption to advance. She voted to exempt some employees from bus lane rules. Each delay, each loophole, leaves someone else at risk.</p><h3 id=what-you-must-do>What You Must Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Assembly Member Rozic. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand passage of the Stop Super Speeders Act.
