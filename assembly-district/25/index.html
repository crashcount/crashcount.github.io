The bus did.</p><p>At Main Street and 57th Road in Flushing, an MTA bus jumped the curb and injured eight. The driver first said he misjudged the curb. After video review, investigators now believe he fell asleep at the wheel. The MTA pulled him from service. “I was all the way in the back and all of a sudden the bus hit the curb,” a rider said. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>ABC7</a>.</p><p>HOLLIS COURT, 50TH AVE: ONE CYCLIST DOWN</p><p>A 55-year-old woman on an e-bike and a 2015 SUV met at Hollis Court Boulevard and 50th Avenue. The SUV turned left. The cyclist was ejected and died at the scene. Crash ID 4832001. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>The district has lost three people in the last 12 months; 887 were hurt. Serious injuries: 22. Crashes: 1,421. <a href=#>PeriodStats</a>. Peak harm hits the morning rush and again at the commute home. At 8 a.m., two dead, 158 injured. At 6 p.m., two dead, 121 injured. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>EXPRESSWAYS TAKE AND TAKE</p><p>On the Long Island Expressway, a 65-year-old man died pre-dawn in December.

The Clearview Expressway shows four deaths and 134 injuries. The Long Island Expressway shows one death and 569 injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>WHAT DRIVES THE BODY COUNT</p><p>“Other” factors lead the harm tally here: five deaths, 567 injuries, 17 serious injuries. Vulnerable road user error is a distant second. Failure to yield shows up too. These are the boxes the city checks after the sirens fade. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>By mode, people in cars absorb the most injuries.

Other motorized users: two dead, 53 injured. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>SMALL FIXES THAT STOP BLOOD</p><p>Main Street and other wide corridors need hardened turns and daylighting so drivers can see and must slow. The Clearview and LIE ramps need tighter geometry and better yield control. At neighborhood corners, give people a head start with LPIs and protect the crosswalks with concrete, not paint. Repeat hotspots need repeat fixes, not warnings. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>LAWMAKERS MOVE, SLOWLY</p><p>Albany kept school-zone cameras alive through 2030. Local reps voted yes. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>S 8344</a>. Cameras catch speed. They do not bury the dead.</p><p>There is a bill to force the worst repeat offenders to install speed limiters. Assembly file A 2299 would require intelligent speed assistance after heavy points or camera tickets. It sits in committee. <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">A 2299</a>.</p><p>CITYWIDE STEPS THAT WOULD MATTER HERE</p><p>Lower the default speed. Slow every block where people live and walk. Use Sammy’s Law powers and set 20. Then make it stick with cameras and design. When a bus can jump a curb on Main, speed and fatigue have too much room. The tools exist. Use them. <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
