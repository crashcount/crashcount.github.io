Sixteen left with serious injuries. Over a thousand hurt.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, the streets saw 1,473 crashes. The dead include the old and the young. A 27-year-old woman, ejected from her car on the Belt Parkway. A 78-year-old woman, killed as a passenger in a van on Brookville Boulevard. A 51-year-old woman, struck and crushed while not even in the roadway. A child, left with crushed legs. These are not numbers. They are empty chairs at dinner tables, shoes left by the door.</p><h3 id=the-machines-cars-trucks-and-the-cost-of-speed>The Machines: Cars, Trucks, and the Cost of Speed</h3><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage.</strong> In three years, cars and SUVs killed six pedestrians and left dozens more with broken bodies. Trucks and buses added to the toll. Motorcycles and bikes are rare in the death count, but the machines that rule these streets are heavy and fast. Speed is a constant. On April 21, a 57-year-old man lost control of his SUV on the Belt Parkway and died at the scene. Police said he &ldquo;failed to navigate the roadway and struck a tree&rdquo; <a href=https://qns.com/2025/04/brooklyn-motorist-killed-belt-parkway-ozone-park/>reported The Brooklyn Paper</a>. The tree did not move.

He voted yes to expand school speed cameras in Schenectady (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">A 7652</a>). But when New York City pushed for 24/7 speed cameras to slow drivers and protect children, Anderson warned the cameras could &ldquo;hit Black and brown communities hardest&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/05/16/not-just-albany-council-members-also-weary-on-speed-cameras-unless-mayor-allocates-money-to-their-districts>Streetsblog NYC</a>).
