Forty-one left with serious wounds. Over 3,400 injured.</strong> These are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors. They are the cyclist left broken on 115th Avenue, the moped rider struck down on 149th, the old woman who never made it home from Brookville Boulevard. The road does not care who you are. It takes all the same.</p><p>On June 15, a cyclist was found unconscious after a hit-and-run in South Ozone Park. Police are still searching for the driver. The news was blunt: &ldquo;They are now looking for evidence to help them track down the driver&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bicyclist-critical-condition-following-hit-run-queens/16752786/>reported ABC7</a>. Four days earlier, a 25-year-old moped rider, Antonio Smith-Ortiz, was killed by a wrong-way driver who fled the scene. &ldquo;The driver, who was going against traffic in the eastbound lane, then struck an unoccupied parked 2015 Ford Transit 350 Courier van before speeding off&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/11/queens-moped-rider-antonio-smith-ortiz-fatally-struck-wrong-way-hit-and-run-driver/>according to NY Daily News</a>.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Children and elders are not spared.</strong> In the last year, 110 people under 18 and 19 people over 75 were injured. Three elders died. The wounds are not just broken bones. They are lives cut short, families left with empty chairs.</p><p>The killers are not just cars. <strong>SUVs, sedans, vans, motorcycles, trucks, taxis, and bikes</strong> all leave bodies behind. The Belt Parkway, Rockaway Boulevard, South Conduit—these streets are not safe for anyone who walks, rides, or waits for a bus.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Assembly Member Khaleel Anderson has taken some steps. He co-sponsored bills to make streets safer for everyone, demanding &ldquo;safe access to public roads for all users by utilizing complete street design principles&rdquo; <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">in A 1077</a>. He voted yes to expand speed cameras near schools <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">with A 7652</a>. These are the right moves. But in 2022, Anderson warned that 24/7 speed cameras &ldquo;could hit Black and brown communities hardest&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/05/16/not-just-albany-council-members-also-weary-on-speed-cameras-unless-mayor-allocates-money-to-their-districts>as reported by Streetsblog NYC</a>. Cameras save lives. But they are not enough. The city and state must do more—redesign streets, lower speed limits, and put safety before politics.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Assembly Member Anderson. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand more protected crossings, more daylighting, more enforcement that targets reckless drivers—not the people trying to survive the street. Every day of delay is another family broken.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Clarkston, Georgia, with high traffic-fatality rates, won $1 million from the Safe Streets and Roads for All grant to craft a safety plan. The Local Infrastructure Hub, co-led by Bloomberg Philanthropies, provides technical help, boosting applications. Mayor Beverley Burks of Clarkston said, "You have to be willing to invest in yourself as a city... Having someone who had the skillset to be able to help write the narrative – that’s very crucial for the reviewers to understand the needs in your community." James Anderson, also quoted, highlighted how technical assistance turns ambition into real safety. Other small cities, like Globe, Arizona, and Gladewater, Texas, have also won grants for pedestrian safety. These wins show federal money can reach vulnerable road users in overlooked places.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
