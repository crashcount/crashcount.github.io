Seventeen were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The dead include a 25-year-old moped rider, struck and left by a wrong-way driver who sped off into the night. Police said, &ldquo;The driver, who was going against traffic in the eastbound lane, then struck an unoccupied parked&mldr;van before speeding off&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/11/queens-moped-rider-antonio-smith-ortiz-fatally-struck-wrong-way-hit-and-run-driver/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>Just days later, a cyclist was found unconscious on 115th Avenue, the victim of another hit-and-run.

The driver is gone. The pain remains.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-that-dont-lie>The Numbers That Don’t Lie</h3><p><strong>Crashes are not rare here.</strong> In the last twelve months, there were 1,583 crashes in AD 31. More than 1,100 people were injured. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. Cars and SUVs are the main killers, but trucks, vans, and even mopeds have left bodies broken. The Belt Parkway, the Conduit, Rockaway Boulevard: these are not just roads. They are sites of loss.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—and What Hasn’t</h3><p>Assembly Member Khaleel Anderson has voted to extend and expand speed cameras near schools, a move that keeps watch over the most vulnerable. He voted yes to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>extend school speed zones, improving child pedestrian safety</a>. Anderson also co-sponsors bills to force safer street designs for all users. But he has also voted to weaken bus safety rules, a step that puts pedestrians and cyclists at greater risk. When speed cameras were debated, Anderson warned that <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/05/16/not-just-albany-council-members-also-weary-on-speed-cameras-unless-mayor-allocates-money-to-their-districts>&ldquo;24/7 cameras could hit Black and brown communities hardest&rdquo;</a>.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by leaders who act—or do not. Call Anderson. Demand a default 20 mph speed limit. Demand real street redesigns, not just cameras. Join with others. Refuse to let another name become a number. The blood on the road is not washed away by silence.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Clarkston, Georgia, with high traffic-fatality rates, won $1 million from the Safe Streets and Roads for All grant to craft a safety plan. The Local Infrastructure Hub, co-led by Bloomberg Philanthropies, provides technical help, boosting applications. Mayor Beverley Burks of Clarkston said, "You have to be willing to invest in yourself as a city... Having someone who had the skillset to be able to help write the narrative – that’s very crucial for the reviewers to understand the needs in your community." James Anderson, also quoted, highlighted how technical assistance turns ambition into real safety. Other small cities, like Globe, Arizona, and Gladewater, Texas, have also won grants for pedestrian safety.
