In the last twelve months, 12 people died and 1,334 were injured in 1,847 crashes. Seventeen of those injuries were serious—lives changed in a blink, families left to pick up the pieces. Just last month, a cyclist was left in critical condition after a hit-and-run in South Ozone Park. Police said, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bicyclist-critical-condition-following-hit-run-queens/16752786/>&ldquo;They are now looking for evidence to help them track down the driver.&rdquo;</a> No one has been arrested.

In the last three years, they caused 6 deaths and 349 injuries to pedestrians. Trucks and buses added more pain: 34 injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds, 6 injuries. Bikes, 4. The numbers do not lie. They only count.</p><p>Children are not spared. In the last year, 116 people under 18 were hurt. Two did not make it home.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-inaction>Leadership: Action and Inaction</h3><p>Assembly Member Khaleel Anderson has voted to extend school speed zones, a move that <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>aims to keep protections in place for children and other vulnerable road users near schools.</a> He co-sponsored bills to boost street safety for all users. But he also voted to weaken bus rules, a change that <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S7785>increases pedestrian and cyclist risk.</a></p><p>The work is not done.

Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for every street, every child, every cyclist.</p><p>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The street does not care.

Clarkston, Georgia, with high traffic-fatality rates, won $1 million from the Safe Streets and Roads for All grant to craft a safety plan. The Local Infrastructure Hub, co-led by Bloomberg Philanthropies, provides technical help, boosting applications. Mayor Beverley Burks of Clarkston said, "You have to be willing to invest in yourself as a city... Having someone who had the skillset to be able to help write the narrative – that’s very crucial for the reviewers to understand the needs in your community." James Anderson, also quoted, highlighted how technical assistance turns ambition into real safety. Other small cities, like Globe, Arizona, and Gladewater, Texas, have also won grants for pedestrian safety.
