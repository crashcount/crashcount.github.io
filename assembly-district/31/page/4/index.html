Seventeen were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The dead include a 25-year-old moped rider, struck and left by a wrong-way driver who sped off into the night. Police said, &ldquo;The driver, who was going against traffic in the eastbound lane, then struck an unoccupied parked&mldr;van before speeding off&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/11/queens-moped-rider-antonio-smith-ortiz-fatally-struck-wrong-way-hit-and-run-driver/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>Just days later, a cyclist was found unconscious on 115th Avenue, the victim of another hit-and-run.

The driver is gone. The pain remains.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-that-dont-lie>The Numbers That Don’t Lie</h3><p><strong>Crashes are not rare here.</strong> In the last twelve months, there were 1,583 crashes in AD 31. More than 1,100 people were injured. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. Cars and SUVs are the main killers, but trucks, vans, and even mopeds have left bodies broken. The Belt Parkway, the Conduit, Rockaway Boulevard: these are not just roads. They are sites of loss.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—and What Hasn’t</h3><p>Assembly Member Khaleel Anderson has voted to extend and expand speed cameras near schools, a move that keeps watch over the most vulnerable. He voted yes to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>extend school speed zones, improving child pedestrian safety</a>. Anderson also co-sponsors bills to force safer street designs for all users. But he has also voted to weaken bus safety rules, a step that puts pedestrians and cyclists at greater risk. When speed cameras were debated, Anderson warned that <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/05/16/not-just-albany-council-members-also-weary-on-speed-cameras-unless-mayor-allocates-money-to-their-districts>&ldquo;24/7 cameras could hit Black and brown communities hardest&rdquo;</a>.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by leaders who act—or do not. Call Anderson. Demand a default 20 mph speed limit. Demand real street redesigns, not just cameras. Join with others. Refuse to let another name become a number. The blood on the road is not washed away by silence.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

It’s here, on city streets.</p><p class=mb3>Bill SB5602, now under City Council debate, would expand speed camera hours and stiffen penalties. The Council’s support for a required home rule message remains uncertain. The measure’s summary: 'Mayor Adams seeks Albany's approval to reauthorize NYC's speed camera program.' Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers backs home rule and cameras but questions where the money goes: 'Does DOT receive back any revenue?' Council Member Charles Barron supports cameras near schools but is noncommittal on home rule, noting, 'We have some of the highest fatalities and accidents, yet we don't see the highest amount of resources.' Speaker Adrienne Adams has voiced skepticism, calling cameras a way to 'nickel and dime' New Yorkers. Assembly Member Khaleel Anderson warns 24/7 cameras could hit Black and brown communities hardest. Assembly Member Dick Gottfried supports cameras and home rule, but many lawmakers hesitate. Advocates urge using revenue for street redesigns in underinvested areas. The debate exposes deep divides over equity, enforcement, and the city’s duty to protect its most vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Delays in commercial waste zones keep deadly trucks on city streets. Overlapping routes, reckless haulers, and missing side guards kill and injure. Reform stalls while lives hang in the balance. Urgency grows. No more excuses.</p><p class=mb3>On May 2, 2022, the City Council’s Sanitation Committee, chaired by Council Member Sandy Nurse, held a hearing on the delayed implementation of commercial waste zones, a reform established by a 2019 law. The matter, titled 'Advocates Warn Against Further Delays on Commercial Waste Zones,' drew sharp criticism after the Department of Sanitation granted private carters a three-month extension to comply with new requirements. Nurse stated, 'Our communities cannot afford any more delays.' Advocates and Families for Safe Streets highlighted the deadly toll: reckless commercial haulers have killed more than two dozen people in recent years. The reform aims to cut truck traffic, reduce pollution, and require life-saving side guards on heavy trucks by 2024. Lauren Pine, a crash survivor, said, 'Commercial waste zone reform can not come fast enough.' The hearing underscored that every delay keeps vulnerable New Yorkers at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
