Some demand revenue for local safety fixes. Others fear 24/7 cameras target Black and brown neighborhoods. Lives hang in the balance. The fight is not just in Albany. It’s here, on city streets.</p><p class=mb3>Bill SB5602, now under City Council debate, would expand speed camera hours and stiffen penalties. The Council’s support for a required home rule message remains uncertain. The measure’s summary: 'Mayor Adams seeks Albany's approval to reauthorize NYC's speed camera program.' Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers backs home rule and cameras but questions where the money goes: 'Does DOT receive back any revenue?' Council Member Charles Barron supports cameras near schools but is noncommittal on home rule, noting, 'We have some of the highest fatalities and accidents, yet we don't see the highest amount of resources.' Speaker Adrienne Adams has voiced skepticism, calling cameras a way to 'nickel and dime' New Yorkers. Assembly Member Khaleel Anderson warns 24/7 cameras could hit Black and brown communities hardest. Assembly Member Dick Gottfried supports cameras and home rule, but many lawmakers hesitate. Advocates urge using revenue for street redesigns in underinvested areas. The debate exposes deep divides over equity, enforcement, and the city’s duty to protect its most vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
