In the last twelve months, 12 people died and 1,334 were injured in 1,847 crashes. Seventeen of those injuries were serious—lives changed in a blink, families left to pick up the pieces. Just last month, a cyclist was left in critical condition after a hit-and-run in South Ozone Park. Police said, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bicyclist-critical-condition-following-hit-run-queens/16752786/>&ldquo;They are now looking for evidence to help them track down the driver.&rdquo;</a> No one has been arrested.

In the last three years, they caused 6 deaths and 349 injuries to pedestrians. Trucks and buses added more pain: 34 injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds, 6 injuries. Bikes, 4. The numbers do not lie. They only count.</p><p>Children are not spared. In the last year, 116 people under 18 were hurt. Two did not make it home.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-inaction>Leadership: Action and Inaction</h3><p>Assembly Member Khaleel Anderson has voted to extend school speed zones, a move that <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>aims to keep protections in place for children and other vulnerable road users near schools.</a> He co-sponsored bills to boost street safety for all users. But he also voted to weaken bus rules, a change that <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S7785>increases pedestrian and cyclist risk.</a></p><p>The work is not done.

Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for every street, every child, every cyclist.</p><p>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.
