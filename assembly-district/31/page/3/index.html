Seventeen left with serious wounds.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, crashes tore through families and neighborhoods—<strong>1,329 people injured</strong>. The numbers do not blink. They do not care if you are young or old. Three children under 18 were killed or seriously hurt. Three elders over 75 died. The Belt Parkway, Rockaway Boulevard, South Ozone Park—names that echo with sirens and loss.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a cyclist was left in critical condition after a hit-and-run on 115th Avenue. Police found the victim unconscious. The driver did not stop. <em>&ldquo;They are now looking for evidence to help them track down the driver&rdquo;</em> <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bicyclist-critical-condition-following-hit-run-queens/16752786/>reported ABC7</a>. Days before, a moped rider, Antonio Smith-Ortiz, was killed by a wrong-way driver who sped off into the night. <em>&ldquo;The driver, who was going against traffic in the eastbound lane, then struck an unoccupied parked van before speeding off&rdquo;</em> <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/11/queens-moped-rider-antonio-smith-ortiz-fatally-struck-wrong-way-hit-and-run-driver/>wrote NY Daily News</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h3><p>Assembly Member Khaleel Anderson has voted to extend school speed zones and boost funding for safer street designs. He co-sponsored bills to make streets safer for all users. He voted for driver education improvements. But Anderson also voted to weaken bus rules, a move that <strong>increases risk for people on foot and on bikes</strong>. He has raised concerns about speed cameras hitting Black and brown communities hardest, but the danger on the street is not spread evenly. The dead are mostly the vulnerable.</p><h3 id=the-system-is-failing-the-vulnerable>The System Is Failing the Vulnerable</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs are the main killers.</strong> In this district, they caused six pedestrian deaths and over 340 injuries. Trucks and buses hurt dozens more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll. The system still puts the burden on those outside the car. The street does not care if you have a helmet or a green light. It only cares if you survive.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every delay, every watered-down bill, every excuse costs lives. Call Assembly Member Anderson. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real street redesigns. Demand that repeat speeders lose their privilege to drive. <strong>Do not wait for another siren.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Both hit a sedan. Metal twisted. One rider, thrown, died on the street. Another ejected, hurt. The sedan driver had no license. Speed ruled the moment. Lives changed in seconds.</p><p class=mb3>On Beach Channel Drive near Beach 45th Street in Queens, two motorcycles crashed into a sedan. According to the police report, both motorcycles were traveling at unsafe speed. The impact demolished both bikes. A 38-year-old man riding without a helmet was ejected and killed after his head struck the ground. Another motorcyclist, age 33, was also ejected and suffered internal injuries. The sedan driver, a 52-year-old man, was injured and complained of pain. The police report notes the sedan driver was unlicensed. The only contributing factor listed is 'Unsafe Speed.' The absence of a helmet is noted for the rider who died, but the primary cause remains unsafe speed and the presence of an unlicensed driver.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
