Forty-one left with serious wounds. Over 3,400 injured.</strong> These are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors. They are the cyclist left broken on 115th Avenue, the moped rider struck down on 149th, the old woman who never made it home from Brookville Boulevard. The road does not care who you are. It takes all the same.</p><p>On June 15, a cyclist was found unconscious after a hit-and-run in South Ozone Park. Police are still searching for the driver. The news was blunt: &ldquo;They are now looking for evidence to help them track down the driver&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bicyclist-critical-condition-following-hit-run-queens/16752786/>reported ABC7</a>. Four days earlier, a 25-year-old moped rider, Antonio Smith-Ortiz, was killed by a wrong-way driver who fled the scene. &ldquo;The driver, who was going against traffic in the eastbound lane, then struck an unoccupied parked 2015 Ford Transit 350 Courier van before speeding off&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/11/queens-moped-rider-antonio-smith-ortiz-fatally-struck-wrong-way-hit-and-run-driver/>according to NY Daily News</a>.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Children and elders are not spared.</strong> In the last year, 110 people under 18 and 19 people over 75 were injured. Three elders died. The wounds are not just broken bones. They are lives cut short, families left with empty chairs.</p><p>The killers are not just cars. <strong>SUVs, sedans, vans, motorcycles, trucks, taxis, and bikes</strong> all leave bodies behind. The Belt Parkway, Rockaway Boulevard, South Conduit—these streets are not safe for anyone who walks, rides, or waits for a bus.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Assembly Member Khaleel Anderson has taken some steps. He co-sponsored bills to make streets safer for everyone, demanding &ldquo;safe access to public roads for all users by utilizing complete street design principles&rdquo; <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">in A 1077</a>. He voted yes to expand speed cameras near schools <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">with A 7652</a>. These are the right moves. But in 2022, Anderson warned that 24/7 speed cameras &ldquo;could hit Black and brown communities hardest&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/05/16/not-just-albany-council-members-also-weary-on-speed-cameras-unless-mayor-allocates-money-to-their-districts>as reported by Streetsblog NYC</a>. Cameras save lives. But they are not enough. The city and state must do more—redesign streets, lower speed limits, and put safety before politics.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Assembly Member Anderson. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand more protected crossings, more daylighting, more enforcement that targets reckless drivers—not the people trying to survive the street. Every day of delay is another family broken.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Council’s support for a required home rule message remains uncertain. The measure’s summary: 'Mayor Adams seeks Albany's approval to reauthorize NYC's speed camera program.' Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers backs home rule and cameras but questions where the money goes: 'Does DOT receive back any revenue?' Council Member Charles Barron supports cameras near schools but is noncommittal on home rule, noting, 'We have some of the highest fatalities and accidents, yet we don't see the highest amount of resources.' Speaker Adrienne Adams has voiced skepticism, calling cameras a way to 'nickel and dime' New Yorkers. Assembly Member Khaleel Anderson warns 24/7 cameras could hit Black and brown communities hardest. Assembly Member Dick Gottfried supports cameras and home rule, but many lawmakers hesitate. Advocates urge using revenue for street redesigns in underinvested areas. The debate exposes deep divides over equity, enforcement, and the city’s duty to protect its most vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Delays in commercial waste zones keep deadly trucks on city streets. Overlapping routes, reckless haulers, and missing side guards kill and injure. Reform stalls while lives hang in the balance. Urgency grows. No more excuses.</p><p class=mb3>On May 2, 2022, the City Council’s Sanitation Committee, chaired by Council Member Sandy Nurse, held a hearing on the delayed implementation of commercial waste zones, a reform established by a 2019 law. The matter, titled 'Advocates Warn Against Further Delays on Commercial Waste Zones,' drew sharp criticism after the Department of Sanitation granted private carters a three-month extension to comply with new requirements. Nurse stated, 'Our communities cannot afford any more delays.' Advocates and Families for Safe Streets highlighted the deadly toll: reckless commercial haulers have killed more than two dozen people in recent years. The reform aims to cut truck traffic, reduce pollution, and require life-saving side guards on heavy trucks by 2024. Lauren Pine, a crash survivor, said, 'Commercial waste zone reform can not come fast enough.' The hearing underscored that every delay keeps vulnerable New Yorkers at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
