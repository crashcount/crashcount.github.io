Sixteen maimed.</strong> In Assembly District 48, the numbers do not lie. Since 2022, cars and trucks have struck down the old and the young. Dov Broyde, 70, was walking home on Avenue I. A Smart Car hit him in the crosswalk. He died at Maimonides. The driver stayed. No charges filed. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/man-70-fatally-struck-by-brooklyn-smart-car-driver/>A 70-year-old man crossing a Brooklyn street around the corner from his home was fatally struck by a Smart Car driver, police said Tuesday.</a></p><p>A 17-year-old on a moped collided with a turning car. He died in the hospital.

Many are old. The killers are cars, SUVs, trucks. In three years: 14 dead, 1,451 injured, 16 left with wounds that will not heal. The numbers are steady. The pain is not. The streets do not forgive.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-against-the-living>Leadership: Votes Against the Living</h3><p>Assembly Member Simcha Eichenstein has a record. He voted <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2363&amp;term=2025">against extending school speed zones</a> and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>against expanding speed camera hours</a>. He stood with those who call cameras a burden, not a shield. He voted yes to <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A8471&amp;term=2023">weaken bus lane rules</a>, making streets more dangerous for those outside a car. He did sponsor <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>bills for e-vehicle licensing and training</a>, but the blood on the asphalt is from cars and trucks, not e-bikes.</p><p>There is no public record of him demanding a 20 mph limit, or pushing for the Stop Super Speeders Act. The silence is loud. The votes are clear.</p><h3 id=what-now-demand-action>What Now: Demand Action</h3><p><strong>Call Assembly Member Eichenstein. Demand he fight for lower speed limits, more speed cameras, and real penalties for repeat offenders.</strong> Do not wait for another name on the list. The dead cannot speak.

The Senate passed the measure 38-21; three city senators—Stephen Chan, Andrew Lanza, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton—voted no. The Assembly passed it 110-31, with nine city lawmakers—Alec Brook-Krasny, Lester Chang, Simcha Eichenstein, Michael Novakhov, Stacey Pheffer Amato, Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Reilly, David Weprin, Kalman Yeger—opposing. The Streetsblog NYC article, 'Ye Shall Know Their Names! Meet the Dirty Dozen City Pols Who Voted Against Speed Camera Program,' quotes lawmakers dismissing speed cameras as revenue grabs or burdens. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action, so no direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists can be assessed.' Still, the votes signal disregard for proven tools that protect those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states, "A van veered, struck a station wagon. The SUV’s driver, 54, died belted in place. The airbag burst. His body broke inside."

No victim behavior is listed as a contributing factor.
