A Smart Car hit him in the crosswalk. He died at Maimonides. The driver stayed.

He stood with those who call cameras a burden, not a shield. He voted yes to <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A8471&amp;term=2023">weaken bus lane rules</a>, making streets more dangerous for those outside a car. He did sponsor <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>bills for e-vehicle licensing and training</a>, but the blood on the asphalt is from cars and trucks, not e-bikes.</p><p>There is no public record of him demanding a 20 mph limit, or pushing for the Stop Super Speeders Act. The silence is loud. The votes are clear.</p><h3 id=what-now-demand-action>What Now: Demand Action</h3><p><strong>Call Assembly Member Eichenstein.

The toll will be measured in blood, not words.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13 and June 17, 2025, the New York State Senate and Assembly voted on reauthorizing New York City's school zone speed camera program. The Senate passed the measure 38-21; three city senators—Stephen Chan, Andrew Lanza, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton—voted no. The Assembly passed it 110-31, with nine city lawmakers—Alec Brook-Krasny, Lester Chang, Simcha Eichenstein, Michael Novakhov, Stacey Pheffer Amato, Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Reilly, David Weprin, Kalman Yeger—opposing. The Streetsblog NYC article, 'Ye Shall Know Their Names! Meet the Dirty Dozen City Pols Who Voted Against Speed Camera Program,' quotes lawmakers dismissing speed cameras as revenue grabs or burdens. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action, so no direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists can be assessed.' Still, the votes signal disregard for proven tools that protect those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure extends and corrects school speed zone laws in New York City, repealing outdated provisions. Gounardes led the push, with strong support from most Senate Democrats and a split Assembly.
