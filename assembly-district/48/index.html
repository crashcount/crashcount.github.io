An Audi came fast—68 miles an hour, prosecutors say. It ran the red. It hit another car. Then it hit the family. The mother and her girls, ages 8 and 5, died. The boy, 4, is still in a coma. The driver, Miriam Yarimi, had a suspended license and over 20 speed camera tickets. She never braked. Brooklyn’s District Attorney called it <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/16/miriam-yarimi-driver-accused-killing-brooklyn-mom-and-two-kids-in-person-court-appearance/>“one of the worst collisions I’ve ever seen on a New York City street”</a>.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>4 people died and 430 were injured</strong> in traffic crashes in AD 48. Five were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The dead are mostly older. The injured are often young. Children, parents, elders—none are spared.</p><h2 id=the-record-of-leadership>The Record of Leadership</h2><p>Assembly Member Simcha Eichenstein has not led on street safety. He voted <strong>no</strong> on a bill to bring speed cameras to school zones in Schenectady—cameras proven to catch drivers who speed where children cross. He <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">opposed it</a>. He did sponsor a bill to regulate e-bikes and mopeds, but that bill targets the most vulnerable, not the drivers of SUVs and trucks who cause most deaths. The cars keep coming. The law keeps missing them.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p>SUVs and trucks killed or hurt more pedestrians here than any other vehicle. In three years, <strong>SUVs caused 7 deaths and 55 injuries</strong>. Trucks killed at least one. Bikes and mopeds together caused far fewer injuries, and no deaths. The numbers are clear. The danger is heavy, fast, and unchecked.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><p>Call Assembly Member Eichenstein. Call your council member. Demand lower speed limits, more speed cameras, and laws that stop reckless drivers before they kill. Do not wait for another child’s name in the news. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Senate passed the measure 38-21; three city senators—Stephen Chan, Andrew Lanza, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton—voted no. The Assembly passed it 110-31, with nine city lawmakers—Alec Brook-Krasny, Lester Chang, Simcha Eichenstein, Michael Novakhov, Stacey Pheffer Amato, Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Reilly, David Weprin, Kalman Yeger—opposing. The Streetsblog NYC article, 'Ye Shall Know Their Names! Meet the Dirty Dozen City Pols Who Voted Against Speed Camera Program,' quotes lawmakers dismissing speed cameras as revenue grabs or burdens. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action, so no direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists can be assessed.' Still, the votes signal disregard for proven tools that protect those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
