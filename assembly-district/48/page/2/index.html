Sixteen maimed.</strong> In Assembly District 48, the numbers do not lie. Since 2022, cars and trucks have struck down the old and the young. Dov Broyde, 70, was walking home on Avenue I. A Smart Car hit him in the crosswalk. He died at Maimonides. The driver stayed. No charges filed. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/man-70-fatally-struck-by-brooklyn-smart-car-driver/>A 70-year-old man crossing a Brooklyn street around the corner from his home was fatally struck by a Smart Car driver, police said Tuesday.</a></p><p>A 17-year-old on a moped collided with a turning car. He died in the hospital.

Many are old. The killers are cars, SUVs, trucks. In three years: 14 dead, 1,451 injured, 16 left with wounds that will not heal. The numbers are steady. The pain is not. The streets do not forgive.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-against-the-living>Leadership: Votes Against the Living</h3><p>Assembly Member Simcha Eichenstein has a record. He voted <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2363&amp;term=2025">against extending school speed zones</a> and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>against expanding speed camera hours</a>. He stood with those who call cameras a burden, not a shield. He voted yes to <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A8471&amp;term=2023">weaken bus lane rules</a>, making streets more dangerous for those outside a car. He did sponsor <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>bills for e-vehicle licensing and training</a>, but the blood on the asphalt is from cars and trucks, not e-bikes.</p><p>There is no public record of him demanding a 20 mph limit, or pushing for the Stop Super Speeders Act. The silence is loud. The votes are clear.</p><h3 id=what-now-demand-action>What Now: Demand Action</h3><p><strong>Call Assembly Member Eichenstein. Demand he fight for lower speed limits, more speed cameras, and real penalties for repeat offenders.</strong> Do not wait for another name on the list. The dead cannot speak.

According to the police report, a 21-year-old e-bike rider, unlicensed and unhelmeted, was struck head-on by an unlicensed SUV. The rider was ejected, left unconscious, and suffered severe head bleeding. The SUV carried two occupants, both unlicensed. The report states, 'Traffic control disregarded.' This failure to obey traffic signals or signs was listed as the primary contributing factor for all involved. The e-bike rider was not wearing a helmet, but this is noted only after the systemic disregard for traffic control. The crash underscores the lethal consequences when drivers ignore basic rules and operate vehicles without licenses.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
