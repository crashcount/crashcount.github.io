Sixteen maimed.</strong> In Assembly District 48, the numbers do not lie. Since 2022, cars and trucks have struck down the old and the young. Dov Broyde, 70, was walking home on Avenue I. A Smart Car hit him in the crosswalk. He died at Maimonides. The driver stayed. No charges filed. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/man-70-fatally-struck-by-brooklyn-smart-car-driver/>A 70-year-old man crossing a Brooklyn street around the corner from his home was fatally struck by a Smart Car driver, police said Tuesday.</a></p><p>A 17-year-old on a moped collided with a turning car. He died in the hospital. His passenger, an elderly man, is still fighting for life. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/teen-boy-dead-man-critically-injured-in-moped-crash-in-brooklyn/>A 17-year-old boy died and an elderly man was in critical condition after a moped collision Monday in Brooklyn.</a></p><p><strong>The dead do not get second chances.</strong></p><h3 id=patterns-of-harm>Patterns of Harm</h3><p>Most victims are on foot. Many are old. The killers are cars, SUVs, trucks. In three years: 14 dead, 1,451 injured, 16 left with wounds that will not heal. The numbers are steady. The pain is not. The streets do not forgive.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-against-the-living>Leadership: Votes Against the Living</h3><p>Assembly Member Simcha Eichenstein has a record. He voted <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2363&amp;term=2025">against extending school speed zones</a> and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>against expanding speed camera hours</a>. He stood with those who call cameras a burden, not a shield. He voted yes to <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A8471&amp;term=2023">weaken bus lane rules</a>, making streets more dangerous for those outside a car. He did sponsor <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>bills for e-vehicle licensing and training</a>, but the blood on the asphalt is from cars and trucks, not e-bikes.</p><p>There is no public record of him demanding a 20 mph limit, or pushing for the Stop Super Speeders Act. The silence is loud. The votes are clear.</p><h3 id=what-now-demand-action>What Now: Demand Action</h3><p><strong>Call Assembly Member Eichenstein. Demand he fight for lower speed limits, more speed cameras, and real penalties for repeat offenders.</strong> Do not wait for another name on the list. The dead cannot speak.
