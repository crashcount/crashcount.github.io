A Smart Car hit him in the crosswalk. He died at Maimonides. The driver stayed.

He stood with those who call cameras a burden, not a shield. He voted yes to <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A8471&amp;term=2023">weaken bus lane rules</a>, making streets more dangerous for those outside a car. He did sponsor <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>bills for e-vehicle licensing and training</a>, but the blood on the asphalt is from cars and trucks, not e-bikes.</p><p>There is no public record of him demanding a 20 mph limit, or pushing for the Stop Super Speeders Act.
