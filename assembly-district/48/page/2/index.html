In April, a driver sped through a red light on Ocean Parkway, hitting Natasha Saada and her three children in the crosswalk. Saada and two girls died. Her son is still in a coma. The driver, Miriam Yarimi, was going 68 miles per hour. She never braked. Her car had 21 speed camera tickets and five red light tickets. Her license was suspended. Brooklyn D.A. Eric Gonzalez called it <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/16/miriam-yarimi-driver-accused-killing-brooklyn-mom-and-two-kids-in-person-court-appearance/>&ldquo;one of the worst collisions I&rsquo;ve ever seen on a New York City street.&rdquo;</a></p><p>In the last year, <strong>three people died and 429 were injured</strong> in Assembly District 48. Five suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Children, elders, workers. The numbers do not stop. The pain does not fade.</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-against-safety>Leadership: Votes Against Safety</h2><p>Assembly Member Simcha Eichenstein has not led on safety. He voted <strong>against speed camera programs</strong>—not once, but twice. In June 2024, he opposed a bill to bring speed cameras to school zones in Schenectady, a tool proven to protect children (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">opposed a bill</a>). In June 2025, he voted no on renewing New York City&rsquo;s own speed camera program, joining a small group of lawmakers who dismissed the evidence (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>voted no on renewing</a>).</p><p>Eichenstein did sponsor a bill to regulate e-bikes and low-speed vehicles (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2363&amp;term=2025">sponsored a bill</a>). But the deadliest threat in these streets is not a delivery worker on a bike. It is the driver who speeds, who runs red lights, who keeps driving after ticket after ticket. The law lets them pay and keep rolling. The bodies pile up.</p><h2 id=the-road-ahead-no-more-waiting>The Road Ahead: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Cars and trucks killed and maimed the most.</strong> In this district, SUVs and sedans caused the most deaths and injuries. Trucks and vans followed. Mopeds and bikes are not the crisis. The crisis is heavy, fast, and unchecked.</p><p>&ldquo;What is very clear is that she should not have been on the road that day,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/miriam-yarimi-ocean-parkway-brooklyn-crash/>said D.A. Gonzalez</a>. But she was. And so are hundreds like her.</p><p><strong>Call your Assembly Member. Call your Council Member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement for repeat offenders. Demand speed cameras in every school zone.</strong></p><p>Every day of delay is another family broken.
