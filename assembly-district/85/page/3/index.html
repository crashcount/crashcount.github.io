They are the map.</p><h3 id=the-hours-that-hurt>The hours that hurt</h3><p>Since 2022, this district logged <strong>4,024 crashes, 16 deaths, and 2,308 injuries</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Pedestrians carry the worst of it: 5 dead, 413 hurt. Cyclists: 160 hurt, 1 killed. Small numbers on a page. Large holes in a block.</p><p>The clock tells its own story. Injuries spike late day into night. From 5 pm to 10 pm, the tally climbs, peaking around the dinner hour and again at 9 pm. After midnight, the hurt keeps coming. At 3 am, three deaths. At 4 am, two more. The log is cold. The pattern is not (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The city tags causes. Most go to “other.” A box that swallows truth: <strong>7 deaths and 665 injuries</strong>. “Vulnerable road user error” gets blame next. That is 3 deaths. “Unsafe speed” is marked in only six injuries. The paper trail is tidy. The street is not (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=three-corners-one-fix>Three corners.

Pull cars back from crosswalks. Let people see and be seen on Westchester and Southern.</li><li>Give walkers the head start. Leading pedestrian intervals at the busy legs, hardened turns to slow the swing.</li><li>Target the repeat blocks in the worst hours with consistent, publicized enforcement. Same places, same times. Every week.</li></ul><p>These are small tools. They work where used. The absence shows.</p><h3 id=officials-know-what-works--do-they>Officials know what works — do they?</h3><p>Albany extended protections around schools this June. The bill to fix school speed zones cleared both chambers on June 17. Local members voted yes (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>S 8344</a>). Cameras help when they are on. They do not slow a car a block away.</p><p>Citywide fixes are on the table. <strong>Lower the default speed</strong> on our streets. Use the tools the city now has. <strong>Stop the worst repeat speeders</strong> with systems that hold the line on speed. The pattern in this district is clear: late‑day hurt, night deaths, the same corridors bleeding. Slower traffic saves lives. Fewer high‑risk drivers on the road saves lives. The numbers here do not argue back (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-toll-of-a-year>The toll of a year</h3><p>Year to date, crashes are up. <strong>745 crashes, 515 injured</strong>, already ahead of last year’s pace. One child is dead. Older New Yorkers are getting hurt more often. Serious injuries more than doubled over last year to date (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>On Seward Avenue this spring, a stolen car hit parked cars. A man said, “It pushed me six feet. I hit my leg and my back.” Another voice: “I’m shocked. I’ll probably feel the pain later.” The driver ran but was caught, ABC7 reported (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/driver-stolen-vehicle-slams-parked-cars-bronx-fleeing-police/16181891/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>A mother waits at a corner that has already taken someone. The light changes. The street does not.</p><p>—</p><p>One action: tell City Hall to slow the city down. Ask for a 20 mph default and real tools for repeat speeders.
