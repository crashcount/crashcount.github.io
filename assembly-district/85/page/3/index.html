Pedestrians carry the worst of it: 5 dead, 413 hurt. Cyclists: 160 hurt, 1 killed. Small numbers on a page. Large holes in a block.</p><p>The clock tells its own story. Injuries spike late day into night. From 5 pm to 10 pm, the tally climbs, peaking around the dinner hour and again at 9 pm. After midnight, the hurt keeps coming. At 3 am, three deaths. At 4 am, two more. The log is cold. The pattern is not (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The city tags causes. Most go to “other.” A box that swallows truth: <strong>7 deaths and 665 injuries</strong>. “Vulnerable road user error” gets blame next. That is 3 deaths. “Unsafe speed” is marked in only six injuries. The paper trail is tidy.

The bill to fix school speed zones cleared both chambers on June 17. Local members voted yes (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>S 8344</a>). Cameras help when they are on. They do not slow a car a block away.</p><p>Citywide fixes are on the table. <strong>Lower the default speed</strong> on our streets. Use the tools the city now has. <strong>Stop the worst repeat speeders</strong> with systems that hold the line on speed. The pattern in this district is clear: late‑day hurt, night deaths, the same corridors bleeding. Slower traffic saves lives. Fewer high‑risk drivers on the road saves lives.
