Over two thousand injured.</strong> Twenty-eight left with wounds so deep they are called serious, not just by doctors but by the city itself. The dead are not numbers. They are a 17-year-old boy thrown from a motorbike at Metcalf and East 172nd, his ride ending in the street, his friend—a 14-year-old girl—rushed to Jacobi Hospital, alive but changed. The driver stayed. No arrests. The city moved on. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/02/25/us-news/18-year-old-boy-killed-teen-girl-injured-after-motorbike-collides-with-minivan-in-nyc/>Both teens were thrown from the bike and rushed to Jacobi Hospital. The older victim succumbed to his injuries while the girl was in stable condition, police said.</a></p><p>A few blocks away, a stolen car slammed into parked cars on Seward Avenue. Robert Perez was sitting in his car. The impact pushed him six feet. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/driver-stolen-vehicle-slams-parked-cars-bronx-fleeing-police/16181891/>&ldquo;It pushed me six feet. I hit my leg and my back. So, I don&rsquo;t even know what to do. I panicked,&rdquo;</a> he said. He was lucky. He walked away. Others do not.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-who-pays-the-price>The Pattern: Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Children, teens, elders.</strong> In the last twelve months, one child and one older adult have died. Fifty children hurt. Eighty-five young adults. The violence comes from all directions: sedans, SUVs, trucks, mopeds. <strong>Cars and SUVs alone have killed five, injured over three hundred.</strong></p><p>The street is not safe for the walker, the rider, the child holding a parent’s hand. The numbers do not care if you are careful. The numbers do not care if you look both ways.</p><h3 id=leadership-what-has-been-done-what-must-be-done>Leadership: What Has Been Done, What Must Be Done</h3><p>Assembly Member Emérita Torres has spoken up for restoring MTA funding, warning that underfunding transit puts riders—especially those on foot or bike—at risk (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/07/30/trains-tracks-and-tunnels-top-mta-needs-for-next-capital-plan-as-current-plan-languishes>Trains, Tracks and Tunnels Top MTA Needs For Next Capital Plan As Current Plan Languishes</a>). But on the blood in the crosswalks, the silence is louder. <strong>No recent bills, no public push for lower speeds, no fight for more cameras or safer crossings.</strong></p><p>The city has the power to set safer speed limits. The state can pass the Stop Super Speeders Act. The tools are there. The bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more>Call to Action: Demand More</h3><p><strong>Do not wait for another child’s name in a headline.</strong> Call Assembly Member Torres. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action on repeat reckless drivers. Demand streets where children can walk and live. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice. Change it.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
