Hundreds Hurt. No Excuses Left.</h1><p class="byline f6 silver">Written July 18, 2025 <em>(Revised August 13, 2025 – Fixed broken link, cleaned citations)</em></p></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>AD 85: Jan 1, 2022 - Jul 18, 2025</h2><h3 id=the-deaths-keep-coming>The Deaths Keep Coming</h3><p>In Assembly District 85, the numbers do not lie. <strong>Sixteen people killed. Over two thousand injured.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, two more lives lost, 635 hurt, twelve left with injuries so severe they will never be the same. The dead are not numbers. They are children, elders, workers, neighbors.</p><p>Just this February, a motorbike carrying two teens collided with a minivan at East 172nd and Metcalf. The boy died. The girl survived, but not unchanged. Police said, <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/02/25/us-news/18-year-old-boy-killed-teen-girl-injured-after-motorbike-collides-with-minivan-in-nyc/>&ldquo;Both teens were thrown from the bike and rushed to Jacobi Hospital. The older victim succumbed to his injuries while the girl was in stable condition.&rdquo;</a> The driver stayed. No arrests. The street stayed the same.</p><p>Last fall, a 56-year-old man was killed crossing East 163rd at Westchester Avenue. He was in the crosswalk. The SUV kept going. He did not.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h3><p><strong>Most of these deaths could have been prevented.</strong> The same streets see the same crashes, year after year. Cars and SUVs do most of the killing—<strong>five deaths, over 300 injuries</strong> from cars and SUVs alone in this district since 2022. Trucks and buses add more. Motorcycles and mopeds, too. The city knows which streets are deadly. The city knows how to fix them. Still, the bodies pile up.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn’t</h3><p>Assembly Member Emérita Torres has voted to extend and expand school speed cameras, a move that <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>boosts safety for children</a>. Torres backed the law to keep speed zones in place, aiming to protect kids near schools. But the work is not done. The most dangerous drivers—those with dozens of camera tickets—still face no real barrier. The streets outside school hours, or outside the camera zones, remain open season.</p><h3 id=the-voices-left-behind>The Voices Left Behind</h3><p>When a stolen car slammed into parked cars on Seward Avenue this April, Robert Perez was thrown six feet. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/driver-stolen-vehicle-slams-parked-cars-bronx-fleeing-police/16181891/>&ldquo;It pushed me six feet. I hit my leg and my back.&rdquo;</a> He survived. Others do not. The shock lingers. The pain comes later.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Assembly Member Torres. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat speeders. Join with others. Do not wait for another child’s name to be added to the list. The street will not change itself.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
