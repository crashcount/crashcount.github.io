Twelve more are left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, 574 neighbors have been hurt in 898 crashes across Assembly District 85. The dead include a teenager and a 55-year-old man. The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie.</p><p>On February 24, a motorbike carrying an 18-year-old boy and a 14-year-old girl collided with a minivan at Metcalf Avenue and East 172nd Street. Both teens were thrown from the bike. The boy died at Jacobi Hospital. The girl survived, but the impact will not leave her soon. Police said, &ldquo;Both teens were thrown from the bike and rushed to Jacobi Hospital. The older victim succumbed to his injuries while the girl was in stable condition,&rdquo; as <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/02/25/us-news/18-year-old-boy-killed-teen-girl-injured-after-motorbike-collides-with-minivan-in-nyc/>reported by the New York Post</a>.

The boy did not make it. &ldquo;The driver remained at the scene and no arrests were made. The investigation is ongoing,&rdquo; according to <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/pedestrians-injured-being-struck-vehicle-bronx-police-say/15952700/>ABC7</a>. The street is unchanged.

Trucks and buses hurt dozens. Motorcycles and mopeds left bodies broken. The young and the old are not spared. One child dead. Four seniors killed or maimed. The violence is not random.

No public push for lower speed limits. No press for more protected crossings or automated enforcement. The silence is loud. The families left behind hear it every day.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next-action-not-excuses>What Comes Next: Action, Not Excuses</h2><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every delay is a choice. Call Assembly Member Torres. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more speed cameras. Demand streets that do not kill children.

The impact hospitalized two people, including Robert Perez, who said, "It pushed me six feet. I hit my leg and my back." Another victim described being "more in shock" than pain. The driver, identified as Angel Colon, fled on foot but was arrested nearby. The crash damaged several vehicles and disrupted a quiet afternoon. Police charged Colon with grand larceny and criminal possession of stolen property.

The man suffered severe crush injuries to his neck and was found conscious but gravely hurt in the street. The police report lists 'Pavement Slippery' and 'Brakes Defective' as contributing factors to the crash.
