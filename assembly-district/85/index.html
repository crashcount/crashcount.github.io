The bill to fix school speed zones cleared both chambers on June 17. Local members voted yes (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>S 8344</a>). Cameras help when they are on. They do not slow a car a block away.</p><p>Citywide fixes are on the table. <strong>Lower the default speed</strong> on our streets. Use the tools the city now has. <strong>Stop the worst repeat speeders</strong> with systems that hold the line on speed. The pattern in this district is clear: late‑day hurt, night deaths, the same corridors bleeding. Slower traffic saves lives. Fewer high‑risk drivers on the road saves lives. The numbers here do not argue back (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-toll-of-a-year>The toll of a year</h3><p>Year to date, crashes are up. <strong>745 crashes, 515 injured</strong>, already ahead of last year’s pace. One child is dead. Older New Yorkers are getting hurt more often. Serious injuries more than doubled over last year to date (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>On Seward Avenue this spring, a stolen car hit parked cars. A man said, “It pushed me six feet. I hit my leg and my back.” Another voice: “I’m shocked. I’ll probably feel the pain later.” The driver ran but was caught, ABC7 reported (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/driver-stolen-vehicle-slams-parked-cars-bronx-fleeing-police/16181891/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>A mother waits at a corner that has already taken someone. The light changes. The street does not.</p><p>—</p><p>One action: tell City Hall to slow the city down. Ask for a 20 mph default and real tools for repeat speeders. Start here: <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The measure extends and corrects school speed zone laws in New York City, repealing outdated provisions. Gounardes led the push, with strong support from most Senate Democrats and a split Assembly.

She stayed upright, but her knee split open. Blood soaked her jeans. She did not fall, but her body buckled. One moment riding, the next—broken, bleeding, still.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a 39-year-old woman operating a moped westbound on Story Avenue near Metcalf Avenue in the Bronx was struck from behind. The report states, 'A moped struck from behind. The woman stayed upright. Her knee split open. Blood soaked her jeans.' The impact caused severe lacerations to her knee, though she did not fall from the vehicle. The moped sustained damage to the center back end, consistent with a rear impact. The police report lists the contributing factor as 'Unspecified,' but the collision's nature—center back end impact—points to a failure by the striking vehicle to maintain safe distance or control. No victim behavior is cited as a contributing factor. The focus remains on the danger posed to vulnerable road users by rear-end collisions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
