Since 2022, <strong>16 people have died</strong> and <strong>2,119 have been injured</strong> in traffic crashes here. <strong>Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians are among the dead.</strong> In the past year alone, two more lives ended—one a child, one an older adult. <strong>Twelve others suffered serious injuries.</strong></p><p>Just this February, a teenager and a 14-year-old girl were thrown from a motorbike at East 172nd and Metcalf. The boy died. The girl survived. The driver stayed at the scene. Police said, <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/02/25/us-news/18-year-old-boy-killed-teen-girl-injured-after-motorbike-collides-with-minivan-in-nyc/>“Both teens were thrown from the bike and rushed to Jacobi Hospital. The older victim succumbed to his injuries while the girl was in stable condition.”</a> No arrests. No answers. The street is quiet again, but the loss remains.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p>The dead are not just numbers. A 56-year-old man, crossing East 163rd at Westchester, was struck and killed by an SUV. A 23-year-old moped rider died on Intervale Avenue. A 32-year-old woman died walking on the Bruckner. Each crash leaves a hole. Each crash is a warning. <strong>Most victims are on foot, on bikes, or riding mopeds.</strong></p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn’t</h3><p>Assembly Member Emérita Torres has voted to extend and expand school speed zones and speed cameras, moves that protect children and slow some drivers. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Torres voted yes to extend school speed zones, improving child pedestrian safety.</a> But Torres also voted to weaken bus rules, a move that puts more pedestrians and cyclists at risk. The work is not finished. <strong>Speed kills. Delay kills.</strong></p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a failure of policy, not fate. Call Assembly Member Torres. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people outside of cars. <strong>Do not wait for another child’s name to be written in blood on the street.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report states the taxi 'slides on wet asphalt' and that 'brakes fail,' resulting in the vehicle’s left front bumper striking the pedestrian. The man suffered severe crush injuries to his neck and was found conscious but gravely hurt in the street. The police report lists 'Pavement Slippery' and 'Brakes Defective' as contributing factors to the crash. No driver error beyond these mechanical and environmental failures is cited, but the systemic danger is clear: a vehicle unable to stop, a vulnerable pedestrian left exposed, and a city street transformed into a site of trauma.
