A 73-year-old woman, crossing at 107th Avenue, hit by a bus making a left turn. A young man, 27, ejected from his sedan on Cross Bay Boulevard, dead before the ambulance arrived. In the last twelve months, 2 people died and 13 suffered serious injuries on the streets of Assembly District 23. 573 were hurt. The numbers do not rest. They do not heal. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p>Children, the old, the ones on foot or bike. In the past year, 54 people under 18 were injured. Cyclists and pedestrians are not shielded by steel. They are left with broken bodies, or worse. Cars and SUVs do most of the killing. Trucks and buses add to the count. The road does not care who you are. It only remembers the impact.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h2><p>Assembly Member Stacey Pheffer Amato has signed on to <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">bills that would force safer street design</a> for all users. She <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1280&amp;term=2023">voted yes to bring speed cameras to school zones</a> in Schenectady. But when the fight came for congestion pricing—money for transit, fewer cars, safer streets—she <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/06/reporters-notebook-where-were-you-the-day-congestion-pricing-died-maybe>called her own vote &ldquo;political blackmail&rdquo;</a> and backed the pause. She also <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/16/watchdog-group-no-toll-exemptions-for-cops>pushed for a bill to give NYPD officers a free pass on congestion tolls</a>, a move watchdogs called a giveaway to the powerful at the expense of everyone else. The record is mixed. The streets are not.</p><h2 id=what-next-the-work-is-not-done>What Next? The Work Is Not Done</h2><p>Every day without change is another day of blood on the asphalt. Call Assembly Member Pheffer Amato. Demand she fight for lower speed limits, more speed cameras, and real street redesigns that protect people, not just cars. Join with others. Make your voice impossible to ignore. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

As the vehicle turned, it struck a 36-year-old woman who was crossing the intersection with the signal. The report states, 'She crossed with the light. The Toyota turned left. Metal met chest. She dropped to the pavement. Crush injuries.' The pedestrian suffered severe chest injuries and fell to the ground. The SUV sustained no damage, and the report notes silence after the impact. The driver’s action—turning left while a pedestrian was lawfully in the crosswalk—created the deadly conflict. The police report lists the pedestrian’s action as 'Crossing With Signal,' underscoring that she had the right of way. No driver error is specified in the contributing factors, but the narrative and sequence of events center the danger of turning vehicles at intersections where pedestrians are present.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill seeks to exempt NYPD officers, even off-duty, from paying congestion pricing tolls in Manhattan’s central business district. Reinvent Albany called the measure 'contrary to notions of basic fairness' and a '$22 million handout' to a special interest. The Traffic Mobility Review Board had already rejected such exemptions. The group warned that multiple exemption bills could cost the public $100 million yearly and force higher tolls for everyone else. Neither Pheffer Amato nor Scarcella-Spanton commented. The watchdog urged lawmakers to serve the many, not the powerful few.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the crash occurred during a police pursuit. The report states the driver was 'Backing Unsafely' and did not possess a valid license. The pedestrian was not in a crosswalk at the time, but the report does not list any pedestrian behavior as a contributing factor. The narrative describes the scene: 'A fleeing Honda reversed into a man, not at a crosswalk. His leg was crushed under steel. He stayed conscious. The driver had no license. The streetlights flickered. Sirens followed.' The focus remains on the driver’s unlawful actions—operating without a license and reversing unsafely while fleeing police—which directly led to the pedestrian’s injuries.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
