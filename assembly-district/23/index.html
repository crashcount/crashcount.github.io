The toll will be measured in blood, not words.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13 and June 17, 2025, the New York State Senate and Assembly voted on reauthorizing New York City's school zone speed camera program. The Senate passed the measure 38-21; three city senators—Stephen Chan, Andrew Lanza, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton—voted no. The Assembly passed it 110-31, with nine city lawmakers—Alec Brook-Krasny, Lester Chang, Simcha Eichenstein, Michael Novakhov, Stacey Pheffer Amato, Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Reilly, David Weprin, Kalman Yeger—opposing. The Streetsblog NYC article, 'Ye Shall Know Their Names! Meet the Dirty Dozen City Pols Who Voted Against Speed Camera Program,' quotes lawmakers dismissing speed cameras as revenue grabs or burdens. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action, so no direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists can be assessed.' Still, the votes signal disregard for proven tools that protect those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill seeks to exempt NYPD officers, even off-duty, from paying congestion pricing tolls in Manhattan’s central business district. Reinvent Albany called the measure 'contrary to notions of basic fairness' and a '$22 million handout' to a special interest. The Traffic Mobility Review Board had already rejected such exemptions. The group warned that multiple exemption bills could cost the public $100 million yearly and force higher tolls for everyone else. Neither Pheffer Amato nor Scarcella-Spanton commented.
