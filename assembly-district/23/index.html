On July 5, a BMW hit the divider, vaulted into oncoming traffic, and caught fire. The driver, 24, and a passenger, 22, died. Three others were thrown from the car.

Nearly 2,000 have been hurt. The violence does not slow. Cars and SUVs do the most harm—6 deaths, 7 serious injuries. Trucks and buses killed 2, left others broken. Motorcycles, mopeds, bikes: the toll is smaller, but the pain is the same.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-that-cut-both-ways>Leadership: Votes That Cut Both Ways</h3><p>Assembly Member Stacey Pheffer Amato has stood on both sides. She co-sponsored bills for safer streets. She voted to fund better designs. But when it mattered most, she voted no on extending school speed zones and keeping speed cameras running (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Open States</a>). She stood against the tools that protect children. She backed bills to weaken bus lane rules, putting walkers and riders at risk.</p><h3 id=what-now-the-next-step-is-yours>What Now: The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p>This is not fate. Every crash is a policy failure. Call Assembly Member Amato. Demand she back speed cameras, safer street designs, and laws that put people before cars.

The Senate passed the measure 38-21; three city senators—Stephen Chan, Andrew Lanza, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton—voted no. The Assembly passed it 110-31, with nine city lawmakers—Alec Brook-Krasny, Lester Chang, Simcha Eichenstein, Michael Novakhov, Stacey Pheffer Amato, Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Reilly, David Weprin, Kalman Yeger—opposing. The Streetsblog NYC article, 'Ye Shall Know Their Names! Meet the Dirty Dozen City Pols Who Voted Against Speed Camera Program,' quotes lawmakers dismissing speed cameras as revenue grabs or burdens. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action, so no direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists can be assessed.' Still, the votes signal disregard for proven tools that protect those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill seeks to exempt NYPD officers, even off-duty, from paying congestion pricing tolls in Manhattan’s central business district. Reinvent Albany called the measure 'contrary to notions of basic fairness' and a '$22 million handout' to a special interest. The Traffic Mobility Review Board had already rejected such exemptions. The group warned that multiple exemption bills could cost the public $100 million yearly and force higher tolls for everyone else. Neither Pheffer Amato nor Scarcella-Spanton commented.

The state-level response included a rejected proposal to raise the payroll mobility tax (PMT) on NYC businesses to fill the $15 billion gap in the MTA’s capital plan. State Sen. Liz Krueger said, 'Payroll mobility taxes are actually taxes on workers... I do not think we have an appetite for that in the Senate.' Assembly Member Stacey Pheffer Amato, who once voted for congestion pricing, now supports the pause, calling the original vote 'political blackmail.' The MTA’s future projects, including the Second Avenue Subway, are threatened, as federal matching funds require local dollars. Lawmakers remain divided. No clear alternative has emerged. Vulnerable road users are left exposed as transit funding falters.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
