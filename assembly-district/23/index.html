A BMW hit the divider, flew into oncoming traffic, and caught fire. Passengers were thrown from the car. Police said, &ldquo;No one in the doomed BMW was wearing a seat belt&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/07/noah-thompson-bmw-driver-passenger-jewel-perez-die-queens-belt-parkway-wreck/>NY Daily News</a>). A woman, 22, left behind two children. The road closed. The smoke hung over Howard Beach.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>three people died and thirteen suffered serious injuries</strong> on the streets of AD 23. <strong>561 were hurt.</strong> The numbers do not slow. They do not care about age. Children, elders, mothers, and sons. The violence is steady, unbroken.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-cars-speed-and-silence>The Pattern: Cars, Speed, and Silence</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage.</strong> In this district since 2022, they killed six, left seven with serious injuries, and hurt hundreds more. Trucks and buses killed two. Motorcycles and mopeds, none. Bikes, none. The pattern is clear. The danger is not hidden.</p><p>The Belt Parkway is not the only place. A 25-year-old died last November, speed listed as the cause (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). A 27-year-old died on Cross Bay Boulevard, ejected, speed and alcohol both named. A 73-year-old woman was killed crossing at 107th Avenue. A bus turned left. She did not make it home.</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-silence-and-the-cost-of-delay>Leadership: Votes, Silence, and the Cost of Delay</h2><p>Assembly Member Stacey Pheffer Amato voted <strong>against renewing New York City’s speed camera program</strong> in June 2025 (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>Streetsblog NYC</a>). Cameras catch speeders. Speed kills. The vote was a choice.</p><p>She also backed a bill to <strong>exempt NYPD officers from congestion pricing tolls</strong>, a move watchdogs called a &ldquo;handout&rdquo; to the powerful (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/16/watchdog-group-no-toll-exemptions-for-cops>Streetsblog NYC</a>). She called the original congestion pricing vote &ldquo;political blackmail&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/06/reporters-notebook-where-were-you-the-day-congestion-pricing-died-maybe>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>Amato did co-sponsor bills for safer street design. But when it mattered—when lives hung in the balance—she voted to weaken the tools that protect the most vulnerable.</p><h2 id=what-now-the-blood-is-still-fresh>What Now: The Blood Is Still Fresh</h2><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a policy failure. The numbers are not fate. They are the result of choices made in Albany and City Hall.</p><p><strong>Call Assembly Member Stacey Pheffer Amato. Demand she support speed cameras, lower speed limits, and real street redesign.</strong> Do not wait for another mother to die. Do not wait for another child to lose a parent. The blood is still fresh. The time is now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Senate passed the measure 38-21; three city senators—Stephen Chan, Andrew Lanza, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton—voted no. The Assembly passed it 110-31, with nine city lawmakers—Alec Brook-Krasny, Lester Chang, Simcha Eichenstein, Michael Novakhov, Stacey Pheffer Amato, Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Reilly, David Weprin, Kalman Yeger—opposing. The Streetsblog NYC article, 'Ye Shall Know Their Names! Meet the Dirty Dozen City Pols Who Voted Against Speed Camera Program,' quotes lawmakers dismissing speed cameras as revenue grabs or burdens. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action, so no direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists can be assessed.' Still, the votes signal disregard for proven tools that protect those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The police report lists the pedestrian’s action as 'Crossing With Signal,' underscoring that she had the right of way. No driver error is specified in the contributing factors, but the narrative and sequence of events center the danger of turning vehicles at intersections where pedestrians are present.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill seeks to exempt NYPD officers, even off-duty, from paying congestion pricing tolls in Manhattan’s central business district. Reinvent Albany called the measure 'contrary to notions of basic fairness' and a '$22 million handout' to a special interest. The Traffic Mobility Review Board had already rejected such exemptions. The group warned that multiple exemption bills could cost the public $100 million yearly and force higher tolls for everyone else. Neither Pheffer Amato nor Scarcella-Spanton commented.

The state-level response included a rejected proposal to raise the payroll mobility tax (PMT) on NYC businesses to fill the $15 billion gap in the MTA’s capital plan. State Sen. Liz Krueger said, 'Payroll mobility taxes are actually taxes on workers... I do not think we have an appetite for that in the Senate.' Assembly Member Stacey Pheffer Amato, who once voted for congestion pricing, now supports the pause, calling the original vote 'political blackmail.' The MTA’s future projects, including the Second Avenue Subway, are threatened, as federal matching funds require local dollars. Lawmakers remain divided. No clear alternative has emerged.
