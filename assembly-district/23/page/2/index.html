On July 5, a BMW lost control near Cross Bay Boulevard, struck a divider, went airborne, and slammed into oncoming traffic. Flames followed. Jewel Perez, 22, and Noah Thompson, 24, died after being thrown from the car. Three others were injured.

According to the police report, the crash occurred during a police pursuit. The report states the driver was 'Backing Unsafely' and did not possess a valid license. The pedestrian was not in a crosswalk at the time, but the report does not list any pedestrian behavior as a contributing factor. The narrative describes the scene: 'A fleeing Honda reversed into a man, not at a crosswalk. His leg was crushed under steel. He stayed conscious. The driver had no license.
