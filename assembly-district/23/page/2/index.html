A 73-year-old woman, crossing at 107th Avenue, hit by a bus making a left turn. A young man, 27, ejected from his sedan on Cross Bay Boulevard, dead before the ambulance arrived. In the last twelve months, 2 people died and 13 suffered serious injuries on the streets of Assembly District 23. 573 were hurt. The numbers do not rest. They do not heal. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p>Children, the old, the ones on foot or bike. In the past year, 54 people under 18 were injured. Cyclists and pedestrians are not shielded by steel. They are left with broken bodies, or worse. Cars and SUVs do most of the killing. Trucks and buses add to the count. The road does not care who you are. It only remembers the impact.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h2><p>Assembly Member Stacey Pheffer Amato has signed on to <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">bills that would force safer street design</a> for all users. She <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1280&amp;term=2023">voted yes to bring speed cameras to school zones</a> in Schenectady. But when the fight came for congestion pricing—money for transit, fewer cars, safer streets—she <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/06/reporters-notebook-where-were-you-the-day-congestion-pricing-died-maybe>called her own vote &ldquo;political blackmail&rdquo;</a> and backed the pause. She also <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/16/watchdog-group-no-toll-exemptions-for-cops>pushed for a bill to give NYPD officers a free pass on congestion tolls</a>, a move watchdogs called a giveaway to the powerful at the expense of everyone else. The record is mixed. The streets are not.</p><h2 id=what-next-the-work-is-not-done>What Next? The Work Is Not Done</h2><p>Every day without change is another day of blood on the asphalt. Call Assembly Member Pheffer Amato. Demand she fight for lower speed limits, more speed cameras, and real street redesigns that protect people, not just cars. Join with others. Make your voice impossible to ignore. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
