She remained conscious as she was trapped by the wreckage. The police report states that both drivers were licensed and that the blinding sun played a direct role in the collision.

The state-level response included a rejected proposal to raise the payroll mobility tax (PMT) on NYC businesses to fill the $15 billion gap in the MTA’s capital plan. State Sen. Liz Krueger said, 'Payroll mobility taxes are actually taxes on workers... I do not think we have an appetite for that in the Senate.' Assembly Member Stacey Pheffer Amato, who once voted for congestion pricing, now supports the pause, calling the original vote 'political blackmail.' The MTA’s future projects, including the Second Avenue Subway, are threatened, as federal matching funds require local dollars. Lawmakers remain divided. No clear alternative has emerged. Vulnerable road users are left exposed as transit funding falters.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The sedan’s left front bumper delivered the blow, and the vehicle sustained no damage. The report notes the driver continued on, leaving the injured man in the roadway. No contributing factors related to the pedestrian’s behavior were listed in the police report. The focus remains on the driver’s aggression and the systemic risk it poses to people on foot.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the crash occurred during a police pursuit. The report states the driver was 'Backing Unsafely' and did not possess a valid license. The pedestrian was not in a crosswalk at the time, but the report does not list any pedestrian behavior as a contributing factor. The narrative describes the scene: 'A fleeing Honda reversed into a man, not at a crosswalk. His leg was crushed under steel. He stayed conscious. The driver had no license. The streetlights flickered. Sirens followed.' The focus remains on the driver’s unlawful actions—operating without a license and reversing unsafely while fleeing police—which directly led to the pedestrian’s injuries.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
