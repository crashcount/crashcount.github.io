Seventy-five have suffered serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, four lives were lost, and over a thousand were injured. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, elders, children. On February 11, an 83-year-old woman was killed crossing with the signal at Avenue of the Americas and West 58th Street. She died from internal injuries after an SUV making a left turn struck her. She had the light. She did not stand a chance. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p><strong>Just weeks ago, a box truck killed a man in Hell&rsquo;s Kitchen.</strong> Days later, a van crashed in Midtown, and firefighters found it packed with 76 propane tanks.

The ramp is a known bottleneck. The city promises to fix it by 2032. The pain is now.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h3><p>Assembly Member Tony Simone has taken some steps. He voted yes to extend school speed zones, a move that protects children near schools. He co-sponsored bills to require speed limiters for repeat offenders and to hold vehicle owners liable for dangerous driving. He stood up for congestion pricing, which can cut traffic and save lives. But he also backed bills that would weaken speed camera enforcement. The fight is not over.</p><h3 id=the-next-move-is-ours>The Next Move Is Ours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. These deaths are not accidents.</strong> Every crash is a policy failure. Every delay is a choice. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has the tools to stop repeat offenders. It can redesign streets for people, not cars. But it will not act unless we force it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call Assembly Member Simone. Demand safer speeds, stronger enforcement, and streets built for life, not death.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The truck, registered in Ohio and operated by a licensed driver from Louisiana, was supposed to be stationary but instead moved forward, causing fatal impact. No contributing factors related to the victim's behavior are cited in the report.

Hoylman-Sigal said, 'This is about the economic engine for the entire region.' Assembly Member Tony Simone and others demanded investment in transportation deserts and accessible stations. Advocates cited the MTA’s ADA settlement, noting only a quarter of stations are wheelchair-accessible, with the fewest in low-income areas.

The vehicle struck a 61-year-old woman who was crossing with the signal. The report states, 'The bumper struck her. She lay crushed and semiconscious, her body broken across the pavement.' The pedestrian suffered crush injuries to her entire body and was left semiconscious at the scene. The police report notes the woman was crossing with the signal, and no contributing factors were attributed to her actions. The report lists the contributing factor for the driver as 'Unspecified,' but the narrative makes clear the SUV 'drove south, straight through the light,' highlighting a failure to obey the traffic signal. The impact and resulting injuries underscore the lethal consequences when drivers disregard traffic controls at intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
