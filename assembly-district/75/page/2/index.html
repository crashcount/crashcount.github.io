Twenty-seven left with injuries that do not heal. In the last year, AD 75 saw 1,612 crashes. The numbers are cold, but the facts are colder. A man struck by a box truck at West 40th and 9th. An 83-year-old woman killed by an SUV turning left at 58th and Sixth. A 34-year-old man, dead at the intersection of 36th and 7th, hit by an SUV. Each one a life ended or broken. Each one a family left with a hole that will not close. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price. In the last twelve months, 853 people were hurt. Trucks, SUVs, taxis, bikes—they all left bodies behind. The sidewalk is not safe. The crosswalk is not safe. The numbers do not lie.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Assembly Member Tony Simone has taken steps. He co-sponsored bills to put speed limiters on state vehicles, to require safer street design, and to hold car owners accountable for repeat offenses. He backed higher fines for speed camera violations and supported automated bike lane enforcement. But not every move helps the most vulnerable. Simone also co-sponsored a bill that would raise the speed threshold for camera enforcement, making it easier for drivers to speed without consequence. <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A6225&amp;term=2025">A 6225</a></p><p>He stood with advocates for pedestrian plazas, like Plaza33 by Penn Station, giving people a place where cars cannot reach them. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/27/33rd-street-by-penn-station-completes-decad-long-transformation-into-plaza33>Plaza33</a> But the work is not done. The street is still a killing field.</p><h3 id=the-system-grinds-on>The System Grinds On</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. The state passes laws. Still, the trucks roll. The taxis jump the curb. The old and the young end up in the hospital or the morgue. &ldquo;The vast majority of commuters in Midtown are traveling by transit and they deserve world-class, fast, and reliable buses&mldr; far fewer New Yorkers are getting hurt in crashes,&rdquo; said <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/dot-proposes-transforming-34th-st-into-mostly-car-free-busway-much-like-14th-st-AY4607640>DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>, pushing for a car-free 34th Street.</p><p>But the numbers in AD 75 do not show an end. They show a crisis that does not stop.</p><p><strong>Call to Action:</strong></p><p><strong>Contact Tony Simone. Demand he fight for lower speed limits, stronger enforcement, and streets where people come first.</strong> Join with others. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill adds pets to protected victims in traffic law. It hikes fines for drivers who hit animals and flee. Lawmakers push for real consequences when cars strike dogs, cats, and other companions.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0723-2025 sits in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced January 23, 2025, it urges the state to pass A10660/S9915, the Protecting Animals Walking on the Street (PAWS) Act. The resolution states: 'add the term companion animals to the list of possible victim classes should a driver fail to exercise due care to avoid striking pedestrians and to increase the fine for striking a pet with a vehicle and leaving the scene without reporting the incident.' Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary sponsor), Lynn C. Schulman, Carlina Rivera, and Justin L. Brannan back the measure. The PAWS Act would raise fines for drivers who hit pets and leave, and would recognize companion animals as protected victims under traffic law. The move targets a gap in current law, where penalties for striking animals are minor—on par with an illegal U-turn. The Council’s action signals a push for stronger accountability when vehicles harm the city’s most vulnerable, including its animals.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report describes the aftermath in stark terms: 'Her face split open on the steel. Blood pooled on the pavement. The car never moved. She did, and then didn’t.'
