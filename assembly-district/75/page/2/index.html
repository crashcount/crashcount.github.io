On a winter night, an 83‑year‑old woman crossed with the signal at Sixth Avenue. A northbound SUV turned left. She died there. The record calls it a <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>left‑turn strike at 6th and 58th</a>. The file number is 4792095.</p><p>Three months later, a box truck moved south on Ninth at West 40th. A 39‑year‑old man was in the roadway, not at an intersection. He suffered crush injuries. The city file says &ldquo;apparent death.&rdquo; The place was <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>9th and 40th</a>. The number is 4803350.</p><p>A year before, near the same corridor, a 29‑year‑old woman was killed at West 58th and Ninth. Another pedestrian, struck and crushed. The city’s ledger lists it as <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4735641</a>.</p><p>These are not outliers. They are the map.</p><h3 id=where-the-street-breaks>Where the street breaks</h3><p>The district’s worst injuries cluster on long, wide blocks. Sixth Avenue. Eighth Avenue. West 42nd Street. The city’s list puts <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Avenue of the Americas</a> at the top with a death and 107 injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Eighth Avenue</a> shows two deaths and 77 injuries. West 42nd has 83 more.</p><p>Day turns to night and the harm keeps coming. The worst hours stack up at noon, early evening, and late night. At 12 p.m., there were 2 deaths and 166 injuries. At 5 p.m., 1 death and 187 injuries. At 10 p.m., 4 deaths and 146 injuries. The city’s clock does not sleep. It only counts.</p><p>Pedestrians take the brunt: <strong>10 dead, 968 injured</strong> since 2022 here. Cyclists count next: <strong>2 dead, 766 injured</strong>. Heavy vehicles add weight — trucks and buses are tied to fatal pedestrian crashes and dozens of serious injuries in this area’s rollup. The numbers come from the city open files for this district’s span.</p><h3 id=ramps-buses-and-a-hard-stop>Ramps, buses, and a hard stop</h3><p>At the Port Authority ramps by Dyer and West 39th, one bus ran into another. FDNY said they saw “musculoskeletal injuries, neck pain, back pain.” That day, at least 30 were hurt and 27 went to hospitals. The ramp jammed. The rear bus, the video showed, “zooming up the ramp and ramming the rear of the bus in front of it so hard that it physically pushed the bus forward.” Those are the words reported by <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/multiple-injuries-2-buses-crash-ramp-port-authority-nyc/17274379/>ABC7</a>. “One bus made contact with the rear of the other bus,” FDNY EMS said in an earlier incident at the same terminal, adding they needed tools for extrication and had to drive the wrong way up a ramp to reach patients. That’s from <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/2-buses-collide-port-authority-shutting-down-14-injured/16916303/>ABC7’s earlier report</a>.</p><p>A few blocks west, a van crashed at 42nd and 10th. Firefighters found 76 propane cylinders and fuel canisters in the back. The driver was charged with reckless endangerment and cited under fire code, according to <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/nyc-van-propane-gas-tanks/>CBS New York</a>. Hazard rolls on four wheels, right through Midtown.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-in-plain-sight>The pattern in plain sight</h3><p>The city’s own breakdown lists “other” factors as the big bucket. It still names the killers we know: inattention, failure to yield, left turns, and trucks mixing with people. On this ground, pedestrians die most. The worst hours pile up around lunch, the commute, and late night. The worst corridors are wide and fast.</p><p>This is Midtown. It is also a worksite. People walk, bike, and wait by the curb. Trucks turn. Buses surge on tight ramps. A bad turn and a person is gone.</p><h3 id=fix-the-corners-slow-the-turns-cut-the-speed>Fix the corners. Slow the turns. Cut the speed.</h3><p>Start with the hot blocks — Sixth Avenue, Eighth Avenue, West 42nd. Daylight the corners. Give walkers a head start with leading intervals. Harden left turns where drivers sweep across the crosswalks. On Ninth and the Port ramps, set stricter truck and bus turns and slow approaches.</p><p>Target the peak hours when the bodies pile up — noon, the commute, and late night. Enforce failure‑to‑yield at the crosswalk. Keep trucks out of the left‑turn lanes at the worst junctions.</p><p>Then do what saves the most lives everywhere: <strong>lower the default speed</strong> and <strong>rein in repeat speeders</strong>. Albany already extended protections around school zones this year — lawmakers moved to “extend provisions and make technical corrections to school speed zones in NYC,” and Assembly Member Tony Simone voted yes, per the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>state record</a>. There is a pending Assembly bill to expand camera enforcement against obscured plates and keep school‑zone cameras running, which Simone co‑sponsors, noted in <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">A 7997</a>. And there is a push to force the worst offenders to slow down with intelligent speed assistance; Simone has backed versions of that idea, as noted in <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">A 7979</a>.</p><p>Citywide, it’s simple. Fewer people die when cars go slower and chronic speeders are stopped from speeding.

The rally targeted Governor Hochul’s $252 billion budget, which omits $33 billion needed for transit upgrades. The event, covered by amny.com, highlighted the matter: 'NYC transit advocates urge Hochul to fully fund MTA Capital Plan with guaranteed state budget revenue.' Hoylman-Sigal said, 'This is about the economic engine for the entire region.' Assembly Member Tony Simone and others demanded investment in transportation deserts and accessible stations. Advocates cited the MTA’s ADA settlement, noting only a quarter of stations are wheelchair-accessible, with the fewest in low-income areas.
