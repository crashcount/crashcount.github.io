On a winter night, an 83‑year‑old woman crossed with the signal at Sixth Avenue. A northbound SUV turned left. She died there. The record calls it a <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>left‑turn strike at 6th and 58th</a>. The file number is 4792095.</p><p>Three months later, a box truck moved south on Ninth at West 40th. A 39‑year‑old man was in the roadway, not at an intersection. He suffered crush injuries. The city file says &ldquo;apparent death.&rdquo; The place was <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>9th and 40th</a>. The number is 4803350.</p><p>A year before, near the same corridor, a 29‑year‑old woman was killed at West 58th and Ninth. Another pedestrian, struck and crushed. The city’s ledger lists it as <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4735641</a>.</p><p>These are not outliers. They are the map.</p><h3 id=where-the-street-breaks>Where the street breaks</h3><p>The district’s worst injuries cluster on long, wide blocks. Sixth Avenue. Eighth Avenue. West 42nd Street. The city’s list puts <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Avenue of the Americas</a> at the top with a death and 107 injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Eighth Avenue</a> shows two deaths and 77 injuries. West 42nd has 83 more.</p><p>Day turns to night and the harm keeps coming. The worst hours stack up at noon, early evening, and late night. At 12 p.m., there were 2 deaths and 166 injuries. At 5 p.m., 1 death and 187 injuries. At 10 p.m., 4 deaths and 146 injuries. The city’s clock does not sleep. It only counts.</p><p>Pedestrians take the brunt: <strong>10 dead, 968 injured</strong> since 2022 here. Cyclists count next: <strong>2 dead, 766 injured</strong>. Heavy vehicles add weight — trucks and buses are tied to fatal pedestrian crashes and dozens of serious injuries in this area’s rollup. The numbers come from the city open files for this district’s span.</p><h3 id=ramps-buses-and-a-hard-stop>Ramps, buses, and a hard stop</h3><p>At the Port Authority ramps by Dyer and West 39th, one bus ran into another. FDNY said they saw “musculoskeletal injuries, neck pain, back pain.” That day, at least 30 were hurt and 27 went to hospitals. The ramp jammed. The rear bus, the video showed, “zooming up the ramp and ramming the rear of the bus in front of it so hard that it physically pushed the bus forward.” Those are the words reported by <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/multiple-injuries-2-buses-crash-ramp-port-authority-nyc/17274379/>ABC7</a>. “One bus made contact with the rear of the other bus,” FDNY EMS said in an earlier incident at the same terminal, adding they needed tools for extrication and had to drive the wrong way up a ramp to reach patients. That’s from <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/2-buses-collide-port-authority-shutting-down-14-injured/16916303/>ABC7’s earlier report</a>.</p><p>A few blocks west, a van crashed at 42nd and 10th. Firefighters found 76 propane cylinders and fuel canisters in the back. The driver was charged with reckless endangerment and cited under fire code, according to <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/nyc-van-propane-gas-tanks/>CBS New York</a>. Hazard rolls on four wheels, right through Midtown.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-in-plain-sight>The pattern in plain sight</h3><p>The city’s own breakdown lists “other” factors as the big bucket. It still names the killers we know: inattention, failure to yield, left turns, and trucks mixing with people. On this ground, pedestrians die most. The worst hours pile up around lunch, the commute, and late night. The worst corridors are wide and fast.</p><p>This is Midtown. It is also a worksite. People walk, bike, and wait by the curb. Trucks turn. Buses surge on tight ramps. A bad turn and a person is gone.</p><h3 id=fix-the-corners-slow-the-turns-cut-the-speed>Fix the corners. Slow the turns. Cut the speed.</h3><p>Start with the hot blocks — Sixth Avenue, Eighth Avenue, West 42nd. Daylight the corners. Give walkers a head start with leading intervals. Harden left turns where drivers sweep across the crosswalks. On Ninth and the Port ramps, set stricter truck and bus turns and slow approaches.</p><p>Target the peak hours when the bodies pile up — noon, the commute, and late night. Enforce failure‑to‑yield at the crosswalk. Keep trucks out of the left‑turn lanes at the worst junctions.</p><p>Then do what saves the most lives everywhere: <strong>lower the default speed</strong> and <strong>rein in repeat speeders</strong>. Albany already extended protections around school zones this year — lawmakers moved to “extend provisions and make technical corrections to school speed zones in NYC,” and Assembly Member Tony Simone voted yes, per the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>state record</a>. There is a pending Assembly bill to expand camera enforcement against obscured plates and keep school‑zone cameras running, which Simone co‑sponsors, noted in <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">A 7997</a>. And there is a push to force the worst offenders to slow down with intelligent speed assistance; Simone has backed versions of that idea, as noted in <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">A 7979</a>.</p><p>Citywide, it’s simple. Fewer people die when cars go slower and chronic speeders are stopped from speeding. If you want that in front of your door on Sixth or Eighth, you have to demand it.</p><h3 id=voices-from-the-scene>Voices from the scene</h3><p>“A lot of them with musculoskeletal injuries, neck pain, back pain,” FDNY Deputy Assistant Chief Joseph Pataky said after the July bus crash at the Port ramps, per <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/multiple-injuries-2-buses-crash-ramp-port-authority-nyc/17274379/>ABC7</a>.</p><p>“One bus made contact with the rear of the other bus,” FDNY EMS Deputy Chief Jason Saffon said at a prior crash in the terminal. “It required some extrication,” and crews had to route ambulances up the ramp against traffic to reach patients, per <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/2-buses-collide-port-authority-shutting-down-14-injured/16916303/>ABC7</a>.</p><h3 id=the-ledger-not-the-lullaby>The ledger, not the lullaby</h3><p>In the last 12 months, this district saw 4 deaths and 1,081 injuries across 2,069 crashes. Year‑to‑date, crashes are up about 26% over last year, and injuries are up about 30%. The people most hurt are those on foot and on bikes. The worst blocks keep their rank. The same hours keep ringing the bell.</p><p>The files do not cry. They list the names, the ages, the corners. They say when the heart stopped. The rest is on us.</p><p>Take one step that matters. Ask City Hall and Albany to cut speeds and stop repeat speeders. Start here: <a href=/take_action/>take action</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter, titled 'Hochul will defy Trump deadline to stop NYC congestion pricing — but insists president still backs her Penn Station revamp plan,' centers on Governor Hochul’s refusal to halt congestion pricing despite federal pressure. Simone, representing the Penn Station area, voiced support for both congestion pricing and a bold Penn Station overhaul, saying, 'It’s time to build a big bold Penn Station. I’m glad that she’s talking to the president about it.' He opposed linking the two projects, stating, 'I don’t think they should be connected.' Simone also welcomed Hochul’s resistance to Amtrak’s expansion plans that would raze neighborhoods.
