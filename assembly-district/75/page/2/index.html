Eight hundred thirty-eight people were hurt. A woman, 83, was killed crossing with the signal at Avenue of the Americas and 58th. A 34-year-old man died at 7th and 36th, struck by an SUV. The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie.</p><h3 id=the-crashes-keep-coming>The Crashes Keep Coming</h3><p>Just last week, a car fire in the Lincoln Tunnel sent one commuter to the hospital and left five more shaken. Traffic froze for an hour. The tunnel filled with smoke and fear. &ldquo;One commuter was taken to Mount Sinai West to be treated for injuries. The extent of the victim&rsquo;s injuries was unclear,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/08/us-news/lincoln-tunnel-closed-for-an-hour-in-rush-hour-nightmare-as-car-fire-snarls-traffic/>said the FDNY</a>.</p><p>On July 2, two buses collided at Port Authority. Fourteen people were hurt. Rescue crews had to fight their way through jammed traffic to reach the trapped. &ldquo;We initially had some difficulty getting up the ramp, because it backed traffic up behind it,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/2-buses-collide-port-authority-shutting-down-14-injured/16916303/>said Deputy Chief Jason Saffon</a>. The city moves, but not always forward.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Assembly Member Tony Simone has signed his name to bills that could slow the carnage. He co-sponsored measures for speed limiters on repeat offenders, higher speed camera fines, and safer street design. He stood at the ribbon-cutting for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/27/33rd-street-by-penn-station-completes-decad-long-transformation-into-plaza33>Plaza33</a>, a block turned over to people, not cars. But the blood on the pavement says more is needed.</p><p>The most dangerous drivers still roam free. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so. Cameras catch speeders, but the worst repeat offenders keep driving. The laws are not enough. The enforcement is not enough. The deaths do not stop.</p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower the speed limit. Tell them to stop the super speeders. Tell them to build streets for people, not for cars. The next name on the list could be someone you love. Do not wait.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The rally targeted Governor Hochul’s $252 billion budget, which omits $33 billion needed for transit upgrades. The event, covered by amny.com, highlighted the matter: 'NYC transit advocates urge Hochul to fully fund MTA Capital Plan with guaranteed state budget revenue.' Hoylman-Sigal said, 'This is about the economic engine for the entire region.' Assembly Member Tony Simone and others demanded investment in transportation deserts and accessible stations. Advocates cited the MTA’s ADA settlement, noting only a quarter of stations are wheelchair-accessible, with the fewest in low-income areas. The rally underscored that without full funding, vulnerable riders—especially those with disabilities—face continued barriers and danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill adds pets to protected victims in traffic law. It hikes fines for drivers who hit animals and flee. Lawmakers push for real consequences when cars strike dogs, cats, and other companions.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0723-2025 sits in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced January 23, 2025, it urges the state to pass A10660/S9915, the Protecting Animals Walking on the Street (PAWS) Act. The resolution states: 'add the term companion animals to the list of possible victim classes should a driver fail to exercise due care to avoid striking pedestrians and to increase the fine for striking a pet with a vehicle and leaving the scene without reporting the incident.' Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary sponsor), Lynn C. Schulman, Carlina Rivera, and Justin L. Brannan back the measure. The PAWS Act would raise fines for drivers who hit pets and leave, and would recognize companion animals as protected victims under traffic law. The move targets a gap in current law, where penalties for striking animals are minor—on par with an illegal U-turn. The Council’s action signals a push for stronger accountability when vehicles harm the city’s most vulnerable, including its animals.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
