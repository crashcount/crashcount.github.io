Eight hundred thirty-eight people were hurt. A woman, 83, was killed crossing with the signal at Avenue of the Americas and 58th. A 34-year-old man died at 7th and 36th, struck by an SUV. The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie.</p><h3 id=the-crashes-keep-coming>The Crashes Keep Coming</h3><p>Just last week, a car fire in the Lincoln Tunnel sent one commuter to the hospital and left five more shaken. Traffic froze for an hour. The tunnel filled with smoke and fear. &ldquo;One commuter was taken to Mount Sinai West to be treated for injuries. The extent of the victim&rsquo;s injuries was unclear,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/08/us-news/lincoln-tunnel-closed-for-an-hour-in-rush-hour-nightmare-as-car-fire-snarls-traffic/>said the FDNY</a>.</p><p>On July 2, two buses collided at Port Authority. Fourteen people were hurt. Rescue crews had to fight their way through jammed traffic to reach the trapped. &ldquo;We initially had some difficulty getting up the ramp, because it backed traffic up behind it,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/2-buses-collide-port-authority-shutting-down-14-injured/16916303/>said Deputy Chief Jason Saffon</a>. The city moves, but not always forward.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Assembly Member Tony Simone has signed his name to bills that could slow the carnage. He co-sponsored measures for speed limiters on repeat offenders, higher speed camera fines, and safer street design. He stood at the ribbon-cutting for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/27/33rd-street-by-penn-station-completes-decad-long-transformation-into-plaza33>Plaza33</a>, a block turned over to people, not cars. But the blood on the pavement says more is needed.</p><p>The most dangerous drivers still roam free. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so. Cameras catch speeders, but the worst repeat offenders keep driving. The laws are not enough. The enforcement is not enough. The deaths do not stop.</p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower the speed limit. Tell them to stop the super speeders. Tell them to build streets for people, not for cars. The next name on the list could be someone you love. Do not wait.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The campaign, titled 'Slow Your Roll, Respect The Stroll,' urges cyclists to stop at red lights and avoid sidewalks, but Bottcher stressed, 'the vast majority of deaths and injuries are caused by cars.' Bottcher and Hoylman-Sigal both called out reckless drivers as the real threat. Assembly Member Tony Simone joined, pushing for statewide laws to curb dangerous delivery app practices. Ligia Guallpa of the Workers Justice Project highlighted how apps force delivery workers into risky behavior, but noted that new minimum pay rates help slow things down. The campaign focuses on education, not punishment, and centers the voices of workers and vulnerable road users.

The bill sits in the Assembly, awaiting committee action. Its summary reads: 'Requires the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices if a driver accumulates eleven or more points on their driving record during an eighteen month period, or receives 6 speed camera or red light camera tickets during a twelve month period.' The primary sponsor is Emily Gallagher (District 50), joined by co-sponsors Rebecca Seawright, Andrew Hevesi, Tony Simone, Jo Anne Simon, Patricia Fahy, Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, MaryJane Shimsky, Yudelka Tapia, Steven Raga, Anna Kelles, Robert C. Carroll, and Sarahana Shrestha. The bill cracks down on repeat offenders, forcing them to install technology that blocks speeding. No safety analyst note is available, but the bill’s intent is clear: rein in drivers who endanger others again and again.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
