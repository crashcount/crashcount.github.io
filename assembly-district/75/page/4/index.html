Seventy-five have suffered serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, four lives were lost, and over a thousand were injured. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, elders, children. On February 11, an 83-year-old woman was killed crossing with the signal at Avenue of the Americas and West 58th Street. She died from internal injuries after an SUV making a left turn struck her. She had the light. She did not stand a chance. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p><strong>Just weeks ago, a box truck killed a man in Hell&rsquo;s Kitchen.</strong> Days later, a van crashed in Midtown, and firefighters found it packed with 76 propane tanks.

The ramp is a known bottleneck. The city promises to fix it by 2032. The pain is now.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h3><p>Assembly Member Tony Simone has taken some steps. He voted yes to extend school speed zones, a move that protects children near schools. He co-sponsored bills to require speed limiters for repeat offenders and to hold vehicle owners liable for dangerous driving. He stood up for congestion pricing, which can cut traffic and save lives. But he also backed bills that would weaken speed camera enforcement. The fight is not over.</p><h3 id=the-next-move-is-ours>The Next Move Is Ours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. These deaths are not accidents.</strong> Every crash is a policy failure. Every delay is a choice. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has the tools to stop repeat offenders. It can redesign streets for people, not cars. But it will not act unless we force it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call Assembly Member Simone. Demand safer speeds, stronger enforcement, and streets built for life, not death.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Bottcher and Hoylman-Sigal both called out reckless drivers as the real threat. Assembly Member Tony Simone joined, pushing for statewide laws to curb dangerous delivery app practices. Ligia Guallpa of the Workers Justice Project highlighted how apps force delivery workers into risky behavior, but noted that new minimum pay rates help slow things down. The campaign focuses on education, not punishment, and centers the voices of workers and vulnerable road users.
