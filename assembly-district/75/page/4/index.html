Twenty-seven left with injuries that do not heal. In the last year, AD 75 saw 1,612 crashes. The numbers are cold, but the facts are colder. A man struck by a box truck at West 40th and 9th. An 83-year-old woman killed by an SUV turning left at 58th and Sixth. A 34-year-old man, dead at the intersection of 36th and 7th, hit by an SUV. Each one a life ended or broken. Each one a family left with a hole that will not close. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price. In the last twelve months, 853 people were hurt. Trucks, SUVs, taxis, bikes—they all left bodies behind. The sidewalk is not safe. The crosswalk is not safe. The numbers do not lie.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Assembly Member Tony Simone has taken steps. He co-sponsored bills to put speed limiters on state vehicles, to require safer street design, and to hold car owners accountable for repeat offenses. He backed higher fines for speed camera violations and supported automated bike lane enforcement. But not every move helps the most vulnerable. Simone also co-sponsored a bill that would raise the speed threshold for camera enforcement, making it easier for drivers to speed without consequence. <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A6225&amp;term=2025">A 6225</a></p><p>He stood with advocates for pedestrian plazas, like Plaza33 by Penn Station, giving people a place where cars cannot reach them. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/27/33rd-street-by-penn-station-completes-decad-long-transformation-into-plaza33>Plaza33</a> But the work is not done. The street is still a killing field.</p><h3 id=the-system-grinds-on>The System Grinds On</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. The state passes laws. Still, the trucks roll. The taxis jump the curb. The old and the young end up in the hospital or the morgue. &ldquo;The vast majority of commuters in Midtown are traveling by transit and they deserve world-class, fast, and reliable buses&mldr; far fewer New Yorkers are getting hurt in crashes,&rdquo; said <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/dot-proposes-transforming-34th-st-into-mostly-car-free-busway-much-like-14th-st-AY4607640>DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>, pushing for a car-free 34th Street.</p><p>But the numbers in AD 75 do not show an end. They show a crisis that does not stop.</p><p><strong>Call to Action:</strong></p><p><strong>Contact Tony Simone.

The SUV was stationary at the time, with no damage reported. The injured rider suffered severe head bleeding but remained conscious. The police report notes the use of a helmet by the rider.

The primary sponsor is Emily Gallagher (District 50), joined by co-sponsors Rebecca Seawright, Andrew Hevesi, Tony Simone, Jo Anne Simon, Patricia Fahy, Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, MaryJane Shimsky, Yudelka Tapia, Steven Raga, Anna Kelles, Robert C.
