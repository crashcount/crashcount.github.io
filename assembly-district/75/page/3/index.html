Twenty-seven left with injuries that do not heal. In the last year, AD 75 saw 1,612 crashes. The numbers are cold, but the facts are colder. A man struck by a box truck at West 40th and 9th. An 83-year-old woman killed by an SUV turning left at 58th and Sixth. A 34-year-old man, dead at the intersection of 36th and 7th, hit by an SUV. Each one a life ended or broken. Each one a family left with a hole that will not close. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price.

The numbers do not lie.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Assembly Member Tony Simone has taken steps. He co-sponsored bills to put speed limiters on state vehicles, to require safer street design, and to hold car owners accountable for repeat offenses. He backed higher fines for speed camera violations and supported automated bike lane enforcement. But not every move helps the most vulnerable. Simone also co-sponsored a bill that would raise the speed threshold for camera enforcement, making it easier for drivers to speed without consequence. <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A6225&amp;term=2025">A 6225</a></p><p>He stood with advocates for pedestrian plazas, like Plaza33 by Penn Station, giving people a place where cars cannot reach them. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/27/33rd-street-by-penn-station-completes-decad-long-transformation-into-plaza33>Plaza33</a> But the work is not done.

Once a car-choked block, now a pedestrian haven. Trees, tables, and open space replace exhaust and noise. Years of work. A new chapter for Midtown. People walk, sit, and breathe. Cars banished. Safety reclaimed.</p><p class=mb3>On June 27, 2024, city officials and civic leaders marked the completion of Plaza33, a pedestrian plaza on 33rd Street by Penn Station. The event capped years of transformation, turning a block once 'full of cars and trucks' into a car-free space. Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine, Assembly Member Tony Simone, and Council Member Erik Bottcher attended the ribbon-cutting. Levine recalled, 'I remember the battle over transforming this space and all the people who said that it would clog up traffic all over Midtown if we turned this street over to people and here we are and it's gorgeous.' Vornado Realty Trust funded the $65-million project with the Department of Transportation. The plaza, now permanent, offers 16,000 square feet for pedestrians, with trees, seating, and public programming. The change removes cars from a busy Midtown block, giving vulnerable road users safe, open ground.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states her body was crushed and she died at the scene, 29 years old, alone in the dark. The vehicle's point of impact was the center front end, and the car was traveling straight ahead. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified' for both the driver and the pedestrian. No information is provided about the vehicle type or the driver. The victim's actions are described as 'Other Actions in Roadway,' but the report does not cite any pedestrian behavior as a contributing factor.

No replacement for the lost $1 billion. Transit riders and street users face uncertainty. Lawmakers call the move reckless. The city waits. Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2024, the New York State legislative session ended without passing a replacement funding plan for the MTA after Governor Kathy Hochul paused congestion pricing. The matter, described as 'Albany pumps the brakes on MTA funding plan in rebuke of Hochul’s move to ditch congestion pricing,' left the MTA without the $1 billion annual revenue congestion pricing would have provided. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins announced the session’s close without a deal. Lawmakers including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris, State Sen. John Liu, Assemblyman Harvey Epstein, and Assemblyman Tony Simone criticized the governor’s decision and the proposed IOU bailout. Gounardes said, 'I cannot in good conscience ratify a decision that will eliminate a significant, dedicated revenue source for the MTA’s capital plan.' The pause leaves the city’s transit future—and the safety of those who rely on it—uncertain.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The policy reversal, covered by Gothamist, sparked outrage among transit advocates and progressives. Hochul claimed, 'We need to make sure our solutions work for everyone, especially those who are struggling to make ends meet.' Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani condemned the move as 'political malpractice.' Jessica Scarcella-Spanton, District 23, was mentioned in coverage but did not take a direct action.

The report cites 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as contributing factors, both attributed to driver error. The sedan was undamaged, while the cyclist lay half-thrown beside his frame. The police report notes the cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this detail follows the primary driver errors. The crash underscores the lethal consequences when drivers disregard traffic controls and fail to yield to vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The narrative states, 'A moped struck a parked SUV. The rider, 29, hit headfirst. Blood seeped from his helmet. He stayed conscious.' The report lists 'Reaction to Uninvolved Vehicle' as a contributing factor, indicating the moped rider responded to another vehicle's actions before the crash. The SUV was stationary at the time, with no damage reported. The injured rider suffered severe head bleeding but remained conscious. The police report notes the use of a helmet by the rider.

Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assembly Member Tony Simone, aims to remind cyclists to stop at red lights and avoid sidewalks. Bottcher’s district saw 2,215 crashes last year, injuring 267 pedestrians and 218 cyclists; three of five fatalities were pedestrians killed by drivers. Bottcher said, 'the vast majority of deaths and injuries are caused by cars.' Simone highlighted delivery app pressure on workers to break laws. Ligia Guallpa of the Workers Justice Project noted delivery workers face daily risks and exploitation. The campaign, first in English and Spanish, will expand citywide. The focus remains: cars are the real threat, but all street users must be considered.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The campaign, titled 'Slow Your Roll, Respect The Stroll,' urges cyclists to stop at red lights and avoid sidewalks, but Bottcher stressed, 'the vast majority of deaths and injuries are caused by cars.' Bottcher and Hoylman-Sigal both called out reckless drivers as the real threat. Assembly Member Tony Simone joined, pushing for statewide laws to curb dangerous delivery app practices. Ligia Guallpa of the Workers Justice Project highlighted how apps force delivery workers into risky behavior, but noted that new minimum pay rates help slow things down. The campaign focuses on education, not punishment, and centers the voices of workers and vulnerable road users. No direct safety impact assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
