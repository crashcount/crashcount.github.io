Thirty people were hurt. The FDNY called it &ldquo;a lot of them with musculoskeletal injuries, neck pain, back pain&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/multiple-injuries-2-buses-crash-ramp-port-authority-nyc/17274379/>ABC7 report</a>). It was the second bus crash at the terminal this month. The ramp is a bottleneck. The city says it will be replaced by 2032. That is seven years and hundreds of injuries away.</p><p>In the past twelve months, four people died and over a thousand were injured in crashes in AD 75. Twenty-five were seriously hurt. The dead include an 83-year-old woman crossing with the signal, a 34-year-old man struck at an intersection, and a 29-year-old woman crushed on 9th Avenue. The numbers do not stop. They only grow.</p><h2 id=the-patterns-never-change>The Patterns Never Change</h2><p>Cars and trucks do most of the killing. SUVs alone took six lives and left 180 people hurt. Trucks killed two more. Taxis, bikes, and mopeds all left their mark. No one is safe. Not the old, not the young. Not the people walking to work or waiting for the light. The FDNY <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/about-30-people-injured-as-buses-crash-on-port-authority-ramp>reported</a> that about 30 people were injured in a bus collision on the Port Authority Bus Terminal ramp on Thursday morning.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-done-what-has-not>What Has Been Done, What Has Not</h2><p>Assembly Member Tony Simone has voted to extend school speed zones and co-sponsored bills for automated bike lane enforcement, bus lane enforcement, and speed limiters for repeat offenders. He stood with advocates to demand more transit funding and supported car-free plazas. But he also backed bills that would weaken speed camera enforcement. The work is not finished. The bodies prove it.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Call Assembly Member Simone. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people outside the car. Every day of delay is another broken body. Do not wait for the next name on the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Safety reclaimed.</p><p class=mb3>On June 27, 2024, city officials and civic leaders marked the completion of Plaza33, a pedestrian plaza on 33rd Street by Penn Station. The event capped years of transformation, turning a block once 'full of cars and trucks' into a car-free space. Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine, Assembly Member Tony Simone, and Council Member Erik Bottcher attended the ribbon-cutting. Levine recalled, 'I remember the battle over transforming this space and all the people who said that it would clog up traffic all over Midtown if we turned this street over to people and here we are and it's gorgeous.' Vornado Realty Trust funded the $65-million project with the Department of Transportation. The plaza, now permanent, offers 16,000 square feet for pedestrians, with trees, seating, and public programming. The change removes cars from a busy Midtown block, giving vulnerable road users safe, open ground.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2024, the New York State legislative session ended without passing a replacement funding plan for the MTA after Governor Kathy Hochul paused congestion pricing. The matter, described as 'Albany pumps the brakes on MTA funding plan in rebuke of Hochul’s move to ditch congestion pricing,' left the MTA without the $1 billion annual revenue congestion pricing would have provided. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins announced the session’s close without a deal. Lawmakers including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris, State Sen. John Liu, Assemblyman Harvey Epstein, and Assemblyman Tony Simone criticized the governor’s decision and the proposed IOU bailout. Gounardes said, 'I cannot in good conscience ratify a decision that will eliminate a significant, dedicated revenue source for the MTA’s capital plan.' The pause leaves the city’s transit future—and the safety of those who rely on it—uncertain.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states the cyclist suffered severe head lacerations, with his 'skull split' and blood pooling on the pavement. Despite the violence of the crash, the taxi showed 'no damage.' The cyclist remained conscious at the scene. The police report lists 'Unspecified' as the contributing factor for both involved parties, offering no explicit driver error, but the narrative centers the impact and injury to the cyclist. The report notes the cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but only after describing the driver actions and crash impact. The stark details highlight the vulnerability of cyclists and the unforgiving nature of city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Fines are low. Many ignore them. Council Member Restler and Assembly Member Simone push bills to hike penalties. The city’s old crackdown expired. Lawmakers want real consequences for repeat scofflaws.</p><p class=mb3>Council Member Lincoln Restler introduced a bill to raise fines for drivers who fail to move cars during alternate-side parking. The bill would increase the penalty to $100 for a second offense within a year and require towing after three violations in 12 months. Assembly Member Tony Simone submitted a state bill to double fines after the tenth violation, up to five times the current cap. The matter targets 'the worst repeat offenders of parking tickets.' Manhattan safe streets activist Jehiah Czebotar analyzed city data, finding that 77 percent of street-sweeping tickets go to repeat offenders, with 37 percent to drivers who got at least six tickets. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program expired last year, leaving a gap in enforcement. Lawmakers say fines must deter, not just be a cost of doing business.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
