A few blocks away, an 83-year-old woman was killed by an SUV while crossing with the signal. A 34-year-old man died at 7th Avenue and 36th Street, the victim of a distracted driver in an SUV. <strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price for someone else&rsquo;s hurry.</strong></p><h2 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h2><p><strong>Crashes keep coming.</strong> In the last 12 months alone, there were 1,734 crashes, 4 deaths, and 25 serious injuries in this district.
