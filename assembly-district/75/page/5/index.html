Twenty-seven left with injuries that do not heal. In the last year, AD 75 saw 1,612 crashes. The numbers are cold, but the facts are colder. A man struck by a box truck at West 40th and 9th. An 83-year-old woman killed by an SUV turning left at 58th and Sixth. A 34-year-old man, dead at the intersection of 36th and 7th, hit by an SUV. Each one a life ended or broken. Each one a family left with a hole that will not close. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price.

The numbers do not lie.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Assembly Member Tony Simone has taken steps. He co-sponsored bills to put speed limiters on state vehicles, to require safer street design, and to hold car owners accountable for repeat offenses. He backed higher fines for speed camera violations and supported automated bike lane enforcement. But not every move helps the most vulnerable.
