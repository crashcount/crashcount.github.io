In the past year, four people have died and twenty-five suffered serious injuries in crashes here. Nine hundred twenty-five were hurt. The dead include a 34-year-old man struck by an SUV at 7th Avenue and West 36th Street. The driver was distracted. The man never made it home, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>This spring, an 83-year-old woman was killed crossing with the signal at Avenue of the Americas and West 58th. The SUV turned left. She had the light. She lost her life, as shown in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>The violence is relentless. Buses collide at Port Authority, leaving a dozen with bruises and broken bones. A food cart breaks loose, slamming into a parked car with a woman and child inside. &ldquo;Firefighters forced entry into the van, removing 76 20-pound propane cylinders and 15 five-gallon fuel containers,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/cops-bust-minivan-driver-in-manhattan-for-carrying-propane-tanks/>reported NY Daily News</a>. The city is a minefield.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Assembly Member Tony Simone has taken some steps. He voted yes to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>extend school speed zones</a>, a move that keeps children safer near schools. He co-sponsored bills to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters and to hold vehicle owners liable for dangerous driving. These are the right fights.</p><p>But Simone also backed bills that would weaken speed camera enforcement. Every loophole is a gift to reckless drivers. Every delay is another name on a slab.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-dont-lie>The Numbers Don’t Lie</h3><p>SUVs and cars did the most harm—over 600 pedestrian injuries and 7 deaths in recent years. Trucks and buses killed 2, bikes injured 143. The old story: the bigger the vehicle, the harder the blow.</p><h3 id=the-call-demand-more>The Call: Demand More</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every death is a choice made by someone in power. Call Assembly Member Simone. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement. Demand streets where a child can cross without fear.</p><p>Do not wait for another name. Act now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The board voted 31-5 in favor. Supporters called current bus speeds 'painfully slow' and urged the city to 'prioritize pedestrians and transit users.' Critics worried about diverted car traffic clogging residential streets, with one resident calling for a 'traffic study' and 'action plan.' The DOT says the busway could boost bus speeds by 15 percent. The proposal would force cars to exit 34th Street quickly or face tickets, echoing rules on 14th Street.

Residents worry rerouted vehicles will jam local streets and worsen safety. Jessica Lavoie of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association warns, "diverting traffic from this critical corridor onto narrow residential streets would lead to increased congestion, safety hazards, and diminished quality of life." The Department of Transportation aims to replicate the 14th Street busway, which "reduced congestion, sped up bus travel and curbed accidents."

The pickup truck, registered in New Jersey, was traveling west and going straight ahead, while the cyclist was making a U-turn. The police report also lists 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a factor, but the primary systemic danger cited is unsafe lane changing.

Cars kept coming.</p><p class=mb3>According to the New York Post (published May 22, 2025), the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) refused to halt Manhattan’s congestion pricing despite a fourth federal deadline. The MTA and state officials dismissed Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy’s threats to withdraw funding as a 'sham,' arguing that the dispute is already in court. Attorney Roberta Kaplan wrote, 'Secretary Duffy did not afford the Project Sponsors any notice or due process before that alleged termination.' The state’s response called the deadlines 'procedurally improper.' The federal government’s push to end the tolls, and the MTA’s resistance, highlight a clash over control of city streets and transit funding. No mention of driver actions, but the policy fight leaves vulnerable road users exposed as the legal battle drags on.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
