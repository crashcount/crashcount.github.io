A few blocks away, an 83-year-old woman was killed by an SUV while crossing with the signal. A 34-year-old man died at 7th Avenue and 36th Street, the victim of a distracted driver in an SUV. <strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price for someone else&rsquo;s hurry.</strong></p><h2 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h2><p><strong>Crashes keep coming.</strong> In the last 12 months alone, there were 1,734 crashes, 4 deaths, and 25 serious injuries in this district.

The board voted 31-5 in favor. Supporters called current bus speeds 'painfully slow' and urged the city to 'prioritize pedestrians and transit users.' Critics worried about diverted car traffic clogging residential streets, with one resident calling for a 'traffic study' and 'action plan.' The DOT says the busway could boost bus speeds by 15 percent. The proposal would force cars to exit 34th Street quickly or face tickets, echoing rules on 14th Street.

Residents worry rerouted vehicles will jam local streets and worsen safety. Jessica Lavoie of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association warns, "diverting traffic from this critical corridor onto narrow residential streets would lead to increased congestion, safety hazards, and diminished quality of life." The Department of Transportation aims to replicate the 14th Street busway, which "reduced congestion, sped up bus travel and curbed accidents."

The cyclist, a 55-year-old man, was ejected and suffered a head injury with severe bleeding. According to the police report, 'Unsafe Lane Changing' was a contributing factor in the collision. The pickup truck, registered in New Jersey, was traveling west and going straight ahead, while the cyclist was making a U-turn. The police report also lists 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a factor, but the primary systemic danger cited is unsafe lane changing. No injuries were reported for the truck occupants. The crash underscores the risks vulnerable road users face when drivers fail to maintain safe lanes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Cars kept coming.</p><p class=mb3>According to the New York Post (published May 22, 2025), the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) refused to halt Manhattan’s congestion pricing despite a fourth federal deadline. The MTA and state officials dismissed Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy’s threats to withdraw funding as a 'sham,' arguing that the dispute is already in court. Attorney Roberta Kaplan wrote, 'Secretary Duffy did not afford the Project Sponsors any notice or due process before that alleged termination.' The state’s response called the deadlines 'procedurally improper.' The federal government’s push to end the tolls, and the MTA’s resistance, highlight a clash over control of city streets and transit funding.

The Department of Transportation aims to allow only buses and trucks, forcing cars to turn off quickly. The M34 bus, used by 28,000 daily riders, currently averages just 3 mph during rush hour. Officials cite the 2019 14th Street busway, which increased bus speeds by 24% and reduced crash injuries. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'The vast majority of commuters in Midtown are traveling by transit and they deserve world-class, fast, and reliable buses.' The plan includes pedestrian improvements like shorter intersections and brighter crosswalks. The move follows previous controversies over similar projects but reflects a push for safer, more efficient streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
