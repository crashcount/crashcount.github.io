Twenty-seven left with injuries that do not heal. In the last year, AD 75 saw 1,612 crashes. The numbers are cold, but the facts are colder. A man struck by a box truck at West 40th and 9th. An 83-year-old woman killed by an SUV turning left at 58th and Sixth. A 34-year-old man, dead at the intersection of 36th and 7th, hit by an SUV. Each one a life ended or broken. Each one a family left with a hole that will not close. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price. In the last twelve months, 853 people were hurt. Trucks, SUVs, taxis, bikes—they all left bodies behind. The sidewalk is not safe. The crosswalk is not safe. The numbers do not lie.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Assembly Member Tony Simone has taken steps. He co-sponsored bills to put speed limiters on state vehicles, to require safer street design, and to hold car owners accountable for repeat offenses. He backed higher fines for speed camera violations and supported automated bike lane enforcement. But not every move helps the most vulnerable. Simone also co-sponsored a bill that would raise the speed threshold for camera enforcement, making it easier for drivers to speed without consequence. <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A6225&amp;term=2025">A 6225</a></p><p>He stood with advocates for pedestrian plazas, like Plaza33 by Penn Station, giving people a place where cars cannot reach them. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/27/33rd-street-by-penn-station-completes-decad-long-transformation-into-plaza33>Plaza33</a> But the work is not done. The street is still a killing field.</p><h3 id=the-system-grinds-on>The System Grinds On</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. The state passes laws. Still, the trucks roll. The taxis jump the curb. The old and the young end up in the hospital or the morgue. &ldquo;The vast majority of commuters in Midtown are traveling by transit and they deserve world-class, fast, and reliable buses&mldr; far fewer New Yorkers are getting hurt in crashes,&rdquo; said <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/dot-proposes-transforming-34th-st-into-mostly-car-free-busway-much-like-14th-st-AY4607640>DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>, pushing for a car-free 34th Street.</p><p>But the numbers in AD 75 do not show an end. They show a crisis that does not stop.</p><p><strong>Call to Action:</strong></p><p><strong>Contact Tony Simone.

Tension rises between speed, safety, and neighborhood calm.</p><p class=mb3>The New York Post (2025-06-08) reports that the city proposes restricting cars on 34th Street to create a busway between 3rd and 9th Avenues. Residents worry rerouted vehicles will jam local streets and worsen safety. Jessica Lavoie of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association warns, "diverting traffic from this critical corridor onto narrow residential streets would lead to increased congestion, safety hazards, and diminished quality of life." The Department of Transportation aims to replicate the 14th Street busway, which "reduced congestion, sped up bus travel and curbed accidents." The article highlights the ongoing struggle to balance efficient transit, tunnel access, and neighborhood safety. No specific driver errors are cited, but the plan underscores the systemic risks of shifting car traffic onto residential blocks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The cyclist, a 55-year-old man, was ejected and suffered a head injury with severe bleeding. According to the police report, 'Unsafe Lane Changing' was a contributing factor in the collision. The pickup truck, registered in New Jersey, was traveling west and going straight ahead, while the cyclist was making a U-turn. The police report also lists 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a factor, but the primary systemic danger cited is unsafe lane changing.

Fear lingered.</p><p class=mb3>According to the New York Post (2025-05-19), a carriage horse ran loose through Central Park after its bridle came off and the driver was separated. Eyewitness Hayley said, "I was there with my friend walking on the sidewalk and almost got trampled by the poor horse. It was so terrifying." Parkgoers scrambled for safety, some jumping fences. Cyclists chased the horse, warning others. The horse was not tethered to a hitching post, as none was nearby. Christina Hansen, union rep for carriage horses, stated, "There were no injuries or property damage reported, and there's currently no indication the horse's driver was negligent." The incident highlights gaps in securing procedures and the absence of hitching posts, raising questions about safety for pedestrians and park users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill adds pets to protected victims in traffic law. It hikes fines for drivers who hit animals and flee. Lawmakers push for real consequences when cars strike dogs, cats, and other companions.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0723-2025 sits in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced January 23, 2025, it urges the state to pass A10660/S9915, the Protecting Animals Walking on the Street (PAWS) Act. The resolution states: 'add the term companion animals to the list of possible victim classes should a driver fail to exercise due care to avoid striking pedestrians and to increase the fine for striking a pet with a vehicle and leaving the scene without reporting the incident.' Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary sponsor), Lynn C. Schulman, Carlina Rivera, and Justin L. Brannan back the measure. The PAWS Act would raise fines for drivers who hit pets and leave, and would recognize companion animals as protected victims under traffic law. The move targets a gap in current law, where penalties for striking animals are minor—on par with an illegal U-turn. The Council’s action signals a push for stronger accountability when vehicles harm the city’s most vulnerable, including its animals.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident occurred at 5:57 p.m. The SUV, traveling north, hit the e-scooter as it was changing lanes. The police report describes the e-scooter operator as semiconscious with severe head bleeding and no helmet. The SUV’s center front end collided with the e-scooter’s center back end, leaving the rider injured on the street. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified' for both parties, but the narrative makes clear the SUV driver struck the e-scooter from behind. No driver errors were explicitly cited, but the impact location and sequence highlight the systemic danger faced by vulnerable road users in mixed traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

On January 6, 2025, Council Member Tony Simone announced a legislative push to require the MTA to install platform screen doors and gates system-wide within five years. The bill, still in proposal stage, will move through the relevant council committee. Simone’s proposal comes after a spate of subway violence, including a recent shove onto tracks in his district. The bill summary states: 'My legislation will require the MTA to install platform screen doors and gates system-wide within five years.' Simone urges the use of congestion pricing revenue for these safety upgrades, arguing, 'No priority is higher on any rider's mind, including mine, than safety on the system.' Simone is the primary sponsor.
