The article details heated opposition from local residents and bus riders, who argued the plan was rushed and lacked proper traffic analysis. Stacy Rauch, a daily bus rider, said, 'The bigger problem is we don’t have enough buses.' Critics worried diverted car traffic would overwhelm nearby streets. The city compared the move to the 14th Street car ban, but residents noted differences in bus frequency. The article highlights accusations of conflicts of interest involving community board members and advocacy groups. The policy aims to prioritize buses and vulnerable road users, but leaves open questions about implementation and neighborhood impact.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Residents worry rerouted vehicles will jam local streets and worsen safety. Jessica Lavoie of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association warns, "diverting traffic from this critical corridor onto narrow residential streets would lead to increased congestion, safety hazards, and diminished quality of life." The Department of Transportation aims to replicate the 14th Street busway, which "reduced congestion, sped up bus travel and curbed accidents." The article highlights the ongoing struggle to balance efficient transit, tunnel access, and neighborhood safety. No specific driver errors are cited, but the plan underscores the systemic risks of shifting car traffic onto residential blocks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He praised her stand against demolishing neighborhoods for Penn Station. But he drew a line: the station’s future should not be a bargaining chip for safer, saner streets.</p><p class=mb3>On March 18, 2025, Assemblyman Tony Simone (District 75) issued a statement on congestion pricing and Penn Station redevelopment. The matter, titled 'Hochul will defy Trump deadline to stop NYC congestion pricing — but insists president still backs her Penn Station revamp plan,' centers on Governor Hochul’s refusal to halt congestion pricing despite federal pressure. Simone, representing the Penn Station area, voiced support for both congestion pricing and a bold Penn Station overhaul, saying, 'It’s time to build a big bold Penn Station. I’m glad that she’s talking to the president about it.' He opposed linking the two projects, stating, 'I don’t think they should be connected.' Simone also welcomed Hochul’s resistance to Amtrak’s expansion plans that would raze neighborhoods. No safety analyst assessment was provided for this action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
