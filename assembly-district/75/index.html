Residents worry rerouted vehicles will jam local streets and worsen safety. Jessica Lavoie of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association warns, "diverting traffic from this critical corridor onto narrow residential streets would lead to increased congestion, safety hazards, and diminished quality of life." The Department of Transportation aims to replicate the 14th Street busway, which "reduced congestion, sped up bus travel and curbed accidents."

The pickup truck, registered in New Jersey, was traveling west and going straight ahead, while the cyclist was making a U-turn.

The 75-year-old male passenger, seated in the right rear and wearing a lap belt, suffered a serious head injury with bleeding. The report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the sole contributing factor for both drivers. One driver was making a left turn while the other was traveling straight. The narrative states: 'A 75-year-old man in the back seat bled from the head. He wore a lap belt. Both drivers were distracted.' No victim behavior contributed to the crash. This collision highlights the deadly consequences of driver distraction on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'Hochul will defy Trump deadline to stop NYC congestion pricing — but insists president still backs her Penn Station revamp plan,' centers on Governor Hochul’s refusal to halt congestion pricing despite federal pressure. Simone, representing the Penn Station area, voiced support for both congestion pricing and a bold Penn Station overhaul, saying, 'It’s time to build a big bold Penn Station. I’m glad that she’s talking to the president about it.' He opposed linking the two projects, stating, 'I don’t think they should be connected.' Simone also welcomed Hochul’s resistance to Amtrak’s expansion plans that would raze neighborhoods.

The bill, titled 'Relates to reducing the speed for owner liability for failure of operator to comply with certain posted maximum speed limits,' lowers the threshold for owner liability to more than seven miles per hour over posted limits. Assembly Members Robert C. Carroll (District 44, primary sponsor) and Tony Simone (District 75, co-sponsor) lead the push. No votes have been recorded yet. The bill targets drivers who speed, holding car owners accountable at lower speeds. This measure could close loopholes and increase enforcement.

The crash occurred at 8:10 a.m. The report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor, highlighting a critical lapse in driver vigilance. The truck, registered in Ohio and operated by a licensed driver from Louisiana, was supposed to be stationary but instead moved forward, causing fatal impact. No contributing factors related to the victim's behavior are cited in the report. The crash underscores the lethal consequences of driver distraction and the dangers posed by large vehicles left unattended on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The rally targeted Governor Hochul’s $252 billion budget, which omits $33 billion needed for transit upgrades. The event, covered by amny.com, highlighted the matter: 'NYC transit advocates urge Hochul to fully fund MTA Capital Plan with guaranteed state budget revenue.' Hoylman-Sigal said, 'This is about the economic engine for the entire region.' Assembly Member Tony Simone and others demanded investment in transportation deserts and accessible stations. Advocates cited the MTA’s ADA settlement, noting only a quarter of stations are wheelchair-accessible, with the fewest in low-income areas. The rally underscored that without full funding, vulnerable riders—especially those with disabilities—face continued barriers and danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill adds pets to protected victims in traffic law. It hikes fines for drivers who hit animals and flee. Lawmakers push for real consequences when cars strike dogs, cats, and other companions.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0723-2025 sits in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced January 23, 2025, it urges the state to pass A10660/S9915, the Protecting Animals Walking on the Street (PAWS) Act. The resolution states: 'add the term companion animals to the list of possible victim classes should a driver fail to exercise due care to avoid striking pedestrians and to increase the fine for striking a pet with a vehicle and leaving the scene without reporting the incident.' Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary sponsor), Lynn C. Schulman, Carlina Rivera, and Justin L. Brannan back the measure. The PAWS Act would raise fines for drivers who hit pets and leave, and would recognize companion animals as protected victims under traffic law. The move targets a gap in current law, where penalties for striking animals are minor—on par with an illegal U-turn. The Council’s action signals a push for stronger accountability when vehicles harm the city’s most vulnerable, including its animals.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
