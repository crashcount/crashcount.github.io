Seventy-five have suffered serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, four lives were lost, and over a thousand were injured. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, elders, children. On February 11, an 83-year-old woman was killed crossing with the signal at Avenue of the Americas and West 58th Street. She died from internal injuries after an SUV making a left turn struck her. She had the light. She did not stand a chance. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p><strong>Just weeks ago, a box truck killed a man in Hell&rsquo;s Kitchen.</strong> Days later, a van crashed in Midtown, and firefighters found it packed with 76 propane tanks.

The ramp is a known bottleneck. The city promises to fix it by 2032. The pain is now.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h3><p>Assembly Member Tony Simone has taken some steps. He voted yes to extend school speed zones, a move that protects children near schools. He co-sponsored bills to require speed limiters for repeat offenders and to hold vehicle owners liable for dangerous driving. He stood up for congestion pricing, which can cut traffic and save lives. But he also backed bills that would weaken speed camera enforcement. The fight is not over.</p><h3 id=the-next-move-is-ours>The Next Move Is Ours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. These deaths are not accidents.</strong> Every crash is a policy failure. Every delay is a choice. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has the tools to stop repeat offenders. It can redesign streets for people, not cars. But it will not act unless we force it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call Assembly Member Simone. Demand safer speeds, stronger enforcement, and streets built for life, not death.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

An illegal electric unicycle hit a cyclist, sending its operator to the hospital in critical but stable condition. The cyclist, Carolyn Backus, was wrongly charged with leaving the scene, though she "remained on scene for about 45 minutes after the crash and waited for paramedics." The Manhattan D.A. dismissed the charge, noting Backus rode a non-motorized bike.

Residents worry rerouted vehicles will jam local streets and worsen safety. Jessica Lavoie of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association warns, "diverting traffic from this critical corridor onto narrow residential streets would lead to increased congestion, safety hazards, and diminished quality of life." The Department of Transportation aims to replicate the 14th Street busway, which "reduced congestion, sped up bus travel and curbed accidents."

The pickup truck, registered in New Jersey, was traveling west and going straight ahead, while the cyclist was making a U-turn. The police report also lists 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a factor, but the primary systemic danger cited is unsafe lane changing.

Federal officials had threatened to withhold funds for road and street safety projects if the city continued the program.

It 'permits the use of photo speed violation monitoring systems in New York City for the purposes of enforcement of license plate obstruction, concealment, and/or distortion; extends provisions permitting the use of speed cameras in certain school zones.'
