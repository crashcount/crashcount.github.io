They do not lie.</p><h3 id=the-crashes-keep-coming>The Crashes Keep Coming</h3><p>Just last week, a car fire in the Lincoln Tunnel sent one commuter to the hospital and left five more shaken. Traffic froze for an hour. The tunnel filled with smoke and fear. &ldquo;One commuter was taken to Mount Sinai West to be treated for injuries.

He co-sponsored measures for speed limiters on repeat offenders, higher speed camera fines, and safer street design. He stood at the ribbon-cutting for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/27/33rd-street-by-penn-station-completes-decad-long-transformation-into-plaza33>Plaza33</a>, a block turned over to people, not cars. But the blood on the pavement says more is needed.</p><p>The most dangerous drivers still roam free. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so. Cameras catch speeders, but the worst repeat offenders keep driving. The laws are not enough. The enforcement is not enough. The deaths do not stop.</p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower the speed limit. Tell them to stop the super speeders. Tell them to build streets for people, not for cars. The next name on the list could be someone you love. Do not wait.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

An illegal electric unicycle hit a cyclist, sending its operator to the hospital in critical but stable condition. The cyclist, Carolyn Backus, was wrongly charged with leaving the scene, though she "remained on scene for about 45 minutes after the crash and waited for paramedics." The Manhattan D.A. dismissed the charge, noting Backus rode a non-motorized bike. The article highlights the risk of high-speed e-vehicles in crowded park zones, where "unpredictable congestion makes it the last place...anyone should be speeding."</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Jessica Lavoie of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association warns, "diverting traffic from this critical corridor onto narrow residential streets would lead to increased congestion, safety hazards, and diminished quality of life."

The 75-year-old male passenger, seated in the right rear and wearing a lap belt, suffered a serious head injury with bleeding.

The matter, titled 'Hochul will defy Trump deadline to stop NYC congestion pricing — but insists president still backs her Penn Station revamp plan,' centers on Governor Hochul’s refusal to halt congestion pricing despite federal pressure. Simone, representing the Penn Station area, voiced support for both congestion pricing and a bold Penn Station overhaul, saying, 'It’s time to build a big bold Penn Station. I’m glad that she’s talking to the president about it.' He opposed linking the two projects, stating, 'I don’t think they should be connected.' Simone also welcomed Hochul’s resistance to Amtrak’s expansion plans that would raze neighborhoods.

The fight for safer streets continues.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly bill A 6225 was introduced on February 28, 2025. It sits in the sponsorship stage. The bill, titled 'Relates to reducing the speed for owner liability for failure of operator to comply with certain posted maximum speed limits,' lowers the threshold for owner liability to more than seven miles per hour over posted limits. Assembly Members Robert C. Carroll (District 44, primary sponsor) and Tony Simone (District 75, co-sponsor) lead the push. No votes have been recorded yet. The bill targets drivers who speed, holding car owners accountable at lower speeds. This measure could close loopholes and increase enforcement. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, passengers—stand to gain from stricter speed control.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
