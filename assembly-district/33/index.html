Five people have died here in the last year. More than 800 have been hurt. Four were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The numbers are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors. They are the sound of sirens at midnight, the hush that falls when the street clears.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/stand-up-scooter-rider-fatal-queens-collision/>39-year-old man on a scooter was killed</a> at 116th Avenue and Nashville Boulevard. The van turned left. The man was thrown from his scooter. He died at the hospital. Police said, &ldquo;As the van attempted to turn left onto Nashville Boulevard, it collided with the scooter, immediately propelling Lagredelle off the device.&rdquo; [amny, 2025-06-30]</p><p>On Hillside Avenue, a <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/12/us-news/knife-wielding-robbery-suspect-on-e-bike-hit-and-killed-by-car-during-nyc-police-chase/>robbery suspect fleeing police on an e-bike was struck and killed by a Lexus</a>. The chase ended in blood. &ldquo;He was pronounced dead at the scene, cops said.&rdquo; [New York Post, 2025-07-13]</p><h3 id=the-pattern-is-clear>The Pattern Is Clear</h3><p>Crashes are not random. They cluster at intersections, at turns, at the places where people cross and drivers look away. In the last twelve months, children and elders have been hurt. One woman, 76, died as a passenger on the Cross Island Parkway. A 29-year-old man was killed crossing with the signal by a turning truck. The cause: driver inattention, unsafe turns, speed.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h3><p>Assembly Member Clyde Vanel has voted for speed cameras and school zone protections. He backed <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>the extension of school speed zones</a> and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">the expansion of speed cameras</a>. He co-sponsored a bill to require speed-limiting tech for repeat offenders. These are steps. But the deaths keep coming. Enforcement is slow. Cameras do not stop a driver from fleeing a scene or making a deadly turn.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Every delay, every loophole, every unprotected crossing is a choice. Call Assembly Member Vanel. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph citywide speed limit. Demand real consequences for repeat offenders. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
