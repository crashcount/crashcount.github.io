In the last twelve months, <strong>four people died</strong> and <strong>744 were injured</strong> in crashes. Two of the dead were pedestrians. One was a man on a scooter, thrown to the ground and left lifeless on 116th Avenue just days ago. The paramedics could not save him. Police said, &ldquo;As the van attempted to turn left onto Nashville Boulevard, it collided with the scooter, immediately propelling Lagredelle off the device before he hit the ground&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/stand-up-scooter-rider-fatal-queens-collision/>amNY</a>).</p><p>A 78-year-old man tried to cross Jericho Turnpike. He never made it. Five months later, the driver was charged with failure to yield and failure to exercise due care. The law calls this a misdemeanor. The man’s family calls it a death sentence. &ldquo;On Tuesday, police charged him with failure to yield to a pedestrian and failure to exercise due care, both misdemeanors&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/21/driver-arrested-5-months-after-fatally-striking-78-year-old-man-in-queens/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><h3 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h3><p><strong>In three and a half years, ten people have died and over 2,200 have been injured</strong> on these streets. Children are not spared. In the last year, 79 kids were hurt. Cars and trucks do most of the damage. SUVs, sedans, and trucks are the main weapons. The numbers are not just numbers. Each is a name, a family, a life cut short.</p><h3 id=what-has-clyde-vanel-done>What Has Clyde Vanel Done?</h3><p>Assembly Member Clyde Vanel has taken some steps. He co-sponsored the <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (A2299)</strong>, a bill to force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed limiters on their cars (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">A2299 bill</a>). He voted yes to expand school speed cameras in Schenectady, a move that protects children where they walk (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">school speed cameras</a>). These are steps in the right direction. But the carnage continues. The laws are slow. The streets are not safe.</p><h3 id=what-next-demand-more>What Next? Demand More</h3><p><strong>The blood on these streets is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Assembly Member Vanel. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real consequences for drivers who kill and maim. Join forces with groups like Families for Safe Streets. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p><p><strong>Act now. The next victim could be someone you love.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
