In the past year alone, five people have died and over 800 have been injured in traffic crashes here. Just last month, a 39-year-old man on a scooter was thrown to the ground and killed when a van turned left across his path at 116th Avenue and Nashville Boulevard. Police said, &ldquo;As the van attempted to turn left onto Nashville Boulevard, it collided with the scooter, immediately propelling Lagredelle off the device&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/stand-up-scooter-rider-fatal-queens-collision/>amny report</a>).</p><p>A week later, a 15-year-old fleeing police on an e-bike was struck and killed by a Lexus driver with a suspended license and 53 speed camera violations. The driver tried to run. The NYPD&rsquo;s Force Investigation Division is now probing the crash (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/13/queens-mugging-suspect-15-on-e-bike-fleeing-nypd-cops-fatally-struck-by-hit-run-lexus-driver/>NY Daily News investigation</a>).</p><h3 id=the-numbers-relentless-and-rising>The Numbers: Relentless and Rising</h3><p>In the last 12 months, AD 33 saw 1,152 crashes, 5 deaths, and 803 injuries. Children are not spared—88 injured, none killed, but luck is not a strategy. Cars and SUVs did most of the harm, causing over 250 pedestrian injuries and two deaths. Trucks killed at least one more. The numbers do not lie. They do not comfort.</p><h3 id=leadership-what-has-clyde-vanel-done>Leadership: What Has Clyde Vanel Done?</h3><p>Assembly Member Clyde Vanel has voted to extend and expand school speed cameras, a move that protects children near schools (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>speed camera legislation</a>). He co-sponsored a bill to require speed-limiting tech for repeat speeders (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">speed-limiting bill</a>). But Vanel also voted to weaken bus lane rules, a step that puts pedestrians and cyclists at greater risk. The work is not done. The danger is not gone.</p><h3 id=the-call-demand-action-now>The Call: Demand Action Now</h3><p>Every crash is preventable. Every death is a policy failure. Call Assembly Member Vanel. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real penalties for repeat speeders. Demand streets where a child can cross without fear. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice. Change it.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
