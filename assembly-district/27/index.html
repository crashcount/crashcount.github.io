Ten left with life-altering injuries. In the last twelve months, Assembly District 27 has seen 1,218 crashes. The numbers are blunt. They do not flinch. Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians—no one is spared.</p><p>A man steps from his car on the Whitestone Expressway. He is struck, thrown, and left dead in the road. The driver flees. His sister waits a year for justice. “Berney died at the scene,” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/05/queens-whitestone-expressway-hit-and-run-crash-unlicensed-james-vennitti-david-berney/>the report reads</a>. The killer is unlicensed. The law is slow.</p><p>On a Friday morning, an MTA bus jumps the curb in Flushing. Seven are hurt. A mother with a baby says, “That would be scary. I&rsquo;ll be more cautious of my surroundings.” <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>She is quoted</a>. The bus takes down a pole. The city shrugs. The accident remains under investigation.</p><h2 id=patterns-that-do-not-change>Patterns That Do Not Change</h2><p>Most deaths come from cars and SUVs. In three years, sedans and SUVs killed five pedestrians and left hundreds more injured. Trucks, motorcycles, and bikes add to the toll, but the steel and speed of cars do the worst. The numbers do not lie. They do not forgive.</p><h2 id=leadership-present-in-name-absent-in-action>Leadership: Present in Name, Absent in Action</h2><p>Assembly Member Sam Berger missed vote after vote on bills that would have made school zones safer. He was absent when the Assembly moved to extend speed zone protections for children. He was silent when bus regulation exemptions advanced. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>The record shows</a> absence, not action.</p><p>When the city debated e-scooter safety, Berger joined those calling for bans, despite no evidence of harm from the program. The data showed 290,000 trips and not a single serious injury or death. Still, Berger stood with those who would rather ban than build safer streets. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/17/queens-pols-have-lots-of-claims-about-the-evils-of-scooter-share-but-few-facts>The facts are clear</a>.</p><h2 id=what-must-change>What Must Change</h2><p>This is not fate. It is failure. Every crash is a policy not passed, a street not fixed, a leader not moved. Call Assembly Member Berger. Demand he show up, vote, and fight for the living. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The owner, Jose DeAguiar, described, "He rams right into the side of the car." The driver exited, inspected the damage, then left without leaving a note. Despite clear video evidence, DeAguiar spent three months seeking accountability as insurers denied responsibility. Only after ABC7's intervention did Amazon respond, covering $6,000 in repairs and $5,000 in storage fees.

The report notes the cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this is mentioned only after driver distraction is cited as the cause.

On February 10, 2024, Vennitti allegedly rear-ended David Berney, 43, after Berney and another driver stopped in the middle lane following a minor collision. The crash threw Berney from his car, killing him at the scene. The other driver was injured. Vennitti, unlicensed, abandoned his Mercedes and fled on foot. Police arrested him a year later. A grand jury indicted Vennitti for leaving the scene of a fatal crash and driving without a license. The case highlights the lethal risk of unlicensed driving and the dangers of stopped vehicles on high-speed roads.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, co-sponsored by Council Members James Gennaro and Lynn Schulman, follows a press conference where lawmakers denounced the program as hazardous. Gennaro said, "The program, as designed, leads to chaos." Ung called her bill a last resort. Assembly Members Sam Berger and David Weprin, and Community Board 8 Chair Martha Taylor, joined the opposition, citing sidewalk clutter and lack of outreach. However, DOT data contradicts their claims: since the program's June launch, 37,000 riders have taken 290,000 trips with no reported serious injuries or deaths. DOT says it held 35 briefings and implemented parking corrals in dense areas. Despite high ridership and safety records, the bill seeks to end the program, centering political frustration over proven outcomes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The force of the impact left the pickup’s right rear bumper destroyed and the truck’s front end mangled. The data makes clear: driver error behind the wheel of the tractor truck led to devastating injuries for the pickup’s occupants.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
