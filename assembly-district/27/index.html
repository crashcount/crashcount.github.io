Thirty-two left with serious injuries.</strong> In just the last twelve months, three more lives lost, ten more bodies broken. <strong>Nearly 800 injured.</strong> The violence does not stop. It comes for the young and the old. It comes on foot, on bikes, in cars. It comes on the way to school, to work, to the store.</p><p>Last week, an MTA bus in Flushing jumped the curb. <strong>Seven people hurt.</strong> A mother with a baby watched the bus mount the sidewalk. &ldquo;That would be scary. I&rsquo;ll be more cautious of my surroundings,&rdquo; she said, clutching her child <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>CBS New York</a>. The pole came down. The bus&rsquo;s front end crumpled. The street was not safe for anyone.</p><p>A few blocks away, another bus slammed a light pole. <strong>Eight more injured.</strong> &ldquo;It must be very devastating for the people that were on the bus,&rdquo; a witness <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/8-hurt-in-queens-bus-crash/>said</a>. The city calls these minor injuries. The pain is not minor for those who carry it.</p><h3 id=leadership-present-or-absent>Leadership: Present or Absent?</h3><p><strong>Assembly Member Sam Berger missed vote after vote on bills to protect children and pedestrians.</strong> In June, as the Assembly weighed laws to extend and improve school speed zones, Berger was marked absent or excused again and again <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Open States</a>. The bills passed. The work was done by others. Berger&rsquo;s silence was louder than any speech.</p><p>When the city tried to expand safe mobility—bike lanes, e-scooter share—Berger joined the chorus against it. He stood with those who called proven safety programs &ldquo;chaos&rdquo; and demanded their end, even as the data <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/17/queens-pols-have-lots-of-claims-about-the-evils-of-scooter-share-but-few-facts>showed</a> no deaths, no serious injuries, and tens of thousands of safe rides.</p><h3 id=the-road-ahead>The Road Ahead</h3><p><strong>The violence is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Cars and SUVs killed and maimed the most. Trucks, buses, motorcycles, and bikes all left their mark. The streets are not safe until leaders make them safe. <strong>Every day of delay is another day of blood on the asphalt.</strong></p><p><strong>Call Assembly Member Sam Berger. Demand votes for school speed zones, for protected bike lanes, for real accountability.</strong> Do not wait for another bus to jump the curb. Do not wait for another name to become a number. The road does not forgive. We should not either.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

On February 10, 2024, Vennitti allegedly rear-ended David Berney, 43, after Berney and another driver stopped in the middle lane following a minor collision. The crash threw Berney from his car, killing him at the scene. The other driver was injured. Vennitti, unlicensed, abandoned his Mercedes and fled on foot. Police arrested him a year later. A grand jury indicted Vennitti for leaving the scene of a fatal crash and driving without a license. The case highlights the lethal risk of unlicensed driving and the dangers of stopped vehicles on high-speed roads.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, co-sponsored by Council Members James Gennaro and Lynn Schulman, follows a press conference where lawmakers denounced the program as hazardous. Gennaro said, "The program, as designed, leads to chaos." Ung called her bill a last resort. Assembly Members Sam Berger and David Weprin, and Community Board 8 Chair Martha Taylor, joined the opposition, citing sidewalk clutter and lack of outreach. However, DOT data contradicts their claims: since the program's June launch, 37,000 riders have taken 290,000 trips with no reported serious injuries or deaths. DOT says it held 35 briefings and implemented parking corrals in dense areas. Despite high ridership and safety records, the bill seeks to end the program, centering political frustration over proven outcomes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
