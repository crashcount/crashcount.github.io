Slow the expressway fronts and ramps near homes and shops. Daylight the corners. Harden the turns. Give walkers the head start at signals. Focus enforcement when the harm hits: late night and early morning at the known hotspots. The district analysis flags “nighttime conditions” and “repeat hotspots.” Treat them like it.</p><p>—</p><h3 id=citywide-tools-that-work>Citywide tools that work</h3><p>Albany extended New York City’s 24‑hour school‑zone speed‑camera program this June, through bill <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>S 8344</a>. With cameras secured, the next lever is speed itself. A citywide 20 MPH default on neighborhood streets and intelligent speed assistance for the worst repeat offenders would cut the risk. In New York, a tiny share of drivers do outsized harm: just <strong>1.5%</strong> of motorists cause <strong>21%</strong> of pedestrian deaths; vehicles with <strong>16 camera tickets in 12 months</strong> are twice as likely to kill or seriously injure, and <strong>30+ tickets</strong> multiplies the risk fifty‑fold, per <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/20/the-1-5-percent-of-drivers-who-cause-21-percent-of-pedestrian-deaths>Streetsblog’s analysis</a>. Our action guide lays out both moves and who to call.

The crash threw Berney from his car, killing him at the scene. The other driver was injured. Vennitti, unlicensed, abandoned his Mercedes and fled on foot. Police arrested him a year later. A grand jury indicted Vennitti for leaving the scene of a fatal crash and driving without a license.

The bill, co-sponsored by Council Members James Gennaro and Lynn Schulman, follows a press conference where lawmakers denounced the program as hazardous. Gennaro said, "The program, as designed, leads to chaos." Ung called her bill a last resort. Assembly Members Sam Berger and David Weprin, and Community Board 8 Chair Martha Taylor, joined the opposition, citing sidewalk clutter and lack of outreach. However, DOT data contradicts their claims: since the program's June launch, 37,000 riders have taken 290,000 trips with no reported serious injuries or deaths. DOT says it held 35 briefings and implemented parking corrals in dense areas. Despite high ridership and safety records, the bill seeks to end the program, centering political frustration over proven outcomes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Metal folded, glass burst, three young adults trapped inside. Neck bones cracked. The truck’s nose caved, the pickup’s rear torn open. All survived, but the scars will linger.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a diesel tractor truck struck the rear of a northbound Ford pickup truck on Whitestone Expressway at 8:37 a.m. The report states, 'A diesel truck slammed into a northbound Ford pickup. The truck’s nose folded. The pickup’s rear tore open.' Three young adults inside the pickup—ages 20, 27, and 29—suffered severe neck crush injuries. None were ejected; all remained strapped in as the vehicle crumpled around them. The police report lists 'Following Too Closely' and 'Unsafe Speed' as contributing factors for the crash. The force of the impact left the pickup’s right rear bumper destroyed and the truck’s front end mangled. The data makes clear: driver error behind the wheel of the tractor truck led to devastating injuries for the pickup’s occupants.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
