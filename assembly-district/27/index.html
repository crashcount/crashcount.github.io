Fourteen Dead. Zero Answers.</h1><p class="byline f6 silver">Written June 4, 2025 <em>(Revised June 6, 2025 – Updated period stats)</em></p></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>AD 27: Jan 1, 2022 - Jun 4, 2025</h2><h3 id=the-bodies-in-the-road>The Bodies in the Road</h3><p>In Assembly District 27, violence comes in pieces. Fourteen dead. Thirty with injuries so grave they are called serious. Over three years, 3,648 crashes. These are not just numbers—they are people who never come home. A cyclist’s legs crushed by a turning car. A pedestrian thrown from his car and left to die on the expressway. A child struck by a distracted driver. The pain does not fade. It spreads.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage: five deaths, ten serious injuries, sixty-six more with broken bones or worse. Trucks and buses follow, with two more serious injuries. Motorcycles and bikes are not spared, but the carnage is driven by the largest, fastest machines. The street is not safe for the old, the young, or anyone who walks or rides.</p><h3 id=leadership-missing-in-action>Leadership: Missing in Action</h3><p>Assembly Member Sam Berger has not led. When a bill came to put speed cameras near schools in Schenectady, Berger was excused—<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">missing a chance to boost school zone safety</a>. When Queens politicians lined up to kill the e-scooter share, Berger joined them, ignoring the data: <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/17/queens-pols-have-lots-of-claims-about-the-evils-of-scooter-share-but-few-facts>&ldquo;37,000 riders, 290,000 trips, no reported serious injuries or deaths&rdquo;</a>. The program worked. Still, Berger stood with those who called it chaos.</p><p>Victims wait for justice. Families wait for action. In one crash, a man watched an Amazon truck hit his car and drive off. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/7-side-helps-get-repairs-covered-amazon-driver-allegedly-crashed-parked-car-drove-off/16474908/>&ldquo;He comes out, looks at it, shrugs his shoulders, and leaves. No note, nothing. No care for anyone else&rsquo;s property&rdquo;</a>.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p>The blood on the street is not an act of God. It is a choice. Every day without lower speed limits, every day without cameras, every day of silence from leaders is another day someone else pays the price.</p><p>Call Sam Berger. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets where children can walk and ride and live.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

According to the police report, the sedan was 'making left turn' when it struck the cyclist, who was 'going straight ahead.' The report states, 'Steel met skin. The rider, 32, fell hard. Legs crushed.' The cyclist suffered crush injuries to the lower legs and remained conscious at the scene. Police explicitly list 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor for both the sedan and the crash overall. The sedan’s left front bumper struck the bike’s center front end. The report notes the cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this is mentioned only after driver distraction is cited as the cause. The crash underscores the persistent risk posed by inattentive drivers to vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The crash threw Berney from his car, killing him at the scene. The other driver was injured. Vennitti, unlicensed, abandoned his Mercedes and fled on foot. Police arrested him a year later. A grand jury indicted Vennitti for leaving the scene of a fatal crash and driving without a license.

The bill, co-sponsored by Council Members James Gennaro and Lynn Schulman, follows a press conference where lawmakers denounced the program as hazardous. Gennaro said, "The program, as designed, leads to chaos." Ung called her bill a last resort. Assembly Members Sam Berger and David Weprin, and Community Board 8 Chair Martha Taylor, joined the opposition, citing sidewalk clutter and lack of outreach. However, DOT data contradicts their claims: since the program's June launch, 37,000 riders have taken 290,000 trips with no reported serious injuries or deaths. DOT says it held 35 briefings and implemented parking corrals in dense areas.
