Fourteen Dead. Zero Answers.</h1><p class="byline f6 silver">Written June 4, 2025 <em>(Revised June 18, 2025 – Updated period stats)</em></p></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>AD 27: Jan 1, 2022 - Jun 4, 2025</h2><h3 id=the-bodies-in-the-road>The Bodies in the Road</h3><p>In Assembly District 27, violence comes in pieces. Fourteen dead. Thirty with injuries so grave they are called serious. Over three years, 3,648 crashes. These are not just numbers—they are people who never come home. A cyclist’s legs crushed by a turning car. A pedestrian thrown from his car and left to die on the expressway. A child struck by a distracted driver. The pain does not fade. It spreads.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage: five deaths, ten serious injuries, sixty-six more with broken bones or worse. Trucks and buses follow, with two more serious injuries. Motorcycles and bikes are not spared, but the carnage is driven by the largest, fastest machines. The street is not safe for the old, the young, or anyone who walks or rides.</p><h3 id=leadership-missing-in-action>Leadership: Missing in Action</h3><p>Assembly Member Sam Berger has not led. When a bill came to put speed cameras near schools in Schenectady, Berger was excused—<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">missing a chance to boost school zone safety</a>. When Queens politicians lined up to kill the e-scooter share, Berger joined them, ignoring the data: <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/17/queens-pols-have-lots-of-claims-about-the-evils-of-scooter-share-but-few-facts>&ldquo;37,000 riders, 290,000 trips, no reported serious injuries or deaths&rdquo;</a>. The program worked. Still, Berger stood with those who called it chaos.</p><p>Victims wait for justice. Families wait for action. In one crash, a man watched an Amazon truck hit his car and drive off. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/7-side-helps-get-repairs-covered-amazon-driver-allegedly-crashed-parked-car-drove-off/16474908/>&ldquo;He comes out, looks at it, shrugs his shoulders, and leaves. No note, nothing. No care for anyone else&rsquo;s property&rdquo;</a>.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p>The blood on the street is not an act of God. It is a choice. Every day without lower speed limits, every day without cameras, every day of silence from leaders is another day someone else pays the price.</p><p>Call Sam Berger. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets where children can walk and ride and live.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report states the pedestrian suffered severe head lacerations, with blood pooling on the street. The driver was cited for 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor. The narrative confirms the driver 'looked away for a moment' before the collision. The SUV showed no damage, but the impact left the pedestrian with significant injuries. No mention is made of pedestrian error or behavior contributing to the crash.

The Mercedes, registered in New Jersey and driven by a Florida-licensed male, was 'changing lanes' before impact, while the Hyundai was 'going straight ahead.' The police report lists 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' and 'Unsafe Speed' as contributing factors. The Hyundai’s left rear bumper was struck by the Mercedes’ right front bumper. An 82-year-old male driver, belted in, suffered severe facial bleeding but remained conscious. The report does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor.
