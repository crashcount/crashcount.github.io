A year later, cops arrested a 63‑year‑old man. “A grand jury indicted [Vennitti] on charges of leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death and driving without a license,” the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/05/queens-whitestone-expressway-hit-and-run-crash-unlicensed-james-vennitti-david-berney/>Daily News reported</a>.

Slow the expressway fronts and ramps near homes and shops. Daylight the corners. Harden the turns. Give walkers the head start at signals. Focus enforcement when the harm hits: late night and early morning at the known hotspots. The district analysis flags “nighttime conditions” and “repeat hotspots.” Treat them like it.</p><p>—</p><h3 id=citywide-tools-that-work>Citywide tools that work</h3><p>Albany extended New York City’s 24‑hour school‑zone speed‑camera program this June, through bill <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>S 8344</a>. With cameras secured, the next lever is speed itself. A citywide 20 MPH default on neighborhood streets and intelligent speed assistance for the worst repeat offenders would cut the risk. In New York, a tiny share of drivers do outsized harm: just <strong>1.5%</strong> of motorists cause <strong>21%</strong> of pedestrian deaths; vehicles with <strong>16 camera tickets in 12 months</strong> are twice as likely to kill or seriously injure, and <strong>30+ tickets</strong> multiplies the risk fifty‑fold, per <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/20/the-1-5-percent-of-drivers-who-cause-21-percent-of-pedestrian-deaths>Streetsblog’s analysis</a>. Our action guide lays out both moves and who to call.
