Police coded the Aug 23 death to driver inattention/distraction (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Across this district, police records also show failure to yield and inattention among the named factors in injury crashes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Nights and late afternoons are deadly: multiple deaths cluster around midnight, 1–2 AM, 4 PM, and 8–10 PM in the district’s records (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>On the map, danger piles up on the expressways that cut through this district: Whitestone Expressway, the Van Wyck, the Long Island Expressway, and the Grand Central Parkway account for some of the heaviest tolls in the data (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Street fixes can slow the hits. Daylighting corners. Hardened left turns. Leading pedestrian intervals. Tight curb radii. Night-focused enforcement at repeat hot spots. These are standard tools. Use them where people are getting hurt.</p><p>The bus map just changed. Riders were still adjusting as the redesign hit its first weekday in Queens (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/queens-bus-network-redesign-faces-1st-weekday-commute/>CBS New York</a>). Streets serve people on foot and on buses first, or they fail.</p><p>Power sits nearby. Assembly Member Sam Berger represents this area. On Jun 17, he was marked “excused” when Albany advanced a bill to extend and fix school speed‑zone rules (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Open States</a>). Last fall, he also appeared with local officials who opposed the Queens e‑scooter share despite the city’s safety data at the time (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/17/queens-pols-have-lots-of-claims-about-the-evils-of-scooter-share-but-few-facts>Streetsblog NYC</a>). What gives?</p><p>Two moves would cut repeat harm. First, drop speeds where people live and walk. Second, stop the worst repeat speeders. Our city already has the tools. The Council can use Sammy’s Law authority to lower limits, and Albany can pass the Stop Super Speeders Act to put speed limiters on the cars of habitual offenders. The case is laid out <a href=/take_action/>here</a>.</p><p>The man on United Nations Ave S is gone. The data shows where the next ones will be. Act now, or count another.</p><p>Take one step today. Tell City Hall and Albany to slow our streets and rein in repeat speeders: <a href=/take_action/>Take action</a>.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
