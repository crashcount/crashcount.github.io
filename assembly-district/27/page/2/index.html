Slow the expressway fronts and ramps near homes and shops. Daylight the corners. Harden the turns. Give walkers the head start at signals.

With cameras secured, the next lever is speed itself. A citywide 20 MPH default on neighborhood streets and intelligent speed assistance for the worst repeat offenders would cut the risk. In New York, a tiny share of drivers do outsized harm: just <strong>1.5%</strong> of motorists cause <strong>21%</strong> of pedestrian deaths; vehicles with <strong>16 camera tickets in 12 months</strong> are twice as likely to kill or seriously injure, and <strong>30+ tickets</strong> multiplies the risk fifty‑fold, per <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/20/the-1-5-percent-of-drivers-who-cause-21-percent-of-pedestrian-deaths>Streetsblog’s analysis</a>.
