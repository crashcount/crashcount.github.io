Police coded the Aug 23 death to driver inattention/distraction (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Across this district, police records also show failure to yield and inattention among the named factors in injury crashes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Nights and late afternoons are deadly: multiple deaths cluster around midnight, 1–2 AM, 4 PM, and 8–10 PM in the district’s records (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>On the map, danger piles up on the expressways that cut through this district: Whitestone Expressway, the Van Wyck, the Long Island Expressway, and the Grand Central Parkway account for some of the heaviest tolls in the data (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Street fixes can slow the hits.

Last fall, he also appeared with local officials who opposed the Queens e‑scooter share despite the city’s safety data at the time (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/17/queens-pols-have-lots-of-claims-about-the-evils-of-scooter-share-but-few-facts>Streetsblog NYC</a>). What gives?</p><p>Two moves would cut repeat harm. First, drop speeds where people live and walk. Second, stop the worst repeat speeders. Our city already has the tools. The Council can use Sammy’s Law authority to lower limits, and Albany can pass the Stop Super Speeders Act to put speed limiters on the cars of habitual offenders. The case is laid out <a href=/take_action/>here</a>.</p><p>The man on United Nations Ave S is gone. The data shows where the next ones will be. Act now, or count another.</p><p>Take one step today.
