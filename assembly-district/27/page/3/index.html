Ten left with life-altering injuries. In the last twelve months, Assembly District 27 has seen 1,218 crashes. The numbers are blunt. They do not flinch. Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians—no one is spared.</p><p>A man steps from his car on the Whitestone Expressway. He is struck, thrown, and left dead in the road. The driver flees. His sister waits a year for justice. “Berney died at the scene,” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/05/queens-whitestone-expressway-hit-and-run-crash-unlicensed-james-vennitti-david-berney/>the report reads</a>. The killer is unlicensed. The law is slow.</p><p>On a Friday morning, an MTA bus jumps the curb in Flushing. Seven are hurt. A mother with a baby says, “That would be scary. I&rsquo;ll be more cautious of my surroundings.” <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>She is quoted</a>. The bus takes down a pole. The city shrugs. The accident remains under investigation.</p><h2 id=patterns-that-do-not-change>Patterns That Do Not Change</h2><p>Most deaths come from cars and SUVs. In three years, sedans and SUVs killed five pedestrians and left hundreds more injured. Trucks, motorcycles, and bikes add to the toll, but the steel and speed of cars do the worst. The numbers do not lie. They do not forgive.</p><h2 id=leadership-present-in-name-absent-in-action>Leadership: Present in Name, Absent in Action</h2><p>Assembly Member Sam Berger missed vote after vote on bills that would have made school zones safer. He was absent when the Assembly moved to extend speed zone protections for children. He was silent when bus regulation exemptions advanced. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>The record shows</a> absence, not action.</p><p>When the city debated e-scooter safety, Berger joined those calling for bans, despite no evidence of harm from the program. The data showed 290,000 trips and not a single serious injury or death. Still, Berger stood with those who would rather ban than build safer streets. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/17/queens-pols-have-lots-of-claims-about-the-evils-of-scooter-share-but-few-facts>The facts are clear</a>.</p><h2 id=what-must-change>What Must Change</h2><p>This is not fate. It is failure. Every crash is a policy not passed, a street not fixed, a leader not moved. Call Assembly Member Berger. Demand he show up, vote, and fight for the living. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
