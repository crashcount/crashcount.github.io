Barriers force drivers to slow, protect cyclists, and clear sightlines. Seventy-nine crashes last year on Ocean Avenue alone. The city moves slow, but hard edges cut risk where cars once ruled.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC reported on June 12, 2025, that the Department of Transportation will install hard barriers at six Brooklyn intersections to protect cyclists and pedestrians. The new design 'daylights' corners, using concrete, granite, and planters to keep cars back and create mini-protected bike lanes. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' The agency targeted intersections with a history of turning crashes—Ocean Avenue saw 79 crashes in 2024, injuring 75 people, including 15 pedestrians and 13 cyclists. Advocates praised the move but called for faster, broader use of hard infrastructure. The article notes that most pedestrian injuries and deaths in New York occur at intersections, and that keeping corners clear is standard in other states. DOT opposes removing parking without barriers, citing risks of faster, more dangerous turns.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states she was 'crossing with the light' and was in the crosswalk at the time of impact. The collision resulted in fatal injuries to the pedestrian, who died at the scene. The police report explicitly cites 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as the contributing factor on the part of the sedan driver. The vehicle's point of impact was the center front end, matching the narrative of a direct, forceful collision. The victim's behavior—crossing with the signal—is noted in the report, but the primary cause remains the driver's failure to yield. The crash underscores the lethal consequences when drivers disregard pedestrian right-of-way at intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

On June 7, 2023, Governor Hochul expressed sympathy for hunger-striking mothers but refused to pressure Speaker Carl Heastie, who blocks the bill from a vote. The bill passed the Senate and has City Council and mayoral support. The matter summary: 'Hochul has previously expressed support for Sammy's Law, which would allow New York City to set its speed limits below 25 miles per hour.' Amy Cohen, a mother and advocate, demanded action, showing Heastie photos of victims. Seven new Assembly members, including Yudelka Tapia, Al Taylor, Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn, and Brian Cunningham, now back the bill, giving it majority support among NYC Assembly members. Still, the Speaker’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed to speeding drivers and systemic danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
