Steel and stone replace painted lines.</p><p class=mb3>The Brooklyn Paper reported on June 11, 2025, that NYC DOT will redesign intersections to protect cyclists and pedestrians. The plan uses 'hardened daylighting'—physical barriers, granite blocks, and planters—to stop cars from parking near corners. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' Nearly half of city traffic deaths happen at intersections, often due to blocked sightlines and turning vehicles. The redesign targets high-crash Brooklyn intersections first, including Ocean Avenue at Church Avenue. The move highlights the city's shift from painted lines to physical infrastructure, aiming to reduce systemic risk for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No bill number or committee was cited. The matter: 'The Bedford Avenue protected bike lane is facing opposition from key figures in the Brooklyn Democratic machine.' Council Members Lincoln Restler and Chi Oss support the lane. Former Adams chief of staff Frank Carone and Brooklyn party chair Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn lead the opposition. Mayor Eric Adams calls for listening to bike lane critics. Challenger Sabrina Gates wants the lane rerouted. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez defends the lane’s safety record. A safety analyst warns: 'Threats to protected bike lanes undermine safe infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians, potentially reducing mode shift and safety in numbers while increasing risk for vulnerable road users.'

The article quotes Councilmember Farrah Louis: "It appeared the driver was driving and hit the gas instead of the brakes, trying to avoid another car, and that's how he crashed." No students were on the bus at the time. The victims were hospitalized with serious injuries. Witnesses described the bus waiting for a pedestrian before suddenly jumping the curb and smashing through the fence. The incident highlights ongoing traffic dangers in the area and raises questions about driver error and the need for improved street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The collision occurred at 18:06, when the teen stepped into the roadway outside a crosswalk or signal. The report states, 'A southbound SUV hits him head-on. The bumper strikes his face. He falls. Blood spills. He is awake, bleeding, cut deep.' Police cite 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor, underscoring the driver’s failure to notice or respond to the pedestrian in time. The report also lists 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a secondary factor, but the primary cause remains the driver’s lack of attention. The impact left the teen conscious but badly injured, highlighting the persistent threat posed by inattentive driving on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

No council bill number applies, but the saga unfolded across 2023 and 2024, with City Hall’s powerful aide Ingrid Lewis-Martin at the center. The matter: 'What role did a single bike lane play in Ingrid Lewis-Martin's undoing?' Lewis-Martin, Mayor Adams’s closest advisor, fought the road diet and bike lane, siding with Broadway Stages and its CEO Gina Argento, who opposed the plan. Under their pressure, Adams abandoned the Department of Transportation’s safety design. After both women’s phones were seized in a corruption probe, City Hall reversed course and advanced the safety project. The episode exposes how political interference delayed life-saving street changes, leaving vulnerable road users exposed to ongoing danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The saga unfolded as City Hall, under pressure from Broadway Stages and its donors, repeatedly stalled or watered down the Department of Transportation’s plan to calm the deadly Brooklyn roadway. The matter’s summary: 'Under pressure from Broadway Stages, Mayor Adams abandoned his own Department of Transportation's plan to calm the notoriously dangerous Brooklyn roadway.' Despite neighborhood support and a history of fatal crashes, City Hall intervened, delaying life-saving changes. Bichotte Hermelyn appeared alongside DOT Commissioner Rodriguez at a meeting dominated by project opponents. The watered-down redesign, installed north of Calyer Street, did 'nothing' for pedestrian safety, according to local officials. The pattern: political influence trumped safety, leaving vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Restler and activists stood firm.</p><p class=mb3>On June 16, 2023, a contentious town hall convened over the city’s proposed safety redesign for McGuinness Boulevard. The meeting, billed as an 'awareness town hall,' was dominated by opponents, including Assembly Member Rodneyse Bichotte-Hermelyn and business leaders like Tony Argento of Broadway Stages. Bichotte-Hermelyn, whose district is far from the site, admitted limited knowledge of the plan but cited business concerns. The session excluded supporters of the redesign, who rallied outside. The Department of Transportation defended its proposal to reduce lanes and add parking-protected bike lanes, citing proven safety benefits. Council Member Lincoln Restler and activists later rallied for the overhaul, insisting that safety for all road users must not be compromised. The event highlighted deep divisions and the influence of business interests over street safety reforms.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
