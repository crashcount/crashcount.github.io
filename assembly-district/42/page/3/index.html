The worst hours sit at the <strong>evening commute</strong>: 5 pm through 8 pm brings the most injuries and many of the deaths, with the single highest at 6 pm, then 5 pm and 7 pm close behind (hourly distribution via <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li></ul><p>Nearly half of city fatalities happen in intersections. DOT says it will harden corners with granite, concrete, and planters to clear sightlines, starting at high‑crash Brooklyn sites. “Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other,” said Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/nyc-dot-cyclist-safety-intersections/>The Brooklyn Paper</a>; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/12/dot-unveils-safer-intersection-design-mini-protected-bike-lanes-at-corners>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><h3 id=names-behind-the-numbers>Names behind the numbers</h3><ul><li>March 7, 2024.

Bedford and Farragut. A school bus jumped the curb and hit a woman and an 8‑year‑old boy. “Hit the gas instead of the brakes,” the driver told police. The child’s arm broke. They lived. “We do know we need more traffic safety in this area,” said Council Member Farah Louis (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/woman-8-year-old-boy-struck-school-bus-flatbush-brooklyn/16148988/>ABC7</a>; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/school-bus-crashes-into-brooklyn-fence/>CBS New York</a>).</p><h3 id=what-keeps-killing-here>What keeps killing here</h3><p>The small‑area data name the killers: “other” factors top the chart, but one code repeats in the dead—failure to yield at turns.

DOT says it’s coming; hold them to it (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/nyc-dot-cyclist-safety-intersections/>The Brooklyn Paper</a>).</li><li>Left‑turn protection and slower signal timing at the intersections with repeated turning deaths (failure‑to‑yield crashes in the data; <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>Truck routing and enforcement on Tilden and Bedford, where a dump truck killed a woman in the crosswalk (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash 4707890</a>).</li></ul><p>Citywide steps that end the pattern:</p><ul><li>The Council can set safer speeds under Sammy’s Law. A 20 mph default saves lives. Our <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a> page has the script.</li><li>Albany has a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters (Stop Super Speeders). Call your reps. It targets the tiny group that does outsized harm (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/20/the-1-5-percent-of-drivers-who-cause-21-percent-of-pedestrian-deaths>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</li></ul><h3 id=the-ask>The ask</h3><p>Ten dead in three years and eight months.

The move comes after a reckless driver killed a baby and injured her mother. Officials and neighbors pushed for this change. Cars lose space. Pedestrians gain safety.</p><p class=mb3>On February 22, 2022, DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez confirmed the conversion of Gates Avenue’s stub end into 'Apolline's Garden,' a pedestrian plaza. The announcement followed a virtual Vanderbilt Avenue Block Association meeting. The plaza honors Apolline Mong-Guillemin, a 3-month-old killed by a wrong-way driver on September 11, 2021. Rodriguez stated, 'Traffic violence is a solvable crisis and I'm committed to carrying out Mayor's Adams's safety vision [by] expanding pedestrian plazas and open streets.' Assembly Member Rodneyse Bichotte called for unity, saying, 'There is no doubt that the creation of Apolline's Garden is the appropriate answer to honor the short life of this 3-month-old baby.' The plan aligns with the NYC 25X25 initiative to reclaim street space for pedestrians and cyclists. Community leaders and officials support the plaza as a step to prevent future tragedy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
