In the last twelve months, <strong>583 people were hurt in crashes</strong>. Seven were left with injuries so grave they may never walk the same. Two people died last year. This year, so far, none. But the cost is not measured in zeros. It is measured in broken arms, in mothers clutching their children on the curb, in the sound of sirens at dawn.</p><p>A school bus jumped the curb at Bedford Avenue and Farragut Road. A woman and her eight-year-old son were walking. The bus hit them, then smashed through a fence. The boy’s arm broke. His mother’s neck and hip screamed with pain. &ldquo;The bus was waiting because a pedestrian was in front&mldr; and all of a sudden we heard a boom. [The bus] jumped over the pavement and crashed,&rdquo; a witness <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/school-bus-crashes-into-brooklyn-fence/>told CBS New York</a>. The driver told police he hit the gas instead of the brakes. No charges. The street remains the same (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/woman-8-year-old-boy-struck-school-bus-flatbush-brooklyn/16148988/>ABC7</a>).</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-weight>Who Bears the Weight</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price.</strong> In three years, nine people have died on these streets. Over 2,000 have been injured. Cars and trucks caused most of the harm. SUVs, sedans, buses, and trucks. The numbers are not just numbers. They are the cost of walking to school, of crossing to the bodega, of riding home at dusk.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Assembly Member Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn has taken steps. She co-sponsored bills for safer streets, including <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">A 1077</a> for complete streets and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A803&amp;term=2025">A 803</a> for automated bike lane enforcement. She voted yes on <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">school speed cameras</a>. She backed <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/06/07/hunger-strike-day-2-gov-hochul-is-sympathetic-but-wont-pressure-heastie-on-sammys-law>Sammy’s Law</a>, giving New York City the power to lower speed limits. But when the fight came to Bedford Avenue, she stood with the party machine against a protected bike lane that could have saved lives (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/28/democratic-party-machine-joins-the-bikelash-on-bedford-avenue>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every delay, every watered-down bill, every bike lane blocked by politics, means another family waits for the call. &ldquo;We do know we need more traffic safety in this area,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/school-bus-crashes-into-brooklyn-fence/>said Councilmember Farrah Louis</a>.</p><p><strong>Call your Assembly Member. Demand safer streets. Demand action, not excuses.
