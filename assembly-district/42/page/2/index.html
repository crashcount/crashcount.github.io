She was semiconscious.</p><h3 id=this-week>This Week</h3><ul><li>Sep 12: A driver in a sedan struck a woman walking on Flatbush Avenue just after midnight; police listed passing as the pre-crash action and recorded severe bleeding (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>Sep 6: At Bedford Avenue and Farragut Road, a driver in an SUV turned left and hit a 23-year-old man not in the roadway; he was incoherent at the scene (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li></ul><h3 id=the-pattern-on-these-blocks>The pattern on these blocks</h3><p>Since 2022, <strong>11 people have been killed</strong> in Assembly District 42, including 8 people walking and 2 people on bikes. Another 636 people walking and 318 people on bikes were injured. These counts come from the same NYPD crash records that list the names of our streets and the times of day.</p><p>The danger pools at long corridors: Flatbush Avenue logged 184 injuries and 1 death; Nostrand Avenue 106 injuries and 1 death; Ocean Avenue 123 injuries. Bedford Avenue shows 88 injuries and 1 death. Evening hits hard: the 6 PM hour alone saw three deaths in this district. All drawn from the city’s open crash database (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Drivers failing to yield at turns keep killing people. On Mar 7, 2024 at Tilden Avenue and Bedford Avenue, a dump-truck driver turned right and killed a 58-year-old woman crossing with the signal; police recorded failure to yield by the driver (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYPD crash report</a>). On Apr 16, 2024 at Avenue D and New York Avenue, a sedan driver turning left killed a 74-year-old woman crossing with the signal; again, failure to yield by the driver (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). On Feb 25, 2024 at Beverley Road and Nostrand Avenue, a right-turning SUV driver killed a 45-year-old woman crossing with the signal; police recorded failure to yield (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=corners-that-hide-people>Corners that hide people</h3><p>Nearly half of city traffic deaths happen at intersections, and DOT says it will start hardening corners in Brooklyn with granite, concrete, and planters. “Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety,” said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/nyc-dot-cyclist-safety-intersections/>The Brooklyn Paper</a>). Advocates called it a start, and pushed for faster, broader use of hard infrastructure (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/12/dot-unveils-safer-intersection-design-mini-protected-bike-lanes-at-corners>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>Bedford and Farragut already saw what a big vehicle can do in a blink. On Apr 9, 2025, a school bus driver jumped the curb there and hit a mother and her 8-year-old son. “We do know we need more traffic safety in this area,” said Council Member Farah Louis at the scene (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/school-bus-crashes-into-brooklyn-fence/>CBS New York</a>).</p><p>Hardened daylighting at corners. Protected turns. Real materials, not paint. The fixes match the failures.</p><h3 id=power-and-responsibility>Power and responsibility</h3><p>Albany extended 24-hour school-zone speed protections this June. Assembly Member <a href=/assembly-district/42/>Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn</a> voted yes on <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>S 8344</a> (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Open States</a>). That keeps one guardrail in place near schools.</p><p>But people are dying on our wider streets and at our corners. The city has the tools it says it will use at high-crash intersections in Brooklyn (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/nyc-dot-cyclist-safety-intersections/>The Brooklyn Paper</a>). The district’s worst hours and corridors are known in the crash logs (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>One more lever sits above all this: slower speeds and checks on the worst repeat offenders. New Yorkers can press for a lower default speed and for mandatory speed limiters for habitual speeders. Details and scripts are <a href=/take_action/>here</a>.</p><p>The woman on Flatbush is still a file in the system. The corner is still there.

Council Member Restler and activists stood firm.</p><p class=mb3>On June 16, 2023, a contentious town hall convened over the city’s proposed safety redesign for McGuinness Boulevard. The meeting, billed as an 'awareness town hall,' was dominated by opponents, including Assembly Member Rodneyse Bichotte-Hermelyn and business leaders like Tony Argento of Broadway Stages. Bichotte-Hermelyn, whose district is far from the site, admitted limited knowledge of the plan but cited business concerns. The session excluded supporters of the redesign, who rallied outside. The Department of Transportation defended its proposal to reduce lanes and add parking-protected bike lanes, citing proven safety benefits. Council Member Lincoln Restler and activists later rallied for the overhaul, insisting that safety for all road users must not be compromised. The event highlighted deep divisions and the influence of business interests over street safety reforms.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lawmakers stall. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>Sammy’s Law, stalled in the New York State Assembly, would let New York City set speed limits below 25 mph. On June 7, 2023, Governor Hochul expressed sympathy for hunger-striking mothers but refused to pressure Speaker Carl Heastie, who blocks the bill from a vote. The bill passed the Senate and has City Council and mayoral support. The matter summary: 'Hochul has previously expressed support for Sammy's Law, which would allow New York City to set its speed limits below 25 miles per hour.' Amy Cohen, a mother and advocate, demanded action, showing Heastie photos of victims. Seven new Assembly members, including Yudelka Tapia, Al Taylor, Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn, and Brian Cunningham, now back the bill, giving it majority support among NYC Assembly members. Still, the Speaker’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed to speeding drivers and systemic danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
