The meeting, billed as an 'awareness town hall,' was dominated by opponents, including Assembly Member Rodneyse Bichotte-Hermelyn and business leaders like Tony Argento of Broadway Stages. Bichotte-Hermelyn, whose district is far from the site, admitted limited knowledge of the plan but cited business concerns. The session excluded supporters of the redesign, who rallied outside. The Department of Transportation defended its proposal to reduce lanes and add parking-protected bike lanes, citing proven safety benefits. Council Member Lincoln Restler and activists later rallied for the overhaul, insisting that safety for all road users must not be compromised. The event highlighted deep divisions and the influence of business interests over street safety reforms.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Amy Cohen, a mother and advocate, demanded action, showing Heastie photos of victims. Seven new Assembly members, including Yudelka Tapia, Al Taylor, Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn, and Brian Cunningham, now back the bill, giving it majority support among NYC Assembly members.

The move comes after a reckless driver killed a baby and injured her mother. Officials and neighbors pushed for this change. Cars lose space. Pedestrians gain safety.</p><p class=mb3>On February 22, 2022, DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez confirmed the conversion of Gates Avenue’s stub end into 'Apolline's Garden,' a pedestrian plaza. The announcement followed a virtual Vanderbilt Avenue Block Association meeting. The plaza honors Apolline Mong-Guillemin, a 3-month-old killed by a wrong-way driver on September 11, 2021. Rodriguez stated, 'Traffic violence is a solvable crisis and I'm committed to carrying out Mayor's Adams's safety vision [by] expanding pedestrian plazas and open streets.' Assembly Member Rodneyse Bichotte called for unity, saying, 'There is no doubt that the creation of Apolline's Garden is the appropriate answer to honor the short life of this 3-month-old baby.' The plan aligns with the NYC 25X25 initiative to reclaim street space for pedestrians and cyclists. Community leaders and officials support the plaza as a step to prevent future tragedy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
