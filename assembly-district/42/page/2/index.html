Twenty-two left with serious injuries. Over 2,100 hurt.</strong> These are not numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors. They are the boy with a broken arm, the woman with pain in her neck and hip, both struck by a school bus that jumped the curb at Bedford Avenue and Farragut Road this spring. The bus driver said he &ldquo;hit the gas instead of the brakes&rdquo; and smashed through a fence. The boy and his mother survived, but their lives are changed <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/woman-8-year-old-boy-struck-school-bus-flatbush-brooklyn/16148988/>forever</a>.</p><p>On Avenue D, a 74-year-old woman crossing with the signal was killed by a sedan making a left turn. On Tilden Avenue, a truck turned right and crushed a 58-year-old woman in the crosswalk. <strong>Most of the dead and injured were walking. Most were doing everything right.</strong></p><h2 id=the-system-favors-steel-over-flesh>The System Favors Steel Over Flesh</h2><p><strong>SUVs and sedans caused the most harm:</strong> 417 crashes, 3 deaths, 8 serious injuries. Trucks and buses killed three more. Bikes and mopeds injured, but did not kill. The street is not a fair fight. &ldquo;Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety,&rdquo; said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez as the city rolled out new intersection designs in Brooklyn <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/nyc-dot-cyclist-safety-intersections/>this June</a>. But the pace is slow. The danger remains.</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-silence-and-the-road-ahead>Leadership: Votes, Silence, and the Road Ahead</h2><p>Assembly Member Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn voted to extend school speed zones, a move that keeps children safer near schools. She co-sponsored bills for bike lane cameras and broader street safety. But she also voted to weaken bus rules, a step that puts pedestrians and cyclists at risk. When the city tried to build a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue, Hermelyn <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/28/democratic-party-machine-joins-the-bikelash-on-bedford-avenue>stood with the party machine</a> against it. <strong>Every delay, every watered-down plan, means more families left to pick up the pieces.</strong></p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>This is not fate.

The meeting, billed as an 'awareness town hall,' was dominated by opponents, including Assembly Member Rodneyse Bichotte-Hermelyn and business leaders like Tony Argento of Broadway Stages. Bichotte-Hermelyn, whose district is far from the site, admitted limited knowledge of the plan but cited business concerns. The session excluded supporters of the redesign, who rallied outside. The Department of Transportation defended its proposal to reduce lanes and add parking-protected bike lanes, citing proven safety benefits. Council Member Lincoln Restler and activists later rallied for the overhaul, insisting that safety for all road users must not be compromised. The event highlighted deep divisions and the influence of business interests over street safety reforms.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

On June 7, 2023, Governor Hochul expressed sympathy for hunger-striking mothers but refused to pressure Speaker Carl Heastie, who blocks the bill from a vote. The bill passed the Senate and has City Council and mayoral support. The matter summary: 'Hochul has previously expressed support for Sammy's Law, which would allow New York City to set its speed limits below 25 miles per hour.' Amy Cohen, a mother and advocate, demanded action, showing Heastie photos of victims. Seven new Assembly members, including Yudelka Tapia, Al Taylor, Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn, and Brian Cunningham, now back the bill, giving it majority support among NYC Assembly members.

The announcement followed a virtual Vanderbilt Avenue Block Association meeting. The plaza honors Apolline Mong-Guillemin, a 3-month-old killed by a wrong-way driver on September 11, 2021. Rodriguez stated, 'Traffic violence is a solvable crisis and I'm committed to carrying out Mayor's Adams's safety vision [by] expanding pedestrian plazas and open streets.' Assembly Member Rodneyse Bichotte called for unity, saying, 'There is no doubt that the creation of Apolline's Garden is the appropriate answer to honor the short life of this 3-month-old baby.' The plan aligns with the NYC 25X25 initiative to reclaim street space for pedestrians and cyclists.
