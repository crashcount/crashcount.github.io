The report states the moped's front end 'folded in' from the impact, leaving the 41-year-old unlicensed rider trapped with crushed legs. The rider was conscious at the scene, suffering severe lower leg injuries. Police records confirm the SUV was parked and unoccupied at the time of the crash. The report notes the moped operator was 'unlicensed,' and lists 'unspecified' as contributing factors, but does not cite any victim behavior as a cause. No other injuries were reported.
