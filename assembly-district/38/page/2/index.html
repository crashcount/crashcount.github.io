Hoylman-Sigal, the bill’s sponsor, said, 'Senators in Massapequa shouldn’t set the speed limit for Manhattan—or the reverse.' The law is named for Sammy Cohen Eckstein, a 12-year-old killed by a car in Brooklyn. The bill had stalled before, but this year the required home rule resolution was submitted.

The crash report lists 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as a contributing factor. The police narrative describes the rider's helmet splitting and blood pooling on the street as emergency crews arrived. The data does not cite any errors by the motorcyclist. The only listed rider factor is helmet use, noted after the SUV driver's failure to yield.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The agency cited 'raised crosswalks, pedestrian-only signal timing, new lane markings and other lane redesigns' as part of its response. Council Member Bob Holden, speaking at the scene, pressed for longer crossing times, raised crosswalks, and enforcement against illegal parking and reckless driving. Assembly Member Jenifer Rajkumar called the situation 'traffic violence,' demanding stronger city control over speed limits and cameras. The redesign is part of Mayor Adams's plan to fix 1,000 dangerous intersections. Residents and advocates highlighted the ongoing threat from large vehicles and a culture of reckless driving. DOT has already installed a pedestrian-only signal phase at the site.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
