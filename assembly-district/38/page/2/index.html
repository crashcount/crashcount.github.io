Six seriously hurt.</strong> In the last year alone, Assembly District 38 has seen 1,006 crashes. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about the weather, the hour, or the name of the street. They only climb.</p><p>Just last week, a 23-year-old man was run down on 101st Street and Liberty Boulevard. Police said, &ldquo;Sonalall approached the driver&rsquo;s side window and flashed what appeared to be a gun, startling the motorist to the point that he drove off, striking the menace&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/08/01/us-news/man-23-fatally-run-over-by-ex-girlfriends-new-beau-in-love-triangle-clash-on-nyc-street-cops/>according to the New York Post</a>. The DA did not charge the driver. Another life ended in the street.</p><p>In June, a man in his 50s was left fighting for his life after a black SUV hit him and kept going. &ldquo;Police say the victim was struck by a black SUV traveling eastbound on 101st Avenue that kept going&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/ozone-park-hit-run-crash-pedestrian-struck-critically-injured-collision-queens-nyc/16780134/>reported ABC7</a>.

In the last twelve months, <strong>74 children were injured</strong>. No child lost their life. SUVs and cars did the most damage: <strong>six deaths, 239 minor injuries, 46 moderate injuries, four serious injuries</strong>. Motorcycles and mopeds killed one, bikes left seven hurt. The streets are not safe for the small or the slow.</p><h3 id=what-has-rajkumar-done>What Has Rajkumar Done?</h3><p>Assembly Member Jenifer Rajkumar voted to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>extend school speed zones</a>, a move to protect children near schools. She co-sponsored bills to boost street safety for all users. But she also pushed for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/04/11/reckless-rajkumar-queens-pol-and-adams-allys-car-slapped-with-9-speeding-tix>e-bike registration and insurance</a>, a policy that burdens delivery workers and shifts blame from drivers to the most vulnerable. Her own office car racked up ten school-zone speeding tickets in a year. The law is slow to change. The street is not.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay means another family broken.</strong> Call Rajkumar. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real street redesigns. Demand action that protects people, not just drivers. The dead cannot speak.

The bills are not yet law and have not advanced through committee. Rajkumar, a close ally of Mayor Adams, claims e-bikes are a 'singular threat' and a 'safety hazard,' citing injury numbers that city data does not support. She stated, 'We have to get rid of the e-bike problem.' Despite her focus on e-bikes, a car used by Rajkumar’s office received 10 school-zone speeding tickets in under a year. Her spokesperson denied she drives the car, later confirmed to belong to her chief of staff. Rajkumar declined further comment. The push for e-bike regulation comes as cars continue to inflict the greatest harm on New York’s streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The moped rider, a 31-year-old man, suffered severe head injuries and was partially ejected, bleeding heavily but conscious. The police report cites 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as contributing factors, underscoring the moped driver's dangerous actions. The rider was unlicensed and wore no helmet, as noted in the report, but these details follow the primary driver errors. The sedan driver, licensed and traveling south, was also involved.

The bill follows a surge in deadly e-bike crashes—23 deaths last year, up from nine in 2022. The city’s new campaign, 'get smart before you start,' aims to educate riders on safe operation. Rajkumar’s bill drew immediate opposition from delivery workers. Gustavo Ajche of Los Deliveristas Unidos said, 'We're deeply disappointed to see local and state leaders introduce legislation that would put the burden of penalty on delivery workers rather than trying to regulate the app companies.' The campaign and bill highlight a growing rift: who shoulders the cost of safety—workers or the corporations that profit from their labor?</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brad Hoylman-Sigal and other NYC officials lobbied the state legislature to pass key transportation and housing bills before the session ends June 9. The centerpiece is 'Sammy’s Law,' which would let New York City set its own speed limits, potentially lowering them to 20 mph. Hoylman-Sigal, the bill’s sponsor, said, 'Senators in Massapequa shouldn’t set the speed limit for Manhattan—or the reverse.' The law is named for Sammy Cohen Eckstein, a 12-year-old killed by a car in Brooklyn. The bill had stalled before, but this year the required home rule resolution was submitted. Mayor Adams’ administration also pushed for affordable housing reforms. The push for Sammy’s Law is a fight to give NYC control over its streets and protect vulnerable road users from deadly speeding.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The redesign is part of Mayor Adams's plan to fix 1,000 dangerous intersections. Residents and advocates highlighted the ongoing threat from large vehicles and a culture of reckless driving.
