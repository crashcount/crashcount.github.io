Four hundred sixty injured. Three seriously hurt.</strong> That is the cost of traffic violence in Assembly District 38 in the last year alone. These numbers are not just statistics—they are mothers, sons, neighbors. On March 28, Zhihong Shi, 31, stepped out of a car on Atlantic Avenue. A van veered out of control. Metal struck flesh. Shi died at Jamaica Hospital. The van driver had suffered a medical episode. The street did not forgive. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/29/man-killed-woodhaven-queens-crash-driver-medical-episode/>&ldquo;Shi and the other victims, ages 67 and 48, were all rushed to Jamaica Hospital, but Shi could not be saved.&rdquo;</a></p><p>On April 25, Breanna Henderson, 23, tried to cross Myrtle Avenue at Woodhaven Boulevard.

The bigger the vehicle, the greater the harm.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-and-stumbles>Leadership: Steps and Stumbles</h2><p>Assembly Member Jenifer Rajkumar has voted to extend school speed zones and expand speed cameras, moves that protect children and walkers. She co-sponsored bills to build safer streets for all users. But she also backed measures to register and license e-bikes—laws that shift the burden to the most vulnerable, not the most dangerous. She called for a &ldquo;new era free of e-bikes blasting through red lights,&rdquo; but the deadliest vehicles are not bikes. They are cars and trucks. The silence is loud when it comes to lowering speed limits or reining in repeat speeders.</p><h2 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another family broken.</strong> Call Assembly Member Rajkumar.

The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, saw candidates who championed 'the importance of bike lanes, public transit, and open streets' win across the city. Council members Lincoln Restler, Shahana Hanif, Shekar Krishnan, Chi Oss, Crystal Hudson, and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams all prevailed on platforms supporting safer streets. Mark Levine, who called for bold highway changes, won the Comptroller race. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text is a vague statement of support for livable streets but does not describe a specific policy action or legislative change, so its direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists cannot be determined.' The victories signal a mandate for people-first streets, but concrete safety gains depend on future action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The legislature dropped a mandate for daylighting—banning parking at corners near elementary schools—deferring instead to New York City, where Council Member Julie Won’s universal daylighting bill faces opposition from the Department of Transportation. Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, herself a crash survivor, vowed to keep fighting for daylighting, saying, 'I think daylighting would have helped me.' Hochul’s proposals to let the city set lower bike lane speed limits and to reclassify heavy e-bikes as mopeds were also cut. Critics argued these would not address core safety issues. The Adams administration opposes a City Council bill for e-bike registration and plates, while State Sen. Jenifer Rajkumar’s state version would shift licensing to the DMV. As Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives put it, 'A daylighting requirement would have made intersections safer around elementary schools, and it’s disappointing that this provision was cut from the New York State budget.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The road stayed still. His body did not.' The contributing factor listed in the police report is 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion,' with no specific driver error cited for the other vehicle. The report notes the motorcyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this detail is mentioned only after the description of the crash mechanics and contributing factors.

The bills are not yet law and have not advanced through committee. Rajkumar, a close ally of Mayor Adams, claims e-bikes are a 'singular threat' and a 'safety hazard,' citing injury numbers that city data does not support. She stated, 'We have to get rid of the e-bike problem.' Despite her focus on e-bikes, a car used by Rajkumar’s office received 10 school-zone speeding tickets in under a year. Her spokesperson denied she drives the car, later confirmed to belong to her chief of staff. Rajkumar declined further comment. The push for e-bike regulation comes as cars continue to inflict the greatest harm on New York’s streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The rider was unlicensed and wore no helmet, as noted in the report, but these details follow the primary driver errors. The sedan driver, licensed and traveling south, was also involved.

The bill follows a surge in deadly e-bike crashes—23 deaths last year, up from nine in 2022. The city’s new campaign, 'get smart before you start,' aims to educate riders on safe operation. Rajkumar’s bill drew immediate opposition from delivery workers. Gustavo Ajche of Los Deliveristas Unidos said, 'We're deeply disappointed to see local and state leaders introduce legislation that would put the burden of penalty on delivery workers rather than trying to regulate the app companies.' The campaign and bill highlight a growing rift: who shoulders the cost of safety—workers or the corporations that profit from their labor?</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
