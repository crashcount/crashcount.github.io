Vulnerable road users watch and wait.</p><p class=mb3>On June 25, 2025, New York City held local elections with major implications for street safety. The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, saw candidates who championed 'the importance of bike lanes, public transit, and open streets' win across the city. Council members Lincoln Restler, Shahana Hanif, Shekar Krishnan, Chi Oss, Crystal Hudson, and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams all prevailed on platforms supporting safer streets. Mark Levine, who called for bold highway changes, won the Comptroller race. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text is a vague statement of support for livable streets but does not describe a specific policy action or legislative change, so its direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists cannot be determined.' The victories signal a mandate for people-first streets, but concrete safety gains depend on future action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The system failed them again.</p><p class=mb3>On May 9, 2025, during New York State’s $254-million budget negotiations, lawmakers rejected Governor Hochul’s proposed street safety measures. The legislature dropped a mandate for daylighting—banning parking at corners near elementary schools—deferring instead to New York City, where Council Member Julie Won’s universal daylighting bill faces opposition from the Department of Transportation. Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, herself a crash survivor, vowed to keep fighting for daylighting, saying, 'I think daylighting would have helped me.' Hochul’s proposals to let the city set lower bike lane speed limits and to reclassify heavy e-bikes as mopeds were also cut. Critics argued these would not address core safety issues. The Adams administration opposes a City Council bill for e-bike registration and plates, while State Sen. Jenifer Rajkumar’s state version would shift licensing to the DMV. As Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives put it, 'A daylighting requirement would have made intersections safer around elementary schools, and it’s disappointing that this provision was cut from the New York State budget.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable road users face danger from both policy and reckless driving.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Member Jenifer Rajkumar introduced bills A9092 and A9114, aiming to require e-bike registration, insurance, and inspections. The bills are not yet law and have not advanced through committee. Rajkumar, a close ally of Mayor Adams, claims e-bikes are a 'singular threat' and a 'safety hazard,' citing injury numbers that city data does not support. She stated, 'We have to get rid of the e-bike problem.' Despite her focus on e-bikes, a car used by Rajkumar’s office received 10 school-zone speeding tickets in under a year. Her spokesperson denied she drives the car, later confirmed to belong to her chief of staff. Rajkumar declined further comment. The push for e-bike regulation comes as cars continue to inflict the greatest harm on New York’s streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The moped, traveling west, struck the sedan's left front quarter panel with force, folding in the car's side. The moped rider, a 31-year-old man, suffered severe head injuries and was partially ejected, bleeding heavily but conscious. The police report cites 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as contributing factors, underscoring the moped driver's dangerous actions. The rider was unlicensed and wore no helmet, as noted in the report, but these details follow the primary driver errors. The sedan driver, licensed and traveling south, was also involved. Noon sun, silent street—speed and disregard for traffic rules turned routine movement into trauma.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill follows a surge in deadly e-bike crashes—23 deaths last year, up from nine in 2022. The city’s new campaign, 'get smart before you start,' aims to educate riders on safe operation. Rajkumar’s bill drew immediate opposition from delivery workers. Gustavo Ajche of Los Deliveristas Unidos said, 'We're deeply disappointed to see local and state leaders introduce legislation that would put the burden of penalty on delivery workers rather than trying to regulate the app companies.' The campaign and bill highlight a growing rift: who shoulders the cost of safety—workers or the corporations that profit from their labor?</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
