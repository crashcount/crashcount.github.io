Six seriously hurt.</strong> In the last year alone, Assembly District 38 has seen 1,006 crashes. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about the weather, the hour, or the name of the street. They only climb.</p><p>Just last week, a 23-year-old man was run down on 101st Street and Liberty Boulevard. Police said, &ldquo;Sonalall approached the driver&rsquo;s side window and flashed what appeared to be a gun, startling the motorist to the point that he drove off, striking the menace&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/08/01/us-news/man-23-fatally-run-over-by-ex-girlfriends-new-beau-in-love-triangle-clash-on-nyc-street-cops/>according to the New York Post</a>. The DA did not charge the driver. Another life ended in the street.</p><p>In June, a man in his 50s was left fighting for his life after a black SUV hit him and kept going. &ldquo;Police say the victim was struck by a black SUV traveling eastbound on 101st Avenue that kept going&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/ozone-park-hit-run-crash-pedestrian-struck-critically-injured-collision-queens-nyc/16780134/>reported ABC7</a>.

In the last twelve months, <strong>74 children were injured</strong>. No child lost their life. SUVs and cars did the most damage: <strong>six deaths, 239 minor injuries, 46 moderate injuries, four serious injuries</strong>. Motorcycles and mopeds killed one, bikes left seven hurt. The streets are not safe for the small or the slow.</p><h3 id=what-has-rajkumar-done>What Has Rajkumar Done?</h3><p>Assembly Member Jenifer Rajkumar voted to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>extend school speed zones</a>, a move to protect children near schools. She co-sponsored bills to boost street safety for all users. But she also pushed for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/04/11/reckless-rajkumar-queens-pol-and-adams-allys-car-slapped-with-9-speeding-tix>e-bike registration and insurance</a>, a policy that burdens delivery workers and shifts blame from drivers to the most vulnerable. Her own office car racked up ten school-zone speeding tickets in a year. The law is slow to change. The street is not.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay means another family broken.</strong> Call Rajkumar. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real street redesigns. Demand action that protects people, not just drivers. The dead cannot speak.

The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, saw candidates who championed 'the importance of bike lanes, public transit, and open streets' win across the city.

Mark Levine, who called for bold highway changes, won the Comptroller race.

The system failed them again.</p><p class=mb3>On May 9, 2025, during New York State’s $254-million budget negotiations, lawmakers rejected Governor Hochul’s proposed street safety measures. The legislature dropped a mandate for daylighting—banning parking at corners near elementary schools—deferring instead to New York City, where Council Member Julie Won’s universal daylighting bill faces opposition from the Department of Transportation. Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, herself a crash survivor, vowed to keep fighting for daylighting, saying, 'I think daylighting would have helped me.' Hochul’s proposals to let the city set lower bike lane speed limits and to reclassify heavy e-bikes as mopeds were also cut. Critics argued these would not address core safety issues. The Adams administration opposes a City Council bill for e-bike registration and plates, while State Sen. Jenifer Rajkumar’s state version would shift licensing to the DMV. As Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives put it, 'A daylighting requirement would have made intersections safer around elementary schools, and it’s disappointing that this provision was cut from the New York State budget.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
