Twenty-one suffered wounds so grave they may never walk the same again. The dead do not get a second chance. The living carry scars.</p><p><strong>Just this spring, Kelvin Mitchell was killed by a hit-and-run driver on Webster Avenue.</strong> His sister stood on the sidewalk and said, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/14/police-chase-linked-to-fatal-hit-and-run-in-bronx>&ldquo;They killed my son. I need justice for my son.&rdquo;</a> The car did not stop. The street did not forgive. The community is left with a hole that cannot be filled.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the harm.</strong> Since 2022, they have killed four people and injured hundreds more. Trucks and buses took another life. Motorcycles and mopeds left fourteen people hurt. Bikes injured six. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not. Every crash is a family changed forever.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-and-silence>Leadership: Votes and Silence</h3><p>Assembly Member Landon Dais has voted to extend and expand school speed zones and cameras, <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>boosting pedestrian safety</a>. He said yes to more protection for children near schools. But Dais also voted to weaken bus rules, a move that <strong>increases risk for people on foot and on bikes.</strong></p><p>The work is not done. <strong>Every day without stronger laws is another day of blood on the street.</strong> As one mother said after her son was killed, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/11/sister-of-bronx-man-killed-by-hit-and-run-mercedes-driver-has-faith-driver-will-be-caught/>&ldquo;I just believe that people should just be more cautious, because now a family is missing a loved one and it’s just not fair.&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.

Witnesses and video show a police van chasing a speeding Mercedes before the crash, raising questions about NYPD pursuit policy. The article notes, 'A police van was in pursuit of the speeding Mercedes, according to video obtained by Streetsblog.' The NYPD’s policy restricts chases to serious crimes and discourages them in residential areas, yet the pursuit occurred near homes and a bodega. The department declined to comment.

The report states the boy was crossing the street outside a crosswalk and without a signal when the SUV, traveling at an unsafe speed, hit him head-on. The impact caused severe bleeding from his arm, but he remained conscious at the scene. Police explicitly cite 'Unsafe Speed' as the contributing factor for the crash. The driver was traveling straight ahead when the collision occurred, and the vehicle’s center front end struck the boy. The police report does not list any pedestrian actions as contributing factors, focusing solely on the driver’s unsafe speed. The crash underscores the lethal consequences of excessive speed on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
