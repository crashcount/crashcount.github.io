Twenty-one left with serious wounds.</strong> In three and a half years, Assembly District 77 has seen 2,985 crashes. The numbers are blunt. The pain is sharper. In the last twelve months alone, two people died and five more suffered injuries that will not heal. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. The street does not care who you are.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the killing.</strong> Four deaths and six serious injuries came from cars and SUVs. Trucks and buses killed once. Motorcycles and mopeds left four with broken bodies. No cyclist killed anyone. The violence is not random. It is heavy, fast, and metal.</p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>On Webster Avenue, a father was struck crossing the street. The driver did not stop. His sister, Justina Lorrious, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/11/sister-of-bronx-man-killed-by-hit-and-run-mercedes-driver-has-faith-driver-will-be-caught/>said, &ldquo;Everybody is missing Kelvin. It’s not gonna be the same over here without him.&rdquo;</a> The loss is not just a number. It is a hole in a family, a silence at the dinner table.</p><p>After the crash, his mother stood at a memorial and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/14/police-chase-linked-to-fatal-hit-and-run-in-bronx>pleaded, &ldquo;They killed my son. I need justice for my son.&rdquo;</a> The plea is simple. It is not answered.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h2><p>Assembly Member Landon Dais voted yes on a bill to <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">bring speed cameras to school zones in Schenectady</a>. The bill aims to slow drivers near children, but it is not for the Bronx. It is not for AD 77. No recent action, no public push, no new law has come from Dais for the people bleeding on these streets.</p><p><strong>The silence is loud.</strong></p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash can be prevented. Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call Landon Dais. Demand speed cameras, lower speed limits, and real protection for people walking and biking. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p><p><strong>The street will not wait. Neither should you.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

According to the police report, the pedestrian was not at an intersection and suffered severe bleeding to his lower leg and foot. The driver, a 48-year-old man, was traveling straight ahead in a 2021 Mitsubishi sedan. Police listed 'Passing Too Closely' as a contributing factor. The report also notes 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion.' The vehicle showed no damage, but the pedestrian was left injured and conscious at the scene.
