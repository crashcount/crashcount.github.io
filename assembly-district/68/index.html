A car does not stop. In Assembly District 68, the numbers do not lie. <strong>Ten dead. Thirty-one left with serious injuries.</strong> In three years, more than 2,200 people have been hurt in 4,488 crashes. The dead are not just numbers. They are children, elders, workers, neighbors. A 53-year-old man crushed by an SUV on Harlem River Drive. A 51-year-old killed on 1st Avenue, emerging from behind a parked car. A 59-year-old struck at an intersection by a bike. The street does not forgive. It does not care if you are careful. It does not care if you are tired from work, heading home to your kids.</p><h2 id=the-weakest-pay-the-price>The Weakest Pay the Price</h2><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> Trucks, SUVs, sedans—they do the killing. In the last year, SUVs and cars accounted for the most deaths and injuries. Trucks and buses followed. Bikes and mopeds, too, but the weight of steel and speed is what breaks bodies. The violence is not random. It is built into the street. Diana Agudela, a 44-year-old e-bike commuter, was beaten on Randall’s Island. Her daughter <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/suspect-in-brutal-beating-of-e-bike-commuter-on-randalls-island-ordered-jailed>demanded more protection, more lights, and called it &ldquo;ridiculous that the park&mldr; had no lights and no cameras.&rdquo;</a> The city left her in the dark. The city left her alone.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-and-silence>Leadership: Action and Silence</h2><p>Assembly Member <strong>Eddie Gibbs has signed on to bills for safer streets</strong>—<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">A 1077</a> and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1280&amp;term=2023">A 1280</a>—calling for roads built for people, not just cars. He voted yes on <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">speed cameras near schools in Schenectady</a>. He <a href=https://nypost.com/2024/07/30/us-news/hochul-restarts-2nd-ave-subway-project-and-punts-congestion-pricing-revenue-fight-to-2025/>praised funding for the Second Avenue Subway</a>, but the trains do not protect you from the cars above. He <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/07/31/manhattan-elected-officials-urge-congestion-pricing-discount-for-electric-cars>joined a push for discounts for electric cars in congestion pricing</a>. Fewer emissions, but the same danger for those on foot. <strong>No bill, no vote, no press release will bring back the dead.</strong></p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>The crisis is not over.</strong> The numbers do not fall by themselves. The city has the power to lower speed limits. The state can keep speed cameras running. <strong>But nothing changes unless you demand it.</strong></p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call Eddie Gibbs. Tell them: Lower the speed. Build the barriers. Light the paths. Do not wait for another body in the road.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
