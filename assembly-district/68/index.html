Thirty-one left with serious injuries.</strong> In three and a half years, 4,539 crashes tore through East Harlem, Randall’s Island, and the streets around them. <strong>Children, elders, workers, and neighbors—no one is spared.</strong></p><p>A newborn killed by a Tesla on 3rd Avenue. A man crushed by a garbage truck on Central Park North. A 59-year-old pedestrian struck dead by a cyclist at 106th and 1st.

It is a daughter waiting for her mother to come home from work. Diana Agudela, a 44-year-old e-bike commuter, was beaten on Randall’s Island. Her daughter <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/suspect-in-brutal-beating-of-e-bike-commuter-on-randalls-island-ordered-jailed>demanded more protection and lighting</a>: &ldquo;We need more protection, we need more lights.

He voted yes to expand <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1280&amp;term=2023">school speed cameras</a> in Schenectady, a step for children’s safety, but far from home. He praised <a href=https://nypost.com/2024/07/30/us-news/hochul-restarts-2nd-ave-subway-project-and-punts-congestion-pricing-revenue-fight-to-2025/>funding for the Second Avenue Subway</a>, but the trains do not stop traffic violence.</p><p>Yet the carnage continues. <strong>SUVs, trucks, bikes, and mopeds all kill here.</strong> The law still lets drivers speed and park with impunity.
