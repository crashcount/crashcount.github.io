In the last twelve months, <strong>five people died</strong> on the streets of Assembly District 68. <strong>Ten more were left with serious injuries.</strong> The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors. They are the man crushed by an SUV on Harlem River Drive. They are the pedestrian struck down at the RFK Bridge exit. They are the cyclist who never made it home from Central Park.</p><p>Just last month, a 43-year-old man on an e-bike collided with a pedestrian in Central Park. He flew from his bike and struck his head on the curb. He died at the hospital. The pedestrian walked away with a cut hand. The police said, <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/e-biker-dies-in-central-park-accident-with-pedestrian-YA4736414>&ldquo;Nico-Garcia was then flung from his bike and struck his head on the curb.&rdquo;</a> No arrests. No comfort. Only the sound of sirens and the scrape of shoes on pavement.</p><p>In January, a 53-year-old man named Willow Hall tried to cross Harlem River Drive. An unlicensed driver in a black Nissan SUV hit him. Hall died. The driver stayed at the scene. It took police six months to make an arrest. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/unlicensed-suv-driver-arrested-6-months-after-killing-east-harlem-pedestrian/>&ldquo;Donald Pinnock was charged Sunday with aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle.&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> In this district, they took four lives and left over 350 people hurt. Trucks and buses killed three more. Bikes and mopeds, one each. The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross the street—they pay the price. The numbers do not lie: <strong>In the last year, 747 people were injured in 1,410 crashes.</strong></p><h3 id=what-has-eddie-gibbs-done>What Has Eddie Gibbs Done?</h3><p>Assembly Member Eddie Gibbs has voted to extend school speed zones and expand speed cameras. He co-sponsored bills to require safer street designs. He voted for more driver education. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>He voted yes to extend school speed zones, improving child pedestrian safety.</a> <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">He co-sponsored a bill boosting street safety for all users.</a></p><p>But Gibbs also voted to weaken bus rules, a move that puts pedestrians and cyclists at greater risk. The work is not done. The streets are not safe. The bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=what-now-demand-more>What Now? Demand More</h3><p><strong>Call Assembly Member Gibbs. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real street redesigns. Demand action against repeat dangerous drivers.</strong></p><p>Every day we wait, someone else does not come home. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice. Make them choose life.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
