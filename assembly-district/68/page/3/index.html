Police found him &ldquo;unconscious and unresponsive on the tracks&rdquo;—no arrests, no answers, just another life lost underground, as reported by the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/06/man-fatally-struck-on-subway-tracks-in-harlem/>NY Daily News</a>.</p><p>On the streets above, the carnage does not stop. In January, Willow Hall, 53, was struck and killed by an unlicensed SUV driver on Harlem River Drive. The driver stayed at the scene but was not charged until six months later. Police stated, &ldquo;Donald Pinnock was charged Sunday with aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/unlicensed-suv-driver-arrested-6-months-after-killing-east-harlem-pedestrian/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>In Central Park, a cyclist was thrown from his e-bike after colliding with a pedestrian in a crosswalk. He &ldquo;slammed his head on the curb&rdquo; and died at the hospital. The pedestrian walked away with a cut hand (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/19/man-riding-e-bike-in-nyc-central-park-dies-in-crash-with-pedestrian/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p><strong>In the last 12 months, five people have died and 885 have been injured in crashes in AD 68. Eleven suffered serious injuries.</strong></p><h3 id=the-numbers-are-names>The Numbers Are Names</h3><p>The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, parents, children. In three years, 12 people have died and 2,547 have been injured on these streets. Most were walking or biking. Cars and trucks did the most harm—<strong>4 deaths and 387 injuries</strong>—but motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes also left bodies broken.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—and What Hasn’t</h3><p>Assembly Member Eddie Gibbs has voted to extend school speed cameras and support safer street designs. He co-sponsored bills to <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">enable safe access to public roads for all users by utilizing complete street design principles</a>.</p><p>But the pace is slow. After Willow Hall was killed, it took half a year for charges to come. The system moves at the speed of paperwork, not grief. The streets remain the same. The danger remains.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-make-them-hear-you>Call to Action: Make Them Hear You</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Assembly Member Eddie Gibbs.
