She was crossing with the signal when a southbound dump truck, making a right turn, struck her. The report states the truck showed no damage. The woman died at the scene. The police report cites 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as a contributing factor, underscoring the driver's responsibility in the collision. The vehicle involved was a large Ford dump truck, classified as an oversized vehicle, which the report also lists as a contributing factor. The victim's behavior—crossing with the signal—is noted in the report, but only after the driver's errors. The impact, the loss, and the systemic risk posed by oversized vehicles remain clear.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Introduced August 18, 2023, it 'requires the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices if a driver accumulates eleven or more points on their driving record during an eighteen month period, or receives 6 speed camera or red light camera tickets during a twelve month period.' Assemblymember Emily Gallagher leads as primary sponsor, joined by Rebecca Seawright, Andrew Hevesi, Tony Simone, Jo Anne Simon, and others. The bill aims to force chronic speeders to slow down.
