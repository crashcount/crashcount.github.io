Twenty-three are left with wounds that will not heal—serious injuries that change a life forever. These are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. They are the man who never made it home from work. The woman who crossed the street and did not reach the other side.</p><p>In the last year alone, <strong>536 people were injured in 890 crashes</strong>.

He voted to extend school speed zones and expand speed cameras, moves that protect children and slow the worst drivers. He co-sponsored bills to force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the law (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">File A 7979</a>). He pushed for automated cameras to catch double-parkers who block crosswalks and bike lanes (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/new-push-for-automated-ticketing-of-drivers-who-double-park-in-nyc>New push for automated ticketing of drivers who double park in NYC</a>). But he also voted to weaken bus rules, making it easier for drivers to endanger people outside the car (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>File S 8344</a>).</p><p>The city made half its taxis wheelchair accessible. &ldquo;We made that today.
