At 11:26 a.m., a 58-year-old pedestrian was crossing the intersection when an unlicensed man riding a Hurley e-scooter struck him head-on.

The e-scooter’s center front end hit the pedestrian, who suffered severe head lacerations and was found unconscious. He died at the scene. The report notes the pedestrian was crossing against the signal, but this is listed after the driver’s errors. The unlicensed status of the e-scooter operator and the failure to yield are central to the crash, underscoring the systemic dangers facing people on foot in New York City streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The police report cites 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as a contributing factor, underscoring the driver's responsibility in the collision. The vehicle involved was a large Ford dump truck, classified as an oversized vehicle, which the report also lists as a contributing factor. The victim's behavior—crossing with the signal—is noted in the report, but only after the driver's errors. The impact, the loss, and the systemic risk posed by oversized vehicles remain clear.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
