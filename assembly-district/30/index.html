The measure, discussed in the council and supported by the NYC Department of Transportation, aims to ticket drivers who double park or block critical spaces. The bill summary states: 'Double parking and curb violations aren’t just a nuisance – they’re a public safety hazard.' Raga and DOT officials argue that manual enforcement cannot keep up with rising car numbers, leaving pedestrians and cyclists at risk. Raga led the push, highlighting blocked hydrants and crosswalks as threats. DOT said automated enforcement 'helps keep streets clear, reduces congestion, and protects New Yorkers.' Delivery drivers voiced concern about work impacts, but the bill’s focus remains on clearing space for vulnerable road users. The proposal awaits further council action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Assemblymember Steven Raga leads the push for a $35 million pilot, aiming to install 150 cameras targeting double parking and illegal stops. The bill, not yet assigned a committee or number, seeks to automate enforcement where manual efforts fall short. Raga writes, 'manual enforcement has not been able to meet the demand to combat double parking and illegal parking.' State Senator Simcha Felder of District 44 opposes the measure, arguing for traditional police summonses instead. The Department of Transportation supports the expansion, stating, 'Automated enforcement has proven to change driver behavior and make our streets safer for everyone.' The debate centers on whether automation or police presence best protects pedestrians and cyclists from blocked lanes and traffic hazards.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
