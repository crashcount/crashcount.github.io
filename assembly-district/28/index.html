A young cyclist, dead on Queens Boulevard. A motorcyclist, burned alive after a BMW driver rammed him in a fit of rage. These are not stories from far away. They happened here, in Assembly District 28, in the last year. The dead do not speak. Their families grieve in silence.</p><p><strong>In the past 12 months, five people have died in traffic crashes in AD 28.</strong> Four more suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. In that same time, 435 people were hurt. The numbers do not slow. They do not care if you are young or old. They do not care if you are careful. They only count the bodies.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>Assembly Member Andrew Hevesi has taken steps. He co-sponsored a bill to force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the law again. The bill sits in committee, waiting for action. Hevesi also voted yes to bring speed cameras to school zones, a move that saves lives by catching drivers who would rather not slow down.</p><p>Hevesi stood with other lawmakers to block the governor from pausing congestion pricing, warning that letting one person override safety policy would &ldquo;make impossibly opaque the actual responsibility for MTA decisions&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/08/23/we-never-gave-hochul-the-power-to-pause-congestion-pricing-legislators-say>said Hevesi and colleagues</a>. But the streets remain deadly. Cameras and laws are only as good as their enforcement. The city can lower speed limits now. It has not.</p><h3 id=the-voices-left-behind>The Voices Left Behind</h3><p>After the BMW driver killed a motorcyclist, Queens DA Melinda Katz <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/25/bmw-driver-charged-with-murder-of-queens-motorcyclist-in-road-rage-crash-nypd/>said, &ldquo;Our roadways are not the place to settle disputes&rdquo;</a>. A witness to the fire truck crash <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/19/us-news/fdny-firetruck-strikes-kills-cyclist-outside-nyc-park/>said, &ldquo;One of them seemed concerned, like shaken, like shocked&rdquo;</a>. The shock lingers. The dead do not come back.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Assembly Member Hevesi. Call the council. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras, more street redesigns, more action. Every day of delay is another name on the list. Do not wait for the next siren.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

They filed a brief. They argue the governor has no right to halt congestion pricing. The MTA Board, not Albany, holds the power. The pause sows confusion. Streets stay clogged. Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On August 23, 2024, a group of New York State legislators—Assembly Members Phil Steck and Andrew Hevesi, State Senator Julia Salazar, and former Assembly Member Dick Gottfried—filed a legal brief against Governor Hochul’s decision to pause congestion pricing. The matter, as described: “the legislature never gave her or any governor the power to do away with the traffic toll.” The brief cites the 2019 Traffic Mobility Act, arguing only the Traffic Mobility Review Board and the MTA can make such decisions. The lawmakers warn that letting the governor override the MTA would “make impossibly opaque the actual responsibility for MTA decisions.” Their action supports the MTA Board’s independence and opposes executive interference. No safety analyst has assessed the direct impact on vulnerable road users, but the legislators’ stance highlights the risk of political meddling in life-and-death street policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The primary sponsor is Emily Gallagher (District 50), joined by co-sponsors Rebecca Seawright, Andrew Hevesi, Tony Simone, Jo Anne Simon, Patricia Fahy, Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, MaryJane Shimsky, Yudelka Tapia, Steven Raga, Anna Kelles, Robert C.
