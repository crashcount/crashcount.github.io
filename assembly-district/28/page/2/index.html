A young cyclist, dead on Queens Boulevard. A motorcyclist, burned alive after a BMW driver rammed him in a fit of rage. These are not stories from far away. They happened here, in Assembly District 28, in the last year. The dead do not speak. Their families grieve in silence.</p><p><strong>In the past 12 months, five people have died in traffic crashes in AD 28.</strong> Four more suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. In that same time, 435 people were hurt. The numbers do not slow. They do not care if you are young or old. They do not care if you are careful. They only count the bodies.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>Assembly Member Andrew Hevesi has taken steps. He co-sponsored a bill to force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the law again. The bill sits in committee, waiting for action. Hevesi also voted yes to bring speed cameras to school zones, a move that saves lives by catching drivers who would rather not slow down.</p><p>Hevesi stood with other lawmakers to block the governor from pausing congestion pricing, warning that letting one person override safety policy would &ldquo;make impossibly opaque the actual responsibility for MTA decisions&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/08/23/we-never-gave-hochul-the-power-to-pause-congestion-pricing-legislators-say>said Hevesi and colleagues</a>. But the streets remain deadly. Cameras and laws are only as good as their enforcement. The city can lower speed limits now. It has not.</p><h3 id=the-voices-left-behind>The Voices Left Behind</h3><p>After the BMW driver killed a motorcyclist, Queens DA Melinda Katz <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/25/bmw-driver-charged-with-murder-of-queens-motorcyclist-in-road-rage-crash-nypd/>said, &ldquo;Our roadways are not the place to settle disputes&rdquo;</a>. A witness to the fire truck crash <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/19/us-news/fdny-firetruck-strikes-kills-cyclist-outside-nyc-park/>said, &ldquo;One of them seemed concerned, like shaken, like shocked&rdquo;</a>. The shock lingers. The dead do not come back.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Assembly Member Hevesi. Call the council. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras, more street redesigns, more action. Every day of delay is another name on the list. Do not wait for the next siren.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
