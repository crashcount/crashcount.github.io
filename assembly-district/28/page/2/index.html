Police said the truck was turning when the crash happened, and the NYPD is investigating <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bicyclist-killed-being-struck-fdny-truck-middle-village-queens/16205704/>ABC7</a>.

He died. The crash record lists two eastbound cars and a northbound bike. Impact to the bike’s left side. “Apparent death,” the city database says <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.

Serious harm shows up with the heavy ones too <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. The FDNY turn at Juniper was not an outlier; heavy vehicles loom large in the worst outcomes here.</p><h3 id=what-the-numbers-say-without-mercy>What the numbers say, without mercy</h3><p>Since 2022, AD 28 logged 3,089 crashes, 1,620 injuries, and six deaths. In the last 12 months alone: 1,015 crashes, 567 injured, five dead. Year‑to‑date injuries are up more than half from last year’s pace <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. Cyclists paid dearly: four killed, 118 injured. Pedestrians: 284 injured, four seriously <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Contributing factors stack up as “other,” distraction, failure to yield, and blown signals. “Other” alone covers 483 injuries. Failure to yield hurt five more. Signals ignored, six.

The turn at 80th and Juniper needs hard edges: daylight every corner, harden the turn, set a leading walk signal. On truck routes, add protected space for the bike and the walk. Give big vehicles fewer chances to sweep across people.</p><h3 id=the-thin-line-between-speed-and-ash>The thin line between speed and ash</h3><p>A BMW driver in Queens rammed a motorcyclist after a minor collision, prosecutors say. The bike burst into flames. The rider died. “Our roadways are not the place to settle disputes,” Queens DA Melinda Katz said <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/25/bmw-driver-charged-with-murder-of-queens-motorcyclist-in-road-rage-crash-nypd/>NY Daily News</a>.
