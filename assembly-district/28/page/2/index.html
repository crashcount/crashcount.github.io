Queens Boulevard remains a top injury corridor here <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=the-worst-hours-hit-late-afternoon>The worst hours hit late afternoon</h3><p>From 2 to 5 p.m., injuries spike. At 2 p.m., 125 people hurt. At 3 p.m., 113 injuries and one death. At 4 p.m., 116 injuries and three deaths. At 5 p.m., 102 injuries and two deaths. Daylight. Crowded streets.

Among pedestrian injuries traced to vehicle type: SUVs 102, sedans 107, trucks 10, buses 8. Serious harm shows up with the heavy ones too <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. The FDNY turn at Juniper was not an outlier; heavy vehicles loom large in the worst outcomes here.</p><h3 id=what-the-numbers-say-without-mercy>What the numbers say, without mercy</h3><p>Since 2022, AD 28 logged 3,089 crashes, 1,620 injuries, and six deaths. In the last 12 months alone: 1,015 crashes, 567 injured, five dead. Year‑to‑date injuries are up more than half from last year’s pace <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. Cyclists paid dearly: four killed, 118 injured. Pedestrians: 284 injured, four seriously <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Contributing factors stack up as “other,” distraction, failure to yield, and blown signals. “Other” alone covers 483 injuries. Failure to yield hurt five more. Signals ignored, six. Each line is a body, not a theory <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=repeat-hotspots-simple-fixes>Repeat hotspots, simple fixes</h3><p>The district’s worst corridors are named in the data: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Jackie Robinson Parkway</a>, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Queens Boulevard</a>, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Woodhaven Boulevard</a>, and <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Metropolitan Avenue</a>. The turn at 80th and Juniper needs hard edges: daylight every corner, harden the turn, set a leading walk signal. On truck routes, add protected space for the bike and the walk. Give big vehicles fewer chances to sweep across people.</p><h3 id=the-thin-line-between-speed-and-ash>The thin line between speed and ash</h3><p>A BMW driver in Queens rammed a motorcyclist after a minor collision, prosecutors say. The bike burst into flames. The rider died. “Our roadways are not the place to settle disputes,” Queens DA Melinda Katz said <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/25/bmw-driver-charged-with-murder-of-queens-motorcyclist-in-road-rage-crash-nypd/>NY Daily News</a>. The paper reported the driver had past summonses for speeding and wrong‑way driving <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/25/bmw-driver-charged-with-murder-of-queens-motorcyclist-in-road-rage-crash-nypd/>NY Daily News</a>.</p><p>The state has a bill to force repeat violators to slow down. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher’s measure would make any driver with 11 points in 24 months, or 6 camera tickets in a year, install an intelligent speed limiter <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">Open States A 2299</a>. Another version set the trigger at 11 points in 18 months, or 6 tickets in a year <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">Open States A 7979</a>. Lawmakers also extended protections in school speed zones this June; the bill passed both chambers <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Open States S 8344</a>.</p><h3 id=slow-it-all-down>Slow it all down</h3><p>Speeds kill. Albany renewed 24‑hour school‑zone cameras through 2030, but city streets outside those zones still run hot. New York City now has the power to lower speed limits on local streets. Advocates say use it. Make 20 miles per hour the rule and back it with cameras and limiters. The tools exist. The bodies are here.</p><p>Take one step now.

Introduced August 18, 2023, it 'requires the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices if a driver accumulates eleven or more points on their driving record during an eighteen month period, or receives 6 speed camera or red light camera tickets during a twelve month period.' Assemblymember Emily Gallagher leads as primary sponsor, joined by Rebecca Seawright, Andrew Hevesi, Tony Simone, Jo Anne Simon, and others. The bill aims to force chronic speeders to slow down.
