She had the walk signal. A Mercedes turned left and struck her. She died at Kings County Hospital. The driver stayed. No charges were filed that day. A witness stood on the curb and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/16/fridays-headlines-east-flatbush-tragedy-edition>described the scene</a>: &ldquo;The lady spin around and sped through.&rdquo; She heard bones break.

Trucks and buses killed two. Motorcycles and mopeds, one. The numbers do not flinch. They do not grieve. They only rise.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-and-silence>Leadership: Votes and Silence</h3><p>Assembly Member Monique Chandler-Waterman has voted to expand school speed cameras, a move that <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S7678>boosts safety for children</a>. She also voted to weaken bus lane rules, a change that <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S7785>increases risk for people on foot and bike</a>. When it came time to extend protections for school speed zones, she <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>missed the vote</a>. <strong>Every delay, every loophole, every missed vote leaves the most vulnerable exposed.</strong></p><h3 id=the-cost-of-waiting>The Cost of Waiting</h3><p>A witness to Lafleur’s death <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/16/fridays-headlines-east-flatbush-tragedy-edition>pleaded for action</a>: &ldquo;The government should do something, like when people are walking, no cars should be moving.&rdquo; The plea is simple. The answer is not. The bodies keep coming. The numbers keep climbing.</p><p><strong>Call your Assembly Member. Demand a default 20 mph speed limit.
