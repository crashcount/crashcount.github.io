Eighty-eight seriously hurt.</strong> That is the toll in Assembly District 58 in the last year alone. The numbers do not bleed, but the streets do. On May 14, Maurette Lafleur, age 68, crossed Rutland Road in the crosswalk with the light. A Mercedes driver turned left and struck her. She died at Kings County Hospital. The driver stayed. No charges. A witness <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/16/fridays-headlines-east-flatbush-tragedy-edition>described the horror</a>: &ldquo;I heard the van run over her and her bones crunching.&rdquo;</p><p>A week earlier, a school principal rolled his car on Lenox Road after hitting parked cars. He refused a breath test. He was charged with DWI. The city called it an incident. The street called it a warning. He <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/06/gregory-jackson-dwi-arrest-flipped-over-brownsville-collaborative-middle-school/>told police</a>, &ldquo;He only had one drink.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=the-policies-and-the-gaps>The Policies and the Gaps</h3><p><strong>Assembly Member Monique Chandler-Waterman has voted for more speed cameras near schools and for expanding their reach.</strong> She backed funding for safer street designs. But when it mattered most, she missed the vote to extend school speed zone protections (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>see bill S 8344</a>). She also voted to weaken bus lane rules, a move that puts people on foot and bike at greater risk. The record is mixed. The danger is not.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-is-the-policy>The Pattern Is the Policy</h3><p><strong>Most victims here are not in cars.</strong> They are walking. They are old, young, or just unlucky. Cars and SUVs do most of the killing. Trucks and vans take their share. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not used it. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call Assembly Member Chandler-Waterman. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people walking and biking.</strong> Do not wait for another name on the list. The street does not care who you are. The law should.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
