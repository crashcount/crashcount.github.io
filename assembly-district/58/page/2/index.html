She had the walk signal. A Mercedes turned left and struck her. She died at Kings County Hospital. The driver stayed. No charges were filed that day. A witness stood on the curb and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/16/fridays-headlines-east-flatbush-tragedy-edition>described the scene</a>: &ldquo;The lady spin around and sped through.&rdquo; She heard bones break.

Trucks and buses killed two. Motorcycles and mopeds, one. The numbers do not flinch. They do not grieve. They only rise.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-and-silence>Leadership: Votes and Silence</h3><p>Assembly Member Monique Chandler-Waterman has voted to expand school speed cameras, a move that <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S7678>boosts safety for children</a>. She also voted to weaken bus lane rules, a change that <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S7785>increases risk for people on foot and bike</a>. When it came time to extend protections for school speed zones, she <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>missed the vote</a>. <strong>Every delay, every loophole, every missed vote leaves the most vulnerable exposed.</strong></p><h3 id=the-cost-of-waiting>The Cost of Waiting</h3><p>A witness to Lafleur’s death <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/16/fridays-headlines-east-flatbush-tragedy-edition>pleaded for action</a>: &ldquo;The government should do something, like when people are walking, no cars should be moving.&rdquo; The plea is simple. The answer is not. The bodies keep coming. The numbers keep climbing.</p><p><strong>Call your Assembly Member. Demand a default 20 mph speed limit.

The crash occurred at 19:47, with both victims—aged 23 and 26—suffering severe lacerations and partial ejection from the scooter. The report states, 'A Lexus struck an e-scooter carrying two men. No helmets. Both thrown, torn, bleeding. Steel met flesh. Skin split open.' Both men were conscious but badly injured, left broken across the road. The police report explicitly cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor. The sedan driver, licensed in New York, was traveling straight ahead at the time of impact. The report also notes 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a secondary factor, but the primary failure remains with the distracted driver.

The 51-year-old man riding the e-scooter suffered severe lacerations to his leg. According to the police report, 'Traffic Control Disregarded' was listed as a contributing factor. The SUV’s center front end struck the rider. The e-scooter operator was unlicensed and wore no helmet, but these details follow the primary driver error. No injuries were reported for the SUV’s driver. The crash left the e-scooter rider bleeding on the street, another vulnerable road user hurt by a driver’s failure to obey traffic control.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
