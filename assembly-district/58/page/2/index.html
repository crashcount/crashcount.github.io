The light said walk. A Mercedes turned left. The car hit her. Bones broke. &ldquo;I heard the van run over her and her bones crunching,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/16/fridays-headlines-east-flatbush-tragedy-edition>said Lorna Johnson</a>.

The dead were old and young. They crossed with the light, against the light, or just tried to live. Cars did not care. Trucks did not care. The numbers do not stop. The pain does not stop.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-broken-promises>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and Broken Promises</h2><p>Most deaths came from cars and SUVs. Trucks killed too.
