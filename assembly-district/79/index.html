A black Mercedes came fast. It did not stop. It hit him, sent him into the air, dragged him half a block. He died at Lincoln Hospital. His mother said, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bronx-pedestrian-killed-heartbroken-family-mourns-father-3-nyc-hit-run/16394341/>&ldquo;That car deliberately went straight speeding, didn&rsquo;t stop, hit my son all the way up into the air and came down, dragged him half a block, they killed my son.&rdquo;</a> He was a father. His children will remember him. The driver did not stay.</p><h2 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h2><p><strong>In the last twelve months, five people died in crashes in AD 79. Seventeen suffered serious injuries.</strong> There were 908 crashes. <strong>643 people were hurt.</strong></p><p>Pedestrians are not safe. In the last year, two young men aged 18–24 died. A woman, 65, was killed by a truck turning right. A 31-year-old woman was killed crossing with the signal. The cars did not stop. The trucks did not stop. The street did not forgive.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h2><p>Assembly Member Chantel Jackson has sponsored bills to require public hearings before building or removing bike lanes <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1060&amp;term=2025">A 1060</a>. This slows down safety upgrades. She co-sponsored a bill for safer street design <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">A 1077</a>, but missed a key vote on school speed cameras <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">A 7652</a>. When advocates rallied for lower speed limits, Jackson hesitated, citing constituent feedback. The Assembly’s inaction keeps streets dangerous. A neighbor <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bronx-fatal-accident-43-year-old-man-killed-hit-run-morrisania/16375922/>said</a>, &ldquo;I think we need to slow down and pay attention to the pedestrians.
