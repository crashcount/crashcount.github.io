His mother said, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bronx-pedestrian-killed-heartbroken-family-mourns-father-3-nyc-hit-run/16394341/>&ldquo;That car deliberately went straight speeding, didn&rsquo;t stop, hit my son all the way up into the air and came down, dragged him half a block, they killed my son.&rdquo;</a> He was a father.

This slows down safety upgrades. She co-sponsored a bill for safer street design <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">A 1077</a>, but missed a key vote on school speed cameras <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">A 7652</a>. When advocates rallied for lower speed limits, Jackson hesitated, citing constituent feedback. The Assembly’s inaction keeps streets dangerous. A neighbor <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bronx-fatal-accident-43-year-old-man-killed-hit-run-morrisania/16375922/>said</a>, &ldquo;I think we need to slow down and pay attention to the pedestrians.
