Over 700 injured.</strong> In the last twelve months, Assembly District 79 has seen 1,059 crashes. The numbers do not bleed, but the streets do. Just weeks ago, a car slammed into a sidewalk shed in Melrose, injuring six. The news was blunt: “Six people were injured when a car crashed into a sidewalk shed Thursday morning in the Melrose section of the Bronx.” <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/car-crashes-into-sidewalk-shed-in-the-bronx/>CBS New York</a></p><p>On May 10, a man crossing Webster Avenue was hit by a black Mercedes. The driver did not stop. The victim’s mother <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bronx-pedestrian-killed-heartbroken-family-mourns-father-3-nyc-hit-run/16394341/>described the horror</a>: “That car deliberately went straight speeding, didn&rsquo;t stop, hit my son all the way up into the air and came down, dragged him half a block, they killed my son.”</p><h2 id=vulnerable-lives-unforgiving-roads>Vulnerable Lives, Unforgiving Roads</h2><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the highest price.</strong> In the last year, children under 18 suffered 94 injuries. Two young adults, ages 18–24, are dead. The old are not spared. A 65-year-old woman was killed at an intersection. The cause: a turning truck and a moment that cannot be undone.</p><p>Cars and SUVs did most of the harm—4 deaths, 385 injuries. Trucks and buses followed. Motorcycles and mopeds, too. The street does not care who you are. It only takes.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Assembly Member Chantel Jackson has voted to extend and expand school speed cameras, a move that protects children near schools. She co-sponsored a bill to boost street safety for all users. But she also sponsored a bill that makes it harder to build bike lanes, slowing progress when speed is life and delay is death. She voted to weaken bus rules, risking more harm to those on foot and bike.</p><p><strong>Every vote counts. Every delay costs lives.</strong></p><h2 id=the-call-demand-action-now>The Call: Demand Action Now</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Contact Assembly Member Jackson.

The report states: 'The 19-year-old rider, unlicensed, helmetless, thrown to the pavement. Face torn. Unconscious.' The BMW driver was licensed and merging at the time of impact. A female passenger on the motorcycle was also ejected, sustaining injuries to her lower leg and foot, and was in shock. The report lists contributing factors as 'Unspecified,' but the collision resulted from the BMW merging into the motorcycle's path, causing a violent head-on crash.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
