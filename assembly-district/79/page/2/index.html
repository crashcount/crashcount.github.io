The report cites 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' and 'Unsafe Speed' as contributing factors in the crash. The moped’s center front end struck the sedan’s side, leaving the rider conscious but gravely injured on the street. The police narrative describes the aftermath: 'His hip split open on the asphalt. Blood pooled. He lay conscious, torn and still, under the Bronx night.' The report notes the rider was not wearing a helmet, but only after highlighting the improper lane usage and unsafe speed as primary causes.

The street swallowed their calm.</p><p class=mb3>At 1490 Southern Boulevard in the Bronx, a parked Ford sedan suffered severe damage to its right front bumper, according to the police report. Two occupants were inside: a 57-year-old male driver and a 50-year-old female passenger. Both were wearing seat belts and remained conscious after the crash. The police report states the driver sustained chest injuries while the passenger was trapped by her shoulder, both suffering crush injuries. The vehicle was stationary at the time of the incident, with the impact focused on the right front bumper. The report lists contributing factors as 'unspecified' and does not cite any driver errors or external causes. No mention is made of victim behavior as a contributing factor. The event underscores the vulnerability of vehicle occupants even when parked, as metal and force converge without warning.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
