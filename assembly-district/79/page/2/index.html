Two Jeeps, steel and speed, converged from opposite sides. She was struck and killed at the intersection. The street claimed her life in the cold Bronx night.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a 53-year-old woman was killed while crossing Melrose Avenue at East 157th Street in the Bronx. The incident occurred at 19:11, when two Jeeps—one traveling south, the other north—approached the intersection. Both vehicles struck the woman as she was in the crosswalk. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified' for both drivers, providing no evidence of evasive action or yielding. The narrative states, 'Steel met flesh. She died where she fell.' The victim's action is noted as 'Crossing Against Signal,' but this is mentioned only after the absence of any driver error cited in the data.
