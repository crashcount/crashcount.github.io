A black Mercedes came fast. It did not stop. It hit him, sent him into the air, dragged him half a block. He died at Lincoln Hospital. His mother said, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bronx-pedestrian-killed-heartbroken-family-mourns-father-3-nyc-hit-run/16394341/>&ldquo;That car deliberately went straight speeding, didn&rsquo;t stop, hit my son all the way up into the air and came down, dragged him half a block, they killed my son.&rdquo;</a> He was a father. His children will remember him. The driver did not stay.</p><h2 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h2><p><strong>In the last twelve months, five people died in crashes in AD 79. Seventeen suffered serious injuries.</strong> There were 908 crashes. <strong>643 people were hurt.</strong></p><p>Pedestrians are not safe. In the last year, two young men aged 18–24 died. A woman, 65, was killed by a truck turning right. A 31-year-old woman was killed crossing with the signal. The cars did not stop. The trucks did not stop. The street did not forgive.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h2><p>Assembly Member Chantel Jackson has sponsored bills to require public hearings before building or removing bike lanes <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1060&amp;term=2025">A 1060</a>. This slows down safety upgrades. She co-sponsored a bill for safer street design <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">A 1077</a>, but missed a key vote on school speed cameras <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">A 7652</a>. When advocates rallied for lower speed limits, Jackson hesitated, citing constituent feedback. The Assembly’s inaction keeps streets dangerous. A neighbor <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bronx-fatal-accident-43-year-old-man-killed-hit-run-morrisania/16375922/>said</a>, &ldquo;I think we need to slow down and pay attention to the pedestrians.

The bill, which would grant New York City local control over its speed limits, remains stalled in the Assembly. The rally, led by Families for Safe Streets, called out lawmakers for refusing to bring the measure to a vote. Fabiola Mendieta-Cuapio, a leading advocate, criticized the lack of transparency: 'We are demanding that the Speaker bring this to a vote.' Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz voiced strong support, but others, like Chantel Jackson, hesitated, citing constituent feedback. The bill’s matter summary states it would not mandate lower limits but allow the city to decide. The legislative process left families of crash victims frustrated and angry.
