The report cites 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' and 'Unsafe Speed' as contributing factors in the crash. The moped’s center front end struck the sedan’s side, leaving the rider conscious but gravely injured on the street. The police narrative describes the aftermath: 'His hip split open on the asphalt.
