His mother <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bronx-pedestrian-killed-heartbroken-family-mourns-father-3-nyc-hit-run/16394341/>described the horror</a>: &ldquo;That car deliberately went straight speeding, didn&rsquo;t stop, hit my son all the way up into the air and came down, dragged him half a block, they killed my son.&rdquo; The driver fled. The family is left with a hole that will never close.</p><p>Just weeks later, a car <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/car-crashes-into-sidewalk-shed-in-the-bronx/>slammed into a sidewalk shed in Melrose, injuring six</a>. The shed was meant to shield pedestrians from falling bricks, not from cars that leave the road. The numbers do not let up: in three years, <strong>15 killed, 2,237 injured, 39 seriously hurt</strong>—and the wounded are often the young, the old, the ones who never saw it coming.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price-vulnerable-lives-repeat-offenders>Who Pays the Price? Vulnerable Lives, Repeat Offenders</h2><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> In this district, SUVs and sedans are the main weapons—<strong>4 deaths and 5 serious injuries</strong> by cars, more by trucks and buses, mopeds, and bikes. The pattern is clear. The pain is not spread evenly. Children, elders, and those on foot or bike are most at risk.</p><h2 id=what-has-assembly-member-jackson-done>What Has Assembly Member Jackson Done?</h2><p>Assembly Member Chantel Jackson has <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted to expand school speed cameras</a> and <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>extend school speed zones</a>, moves that help protect children near schools. She has also <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored a bill to boost street safety for all users</a>. But Jackson has backed measures that <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1060&amp;term=2025">make it harder to build bike lanes</a> and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=S7785&amp;term=2025">weaken bus lane rules</a>, putting vulnerable road users at greater risk.</p><p>The silence is loudest where it matters most: <strong>no push for a 20 mph citywide speed limit, no action against repeat speeders, no fight for street redesigns that put people before cars.</strong></p><h2 id=the-call-demand-more-demand-it-now>The Call: Demand More, Demand It Now</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of blood on the street.</strong> Call Assembly Member Jackson.
