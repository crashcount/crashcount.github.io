Thirty-five left with serious wounds.</strong> In Assembly District 72, the numbers do not lie. From January 2022 to July 2025, the streets have claimed lives and broken bodies. A child struck by a motorscooter on Edgecombe. An elderly woman hit by an SUV on Harlem River Drive. Cyclists gashed open by car doors, riders thrown from bikes, pedestrians left bleeding on Broadway. The violence is steady, unyielding. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Every crash is a family changed forever</a>.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most harm.</strong> Out of all pedestrian injuries and deaths, sedans and SUVs were responsible for the largest share. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes also left their mark, but the weight of the carnage falls on four wheels. The numbers are plain: 297 injuries and deaths from cars and SUVs, 17 from motorcycles and mopeds, 9 from bikes. Trucks and buses added to the toll. The street does not care who you are. It only cares what hits you.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h3><p>Assembly Member Manny De Los Santos has taken steps. He voted to extend school speed zones, a move that keeps children safer near schools. He co-sponsored <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>bills to require speed limiters for repeat speeders</a> and to <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">push for safer street designs</a>. He backed <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A324&amp;term=2025">more bike lane enforcement and better vehicle technology</a>. But he also voted to weaken bus lane rules, a step that puts pedestrians and cyclists at greater risk. The record is mixed. The danger remains.</p><h3 id=the-next-fight>The Next Fight</h3><p><strong>The disaster is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every delay, every watered-down law, every loophole keeps the blood flowing. The time for half-measures is over. Call Assembly Member De Los Santos. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat speeders. Demand streets built for people, not just cars. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Police explicitly cite 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the primary contributing factor. The narrative describes the aftermath: the cyclist lying in the cold, bloodied and unmoving, while the street remained unchanged. No contributing factors are attributed to the cyclist’s behavior.
