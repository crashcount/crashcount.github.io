A teenager is thrown from a moped on West 185th. An elderly cyclist falls silent on Saint Nicholas Avenue. <strong>In the last twelve months, Assembly District 72 saw 1 death, 14 serious injuries, and 369 people hurt in 713 crashes.</strong> The numbers do not flinch. They do not pause for grief. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p><strong>Children are not spared.</strong> Twenty-five under 18 were injured, one seriously.

The street does not care who you are.</p><h2 id=what-hits-hurts-and-kills>What Hits, Hurts, and Kills</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most damage.</strong> In three years, they killed two pedestrians and left 10 with serious wounds. Motorcycles and mopeds cut down more. Bikes, too, have left their mark—one death, one serious injury. The machines are many. The bodies are soft.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-miles-to-go>Leadership: Steps Forward, Miles to Go</h2><p>Assembly Member Manny De Los Santos has signed his name to bills for safer streets. He co-sponsored laws to require <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A324&amp;term=2025">complete street design</a>, <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2642&amp;term=2025">vehicle safety tech</a>, speed limiters, and automated bike lane enforcement.

Every loophole is another family broken.</strong></p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> The city now has the power to lower speed limits. Cameras can catch the reckless, if Albany keeps them alive. But laws on paper do not slow a car. Only action does.</p><p><strong>Call De Los Santos. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never sleep. Demand streets where children can walk home.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for the next siren. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The data shows the motorscooter was going straight ahead before losing control and overturning, with the center front end damaged.
