But the streets of Assembly District 72 did not rest. In the past twelve months, 494 people were hurt in crashes. Thirteen were left with injuries so grave they may never walk the same. The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie. See the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Just this week, a cyclist was struck in Washington Heights. The driver fled. Neighbors did not sound surprised. One <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/nypd-hunting-for-driver-who-struck-cyclist-in-washington-heights/>said the intersection has been a problem for some time</a>. The city moves on. The cyclist is expected to live. Not all do.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-young-old-no-one-spared>The Pattern: Young, Old, No One Spared</h3><p>Children, elders, workers—all hit. In the last year, 31 children were injured. Seventy-nine young adults. Fourteen people over 75. The pain is not abstract. It is a mother waiting at the hospital. It is a child with a cast. It is a man who will not ride again.</p><p>Cars and SUVs do most of the harm. In three years, they caused 2 deaths and over 300 injuries to pedestrians. Motorcycles and mopeds added more. Bikes, too, left their mark, but the carnage comes on four wheels most often.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h3><p>Assembly Member Manny De Los Santos has acted. He <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted to extend school speed zones</a>, protecting children near schools. He co-sponsored a bill to <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">force repeat speeders to install speed limiters</a>. He backed <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A803&amp;term=2025">bike lane enforcement</a> and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A324&amp;term=2025">complete street design</a>. But he also <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S7785>voted to weaken bus lane rules</a>, a move that puts walkers and cyclists at risk.</p><p>The work is not done. The streets are not safe. The numbers do not lie.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-demand-now>Call to Action: Demand More, Demand Now</h3><p>Do not wait for another body in the road. Call Assembly Member De Los Santos. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real street redesign. Demand action for the living, not words for the dead.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
