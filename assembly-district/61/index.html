Five more have life-altering injuries. In the last twelve months, Assembly District 61 has seen over a thousand crashes. More than five hundred people have been hurt. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do. A 68-year-old man, crossing at Forest Avenue and Raymond Place, was struck and killed by an SUV. He was in the crosswalk. The driver failed to yield, distracted, turning left. The man never made it to the other side. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Children are not spared. In the past year, 72 kids were injured in crashes here. The street is no sanctuary. The curb is no shield.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-and-evasion>Leadership: Action and Evasion</h2><p>Assembly Member Charles Fall has voted for speed cameras in Schenectady, supporting a pilot to protect children there. But here at home, he has sponsored a bill to shrink the area around schools where speed cameras can operate. The bill would mean fewer cameras, less protection for children walking to class. The summary is plain: &ldquo;reduces the radial distance from school buildings for such school speed zones.&rdquo; <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A4371&amp;term=2025">See the bill</a></p><p>No safety analyst has weighed in. The intent is clear. Less camera coverage. More danger at the curb.</p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>The news does not soften the blows. On a cold March morning, two police officers crashed their cruiser into a building on Victory Boulevard, swerving to avoid a car making a U-turn. Both were hospitalized. No bystanders were hit, this time. &ldquo;It was pretty, pretty fast and then he crashed into a sanitation car. He crashed over there and then he&rsquo;s doing circles and then he crashed out with a police car,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/staten-island-cops-responding-to-gun-call-crash-into-store/>said witness Abi Aguirre</a>.</p><p>Elsewhere, a driver with 27 violations fled a stop, crashed into a police car, and fired a gun. Three officers were injured by shattered glass. The SUV had five speeding tickets. The system let it roll on. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/12/staten-island-driver-fleeing-nypd-stop-for-tinted-windows-fires-at-cops/>NY Daily News</a></p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every day the law delays, another family waits for the call. Contact Assembly Member Charles Fall. Demand he protect—not shrink—school speed zones. Demand he fight for more cameras, lower speed limits, and safer crossings. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

On Staten Island, officers responding to a gun call swerved to avoid a U-turning car, lost control, and crashed into a shuttered restaurant. Both officers were hospitalized with minor injuries. Hours earlier in Manhattan, a Dodge Charger changed lanes, clipped a street sweeper, spun out, and pinned an officer against his patrol SUV. Surveillance footage showed the Charger 'spinning out of control before hitting the officer.' Witness Abi Aguirre described the chaos: 'It was pretty, pretty fast and then he crashed into a sanitation car.' Both incidents highlight the risks posed by high-speed responses and sudden driver maneuvers. Storefronts and sidewalks offered little protection. No pedestrians were reported injured.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
