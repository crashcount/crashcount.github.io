Since 2022, five people are dead. Seventeen more are left with injuries so serious they may never walk right again. The numbers do not flinch: <strong>1,689 injured, 3,606 crashes</strong> in just over three years (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The dead are not just numbers. A 68-year-old man, crossing at Forest Avenue and Raymond Place, was struck and killed by an SUV making a left turn. He was in the crosswalk. The driver failed to yield. The man never made it home (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>A year earlier, a 60-year-old man was killed crossing with the signal at Post Avenue.

Trucks and buses added dozens more injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds, a handful. Bikes, a few scrapes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The danger is everywhere. On March 15, two police officers crashed their cruiser into a Staten Island building while swerving to avoid a U-turning car. Both were hospitalized. The street offered no forgiveness. &ldquo;Another vehicle attempted to make a U-turn, causing the police cruiser to swerve to avoid a collision,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/nypd-crash-2-officers-recovering-crashing-police-cruiser-staten-island/16028315/>reported ABC7</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-action>Leadership: Words and Action</h3><p>Assembly Member Charles Fall has spoken up for safer streets. He has <strong>criticized city delays</strong> and failures to redesign dangerous intersections, and has backed laws for daylighting and protected bike lanes. But the carnage continues. The policies move slow. The cars do not.</p><p>The call is clear. &ldquo;It was pretty, pretty fast and then he crashed into a sanitation car&mldr; then he&rsquo;s doing circles and then he crashed out with a police car,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/staten-island-cops-responding-to-gun-call-crash-into-store/>said a witness to a recent crash</a>.</p><h3 id=what-next>What Next?</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.

The reports state, 'Years of bus priority projects have barely improved speeds because New York City leaders have not implemented real bus rapid transit (BRT).' Colon, reporting for Streetsblog NYC, supports comprehensive BRT and opposes the city’s piecemeal fixes. Mayor Adams and city agencies have not acted on key recommendations. The safety analyst notes: the lack of real BRT means missed chances for mode shift and street equity, but does not directly worsen conditions for pedestrians and cyclists; the status quo remains unchanged.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Bottcher called it 'transformative,' promising fewer crashes and faster buses. Powers slammed the last-minute reversal. Safety analysts warn: canceling the busway preserves car dominance, discourages transit, and keeps streets unsafe for pedestrians and cyclists. The project’s future is uncertain.

The project faces delays and political pushback, including the removal of a protected bike lane after developer objections. A safety analyst notes: 'Center-running bus lanes typically reduce conflicts between buses, cars, pedestrians, and cyclists, calm traffic, and can enable street redesigns that improve safety and comfort for vulnerable road users.'

The case, rooted in the MTA’s lawsuit against the feds, remains unresolved. The DOT’s attorney, Dominika Tarczynska, said, "The Department of Transportation maintains the position that New York City should stop charging tolls by April 20." MTA attorney Robert Kaplan countered, "Congestion pricing is in effect, we believe it's working, and ... we don't intend to turn it off unless there's an order from your honor." Governor Hochul and the MTA refuse to comply. The federal government threatens vague consequences but takes no concrete steps. The MTA’s November agreement with the Biden-era DOT did not allow for unilateral federal withdrawal. As the legal fight drags on, congestion pricing continues. Streets south of 60th Street see fewer crashes. Bus speeds rise. Foot traffic grows. Vulnerable road users benefit while politicians bicker.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, discussed in the Transportation, Public Safety, Sanitation & Environment Committee, drew strong turnout. The meeting's summary: 'A large number of Lower Manhattan residents turned out to support the Canal Street open street, but organizers reduced the program's operating times in response to complaints from some residents.' Chairperson Vincent Cirrito said, 'This is an open space for our residents, for our kids... where they don’t have to worry about vehicles and cars.' Council Member Chris Marte and some residents pushed for further cutbacks, while others defended the open street as vital for safety, accessibility, and local business. The board sided with vulnerable road users, keeping two blocks of Canal Street open to people, not cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets once safe for walkers and riders now risk return to cars. The future is uncertain.</p><p class=mb3>On April 3, 2025, New York City’s Open Streets program entered crisis. The program, legislated by the City Council, lost its federal Covid funding. Mayor Adams has not allocated city funds. The Department of Transportation (DOT) says $5 million is needed to maintain current operations, but the Council’s preliminary budget omits this. DOT Chief of Staff Ryan Lynch told advocates the agency is lobbying for replacement funds. Council Member Shekar Krishnan criticized the mayor’s stance, saying, “It’s deeply misguided to cut funds from the open street program, especially at this moment.” The City Comptroller’s office also faulted the administration for poor planning. The funding gap has already led to reduced hours and fewer open streets. Council members are pushing for restoration, but the program’s future hangs in the balance.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Public input ongoing.</p><p class=mb3>On March 26, 2025, the Department of Transportation unveiled its plan for the Bronx portion of the Harlem River Greenway. The plan, not a council bill but a DOT action, covers a seven-mile route along Bailey Avenue, Sedgwick Avenue, Depot Place, Exterior Street, E. 135th Street, Lincoln Avenue, and Bruckner Boulevard. The DOT cited access issues with state and private landowners, abandoning Mayor Adams’s earlier promise of a true waterfront path. The official summary states: 'protected bike lanes on streets near the waterfront, rather than a true waterfront greenway.' Advocates like Chauncy Young and Laura Solis welcomed protected lanes but lamented the loss of a car-free riverside route. Mayor Adams claimed the project would help undo highway devastation in the Bronx. Still, the plan leaves vulnerable road users exposed to traffic, not shielded by water’s edge. Public workshops are ongoing.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
