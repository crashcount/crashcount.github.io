Twenty-two left with serious injuries.</strong> Nearly 2,000 hurt since 2022. The dead include a 16-year-old on a scooter, a 68-year-old man in a crosswalk, a 78-year-old woman behind the wheel, and a child. The list grows. The pain does not fade.</p><p>Just last month, a 13-year-old boy was thrown from his moped after colliding with an MTA bus on Castleton Avenue. He landed hard. His head struck the pavement. He was rushed to the hospital, fighting for his life. The bus driver and passengers walked away unscathed. Police said, &ldquo;the moped went through a stop sign without stopping and hit the bus&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/moped-bus-collision-staten-island/>amNY</a>).</p><p>On June 29, a 16-year-old riding an electric scooter crossed into the path of a Hyundai Tucson. He died from head trauma. The driver stayed. No charges. Another family shattered (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>The Brooklyn Paper</a>).</p><h2 id=patterns-of-harm-who-pays-the-price>Patterns of Harm: Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage.</strong> They killed two, seriously injured three, and left hundreds with broken bodies. Trucks and buses hurt dozens more. Motorcycles and mopeds, too, leave blood on the street. Even bikes are not blameless. But the deadliest force is always speed and steel.</p><p>The old, the young, the ones on foot or two wheels—they pay the highest price. A pedestrian struck at 30 mph is five times more likely to die than at 20 mph. The city knows this. Albany knows it. Still, the carnage continues.</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-silence-and-the-long-road-ahead>Leadership: Votes, Silence, and the Long Road Ahead</h2><p>Assembly Member Charles Fall has taken some steps. In June, he <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted yes to extend school speed zones</a>, a move meant to protect children near schools. But the streets outside those zones remain dangerous. The crisis is not contained by painted lines or school bells.</p><p>The city now has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so. Every day of delay is another day of risk. As one DOT spokesperson <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/dot-worker-slashed-by-e-biker-manhattan/>said after a worker was slashed on the job</a>, &ldquo;This was an abhorrent assault of a NYC DOT employee who performs critical work to keep our city moving.&rdquo; The violence is not just in the numbers. It is in the wounds, the fear, the empty chairs at dinner tables.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Assembly Member Fall. Call the Council. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for every street, not just the ones near schools. <strong>Do not wait for another child to die.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The complaint, reported by Streetsblog NYC, claims the NYPD's Community Response Team operated as a rogue unit, answerable only to City Hall, with Deputy Mayor Kaz Daughtry allowing reckless pursuits. Donlon cites deaths and injuries, including cyclist Amanda Servedio. The suit alleges 398 crashes and 315 injuries in 2024—a 47% jump. Donlon's allegations highlight how high-speed chases increase risk to pedestrians and cyclists, introducing unpredictable, dangerous driving and eroding public trust in safe, equitable enforcement.

Safety stands still.</p><p class=mb3>On July 11, 2025, Dave Colon spotlighted two reports slamming New York City’s failure to deliver real bus rapid transit. The reports state, 'Years of bus priority projects have barely improved speeds because New York City leaders have not implemented real bus rapid transit (BRT).' Colon, reporting for Streetsblog NYC, supports comprehensive BRT and opposes the city’s piecemeal fixes. Mayor Adams and city agencies have not acted on key recommendations. The safety analyst notes: the lack of real BRT means missed chances for mode shift and street equity, but does not directly worsen conditions for pedestrians and cyclists; the status quo remains unchanged.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city will replace it with a painted, unprotected lane. The official matter: 'Part of the parking-protected bike lane on a hazardous stretch of Bedford Avenue ... will be removed and replaced with a non-protected painted bike lane.' Council Member Lincoln Restler condemned the move, calling it 'a purely political decision to rip out a bike lane with no alternative.' Transportation Alternatives noted pedestrian injuries fell 10% and driver injuries 42% after the lane was installed. The safety analyst warns: 'Removing a parking-protected bike lane and replacing it with a painted lane reduces physical protection for cyclists, likely decreasing safety and discouraging cycling, especially on a hazardous stretch.'

The project faces delays and political pushback, including the removal of a protected bike lane after developer objections. A safety analyst notes: 'Center-running bus lanes typically reduce conflicts between buses, cars, pedestrians, and cyclists, calm traffic, and can enable street redesigns that improve safety and comfort for vulnerable road users.'
