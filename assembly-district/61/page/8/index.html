The bill, discussed in October 2023, has not specified a streamlined process for licensing. The matter’s summary states: 'Holden's bill does nothing to rectify the fundamental issues of inadequate space and dangerous workplace practices.' Holden and his colleagues push regulation, but critics say the bill ignores the real threats: narrow sidewalks, blocked crosswalks, and unsafe delivery work. The proposal would burden riders and discourage micromobility, while failing to address illegal mopeds or car dominance. State Senator Brad Hoylman’s employer-provided ID plan is cited as a better alternative. The opinion calls for protected bike lanes, wider sidewalks, and fair enforcement, not more bureaucracy. Holden’s bill, critics argue, misses the mark for pedestrian safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She stressed, 'The 30 miles of bus lane and 50 miles of bike lanes is not a goal—it’s legal mandate.' The exchange revealed ongoing tension over DOT’s slow rollout and lack of transparency.

The official summary claims 'new improvements' and uses language of equity and sustainability. Advocates like Janet Gallant and Ben Crowther call it 'greenwashing' and a 'marketing ploy.' Brian O’Malley points to the climate crisis. Lawsuits challenge the plan, which critics say will worsen health and climate impacts, especially for Black and brown communities.

The article, reviewed by Streetsblog NYC, highlights systemic failures: unsafe streets, lack of charging infrastructure, and tech companies shifting risk onto underpaid delivery workers. Council Member Alexa Aviles urges rapid expansion of e-bike charging stations and blames corporate greed. State Senators Jessica Ramos and Brad Hoylman-Sigal call for industry accountability and a standardized, safe delivery vehicle. The matter summary states, 'The city needs a systemic fix, justice for workers and accountability by tech giants.' Advocacy groups reject punitive crackdowns on workers, pushing instead for expanded bike lanes and public infrastructure. The piece concludes that only a multi-pronged, structural approach—never just enforcement—will protect vulnerable road users and delivery workers alike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, under city review since 2022, aimed to speed up buses for 85,000 daily riders by installing dedicated busways or offset lanes. According to Streetsblog, Espaillat leaned on younger electeds to align with Council Member Oswald Feliz, a vocal critic. 'He defers to the local elected officials, and all of them seem to be in agreement,' said Espaillat’s chief of staff, Aneiry Batista. Lawmakers who once supported the upgrades grew silent or opposed them after Espaillat’s intervention. The Department of Transportation, MTA, and governor’s office met with Espaillat to discuss the project, but delays persisted. The opposition from Feliz and business groups led DOT to scrap the most ambitious safety options. Riders, many without cars, remain exposed to slow, hazardous conditions as cars block bus lanes and traffic crawls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On June 29, 2023, a report surfaced in Streetsblog NYC detailing the debate over MTA congestion pricing. The report, titled "New Jersey May See Red over Congestion Pricing, but Garden State Gets Plenty of MTA Green," highlights that from 2014 to 2022, the MTA paid New Jersey companies $3.3 billion for goods and services. The plan, set to raise $15 billion for the MTA's 2020-2024 capital plan, faces opposition from New Jersey officials, including Governor Phil Murphy, who have threatened lawsuits. The article quotes Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany: "Congestion pricing will bring in $15 billion alone for the MTA's $55 billion 2020-2024 capital plan, and New Jersey businesses stand to profit from this major increase in MTA capital spending." MTA spokesperson Eugene Resnick adds that congestion pricing will "reduce traffic, improve regional air quality, and boost the Garden State's economy." Despite the political fight, the money keeps flowing. Vulnerable road users remain at risk as the system prioritizes contracts and capital over street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Ariola said, 'At long last, we will finally have a safe, steady, and efficient flow of traffic here, and the area is now more resilient than ever before.' The project, part of a $16.6 million investment begun in March 2021, also repaired or replaced 1,100 feet of storm sewer and added new left turn lanes.

These vehicles are not small—they are right-sized. Cars, SUVs, and trucks are oversized and deadly. Language shapes danger. Words matter. Human-scaled mobility deserves respect, not diminishment.</p><p class=mb3>This opinion piece, published June 12, 2023, on Streetsblog NYC, challenges the use of the term ‘micromobility’ to describe bikes, scooters, and similar vehicles. The article argues, ‘SUVs, pick-up trucks, and passenger cars should not be the benchmark by which we judge the size of other forms of transit, and the term 'micromobility' encourages us to believe that they are.’ Author Sarah Risser calls for dropping the ‘micro’ prefix, urging us to see bikes and scooters as standard, not lesser. She highlights how oversized vehicles—cars, SUVs, trucks—fuel rising deaths among pedestrians and cyclists. Risser urges language that centers human-scaled mobility and rejects car supremacy. No council bill or vote is attached, but the stance is clear: words shape safety, and the right words can help dismantle systemic danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
