Twenty-two left with serious injuries.</strong> Nearly 2,000 hurt since 2022. The dead include a 16-year-old on a scooter, a 68-year-old man in a crosswalk, a 78-year-old woman behind the wheel, and a child. The list grows. The pain does not fade.</p><p>Just last month, a 13-year-old boy was thrown from his moped after colliding with an MTA bus on Castleton Avenue. He landed hard. His head struck the pavement. He was rushed to the hospital, fighting for his life. The bus driver and passengers walked away unscathed. Police said, &ldquo;the moped went through a stop sign without stopping and hit the bus&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/moped-bus-collision-staten-island/>amNY</a>).</p><p>On June 29, a 16-year-old riding an electric scooter crossed into the path of a Hyundai Tucson. He died from head trauma. The driver stayed. No charges. Another family shattered (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>The Brooklyn Paper</a>).</p><h2 id=patterns-of-harm-who-pays-the-price>Patterns of Harm: Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage.</strong> They killed two, seriously injured three, and left hundreds with broken bodies. Trucks and buses hurt dozens more. Motorcycles and mopeds, too, leave blood on the street. Even bikes are not blameless. But the deadliest force is always speed and steel.</p><p>The old, the young, the ones on foot or two wheels—they pay the highest price. A pedestrian struck at 30 mph is five times more likely to die than at 20 mph. The city knows this. Albany knows it. Still, the carnage continues.</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-silence-and-the-long-road-ahead>Leadership: Votes, Silence, and the Long Road Ahead</h2><p>Assembly Member Charles Fall has taken some steps. In June, he <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted yes to extend school speed zones</a>, a move meant to protect children near schools. But the streets outside those zones remain dangerous. The crisis is not contained by painted lines or school bells.</p><p>The city now has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so. Every day of delay is another day of risk. As one DOT spokesperson <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/dot-worker-slashed-by-e-biker-manhattan/>said after a worker was slashed on the job</a>, &ldquo;This was an abhorrent assault of a NYC DOT employee who performs critical work to keep our city moving.&rdquo; The violence is not just in the numbers. It is in the wounds, the fear, the empty chairs at dinner tables.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Assembly Member Fall. Call the Council. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for every street, not just the ones near schools. <strong>Do not wait for another child to die.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Streetsblog’s coverage, criticized by City Hall and DOT, revealed that vacancies and political interference—especially from Council Members Bob Holden and Oswald Feliz—stalled projects like the Citi Bike expansion in Queens and the Fordham Road bus lane in the Bronx. DOT completed only 67% of its bus lane mandate and fell 17% short on bike lanes.

The hearing, led by Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, questioned whether Mayor Adams is honoring his pledge to end road violence. The matter focused on the administration’s failure to meet Council-mandated benchmarks in the NYC Streets Plan, especially protected bike lanes and bus lanes. Brooks-Powers stated, 'No New Yorker should have to fear for their life while crossing or using our streets.' She stressed that enforcement alone is not enough, demanding equitable infrastructure in neglected neighborhoods. Advocacy leaders like Elizabeth Adams and Sara Lind echoed the call for physical changes and accountability.

The project, begun in September 2021 and finished last fall, added 1,285 square feet of sidewalk, a new median, and red bus-only lanes on Westchester Avenue. The DOT worked with the MTA to cut a circuitous bus detour, giving Bx12 and other riders a direct path. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'DOT’s work at Pelham Bay Park... may be only one-10th of a mile, but the impact for thousands of riders will be gigantic.' New York City Transit President Richard Davey added, 'Bus lanes don't have to be miles long to deliver a huge impact.' The changes serve 64,000 daily riders, expanding space for pedestrians and shortening bus trips. More crosswalks now connect the busy transfer point, making the area less hostile for those on foot.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lockwood blames road markings, not the driver, saying, 'I blame it on that yellow line.' He criticizes the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) for prioritizing speed over safety, stating, 'They're there to make them faster.' Lockwood argues that traffic controls shift blame onto vulnerable users and do not guarantee safety. He supports Vision Zero and shared space designs, which slow traffic and reduce crashes.

Brooklyn organizer Kathy Park-Price of Transportation Alternatives said, 'After decades of car-centric planning, it's time to return Grand Army Plaza to people.' Residents’ top demands: more protected pedestrian space, protected bike lanes, and overhauled traffic operations. The DOT plans a capital project design in fall 2023.

The truck, owned by JCDecaux, had racked up 30 violations since 2017. Despite this, the driver escaped charges, and the vehicle never triggered the city’s Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program, which requires safety courses for drivers with repeated violations. The intersection had only paint and plastic flappers—ignored by drivers—until officials added some concrete barriers in the fall. Local council members had pushed for stronger protection. The DOT said it would review safety practices with JCDecaux. The 34th District has one of Brooklyn’s highest truck-related fatality rates.

The event, titled 'The Streetsie Awards: Vote for Your Favorite Streetfilm of the Year!', showcases Clarence Eckerson Jr.’s work documenting the fight for safer streets. The films cover cargo bikes, school streets, women’s rides, and international comparisons. They highlight how protected bike lanes and open streets reduce danger for children and families. Jersey City and Hoboken, featured in one film, have reached zero road deaths by redesigning streets for people, not cars. Council action is not involved, but the advocacy is clear: safer infrastructure saves lives. The films make the case—New York can do better for its most vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The agency completed only 25 miles of bike lanes and 11.95 miles of bus lanes. The matter, titled 'DOT Will Not Reach Required Bike and Bus Lane Requirements This Year,' drew sharp criticism from Riders Alliance and Transportation Alternatives. Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance said, 'The Adams administration is many miles wide of the mark when it comes to complying with the Streets Plan and keeping the mayor's promise to millions of riders.' Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives added, 'The city needs to meet these goals without delay or excuse and stop leaving New Yorkers who walk, bike, and bus behind.' A City Council spokesperson blamed staff shortages and unfilled vacancies, calling the situation 'unacceptable.' The Council urged the administration to fill key roles and meet legal requirements. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, bus riders—bear the brunt of these failures.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The commentary notes, 'the stats on 2021's pedestrian death crisis came out not too long ago, and they were awful. As in, the-worst-they-been-in-40-years awful.' No council bill or vote is attached, but the piece draws on federal data and expert analysis. It singles out SUVs as a main threat: drivers are four times more likely to strike pedestrians while turning, and children hit by SUVs are eight times more likely to die than if struck by smaller cars. The article also exposes the frequency and devastation of vehicle-into-building crashes and the false promise of autonomous vehicles. It underscores how car culture’s burdens fall hardest on marginalized communities.

The state calls transit taxes its own contribution, shortchanging riders. Lawmakers and watchdogs demand an end to the shell game. The governor stalls. Riders pay the price in service and safety.</p><p class=mb3>This state budgetary action, revealed December 20, 2022, exposes New York’s long-running diversion of dedicated transit funds from the MTA. Under the 1975 18-b law, the state must match local funding for public transit. Instead, since 1995, Albany has counted regional transit taxes as its own share, leaving a $4.9 billion shortfall. State Comptroller Tom DiNapoli criticizes the practice: 'the state has used a portion of these resources... rather than using General Fund revenues as originally intended.' Assembly Member Amy Paulin, chair of the Corporations Committee, insists, 'we don’t have to justify funding the MTA adequately. It is very justified.' Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany calls for an end to 'raiding dedicated funds.' The governor’s office has not pledged to stop. The result: less money for transit, more danger for those who rely on it.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The study, titled "Four Ways To Build A Better Automated Enforcement Program," surveyed 1,500 U.S. adults about traffic cameras. Researchers, including Kelcie Ralph, urge cities to use data-driven camera placement, scale fines to income, and spend revenue on self-enforcing infrastructure like road narrowing. They warn against using cameras as cash cows or funding police and private contractors. The report states: "The purpose of [automated enforcement] is to improve safety, not catch unsuspecting drivers." Ralph adds, "They need to be in places with known safety risks, and it should be a data driven process." The analysis calls for shifting control to transportation departments and removing jail time for unpaid fines.

The bill remains in committee. The measure would give whistleblowers 25% of the ticket, up to $75. The matter targets drivers who obscure or remove plates to dodge automated enforcement. As city and state agencies rely more on cameras to catch speeders and red-light runners, more drivers hide their plates. The Department of Transportation says cameras failed to ticket over 4% of violators last fall, up from 1% in 2019. Advocates accuse police of lax enforcement and even breaking the law themselves. Gounardes’s bill, still stalled, aims to close this loophole and put power in the hands of citizens.

Community Board 4 backed the plan but demanded more concrete barriers. Locals say painted islands and plastic posts won’t stop cars. Three pedestrians have died since 2016.</p><p class=mb3>On November 21, 2022, the Department of Transportation unveiled a plan for a parking-protected bike lane on nearly 40 blocks of 10th Avenue, stretching from W. 14th to W. 52nd streets. Manhattan Community Board 4’s Transportation Committee unanimously supported the proposal but urged DOT to add more physical barriers. The plan includes pedestrian islands and repurposes car lanes in some sections, but for 19 blocks, car lanes remain untouched. Council Member Erik Bottcher and local activists pushed for the redesign, citing high crash and fatality rates: 173 crashes this year, 40 injuries, and three pedestrian deaths since 2016. Committee members, including Christine Berthet and Brett Firfer, criticized painted islands as unsafe, calling for concrete or vertical barriers. DOT’s Patrick Kennedy cited resource limits. The agency aims to start work in spring and finish by fall.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
