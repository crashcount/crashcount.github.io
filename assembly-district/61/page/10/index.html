The article highlights the unchecked rise of ultra-fast shipping, noting, 'the fallout looks like a veritable armada of delivery trucks triple-parking in your neighborhoods.' The author supports regulation of rapid delivery, investment in transit, and use of micro-mobility for last-mile trips. Council bill number and committee details are not applicable, as this is not a legislative action but a policy proposal. The piece argues that a delivery tax would push consumers toward sustainable choices and fund shared infrastructure, especially transit. It stresses that unchecked delivery harms vulnerable communities with pollution and congestion, and urges cities to prioritize curb management, electric trucks, and e-cargo bikes to protect public space and safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streetsblog’s coverage, criticized by City Hall and DOT, revealed that vacancies and political interference—especially from Council Members Bob Holden and Oswald Feliz—stalled projects like the Citi Bike expansion in Queens and the Fordham Road bus lane in the Bronx. DOT completed only 67% of its bus lane mandate and fell 17% short on bike lanes.

She stressed that enforcement alone is not enough, demanding equitable infrastructure in neglected neighborhoods.

The project, begun in September 2021 and finished last fall, added 1,285 square feet of sidewalk, a new median, and red bus-only lanes on Westchester Avenue. The DOT worked with the MTA to cut a circuitous bus detour, giving Bx12 and other riders a direct path. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'DOT’s work at Pelham Bay Park... may be only one-10th of a mile, but the impact for thousands of riders will be gigantic.' New York City Transit President Richard Davey added, 'Bus lanes don't have to be miles long to deliver a huge impact.' The changes serve 64,000 daily riders, expanding space for pedestrians and shortening bus trips.

The public consultation, held in November, drew 1,270 in-person responses. The DOT summarized: 'the majority of respondents were interested in options to unify the public spaces.' Council members are not directly named, but city officials like Terra Ishee, DOT Pedestrian Unit Director, acknowledged the limits of past efforts: 'We really need to bump it up and make it a full blown capital project.' Brooklyn organizer Kathy Park-Price of Transportation Alternatives said, 'After decades of car-centric planning, it's time to return Grand Army Plaza to people.' Residents’ top demands: more protected pedestrian space, protected bike lanes, and overhauled traffic operations. The DOT plans a capital project design in fall 2023. The survey shows clear public support for bold, systemic safety improvements for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The truck, owned by JCDecaux, had racked up 30 violations since 2017. Despite this, the driver escaped charges, and the vehicle never triggered the city’s Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program, which requires safety courses for drivers with repeated violations. The intersection had only paint and plastic flappers—ignored by drivers—until officials added some concrete barriers in the fall. Local council members had pushed for stronger protection. The DOT said it would review safety practices with JCDecaux. The 34th District has one of Brooklyn’s highest truck-related fatality rates.

The films cover cargo bikes, school streets, women’s rides, and international comparisons. They highlight how protected bike lanes and open streets reduce danger for children and families. Jersey City and Hoboken, featured in one film, have reached zero road deaths by redesigning streets for people, not cars. Council action is not involved, but the advocacy is clear: safer infrastructure saves lives.

Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance said, 'The Adams administration is many miles wide of the mark when it comes to complying with the Streets Plan and keeping the mayor's promise to millions of riders.' Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives added, 'The city needs to meet these goals without delay or excuse and stop leaving New Yorkers who walk, bike, and bus behind.' A City Council spokesperson blamed staff shortages and unfilled vacancies, calling the situation 'unacceptable.' The Council urged the administration to fill key roles and meet legal requirements.

The commentary notes, 'the stats on 2021's pedestrian death crisis came out not too long ago, and they were awful. As in, the-worst-they-been-in-40-years awful.' No council bill or vote is attached, but the piece draws on federal data and expert analysis. It singles out SUVs as a main threat: drivers are four times more likely to strike pedestrians while turning, and children hit by SUVs are eight times more likely to die than if struck by smaller cars. The article also exposes the frequency and devastation of vehicle-into-building crashes and the false promise of autonomous vehicles. It underscores how car culture’s burdens fall hardest on marginalized communities.

They warn against using cameras as cash cows or funding police and private contractors. The report states: "The purpose of [automated enforcement] is to improve safety, not catch unsuspecting drivers."

They want safe, reliable trains. Advocates say the governor must fund transit, not let it fall apart. Riders rejected fearmongering. Now they wait for Hochul to deliver on her promises. The city’s future rides on it.</p><p class=mb3>""Without them, the MTA risks falling into a real death spiral of fare hikes and service cuts, which will further depress ridership and hurt the city and region’s recovery."" -- Charles Fall</p><p class=mb3>This post-election analysis, published November 21, 2022, reviews the outcome of the November 8 election and its meaning for transit policy. Subway riders backed Governor Hochul by an 81 to 19 percent margin in districts with the busiest stations. The article states, 'the governor needs to invest in mass transit and provide the MTA the billions it needs in new dedicated revenues to save it from the fiscal cliff.' Advocates like Rachael Fauss, John McCarthy, Liam Blank, Kate Slevin, and Lisa Daglian urge Hochul and the legislature to boost funding and treat transit as essential. They warn of a 'death spiral' if service cuts and fare hikes hit. Hochul’s support for projects like the Interborough Express and congestion pricing is noted. The message is clear: New Yorkers demand safe, reliable transit, and the governor must deliver.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
