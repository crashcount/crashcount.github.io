Twenty-two left with serious injuries.</strong> Nearly 2,000 hurt since 2022. The dead include a 16-year-old on a scooter, a 68-year-old man in a crosswalk, a 78-year-old woman behind the wheel, and a child. The list grows. The pain does not fade.</p><p>Just last month, a 13-year-old boy was thrown from his moped after colliding with an MTA bus on Castleton Avenue. He landed hard. His head struck the pavement. He was rushed to the hospital, fighting for his life. The bus driver and passengers walked away unscathed. Police said, &ldquo;the moped went through a stop sign without stopping and hit the bus&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/moped-bus-collision-staten-island/>amNY</a>).</p><p>On June 29, a 16-year-old riding an electric scooter crossed into the path of a Hyundai Tucson. He died from head trauma. The driver stayed. No charges. Another family shattered (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>The Brooklyn Paper</a>).</p><h2 id=patterns-of-harm-who-pays-the-price>Patterns of Harm: Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage.</strong> They killed two, seriously injured three, and left hundreds with broken bodies. Trucks and buses hurt dozens more. Motorcycles and mopeds, too, leave blood on the street. Even bikes are not blameless. But the deadliest force is always speed and steel.</p><p>The old, the young, the ones on foot or two wheels—they pay the highest price. A pedestrian struck at 30 mph is five times more likely to die than at 20 mph. The city knows this. Albany knows it. Still, the carnage continues.</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-silence-and-the-long-road-ahead>Leadership: Votes, Silence, and the Long Road Ahead</h2><p>Assembly Member Charles Fall has taken some steps. In June, he <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted yes to extend school speed zones</a>, a move meant to protect children near schools. But the streets outside those zones remain dangerous. The crisis is not contained by painted lines or school bells.</p><p>The city now has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so. Every day of delay is another day of risk. As one DOT spokesperson <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/dot-worker-slashed-by-e-biker-manhattan/>said after a worker was slashed on the job</a>, &ldquo;This was an abhorrent assault of a NYC DOT employee who performs critical work to keep our city moving.&rdquo; The violence is not just in the numbers. It is in the wounds, the fear, the empty chairs at dinner tables.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Assembly Member Fall. Call the Council. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for every street, not just the ones near schools. <strong>Do not wait for another child to die.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Cooney warned that the pause means less expansion, less accessibility, dirtier buses, older trains, and outdated signals.

The action, detailed in 'Disabled NYer’s are Victims of Gov. Hochul’s Congestion Pricing Pause,' leaves tens of thousands without access. Michelle Alcaraz and Ray Ray, both disabled New Yorkers, are forced to travel far from home or avoid transit altogether. The MTA’s $16 billion in scheduled repairs, including crucial accessibility upgrades, is now in limbo. Joe Rappaport of the Brooklyn Center for the Independence of the Disabled called on the governor and legislature to restore funding, warning that the lack of elevators treats disabled riders as 'second-class citizens.'

DOT cited 110 injury crashes and one fatality in four years along the corridor. The redesign also includes concrete bus boarding islands and pedestrian improvements near schools and hospitals.

Community board attendees voiced anger over the loss of 28 parking spots, but some residents and advocates praised the safety upgrades, calling them 'desperately needed.'

The event, organized by Riders Alliance, followed Governor Kathy Hochul’s last-minute decision to halt the Manhattan toll plan. The protest drew bus and subway riders, who chanted for immediate action and held signs demanding clean air and reliable transit. Restler declared, 'Kathy Hochul has betrayed us,' and called for more frequent bus service, better trains, and less dependence on cars and trucks. The demonstrators warned that without congestion pricing, the MTA faces a funding crisis. This threatens repairs and improvements, especially in Black, Brown, and low-income neighborhoods, and risks worsening traffic and delays for emergency services. The protest highlights the systemic danger: when transit funding is gutted, vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, once set to launch June 30, was halted after pressure from U.S. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who feared electoral fallout. The matter, described as a move to 'indefinitely delay' tolls, drew criticism for its timing and impact. Hochul’s action, punctuated by a speech echoing toll critics, left the policy in limbo. Political consultants and union leaders, including @TwuSamuelsen, noted the decision failed to win votes or resolve the issue. The MTA confirmed the program’s pause in court. With no congestion pricing, New York’s streets remain dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists. The delay means no reduction in car traffic, no new funding for transit, and no safety gains for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, debated as Bill 28, has not advanced in committee and faces strong opposition. The matter, described as 'a last-minute funding move that drew fierce opposition,' has Krueger stating, 'I think it does not have support.' Assemblyman Brian Cunningham echoed, 'No new taxes.' The proposal would raise the payroll mobility tax, already increased last year, to fund the MTA. Rep. Jerry Nadler and business groups argue the tax unfairly targets NYC, while congestion pricing would have spread costs regionally. With the legislative session ending, MTA projects remain at risk.

Only a small segment between Springfield Boulevard and Cloverdale Boulevard will have a protected lane in one direction. DOT cited the need to 'maintain current curbside activities,' meaning parking. Community Board 11 had opposed the original plan, and homeowners rallied with 'NO BIKE LANES' signs and an 800-signature petition. Advocates like Laura Shepard and Elizabeth Adams condemned the rollback, saying, 'We can't let politics get in the way of saving lives.'

DSNY Deputy Commissioner Joshua Goodman defended the process, stating, 'Safety was absolutely one of the weighted factors,' and promised, 'there will be consequences for lack of compliance.'
