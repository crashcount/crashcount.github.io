Twenty-two left with serious injuries.</strong> Nearly 2,000 hurt since 2022. The dead include a 16-year-old on a scooter, a 68-year-old man in a crosswalk, a 78-year-old woman behind the wheel, and a child. The list grows. The pain does not fade.</p><p>Just last month, a 13-year-old boy was thrown from his moped after colliding with an MTA bus on Castleton Avenue. He landed hard. His head struck the pavement. He was rushed to the hospital, fighting for his life. The bus driver and passengers walked away unscathed. Police said, &ldquo;the moped went through a stop sign without stopping and hit the bus&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/moped-bus-collision-staten-island/>amNY</a>).</p><p>On June 29, a 16-year-old riding an electric scooter crossed into the path of a Hyundai Tucson. He died from head trauma. The driver stayed. No charges. Another family shattered (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>The Brooklyn Paper</a>).</p><h2 id=patterns-of-harm-who-pays-the-price>Patterns of Harm: Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage.</strong> They killed two, seriously injured three, and left hundreds with broken bodies. Trucks and buses hurt dozens more. Motorcycles and mopeds, too, leave blood on the street. Even bikes are not blameless. But the deadliest force is always speed and steel.</p><p>The old, the young, the ones on foot or two wheels—they pay the highest price. A pedestrian struck at 30 mph is five times more likely to die than at 20 mph. The city knows this. Albany knows it. Still, the carnage continues.</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-silence-and-the-long-road-ahead>Leadership: Votes, Silence, and the Long Road Ahead</h2><p>Assembly Member Charles Fall has taken some steps. In June, he <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted yes to extend school speed zones</a>, a move meant to protect children near schools. But the streets outside those zones remain dangerous. The crisis is not contained by painted lines or school bells.</p><p>The city now has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so. Every day of delay is another day of risk. As one DOT spokesperson <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/dot-worker-slashed-by-e-biker-manhattan/>said after a worker was slashed on the job</a>, &ldquo;This was an abhorrent assault of a NYC DOT employee who performs critical work to keep our city moving.&rdquo; The violence is not just in the numbers. It is in the wounds, the fear, the empty chairs at dinner tables.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Assembly Member Fall. Call the Council. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for every street, not just the ones near schools. <strong>Do not wait for another child to die.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The MTA board approved the pause, forcing a $16 billion cut in capital spending. Projects delayed include modern signals, station accessibility, new trains, and electric buses. The plan, crafted by former NYC Transit President Andy Byford, aimed to fix decades of neglect. Byford said, 'The Fast Forward plan we created in 2018 is as necessary today as it was then.' MTA board member Norman Brown lamented, 'We're turning the clock back.' The pause leaves vulnerable riders—especially low-income New Yorkers—exposed to unreliable, unsafe transit.

The project, pitched as a school safety upgrade, will replace painted bike lanes with a two-way protected lane, add sidewalk extensions, and close two slip lanes. DOT cited 110 injury crashes and one fatality in four years along the corridor. The redesign also includes concrete bus boarding islands and pedestrian improvements near schools and hospitals. DOT staffer Alex Ussery said, 'We’ve received some concerns from the community and various elected officials specifically regarding safety around students.' Community board attendees voiced anger over the loss of 28 parking spots, but some residents and advocates praised the safety upgrades, calling them 'desperately needed.' Installation will begin this summer and finish in the fall.

Council Members Pierina Sanchez and Oswald Feliz, who represent the area, expressed cautious optimism and called for community engagement. Committee Chair Lucia Deng reported, 'There was zero pushback on the concept of busways or bus lanes.' The committee even pushed for a longer route.

The event, organized by Riders Alliance, followed Governor Kathy Hochul’s last-minute decision to halt the Manhattan toll plan. The protest drew bus and subway riders, who chanted for immediate action and held signs demanding clean air and reliable transit. Restler declared, 'Kathy Hochul has betrayed us,' and called for more frequent bus service, better trains, and less dependence on cars and trucks. The demonstrators warned that without congestion pricing, the MTA faces a funding crisis. This threatens repairs and improvements, especially in Black, Brown, and low-income neighborhoods, and risks worsening traffic and delays for emergency services. The protest highlights the systemic danger: when transit funding is gutted, vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Political consultants and union leaders, including @TwuSamuelsen, noted the decision failed to win votes or resolve the issue. The MTA confirmed the program’s pause in court. With no congestion pricing, New York’s streets remain dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists.

The proposal would raise the payroll mobility tax, already increased last year, to fund the MTA. Rep.

Advocates like Laura Shepard and Elizabeth Adams condemned the rollback, saying, 'We can't let politics get in the way of saving lives.'
