The street has seen 1,594 crashes, 44 cyclist injuries, 67 pedestrian injuries, and three deaths since 2013. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher announced the changes, which include daylighting intersections, banning left turns at key avenues, and adding painted pedestrian extensions. Gallagher said, 'Quick, iterative incremental changes will be a great way to reduce injuries and fatalities rather than waiting for an entire overhaul.' Council Member Lincoln Restler praised the upgrades as 'a step in the right direction.' Bronwyn Breitner of Make McGuinness Safe Coalition called for a full-scale redesign, reallocating space from cars to people.

The bill sits stalled in the Assembly committee since January. The measure, sponsored by Senator Julia Salazar, would require NYSERDA to cover half the cost of e-bike purchases, up to $1,100.

The bill’s summary states it aims to make e-bikes accessible and reduce car dependence.

The report states: 'Air quality and public health in the Bronx will receive a boost from congestion pricing, even under a toll scenario that diverts substantial truck traffic.' The analysis draws from the MTA's environmental assessment, especially Toll Scenario A, which projects less particulate matter (PM2.5) in Bronx air despite increased vehicle miles. The health benefits for Bronx residents match those in Queens, Brooklyn, and Hudson County. Environmental justice and transportation advocates call for rapid electrification of buses and trucks, capping highways, and rigorous air monitoring to prevent new pollution hot spots. The analysis values total health benefits at $20.8 million for 2023.

The real fix: fewer, smaller cars on the road.</p><p class=mb3>On August 17, 2022, Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) pressed the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to address frontover crashes—fatal incidents where large vehicles strike unseen children in front. The senator’s letter called for annual injury and fatality data, improved data collection, and efforts to prevent future deaths. He stated, 'Safety is not—and should never be—a premium feature only available to those who can afford it; it should be the default.' Blumenthal’s push follows a demonstration showing ten children hidden in a single SUV’s blind spot. The bill’s focus is on mandating front cameras, but experts and advocates warn this won’t fix the core problem: cars are too big, too tall, too deadly. As noted, 'The most effective way to reduce tragic frontover deaths is to have fewer cars in American driveways.' Cameras help, but shrinking vehicles and reducing car dependency would save more lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The author presses city leaders, including Mayor Eric Adams, to repurpose street space for climate resilience, referencing the NYC 25x25 challenge.

The bill continues the $7,500 federal EV tax credit and adds a $4,000 credit for used EVs, but omits dedicated funding for electric transit, freight, or e-bikes. Advocates like Yonah Freemark, David Zipper, and Noa Banayan criticize the focus on large electric SUVs and trucks, calling them dangerous for people outside cars. Zipper says, “We’re actually inducing people to buy heavier, more dangerous electric automobiles.” The bill introduces a $3.4 billion Neighborhood Equity and Access Grant, but skips high-speed rail and transit. Advocates urge more action, warning that the bill leaves vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article, titled 'Opinion: Stop Trusting Elon Musk on Tunnels, on Teslas, on Everything,' cites damning crash data and exposes false safety claims around Tesla’s 'Full Self-Driving' feature. At least 273 crashes have been linked to the technology, contradicting Musk’s public statements. The piece urges planners and policymakers to reject Musk’s unproven solutions, including the Boring Company and Hyperloop, and instead focus on reducing vehicle miles traveled. The author warns that uncritical adoption of these technologies endangers vulnerable road users and worsens congestion and pollution. No council bill or vote is involved, but the message is clear: stop trusting tech hype that puts lives at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT Director of Bus Priority Kyle Gebhart said, “Everything is on the table.” The agency’s data shows slow buses and high rates of pedestrian and cyclist injuries. The plan divides the corridor into three segments for tailored solutions, including curbside and center-running bus lanes, transit signal priority, and busways. Some business groups voiced anger over possible parking loss, but transit advocates countered that most shoppers do not drive. Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein said, “Busways are great for business, bringing more customers from more neighborhoods more efficiently and affordably.” The project’s outcome will shape safety for thousands who walk, bike, and ride.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The carnage included hit-and-runs, reckless driving, and unlicensed operators. Adams and Rodriguez said they are 'working every day to deliver true public safety for pedestrians, cyclists, and everyone who uses our streets.' They acknowledged recent progress but warned, 'the disturbing incidents we've seen in recent weeks and the last 48 hours remind us just how fragile those positive steps are and how much more work remains.' The city faces one of its most violent years since Vision Zero began. The numbers: 106 killed citywide in the first half of 2022, surpassing 2015. The crisis is not over. The danger remains.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
