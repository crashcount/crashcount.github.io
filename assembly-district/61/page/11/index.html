Since 2022, five people are dead. Seventeen more are left with injuries so serious they may never walk right again. The numbers do not flinch: <strong>1,689 injured, 3,606 crashes</strong> in just over three years (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The dead are not just numbers. A 68-year-old man, crossing at Forest Avenue and Raymond Place, was struck and killed by an SUV making a left turn. He was in the crosswalk. The driver failed to yield. The man never made it home (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>A year earlier, a 60-year-old man was killed crossing with the signal at Post Avenue. The car turned left.

Trucks and buses added dozens more injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds, a handful. Bikes, a few scrapes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The danger is everywhere. On March 15, two police officers crashed their cruiser into a Staten Island building while swerving to avoid a U-turning car. Both were hospitalized. The street offered no forgiveness. &ldquo;Another vehicle attempted to make a U-turn, causing the police cruiser to swerve to avoid a collision,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/nypd-crash-2-officers-recovering-crashing-police-cruiser-staten-island/16028315/>reported ABC7</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-action>Leadership: Words and Action</h3><p>Assembly Member Charles Fall has spoken up for safer streets. He has <strong>criticized city delays</strong> and failures to redesign dangerous intersections, and has backed laws for daylighting and protected bike lanes. But the carnage continues. The policies move slow. The cars do not.</p><p>The call is clear. &ldquo;It was pretty, pretty fast and then he crashed into a sanitation car&mldr; then he&rsquo;s doing circles and then he crashed out with a police car,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/staten-island-cops-responding-to-gun-call-crash-into-store/>said a witness to a recent crash</a>.</p><h3 id=what-next>What Next?</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.

Bikes bring freedom.</p><p class=mb3>On November 18, 2022, Streetsblog NYC published a public advocacy piece titled "Cargo Bikes: The Happiest Transportation Mode on Earth." The article highlights the Boelens family, who have lived car-free for 11 years, using cargo bikes for daily errands and childcare. The piece states: "We find it's just as easy to get around within a five-mile radius by bike than it is by car. We get exercise, fresh air, and save so much money." The story features direct quotes from Arnout and Nicole Zoeller Boelens, who describe the ease and joy of cycling as a family. No council bill, vote, or committee action is involved. The article challenges the myth that families need cars, showing how street design—not personal choice—shapes safety and mobility for vulnerable road users. No formal safety analyst assessment is included.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The grove honors over 2,100 killed and nearly half a million injured since Vision Zero began in 2014. The Parks Department set aside the space, with saplings planted by volunteers and city workers.

Healthcare costs from vehicle emissions top $21 billion per year in the city. The piece highlights that electric vehicles do not eliminate most toxic emissions, which come from tires and non-tailpipe sources. Traffic noise increases risk of heart attacks, strokes, and dementia. The article quotes, 'People who walk 8.6 minutes a day are 33 percent more likely to report better mental health.' It argues that walking and biking foster stronger communities and civic engagement, while car traffic breeds isolation and danger.

The bill, under committee review, would prohibit right turns on red except at designated intersections and allow cyclists to treat stoplights as yield signs. The matter summary states the act 'will prohibit right-on-reds except at designated intersections.' Council Member Christina Henderson acknowledged the controversy, highlighting that 'the vast majority of [traffic violence] incidents are occurring in communities of color.' Advocates and council members argue the ban will reduce deadly 'right-hook' crashes, especially as large vehicles create blind zones. The bill awaits a final vote and Congressional approval, aiming to protect vulnerable road users and address longstanding inequities in traffic violence.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Elizabeth Adams called for protected bike lanes, saying, 'For the future of our climate and the safety on our streets, protected bike lanes need to be a priority.'

The Mayor’s Management Report shows only 32 protected bike lane miles and 2 bus lane miles added in fiscal year 2022—far short of the annual targets. Councilman Lincoln Restler, District 33, is quoted: “We’ve approved $904 million for better bus lanes, more pedestrian space, and protected bike lanes and now we need to pick up the pace on implementation.” Restler pledges robust oversight and accountability, pressing the Department of Transportation to deliver. The report details frustration from council members and advocates over missed deadlines, slow progress, and persistent dangers for vulnerable road users.

Nearly 20% of top agency positions are vacant. The article, titled 'Just Keeping the Lights On,' details how these gaps cripple street safety and improvement projects. Key leadership roles—chief of staff, general counsel, communications director—remain unfilled. Employees blame city hiring policies, pandemic resignations, and weak leadership from Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. One former staffer says, 'We couldn't produce anything new. We were just keeping the lights on.' Another warns, 'The agency's ability to respond to severe injuries and fatalities is also limited and slow.' Political interference and lack of expertise at the top deepen the crisis.

Author Nicole A. Murray argues the true financial and social burden comes from car culture itself. The article highlights how automotive, oil, and insurance industries siphon money from the public, while political decisions—like Governor Hochul's gas tax suspension—undercut transit funding. The piece states: 'The real cash grab: the silent hands that the automotive and subsidiary industries have in our pockets—all of our pockets—every day.' Murray calls out the hypocrisy of congestion pricing opponents who ignore the needs of transit-dependent New Yorkers. No council bill number or committee is involved; this is a public statement, not legislation. The article exposes how car dependency and predatory lending practices trap working families, while public transportation offers a path to freedom and safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The street has seen 1,594 crashes, 44 cyclist injuries, 67 pedestrian injuries, and three deaths since 2013. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher announced the changes, which include daylighting intersections, banning left turns at key avenues, and adding painted pedestrian extensions. Gallagher said, 'Quick, iterative incremental changes will be a great way to reduce injuries and fatalities rather than waiting for an entire overhaul.' Council Member Lincoln Restler praised the upgrades as 'a step in the right direction.' Bronwyn Breitner of Make McGuinness Safe Coalition called for a full-scale redesign, reallocating space from cars to people.
