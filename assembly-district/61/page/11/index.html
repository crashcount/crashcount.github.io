Manhattan Community Board 4’s Transportation Committee unanimously supported the proposal but urged DOT to add more physical barriers. The plan includes pedestrian islands and repurposes car lanes in some sections, but for 19 blocks, car lanes remain untouched. Council Member Erik Bottcher and local activists pushed for the redesign, citing high crash and fatality rates: 173 crashes this year, 40 injuries, and three pedestrian deaths since 2016. Committee members, including Christine Berthet and Brett Firfer, criticized painted islands as unsafe, calling for concrete or vertical barriers. DOT’s Patrick Kennedy cited resource limits. The agency aims to start work in spring and finish by fall.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article highlights the Boelens family, who have lived car-free for 11 years, using cargo bikes for daily errands and childcare. The piece states: "We find it's just as easy to get around within a five-mile radius by bike than it is by car. We get exercise, fresh air, and save so much money." The story features direct quotes from Arnout and Nicole Zoeller Boelens, who describe the ease and joy of cycling as a family. No council bill, vote, or committee action is involved. The article challenges the myth that families need cars, showing how street design—not personal choice—shapes safety and mobility for vulnerable road users.

The article, titled 'Walkable City 10 Years Later: Cars Make Us Sicker Than We Thought,' draws on studies showing road emissions cause 53,000 early deaths annually in the U.S., with 1,400 in New York City alone. Healthcare costs from vehicle emissions top $21 billion per year in the city. The piece highlights that electric vehicles do not eliminate most toxic emissions, which come from tires and non-tailpipe sources. Traffic noise increases risk of heart attacks, strokes, and dementia. The article quotes, 'People who walk 8.6 minutes a day are 33 percent more likely to report better mental health.' It argues that walking and biking foster stronger communities and civic engagement, while car traffic breeds isolation and danger.

Disability Rights Advocates attorney Meredith Weaver called the process 'hard-fought,' noting that leaders' inaction led to injuries and isolation.

The plan was presented to Manhattan Community Board 12's Traffic and Transportation committee, which gave unanimous advisory support. The DOT aims to install the changes by summer or early fall 2023. The proposal states: 'The city wants to repurpose a pair of car lanes on the Washington Bridge uptown for a two-way bike lane and a bus lane next year, giving a dedicated space to cyclists who are currently forced to share extremely narrow paths with pedestrians.' Lucia Deng, a Transportation Alternatives activist, called the move 'huge,' noting the Bronx and Upper Manhattan have long been neglected. DOT planner Patrick Kennedy said, 'We try to maintain the protected connections as much as possible. They really only work if they’re continuous.' The plan removes 20 parking spaces but connects vital bike and bus routes, giving thousands of non-drivers safer passage.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The study, led by University of Washington researchers, argues that 'rolling back the clocks in November may give millions of Americans an extra hour of sleep, but it also costs human and animal lives on U.S. roads that could be saved by making daylight savings time permanent.' The report found that keeping daylight savings time year-round could prevent 33 human deaths and 36,550 deer deaths annually by reducing crashes during dark hours, especially at peak commute times. A 2004 Rutgers study cited in the report found permanent daylight savings time would cut pedestrian deaths by about 13 percent during dusk and dawn. The researchers stress that systemic changes—like mandatory streetlights, traffic-calming infrastructure, and wildlife crossings—are also needed to protect vulnerable road users and wildlife.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
