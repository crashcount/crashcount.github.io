Twenty-two left with serious injuries.</strong> Nearly 2,000 hurt since 2022. The dead include a 16-year-old on a scooter, a 68-year-old man in a crosswalk, a 78-year-old woman behind the wheel, and a child. The list grows. The pain does not fade.</p><p>Just last month, a 13-year-old boy was thrown from his moped after colliding with an MTA bus on Castleton Avenue. He landed hard. His head struck the pavement. He was rushed to the hospital, fighting for his life. The bus driver and passengers walked away unscathed. Police said, &ldquo;the moped went through a stop sign without stopping and hit the bus&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/moped-bus-collision-staten-island/>amNY</a>).</p><p>On June 29, a 16-year-old riding an electric scooter crossed into the path of a Hyundai Tucson. He died from head trauma. The driver stayed. No charges. Another family shattered (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>The Brooklyn Paper</a>).</p><h2 id=patterns-of-harm-who-pays-the-price>Patterns of Harm: Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage.</strong> They killed two, seriously injured three, and left hundreds with broken bodies. Trucks and buses hurt dozens more. Motorcycles and mopeds, too, leave blood on the street. Even bikes are not blameless. But the deadliest force is always speed and steel.</p><p>The old, the young, the ones on foot or two wheels—they pay the highest price. A pedestrian struck at 30 mph is five times more likely to die than at 20 mph. The city knows this. Albany knows it. Still, the carnage continues.</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-silence-and-the-long-road-ahead>Leadership: Votes, Silence, and the Long Road Ahead</h2><p>Assembly Member Charles Fall has taken some steps. In June, he <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted yes to extend school speed zones</a>, a move meant to protect children near schools. But the streets outside those zones remain dangerous. The crisis is not contained by painted lines or school bells.</p><p>The city now has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so. Every day of delay is another day of risk. As one DOT spokesperson <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/dot-worker-slashed-by-e-biker-manhattan/>said after a worker was slashed on the job</a>, &ldquo;This was an abhorrent assault of a NYC DOT employee who performs critical work to keep our city moving.&rdquo; The violence is not just in the numbers. It is in the wounds, the fear, the empty chairs at dinner tables.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Assembly Member Fall. Call the Council. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for every street, not just the ones near schools. <strong>Do not wait for another child to die.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

As of December 2022, DOT had built only 7.7 miles, with 4.2 miles of new camera-enforced lanes and 7.3 miles under construction. The agency cites staff shortages and budget cuts as the main obstacles. Council members and advocates, including Riders Alliance and the City Council, have condemned the delays and called staff shortages 'unacceptable.' Mayor Adams’s administration has revised its promise, now counting 'enhanced' lanes, not just new ones. DOT spokesman Vin Barone insists the agency intends to meet 2023 goals, but specifics are lacking. The law has no enforcement provision. The city’s one million daily bus riders, many low-income and people of color, continue to suffer slow, unreliable service.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Alfresco NYC Coalition and advocates like Maulin Mehta support shifting oversight to the Department of Transportation (DOT) for a broader, safer approach to curb use. The bill is under active debate, with hearings showing strong support for reclaiming curb space for public benefit, not just cars or restaurants.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates like Rachael Fauss, John McCarthy, Liam Blank, Kate Slevin, and Lisa Daglian urge Hochul and the legislature to boost funding and treat transit as essential. They warn of a 'death spiral' if service cuts and fare hikes hit. Hochul’s support for projects like the Interborough Express and congestion pricing is noted.

Healthcare costs from vehicle emissions top $21 billion per year in the city. The piece highlights that electric vehicles do not eliminate most toxic emissions, which come from tires and non-tailpipe sources. Traffic noise increases risk of heart attacks, strokes, and dementia. The article quotes, 'People who walk 8.6 minutes a day are 33 percent more likely to report better mental health.'

The city must keep these ramps in working order, but sidewalks beyond the ramps are excluded. The matter, titled 'Why Do People With Disabilities Have to Sue To Get Accessible Sidewalks?', highlights the city's long resistance to basic ADA compliance. Plaintiffs like Fran Fulton said, 'They're responding to our needs now because we sued them.' Disability Rights Advocates attorney Meredith Weaver called the process 'hard-fought,' noting that leaders' inaction led to injuries and isolation. Weaver stressed that proactive, well-funded sidewalk networks—not lawsuits—would better protect people with mobility challenges. This settlement forces overdue action, but leaves many sidewalks unsafe.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan was presented to Manhattan Community Board 12's Traffic and Transportation committee, which gave unanimous advisory support. The DOT aims to install the changes by summer or early fall 2023. The proposal states: 'The city wants to repurpose a pair of car lanes on the Washington Bridge uptown for a two-way bike lane and a bus lane next year, giving a dedicated space to cyclists who are currently forced to share extremely narrow paths with pedestrians.' Lucia Deng, a Transportation Alternatives activist, called the move 'huge,' noting the Bronx and Upper Manhattan have long been neglected. DOT planner Patrick Kennedy said, 'We try to maintain the protected connections as much as possible. They really only work if they’re continuous.' The plan removes 20 parking spaces but connects vital bike and bus routes, giving thousands of non-drivers safer passage.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
