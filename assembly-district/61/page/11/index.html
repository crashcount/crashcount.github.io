Since 2022, five people are dead. Seventeen more are left with injuries so serious they may never walk right again. The numbers do not flinch: <strong>1,689 injured, 3,606 crashes</strong> in just over three years (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The dead are not just numbers. A 68-year-old man, crossing at Forest Avenue and Raymond Place, was struck and killed by an SUV making a left turn. He was in the crosswalk. The driver failed to yield. The man never made it home (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>A year earlier, a 60-year-old man was killed crossing with the signal at Post Avenue. The car turned left. He bled out in the street (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=streets-still-unsafe>Streets Still Unsafe</h3><p>The violence is not random. <strong>Most deaths come from cars and SUVs.</strong> In this district, cars and SUVs killed two, left two more with serious injuries, and hurt over 300 people. Trucks and buses added dozens more injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds, a handful. Bikes, a few scrapes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The danger is everywhere. On March 15, two police officers crashed their cruiser into a Staten Island building while swerving to avoid a U-turning car. Both were hospitalized. The street offered no forgiveness. &ldquo;Another vehicle attempted to make a U-turn, causing the police cruiser to swerve to avoid a collision,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/nypd-crash-2-officers-recovering-crashing-police-cruiser-staten-island/16028315/>reported ABC7</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-action>Leadership: Words and Action</h3><p>Assembly Member Charles Fall has spoken up for safer streets. He has <strong>criticized city delays</strong> and failures to redesign dangerous intersections, and has backed laws for daylighting and protected bike lanes. But the carnage continues. The policies move slow. The cars do not.</p><p>The call is clear. &ldquo;It was pretty, pretty fast and then he crashed into a sanitation car&mldr; then he&rsquo;s doing circles and then he crashed out with a police car,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/staten-island-cops-responding-to-gun-call-crash-into-store/>said a witness to a recent crash</a>.</p><h3 id=what-next>What Next?</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every delay means another family broken. Call Assembly Member Fall. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real street redesigns. <strong>Do not wait for another body in the road.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The proposal, supported by Transportation Alternatives and Streetsblog NYC, urges policymakers to use tax revenue to fund safer infrastructure. The article states, 'one efficient policy would be to tax large vehicles and use the revenue to build the infrastructure needed for safer streets.' The analysis draws a direct line between the rise of SUVs and pickups and the surge in pedestrian deaths. It notes that the largest vehicles are the deadliest, especially for those on foot or bike. The piece argues that taxing these vehicles would not only discourage their use but also shift the burden of their societal costs back onto their owners. The model follows Washington, D.C.'s recent move to scale registration fees by vehicle size and dedicate funds to safety programs. The message is blunt: fewer giant vehicles, more lives saved.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Mayor’s Management Report shows only 32 protected bike lane miles and 2 bus lane miles added in fiscal year 2022—far short of the annual targets. Councilman Lincoln Restler, District 33, is quoted: “We’ve approved $904 million for better bus lanes, more pedestrian space, and protected bike lanes and now we need to pick up the pace on implementation.” Restler pledges robust oversight and accountability, pressing the Department of Transportation to deliver. The report details frustration from council members and advocates over missed deadlines, slow progress, and persistent dangers for vulnerable road users.

Nearly 20% of top agency positions are vacant. The article, titled 'Just Keeping the Lights On,' details how these gaps cripple street safety and improvement projects. Key leadership roles—chief of staff, general counsel, communications director—remain unfilled. Employees blame city hiring policies, pandemic resignations, and weak leadership from Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. One former staffer says, 'We couldn't produce anything new. We were just keeping the lights on.' Another warns, 'The agency's ability to respond to severe injuries and fatalities is also limited and slow.' Political interference and lack of expertise at the top deepen the crisis.

Author Nicole A. Murray argues the true financial and social burden comes from car culture itself. The article highlights how automotive, oil, and insurance industries siphon money from the public, while political decisions—like Governor Hochul's gas tax suspension—undercut transit funding. The piece states: 'The real cash grab: the silent hands that the automotive and subsidiary industries have in our pockets—all of our pockets—every day.' Murray calls out the hypocrisy of congestion pricing opponents who ignore the needs of transit-dependent New Yorkers. No council bill number or committee is involved; this is a public statement, not legislation.

Council Member Lincoln Restler praised the upgrades as 'a step in the right direction.'

The analysis draws from the MTA's environmental assessment, especially Toll Scenario A, which projects less particulate matter (PM2.5) in Bronx air despite increased vehicle miles. The health benefits for Bronx residents match those in Queens, Brooklyn, and Hudson County. Environmental justice and transportation advocates call for rapid electrification of buses and trucks, capping highways, and rigorous air monitoring to prevent new pollution hot spots.

The senator’s letter called for annual injury and fatality data, improved data collection, and efforts to prevent future deaths. He stated, 'Safety is not—and should never be—a premium feature only available to those who can afford it; it should be the default.' Blumenthal’s push follows a demonstration showing ten children hidden in a single SUV’s blind spot. The bill’s focus is on mandating front cameras, but experts and advocates warn this won’t fix the core problem: cars are too big, too tall, too deadly. As noted, 'The most effective way to reduce tragic frontover deaths is to have fewer cars in American driveways.'
