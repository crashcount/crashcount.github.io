Twenty-two left with serious injuries.</strong> Nearly 2,000 hurt since 2022. The dead include a 16-year-old on a scooter, a 68-year-old man in a crosswalk, a 78-year-old woman behind the wheel, and a child. The list grows. The pain does not fade.</p><p>Just last month, a 13-year-old boy was thrown from his moped after colliding with an MTA bus on Castleton Avenue. He landed hard. His head struck the pavement. He was rushed to the hospital, fighting for his life. The bus driver and passengers walked away unscathed. Police said, &ldquo;the moped went through a stop sign without stopping and hit the bus&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/moped-bus-collision-staten-island/>amNY</a>).</p><p>On June 29, a 16-year-old riding an electric scooter crossed into the path of a Hyundai Tucson. He died from head trauma. The driver stayed. No charges. Another family shattered (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>The Brooklyn Paper</a>).</p><h2 id=patterns-of-harm-who-pays-the-price>Patterns of Harm: Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage.</strong> They killed two, seriously injured three, and left hundreds with broken bodies. Trucks and buses hurt dozens more. Motorcycles and mopeds, too, leave blood on the street. Even bikes are not blameless. But the deadliest force is always speed and steel.</p><p>The old, the young, the ones on foot or two wheels—they pay the highest price. A pedestrian struck at 30 mph is five times more likely to die than at 20 mph. The city knows this. Albany knows it. Still, the carnage continues.</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-silence-and-the-long-road-ahead>Leadership: Votes, Silence, and the Long Road Ahead</h2><p>Assembly Member Charles Fall has taken some steps. In June, he <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted yes to extend school speed zones</a>, a move meant to protect children near schools. But the streets outside those zones remain dangerous. The crisis is not contained by painted lines or school bells.</p><p>The city now has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so. Every day of delay is another day of risk. As one DOT spokesperson <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/dot-worker-slashed-by-e-biker-manhattan/>said after a worker was slashed on the job</a>, &ldquo;This was an abhorrent assault of a NYC DOT employee who performs critical work to keep our city moving.&rdquo; The violence is not just in the numbers. It is in the wounds, the fear, the empty chairs at dinner tables.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Assembly Member Fall. Call the Council. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for every street, not just the ones near schools. <strong>Do not wait for another child to die.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Family and advocates say the plan skips key safety fixes. Jersey barriers leave gaps. Pedestrian islands and bike signals are missing. The city delays. Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On May 19, 2023, the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) latest redesign proposal for Ninth Street in Gowanus drew fire at a Community Board 6 meeting. The plan, discussed in the Transportation and Public Safety Committees, adds buffer-protected bike lanes and some jersey barriers, but skips driveways and omits pedestrian islands, raised intersections, and bicycle signals. Maxime Le Munier, whose wife Sarah Schick was killed by a truck driver on Ninth Street, said, “What we want is to guarantee everyone’s safety, and it seems like it’s going to fall short.” Community Board 6 Transportation Chair Doug Gordon and Public Safety Chair Jerry Armer echoed calls for stronger, faster action. Council Member Hanif hosted a recent event on the issue. The committees unanimously approved the DOT proposal with conditions: more pedestrian safety, more traffic calming, and a comprehensive plan for all of Ninth Street. DOT has not set a timeline. Schick’s family is suing the city for $100 million, alleging negligence.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists still face danger. Parks closed the path but failed to set a safe detour. Riders dodge cars, confusion, and construction. The city drags its feet.</p><p class=mb3>The Ocean Parkway bike lane repair project, funded in 2019 by then-Borough President Eric Adams and former Council Member Mark Treyger, finally began in May 2023 after years of delays. The $2.6-million, seven-block overhaul—managed by the Parks Department—targets the cracked 1894 path between avenues R and X. Construction, delayed by the pandemic and contract issues, will continue through March 2024. The Parks Department closed the northernmost block but failed to provide a safe, legal detour for cyclists, leaving them to navigate dangerous service roads and unclear signage. Treyger celebrated the start on social media, thanking advocates. Jon Orcutt of Bike New York criticized Parks for slow, unsafe detour practices, saying, 'They should be working on it based on function.' Lawmakers have introduced legislation to speed up Parks capital projects. Cyclists remain at risk until the city fixes its broken process.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The program, starting fall 2023 in West Harlem, covers up to 10 residential blocks and 14 public schools. The DSNY report, with McKinsey input, finds containerization viable for most neighborhoods. The matter aims to 'remove garbage bags from sidewalks' and address public health. Council member Shaun Abreu supports the initiative, calling current practices 'backwards' and endorsing large-scale containerization. Advocates like CHEKPEDS founder Christine Berthet support repurposing parking for trash containers, citing sidewalk access. The city will double trash collection in the pilot area, with $5.7 million allocated. The plan faces challenges in dense areas, but signals a shift toward safer, cleaner streets for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He says it could break the political deadlock. The plan keeps most benefits: less traffic, faster buses, more transit cash. Regular drivers would pay more. Occasional drivers get a break.</p><p class=mb3>On April 26, 2023, Charles Komanoff proposed a policy tweak to New York’s stalled congestion pricing plan. The plan, passed by the state legislature in 2019, remains stuck in federal review. Komanoff suggests, 'let’s give every household in the 12-county MTA region a single untolled trip per month into the congestion zone.' He argues this would address fairness concerns and soften opposition from occasional drivers. The freebie would cut annual net revenues by $110 million, but Komanoff says this could be offset by raising tolls for regular commuters. The proposal aims to preserve congestion pricing’s core goals: less traffic, faster travel, and more funding for transit.

Bus Lane Cameras Reduce Collisions, Speed Commutes, MTA Says,' highlighted MTA data: routes with automated bus lane enforcement (ABLE) saw 25 percent fewer crashes and 5 percent faster bus speeds over four years. MTA New York City Transit President Richard Davey testified, calling camera enforcement 'one of the most efficient and effective tools at our disposal.' MTA board member Andrew Albert pushed for more dedicated lanes, while CEO Janno Lieber urged Mayor Adams to meet legal bus lane minimums. The MTA aims to expand cameras to 1,000 buses, covering 80 percent of lanes. The city DOT has fallen behind on required bus lane mileage. Delivery firms like Amazon and UPS are frequent offenders. The MTA is also redesigning routes and reallocating dispatchers to cut bus bunching.

The Safer Fleets Challenge calls for Intelligent Speed Assist in 50 municipal fleets by 2025. Pilots show sharp drops in speeding and crashes. Officials say it saves lives and money.</p><p class=mb3>""This is not something cutting edge... This is the U.S. falling behind and needing to catch up what's happening in other countries ... If you ask a parent if they would like to have this technology in their cars for their teenagers, I would venture to guess almost every parent would say yes. If we want it for our teenagers, we should want it for everyone—because everyone is sharing the roads with each other."" -- Charles Fall</p><p class=mb3>On April 20, 2023, a coalition of transportation advocates launched the Safer Fleets Challenge, urging 50 U.S. communities to install Intelligent Speed Assist (ISA) technology on municipal vehicles by 2025. The campaign, highlighted in a Streetsblog NYC article, states: 'Some of America's most prominent sustainable transportation advocacy organizations are challenging governments to embrace a ground-breaking technology that makes it impossible for drivers to speed, starting with the vehicles in their own fleets.' Former council member Erica Gilmore and America Walks president Mike McGinn voiced strong support. Gilmore said, 'Greater safety, of course, would lead to budget savings over the long run for cities and towns.'

Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On April 19, 2023, Mayor Eric Adams endorsed a pilot to make two bus routes free in each borough, totaling ten free buses. The plan is part of the 'Fix the MTA' package, originally championed by Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and progressive allies. Adams said, 'I strongly support the thought of having 10 buses being free on lines in the city. I think it would make a major impact.' Mamdani called free buses 'transformative' for working-class New Yorkers. Despite this, other bus improvements lag. Adams pledged 150 miles of new bus lanes in four years, but only 11.95 miles were built last year. Some projects stalled amid political opposition. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber stressed the need for city commitment to bus lanes and warned of fare hikes and service cuts if funding gaps persist.

The analysis found that containers could replace sidewalk trash piles, freeing up as much as 25 percent of pedestrian space. The Department of Transportation is redesigning the road, adding curb extensions and loading zones, while the Department of Sanitation considers new collection methods. The plan calls for curbside bins, reducing sidewalk obstacles for pedestrians and shifting space away from cars and trash.

One was a child. Drivers struck victims at dangerous intersections. City allowed parked cars to block sightlines. DOT resists daylighting. Police killed one victim. Advocates demand action. Streets remain deadly. Accountability is missing.</p><p class=mb3>A pending City Council bill would require daylighting—removing parking near corners—at 100 intersections per year. The Department of Transportation opposes the bill. The issue gained urgency after three pedestrians, including 7-year-old Dolma Naadhun, died in separate crashes over the weekend of February 19, 2023. One victim was killed at an intersection where parked cars blocked visibility and the ADA ramp. Another, Zabina Gafoor, was struck by an NYPD vehicle responding to an emergency. Advocates, including Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives, condemned the city’s failure to implement proven safety measures, saying, 'Our city’s children deserve to grow up without the threat of traffic violence.' The bill remains pending. Critics say the city’s refusal to daylight intersections and hold drivers accountable continues to put lives at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
