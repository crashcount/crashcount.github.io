Twenty-two left with serious injuries.</strong> Nearly 2,000 hurt since 2022. The dead include a 16-year-old on a scooter, a 68-year-old man in a crosswalk, a 78-year-old woman behind the wheel, and a child. The list grows. The pain does not fade.</p><p>Just last month, a 13-year-old boy was thrown from his moped after colliding with an MTA bus on Castleton Avenue. He landed hard. His head struck the pavement. He was rushed to the hospital, fighting for his life. The bus driver and passengers walked away unscathed. Police said, &ldquo;the moped went through a stop sign without stopping and hit the bus&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/moped-bus-collision-staten-island/>amNY</a>).</p><p>On June 29, a 16-year-old riding an electric scooter crossed into the path of a Hyundai Tucson. He died from head trauma. The driver stayed. No charges. Another family shattered (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>The Brooklyn Paper</a>).</p><h2 id=patterns-of-harm-who-pays-the-price>Patterns of Harm: Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage.</strong> They killed two, seriously injured three, and left hundreds with broken bodies. Trucks and buses hurt dozens more. Motorcycles and mopeds, too, leave blood on the street. Even bikes are not blameless. But the deadliest force is always speed and steel.</p><p>The old, the young, the ones on foot or two wheels—they pay the highest price. A pedestrian struck at 30 mph is five times more likely to die than at 20 mph. The city knows this. Albany knows it. Still, the carnage continues.</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-silence-and-the-long-road-ahead>Leadership: Votes, Silence, and the Long Road Ahead</h2><p>Assembly Member Charles Fall has taken some steps. In June, he <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted yes to extend school speed zones</a>, a move meant to protect children near schools. But the streets outside those zones remain dangerous. The crisis is not contained by painted lines or school bells.</p><p>The city now has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so. Every day of delay is another day of risk. As one DOT spokesperson <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/dot-worker-slashed-by-e-biker-manhattan/>said after a worker was slashed on the job</a>, &ldquo;This was an abhorrent assault of a NYC DOT employee who performs critical work to keep our city moving.&rdquo; The violence is not just in the numbers. It is in the wounds, the fear, the empty chairs at dinner tables.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Assembly Member Fall. Call the Council. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for every street, not just the ones near schools. <strong>Do not wait for another child to die.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

No answers given.</p><p class=mb3>On February 28, 2022, city agencies responded to the death of Lin Wen-Chiang, 77, who was killed after his bike struck a caved-in section of 40th Drive in Elmhurst, Queens. The matter, titled 'City Covers Up Failure After Cyclist Death, With Hastily Made Repairs After Months of 311 Complaints,' details how residents filed at least eight 311 complaints to the Department of Transportation and 14 to the Department of Environmental Protection since 2019. Both agencies failed to fix the hazard. Only after Wen-Chiang’s death did city workers patch the road, but the repair was rushed and left uneven, creating a new danger. DOT spokesman Vin Barone called it 'a tragedy' and said an investigation is underway. DEP claimed the subsurface infrastructure was sound. No council members are named. The city’s neglect cost a life and left the street unsafe for cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The announcement, covered by Streetsblog NYC, focused on broad climate issues. Advocates, including Jaqi Cohen and Kevin Garcia, pressed the new office to prioritize transportation emissions, quoting, 'improving transit options and creating access for environmental justice communities, while also curbing harmful diesel emissions.' Aggarwala voiced support for congestion pricing, pedestrianization, and bus lanes, promising collaboration with the Department of Transportation. Transportation emissions have dropped only 5% since 2007, while car ownership rises. Advocates urge the climate team to work with DOT on bus and bike lanes, last-mile delivery, and cargo bikes to meet climate and justice goals.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Planners shift focus. Streets change. Fewer cars, more homes. Demand-based pricing rises. Public space gets new life. The old rules crumble. The car’s grip loosens. Vulnerable road users watch the system bend.</p><p class=mb3>This policy analysis, published January 31, 2022, reviews the swift rollback of mandatory parking minimums across U.S. cities and states. The article, 'Analysis: The Decline and Fall of Mandatory Parking Minimums,' highlights reforms like removing off-street parking requirements, charging demand-based prices, and investing parking revenue in public services. Cities such as South Bend, Sacramento, Berkeley, Minneapolis, and others lead the charge. State-level changes in Oregon, California, and Connecticut follow. The analysis credits UCLA Professor Donald Shoup’s influence. No council bill number or committee is cited, as this is a legislative trend, not a single bill. The piece notes, 'Minimum parking requirements are on the way out.' These reforms embed parking changes within broader housing and zoning efforts, aiming to cut car dependency and boost affordable housing. No direct safety analyst note is included, but the trend signals a shift in urban priorities that could reshape streets for all users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The real number for maximum benefit is $80. Politicians settle low. The city leaves billions on the table. Transit, air, and streets stay dangerous. Cars keep winning. Vulnerable lives pay.</p><p class=mb3>This editorial, published January 27, 2022, argues for a much higher congestion pricing toll than the $13–$15 range under discussion. Contributor Charles Komanoff, using his Balanced Transportation Analyzer, finds that an $80 toll would maximize net societal benefit, nearly $10 billion yearly. The article states: 'A $13 or $15 congestion toll might be all the politicians think they can achieve, but such a low fee will fail to maximize the net societal benefit.' Komanoff’s analysis shows the current plan extracts only half the possible benefit while charging less than a fifth of the optimal toll. No council member is named; this is an expert’s call to action. The piece notes that higher tolls could fund subway safety upgrades and faster trains, but the city’s political will remains weak. Vulnerable road users remain at risk as cars dominate.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A 75-year-old pedestrian was hit midblock by a driver in a Lincoln Corsair. Gallagher wrote, 'Extremely distressing to see another serious crash injuring a pedestrian on McGuinness. I’m thinking about the victim and continuing to fight for our improvements, which can’t come soon enough.' The street, notorious for speeding and poor crossings, is slated for a $39 million redesign after years of advocacy and deadly crashes. The Make McGuinness Safe Coalition and residents have pushed for a road diet, bike lanes, and traffic calming. The Department of Transportation is gathering public feedback, with construction expected later this year. Gallagher’s stance and the community’s demands highlight the urgent need to protect vulnerable road users on this dangerous stretch.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article, titled “Why Tesla Can Program Its Cars to Break Road Safety Laws,” exposes how Tesla’s October 2021 software update lets drivers select aggressive profiles. In ‘assertive’ mode, Teslas tailgate, perform unsafe passes, and roll through stops—illegal actions in most states. Phil Koopman, an autonomous vehicle expert, said, “Basically, Tesla is programming its cars to break laws.” The report highlights a regulatory gap: U.S. law punishes drivers, not manufacturers. Some states shield automakers, while others seek accountability. NHTSA investigates, but action lags. Tesla faces no immediate recall. The result: automated vehicles threaten pedestrians and cyclists, while lawmakers and regulators look away.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
