Since 2022, five people are dead. Seventeen more are left with injuries so serious they may never walk right again. The numbers do not flinch: <strong>1,689 injured, 3,606 crashes</strong> in just over three years (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The dead are not just numbers. A 68-year-old man, crossing at Forest Avenue and Raymond Place, was struck and killed by an SUV making a left turn. He was in the crosswalk. The driver failed to yield. The man never made it home (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>A year earlier, a 60-year-old man was killed crossing with the signal at Post Avenue.

Trucks and buses added dozens more injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds, a handful. Bikes, a few scrapes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The danger is everywhere. On March 15, two police officers crashed their cruiser into a Staten Island building while swerving to avoid a U-turning car. Both were hospitalized. The street offered no forgiveness. &ldquo;Another vehicle attempted to make a U-turn, causing the police cruiser to swerve to avoid a collision,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/nypd-crash-2-officers-recovering-crashing-police-cruiser-staten-island/16028315/>reported ABC7</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-action>Leadership: Words and Action</h3><p>Assembly Member Charles Fall has spoken up for safer streets. He has <strong>criticized city delays</strong> and failures to redesign dangerous intersections, and has backed laws for daylighting and protected bike lanes. But the carnage continues. The policies move slow.

The change, reported by Streetsblog NYC, limits car-free hours to Saturdays only from May to September—a 50 percent cut from last year’s already reduced schedule. The program, once a weekend staple from spring to fall, now faces its smallest footprint yet. Alex Morano, a volunteer organizer, called the rollback 'really unfortunate,' stressing the street’s value to the neighborhood. Saskia Haegens, Chair of the Prospect Heights Neighborhood Development Corporation, urged full city funding, saying the program is 'transformative.' Organizers blame insufficient city support, with less than half the cost covered this year. The Department of Transportation claims $10 million in annual support and promises a permanent redesign, but for now, cars win back space. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, families—lose a vital refuge.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Heidi Simon, a leading advocate, said, 'It's disheartening to know that there are people in the trenches at the local and state level who relied on these resources to get their jobs done, and their jobs just got made harder.' The loss scatters vital research, making it harder for cities—especially smaller ones—to build safer streets.

The piece, titled 'Gov. Hochul Could Transform Our City with Parking Reform,' argues, 'With permission from the state, New York City could enact a citywide, resident-only parking system. Non-residents needn’t be banned from parking here, just charged for it, with the money going to the MTA.' The editorial highlights rampant illegal vehicle registrations and the dangers they pose, including uninsured cars and increased risk for cyclists. The proposal urges charging both residents and visitors for parking, with higher rates in dense, wealthy areas. The plan aims to reduce congestion, generate MTA revenue, and reclaim curb space for safer uses. No council member is directly named, as this is an opinion piece, but the call is clear: state action is needed to protect vulnerable road users and restore trust in public space management.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

MTA spokesperson Laura Cala-Rauch said the program 'is having a big impact on speeding buses and improving the quality of life for New Yorkers.' Data from Jehiah Czebotar shows cameras now issue 76.4% of bus lane and stop tickets—93% by December. Bus speeds rose 5%, crashes involving buses dropped 20%, and emissions fell up to 10%. Persistent violators remain, with some drivers racking up five tickets. Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein called for escalating fines and legislative changes to target repeat offenders.

The IBO states: 'It will be virtually impossible for the city to meet the City Council's required 150 miles of new bus lanes at the pace Mayor Adams is going.' Mayor Adams, who took office in 2022, has slowed or killed key bus projects, including the Fordham Road busway. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno claims the agency is building protected lanes and using cameras for enforcement, but admits resources are tight. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams has called for compliance but not funded it. Riders Alliance spokesman Danny Pearlstein blames hiring freezes and political interference for 'broken promises and neglected legislation.' The report shows that while DOT’s budget grew, staffing for bus lane expansion fell. Bus speeds remain stuck at 8.1 mph.

Simone wants action, not talk.</p><p class=mb3>Bill number pending. On January 6, 2025, Council Member Tony Simone announced a legislative push to require the MTA to install platform screen doors and gates system-wide within five years. The bill, still in proposal stage, will move through the relevant council committee. Simone’s proposal comes after a spate of subway violence, including a recent shove onto tracks in his district. The bill summary states: 'My legislation will require the MTA to install platform screen doors and gates system-wide within five years.' Simone urges the use of congestion pricing revenue for these safety upgrades, arguing, 'No priority is higher on any rider's mind, including mine, than safety on the system.' Simone is the primary sponsor. The measure aims to prevent fatal and dangerous falls and shoves, focusing on protecting riders from harm.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Hochul defended her pause, then reversed course after the election. Former Governor Cuomo and Hochul both failed to deliver the toll on time.

Streetsblog’s December 23, 2024 recap highlights the struggle to end car carnage. The piece notes, 'America's first-ever congestion pricing program had been paused at the 11th hour... brought back in November, though in a sadly diminished form.' USDOT approved a rule for automatic pedestrian emergency braking in new cars. Atlanta passed a right-on-red ban. St. Louis invested $300 million in sustainable transport. Canadian leaders pushed for high car registration fees to fund transit. No single council member is named; instead, the review tracks national and local leaders’ actions. The article underscores that, despite new laws and investments, systemic danger remains.

The matter, reported by Streetsblog NYC, centers on New York’s offer of over $100 million for New Jersey Transit, potentially as an annual payment from congestion toll revenue. Hochul said, 'We've made multiple offers to settle this lawsuit. Very generous offers.' New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy refused, risking further strain on NJ Transit, which recently raised fares 15 percent. Riders Alliance’s Betsy Plum called Murphy’s stance 'a stubbornness tax' paid by transit riders. Environmental advocates criticized Murphy for blocking improvements to public transportation. The congestion pricing program, set to be the nation’s first, remains tied up in court.

Kathy Hochul's office refused to release her daily schedule for April, May, and June—the months when she halted congestion pricing. Streetsblog filed two Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) requests (R001199-062024 and R001389-102924), both denied or delayed without reason. The matter centers on the governor's decision to 'pause congestion pricing,' a move that impacts every New Yorker who walks, bikes, or rides transit. Heather Murray of Cornell Law School called the delay 'unconscionable,' saying, 'Delaying release of these records for six months is tantamount to denial of the request and violates the Freedom of Information Law.' Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance urged Hochul to 'level with New Yorkers.'

The Parks Department said, 'While durable repairs have been made, efforts are ongoing to address underlying challenges and create a stronger, safer greenway for New Yorkers.' The path, north of the George Washington Bridge, has collapsed twice in two years. Advocates like Allegra LeGrande and Ira Gershenhorn, along with former Traffic Commissioner Sam Schwartz, urge the city to convert a Henry Hudson Parkway lane into a protected bike path. They call this 'low-hanging fruit.' Instead, the city has forced cyclists onto dangerous, unprotected detours. The city’s refusal to provide a safe, direct route exposes vulnerable road users to ongoing harm.
