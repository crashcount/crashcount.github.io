The statement followed a spate of violence: 'Car drivers killed at least three people and injured seven others, including an 11-year-old boy.' The carnage included hit-and-runs, reckless driving, and unlicensed operators. Adams and Rodriguez said they are 'working every day to deliver true public safety for pedestrians, cyclists, and everyone who uses our streets.' They acknowledged recent progress but warned, 'the disturbing incidents we've seen in recent weeks and the last 48 hours remind us just how fragile those positive steps are and how much more work remains.' The city faces one of its most violent years since Vision Zero began. The numbers: 106 killed citywide in the first half of 2022, surpassing 2015. The crisis is not over.

The plan, described as 'crucial for providing protected access to parks and greenways,' faces criticism from activists and residents who say it lacks key connections and leaves cyclists exposed. CB11 member John Kelly, speaking personally, voiced fear for his child’s safety and called for a shift in car culture. Victor Dadras, chair of the CB11 Transportation Committee, called the plan 'a step in the right direction' but admitted it is incomplete. The committee will discuss the proposal further, with a full board vote expected in September. DOT may begin marking lanes in the fall.

Comptroller Brad Lander sounded the alarm, saying, 'These payouts cost over a hundred of million dollars a year, and can never account for the damage to traffic victims and their families. Traffic violence has a price NYC cannot afford.' The NYPD, Department of Sanitation, FDNY, Department of Environmental Protection, and DOT accounted for nearly all payouts. Only Sanitation and DOT responded to the report. The city’s own fleet remains a threat to vulnerable road users.

Speaking publicly, Lieber said, "If it doesn't happen, at some point we can't award contracts that are dependent on having capital, the cash a couple of years later." The matter centers on congestion pricing, which Lieber and advocates call the largest, most environmentally beneficial funding source for the MTA. Projects at risk include the Second Avenue Subway, ADA accessibility improvements, and zero-emissions buses. Lieber opposes broad exemptions, arguing carve-outs weaken the plan. Rachel Fauss, a transit advocate, stressed, "There is no other source to fill that $15 billion hole."

The report, titled 'Study: Cycling is 10x More Important Than Electric Cars For Reaching Net Zero,' finds that 'tackling the climate and air pollution crises requires curbing all motorised transport, particularly private cars, as quickly as possible.' No council members are named; this is a research-driven analysis, not a legislative action. The study tracked 4,000 urban residents across Europe, showing daily cyclists had 84% lower travel emissions than non-cyclists. It argues that active travel—cycling, walking, e-biking—cuts emissions faster than waiting for electric cars to replace gas vehicles.

Owners of 6,000-pound behemoths now pay $500, up from $155. The city aims to fund safer streets and fix battered roads. Councilmember Mary Cheh says it’s a step to offset harm from oversized vehicles.</p><p class=mb3>On May 27, 2022, the D.C. Council passed a bill to increase registration fees for large SUVs. The measure, led by Transportation Committee Chairwoman Mary Cheh, boosts fees to $500 for vehicles over 6,000 pounds, $250 for 5,000–6,000 pounds, and $175 for 3,500–5,000 pounds. The bill summary states, 'the larger a vehicle, the worse it is for the environment, the more damage it causes to our roads, and the more dangerous to others using the roadway.' Cheh, who wrote the proposal, said, 'drivers who pick these larger vehicles will now need to pay a bit more to compensate for that additional damage.' The council expects the new fees to raise $40 million over five years, funding street safety projects and road repairs. Cheh admits the policy is not a cure-all for traffic violence but calls it a step forward to recoup costs from oversized vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Executive Director Terri Carta of the Brooklyn Greenway Initiative said, 'NYC Parks and DOT need to provide a safe alternative for greenway users during construction.'

Santaella opposes the current DOT plan and urges a redesign: reduce car lanes to four, add center-running bus lanes, fully separated bikeways, and wider sidewalks. He warns that mountable curbs let drivers invade bike lanes, putting cyclists at risk. Bus riders see little benefit, still stuck behind double-parked cars.

Restler emphasized that the funding will harden bike lanes, replacing paint with physical barriers to keep cars out and protect cyclists.
