Since 2022, five people are dead. Seventeen more are left with injuries so serious they may never walk right again. The numbers do not flinch: <strong>1,689 injured, 3,606 crashes</strong> in just over three years (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The dead are not just numbers. A 68-year-old man, crossing at Forest Avenue and Raymond Place, was struck and killed by an SUV making a left turn. He was in the crosswalk. The driver failed to yield.

On March 15, two police officers crashed their cruiser into a Staten Island building while swerving to avoid a U-turning car. Both were hospitalized.

The matter, titled 'Advocates Warn Against Further Delays on Commercial Waste Zones,' drew sharp criticism after the Department of Sanitation granted private carters a three-month extension to comply with new requirements. Nurse stated, 'Our communities cannot afford any more delays.' Advocates and Families for Safe Streets highlighted the deadly toll: reckless commercial haulers have killed more than two dozen people in recent years. The reform aims to cut truck traffic, reduce pollution, and require life-saving side guards on heavy trucks by 2024. Lauren Pine, a crash survivor, said, 'Commercial waste zone reform can not come fast enough.'

The plan, part of the 'Great Streets' project, keeps eight car lanes and installs only lightly protected bike lanes with mountable curbs. Samuel Santaella, the author, writes: 'the department has discriminated against thousands of bikers and 13,630 pre-pandemic daily bus riders in order to privilege the needs of 40,000 daily motorists.' Santaella opposes the current DOT plan and urges a redesign: reduce car lanes to four, add center-running bus lanes, fully separated bikeways, and wider sidewalks. He warns that mountable curbs let drivers invade bike lanes, putting cyclists at risk. Bus riders see little benefit, still stuck behind double-parked cars.

The plan, part of ongoing budget talks, aims to fund hundreds of miles of protected bike and bus lanes, plus concrete barriers. Council Member Lincoln Restler of District 33, a member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, praised the move as 'a very clear commitment to addressing street safety across the five boroughs.' The proposal supports the Streets Master Plan, which mandates 250 miles of protected bike lanes and 150 miles of protected bus lanes in five years. Restler emphasized that the funding will harden bike lanes, replacing paint with physical barriers to keep cars out and protect cyclists. The Council had requested $3.1 billion, but Restler called the $900 million a dramatic investment.

The report, titled 'Study: Car Ownership Doesn’t Always Cut Black Workers’ Commutes,' finds that despite an increase in car ownership among Black workers—from 76% in 1980 to 85% in 2019—average commute times grew longer, not shorter. The study states, 'it may not be possible to speed up city commutes with automotive strategies alone.' The gap in commute times between Black and White workers persists, especially in large, segregated cities. The article warns that subsidizing driving will make streets more polluted and dangerous, with the heaviest toll on communities of color. It calls for investment in bus rapid transit, trains, and active transportation, and for building communities where jobs and housing are close.

The article states: 'The Bombers do nothing to promote—and, in fact, discourage—fans from visiting Yankee Stadium by bicycle.' There are no bike racks at the stadium. Helmets are banned inside. Painted bike lanes are blocked by double-parked cars. No protected bike lanes exist near the stadium. The Macombs Dam Bridge approach is hazardous. The Yankees promote transit but ignore cycling. No council members are directly involved.

The proposal, part of the council’s response to the mayor’s $98.5 billion preliminary budget, seeks to expand protected bike lanes to 500 miles, bus lanes to 500 miles, and add 38 million feet of pedestrian space. The council’s plan also introduces 40 miles of car-free busways, a benchmark not found in the mayor’s plan or previous legislation. Adams and other council leaders argue this funding is vital, stating, 'To secure an equitable recovery for our city and improve public safety, we must focus on robust investments.' Transit advocates back the plan, urging the mayor to support safer, more accessible streets for all New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The E-BIKE Act, once part of the Build Back Better Act, proposed a federal tax credit for e-bike buyers. Congress reduced the credit from $1,500 to $900 and limited eligibility, stalling progress. The article states, 'By replacing car trips, e-bikes can simultaneously lower emissions, improve street safety, and boost riders' health.' John MacArthur, a transportation program manager, notes that local and state lawmakers now lead with rebates and incentives. Council members and legislators in Vermont, Colorado, California, Washington, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Oklahoma have introduced or supported bills for e-bike rebates. Despite the momentum, no current state proposal pairs incentives with new bike infrastructure. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians and cyclists—remain at risk as car dominance continues and federal action lags.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates, including Jaqi Cohen and Kevin Garcia, pressed the new office to prioritize transportation emissions, quoting, 'improving transit options and creating access for environmental justice communities, while also curbing harmful diesel emissions.' Aggarwala voiced support for congestion pricing, pedestrianization, and bus lanes, promising collaboration with the Department of Transportation. Transportation emissions have dropped only 5% since 2007, while car ownership rises.

The analysis credits UCLA Professor Donald Shoup’s influence. No council bill number or committee is cited, as this is a legislative trend, not a single bill.

The article states: 'A $13 or $15 congestion toll might be all the politicians think they can achieve, but such a low fee will fail to maximize the net societal benefit.' Komanoff’s analysis shows the current plan extracts only half the possible benefit while charging less than a fifth of the optimal toll. No council member is named; this is an expert’s call to action. The piece notes that higher tolls could fund subway safety upgrades and faster trains, but the city’s political will remains weak.
