Since 2022, five people are dead. Seventeen more are left with injuries so serious they may never walk right again. The numbers do not flinch: <strong>1,689 injured, 3,606 crashes</strong> in just over three years (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The dead are not just numbers. A 68-year-old man, crossing at Forest Avenue and Raymond Place, was struck and killed by an SUV making a left turn. He was in the crosswalk. The driver failed to yield. The man never made it home (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>A year earlier, a 60-year-old man was killed crossing with the signal at Post Avenue. The car turned left.

Trucks and buses added dozens more injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds, a handful. Bikes, a few scrapes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The danger is everywhere. On March 15, two police officers crashed their cruiser into a Staten Island building while swerving to avoid a U-turning car. Both were hospitalized. The street offered no forgiveness. &ldquo;Another vehicle attempted to make a U-turn, causing the police cruiser to swerve to avoid a collision,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/nypd-crash-2-officers-recovering-crashing-police-cruiser-staten-island/16028315/>reported ABC7</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-action>Leadership: Words and Action</h3><p>Assembly Member Charles Fall has spoken up for safer streets. He has <strong>criticized city delays</strong> and failures to redesign dangerous intersections, and has backed laws for daylighting and protected bike lanes. But the carnage continues. The policies move slow. The cars do not.</p><p>The call is clear. &ldquo;It was pretty, pretty fast and then he crashed into a sanitation car&mldr; then he&rsquo;s doing circles and then he crashed out with a police car,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/staten-island-cops-responding-to-gun-call-crash-into-store/>said a witness to a recent crash</a>.</p><h3 id=what-next>What Next?</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every delay means another family broken. Call Assembly Member Fall. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real street redesigns. <strong>Do not wait for another body in the road.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Justin Wood of New York Lawyers for the Public Interest warned, 'The system cannot achieve transformational change if it is treated as a limited pilot program.' The city’s goal to cut truck miles falls short of original promises. Action Carting, whose driver killed a cyclist in 2017, secured contracts for 14 zones.

Brooks-Powers stated, 'The Streets Plan is the law, and the Department of Transportation is still failing to fulfill its legal obligations.' She promised to hold DOT accountable at an upcoming budget hearing. The city also lagged on bus stop upgrades, completing just 54 out of 500 required. Cyclist fatalities soared to 30 in 2023, the highest this century.

The plan, discussed in workshops since spring 2023, would reduce the avenue from three to two moving lanes each way, add parking-protected bike lanes, and install painted pedestrian islands. Board members, including Katie Walsh and Gabino Morales, voiced strong support, with Morales stating, 'This is just a beginning of what we could do to fix our community.' Diana Gonzalez described the avenue as a place where 'they're gonna kill you.' The board will urge DOT to go beyond paint and install hard infrastructure.

The plan will close the current narrow walkway this fall and replace it with an eight-foot-wide path for cyclists and pedestrians by year’s end. The project is part of a broader push to make three MTA bridges accessible to non-drivers. MTA Construction and Development President Jamie Torres-Springer said, 'The MTA has made great progress in planned capital improvements to pedestrian and bike accessibility on bridges.' Local cyclist Allegra LeGrande called the move overdue, noting, 'If they build it they will come.' The project includes a cantilevered ramp for wheelchair access and improved exits. While the path is closed, a shuttle bus may run for six weeks.

The report states the pedestrian was at the intersection when the bus’s left front quarter panel hit his lower leg, causing severe lacerations. The narrative describes, 'Steel struck his leg. Flesh tore. Blood pooled by the curb. He stayed awake. The bus rolled on, unmarked.' The bus sustained no damage and continued on its route. Police list both driver and pedestrian contributing factors as 'Unspecified.' The report highlights the systemic danger of large vehicles turning through crosswalks, with no evidence of driver accountability or intervention at the scene. No contributing victim behavior is cited; the focus remains on the impact of the turning bus.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

He writes, 'The increasing size of passenger vehicles has been catastrophic for road safety, traffic congestion, climate viability, and household budgets.' Komanoff opposes SUV and pickup proliferation and supports downsizing, electrification, and policies like road pricing and better transit. He stresses that larger vehicles are far more likely to kill other road users. He argues that electrification and smaller cars alone cannot cut emissions or deaths enough. Only less driving, paired with systemic changes—congestion pricing, curb pricing, and livable streets—will protect the vulnerable and the climate. No council bill is attached, but the warning is clear: car bloat endangers everyone outside the vehicle.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Reynoso urged ongoing oversight, saying, 'It is important that DSNY continuously reassess implementation and course correct as needed.'

The bill responds to a new report showing Sunset Park and Red Hook face the city's highest truck volumes—over 9,000 daily trips—linked to sprawling Amazon, FedEx, and UPS facilities. The report states, 'a quarter of residents across the Empire State live within half a mile of a distribution center that’s at least 50,000 square feet, disproportionately harming Black and Latino communities.' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, representing the affected Brooklyn neighborhoods, calls for urgent action 'for the sake of our climate and the safety of our streets.' Assembly Member Marcela Mitaynes, whose district sees the most daily truck traffic, urges colleagues to pass the Act. Advocates like Kevin Garcia say the bill is 'key legislation to protect frontline communities from increased vehicular traffic and tailpipe emissions.' The Act would require emissions reviews, pollution minimization, and studies of low-emission zones in hotspots.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, installed these barriers in fall 2023, aiming to 'harden' bike lanes in a borough with few safe cycling routes. Cyclists like Joseph Rienti say the barriers are better than nothing, but drivers now park at both ends, forcing riders into car traffic. Rienti urges better design or enforcement, not removal. Police enforcement is almost nonexistent: less than 2 percent of 76,000 complaints led to tickets. City Council, including Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, has not advanced a bill allowing citizen reporting of blocked lanes, despite majority support. DOT spokeswoman Mona Bruno promises to work with police, but for now, the barriers fail to protect vulnerable cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brooks-Powers criticized the Adams administration and the Department of Transportation for failing to meet the Streets Plan's legal requirement of 50 miles of protected bike lanes, achieving only about 30 miles. She stated, 'Thirty-plus miles of completed new bike lane is of course better than none, but falls far short of Streets Plan requirements.' Brooks-Powers also condemned the missed bus lane targets and called out DOT's lack of transparency, pledging to hold the agency accountable and push for safer, more equitable streets.

Sanitation Commissioner Jessica Tisch declared, “For the first time the plan calls for doing both at the same time, rather than prioritizing one over the other or making trade-offs.” This policy change ends years of prioritizing car lanes over bike lanes for snow clearance. The agency updated its annual snow plan and hired 563 new workers, now able to dispatch plows for all routes simultaneously. The new approach means protected bike lanes—165 miles worth—will be cleared alongside roads, not after. Tisch emphasized, “Every street in the city is on a route and we are staffed to dispatch every route at the same time. Prioritization of certain streets is a thing of the past.” Advocates, including Jon Orcutt of Bike New York, praised the move as overdue and vital for cyclists’ safety.
