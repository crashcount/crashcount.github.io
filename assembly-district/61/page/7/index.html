Since 2022, five people are dead. Seventeen more are left with injuries so serious they may never walk right again. The numbers do not flinch: <strong>1,689 injured, 3,606 crashes</strong> in just over three years (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The dead are not just numbers. A 68-year-old man, crossing at Forest Avenue and Raymond Place, was struck and killed by an SUV making a left turn. He was in the crosswalk. The driver failed to yield. The man never made it home (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>A year earlier, a 60-year-old man was killed crossing with the signal at Post Avenue. The car turned left.

Trucks and buses added dozens more injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds, a handful. Bikes, a few scrapes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The danger is everywhere. On March 15, two police officers crashed their cruiser into a Staten Island building while swerving to avoid a U-turning car. Both were hospitalized. The street offered no forgiveness. &ldquo;Another vehicle attempted to make a U-turn, causing the police cruiser to swerve to avoid a collision,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/nypd-crash-2-officers-recovering-crashing-police-cruiser-staten-island/16028315/>reported ABC7</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-action>Leadership: Words and Action</h3><p>Assembly Member Charles Fall has spoken up for safer streets. He has <strong>criticized city delays</strong> and failures to redesign dangerous intersections, and has backed laws for daylighting and protected bike lanes. But the carnage continues. The policies move slow. The cars do not.</p><p>The call is clear. &ldquo;It was pretty, pretty fast and then he crashed into a sanitation car&mldr; then he&rsquo;s doing circles and then he crashed out with a police car,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/staten-island-cops-responding-to-gun-call-crash-into-store/>said a witness to a recent crash</a>.</p><h3 id=what-next>What Next?</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every delay means another family broken. Call Assembly Member Fall. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real street redesigns. <strong>Do not wait for another body in the road.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The policy, shaped by advocacy campaigns, was summarized as offering 'more flexibility to design roads safely,' but advocates say it is 'a transitional document; it’s not a transformational document.' FHWA Administrator Shailen Bhatt claimed the update empowers cities to prioritize active transportation, stating, 'The cities that are really thriving... are the ones who are really putting active transportation at the forefront.' However, advocates like Mike McGinn and Beth Osborne criticized the weak reforms to the 85th percentile speed rule and the lack of bold safety mandates. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law now requires updates every four years, giving hope for future, stronger reforms. For now, the MUTCD still leaves vulnerable road users at risk, with only incremental gains.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Ritchie Torres (D-Bronx). The bill, supported by the city and FDNY Commissioner Laura Kavanagh, requires the Consumer Product Safety Commission to create federal safety standards for micromobility batteries. The matter summary states the bill aims to 'protect against the risk of fires.' Torres and advocates like Ligia Guallpa of the Worker's Justice Project pushed for app-based companies to supply certified batteries, but tech giants oppose this. Kavanagh said, 'A strong federal standard for lithium-ion batteries is required to ensure public safety.' Despite new laws, the cost of safe batteries—up to $5,000—still falls on low-paid delivery workers. Sixteen people have died in 253 battery fires this year. The city passed a buyback program for faulty batteries, but it has not started.

Vulnerable riders pay the price in time and danger.</p><p class=mb3>This Streetsblog NYC analysis, published November 13, 2023, examines New York’s failure to deliver true Bus Rapid Transit (BRT). The article, titled 'Want More Rapid Bus Transit? Build Real Bus Rapid Transit,' criticizes Mayor Adams for not following through on campaign pledges to expand bus lanes and implement full BRT. Advocates like Annie Weinstock and JP Patafio argue that dedicated center-running lanes, off-board fare collection, and strict enforcement are needed to speed up buses and protect riders. The piece notes, 'Current bus lanes, like on Utica [Avenue], really it’s almost like a parking lot, because they cover the plates and there’s no enforcement.' The report highlights that without strong leadership and commitment, bus riders—often the city’s most vulnerable—remain exposed to slow service and street danger. No council bill number or committee is attached; this is a policy analysis and advocacy call to action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He stated, 'The Bedford Avenue bike lane has been unacceptably dangerous since it was first laid, and for years, the people of my district have been promised that it would be protected.' Advocacy groups, including Transportation Alternatives, echoed his frustration, citing record cyclist deaths and urgent need for safety. The DOT has not responded to requests for comment.

In a closed-door meeting with the Department of Transportation, Adams said, "My legacy is not how many bike miles I do. My legacy is not how many bus lanes I do." He signaled a shift from measurable safety benchmarks to a focus on community input, a move DOT staffers called "extremely micromanaged." Adams’s administration has failed to meet even the minimum legal standards for new lanes. A mayoral spokesman claimed the city still delivers "safe, efficient streets," but advocates say Adams’s approach relies on vague metrics and lacks accountability. No council members are directly involved; this is a mayoral policy stance. The result: fewer protected spaces for vulnerable road users, more risk on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates like Jon Orcutt (Bike New York) and Juan Restrepo (Transportation Alternatives) condemned the mayor’s approach, warning it gives veto power to small groups and leaves the city “rudderless” on street safety.

Resistance remains.</p><p class=mb3>On October 11, 2023, Mayor Eric Adams announced support for the Sanitation Department's plan to repurpose 150,000 parking spaces for containerized garbage collection. The policy, unveiled by DSNY, aims to move trash from sidewalks into closed bins, targeting cleaner streets and less sidewalk clutter. The mayor said, 'Everyday New Yorkers are tired of the rodents, they’re tired of the trash, and this is a small price to pay on ensuring that you can have cleaner streets.' Council member Shaun Abreu, representing West Harlem, voiced strong support, citing visible improvements from the local pilot. The plan requires smaller buildings to use wheeled bins on sidewalks, while larger buildings would get shared curbside containers. The city faces pushback from some residents, but Adams insists street cleanliness is a top concern. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the move could clear sidewalks for pedestrians and reduce hazards from trash piles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, discussed in October 2023, has not specified a streamlined process for licensing. The matter’s summary states: 'Holden's bill does nothing to rectify the fundamental issues of inadequate space and dangerous workplace practices.' Holden and his colleagues push regulation, but critics say the bill ignores the real threats: narrow sidewalks, blocked crosswalks, and unsafe delivery work. The proposal would burden riders and discourage micromobility, while failing to address illegal mopeds or car dominance. State Senator Brad Hoylman’s employer-provided ID plan is cited as a better alternative. The opinion calls for protected bike lanes, wider sidewalks, and fair enforcement, not more bureaucracy. Holden’s bill, critics argue, misses the mark for pedestrian safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The suit names Sholem Klein, head of the Rockaway Nassau Safety Patrol, as the complainant who called police. The Brooklyn DA later dropped charges against White.
