Twenty-two left with serious injuries.</strong> Nearly 2,000 hurt since 2022. The dead include a 16-year-old on a scooter, a 68-year-old man in a crosswalk, a 78-year-old woman behind the wheel, and a child. The list grows. The pain does not fade.</p><p>Just last month, a 13-year-old boy was thrown from his moped after colliding with an MTA bus on Castleton Avenue. He landed hard. His head struck the pavement. He was rushed to the hospital, fighting for his life. The bus driver and passengers walked away unscathed. Police said, &ldquo;the moped went through a stop sign without stopping and hit the bus&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/moped-bus-collision-staten-island/>amNY</a>).</p><p>On June 29, a 16-year-old riding an electric scooter crossed into the path of a Hyundai Tucson. He died from head trauma. The driver stayed. No charges. Another family shattered (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>The Brooklyn Paper</a>).</p><h2 id=patterns-of-harm-who-pays-the-price>Patterns of Harm: Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage.</strong> They killed two, seriously injured three, and left hundreds with broken bodies. Trucks and buses hurt dozens more. Motorcycles and mopeds, too, leave blood on the street. Even bikes are not blameless. But the deadliest force is always speed and steel.</p><p>The old, the young, the ones on foot or two wheels—they pay the highest price. A pedestrian struck at 30 mph is five times more likely to die than at 20 mph. The city knows this. Albany knows it. Still, the carnage continues.</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-silence-and-the-long-road-ahead>Leadership: Votes, Silence, and the Long Road Ahead</h2><p>Assembly Member Charles Fall has taken some steps. In June, he <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted yes to extend school speed zones</a>, a move meant to protect children near schools. But the streets outside those zones remain dangerous. The crisis is not contained by painted lines or school bells.</p><p>The city now has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so. Every day of delay is another day of risk. As one DOT spokesperson <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/dot-worker-slashed-by-e-biker-manhattan/>said after a worker was slashed on the job</a>, &ldquo;This was an abhorrent assault of a NYC DOT employee who performs critical work to keep our city moving.&rdquo; The violence is not just in the numbers. It is in the wounds, the fear, the empty chairs at dinner tables.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Assembly Member Fall. Call the Council. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for every street, not just the ones near schools. <strong>Do not wait for another child to die.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Warehouses choke streets. Black and Latino residents breathe the fumes and dodge danger. Lawmakers push the Clean Deliveries Act to curb the chaos. The burden falls hard. The fight is on.</p><p class=mb3>The Clean Deliveries Act, now under consideration in Albany, aims to regulate last-mile warehouse traffic and emissions across New York State. The bill responds to a new report showing Sunset Park and Red Hook face the city's highest truck volumes—over 9,000 daily trips—linked to sprawling Amazon, FedEx, and UPS facilities. The report states, 'a quarter of residents across the Empire State live within half a mile of a distribution center that’s at least 50,000 square feet, disproportionately harming Black and Latino communities.' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, representing the affected Brooklyn neighborhoods, calls for urgent action 'for the sake of our climate and the safety of our streets.' Assembly Member Marcela Mitaynes, whose district sees the most daily truck traffic, urges colleagues to pass the Act. Advocates like Kevin Garcia say the bill is 'key legislation to protect frontline communities from increased vehicular traffic and tailpipe emissions.' The Act would require emissions reviews, pollution minimization, and studies of low-emission zones in hotspots.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, installed these barriers in fall 2023, aiming to 'harden' bike lanes in a borough with few safe cycling routes. Cyclists like Joseph Rienti say the barriers are better than nothing, but drivers now park at both ends, forcing riders into car traffic. Rienti urges better design or enforcement, not removal. Police enforcement is almost nonexistent: less than 2 percent of 76,000 complaints led to tickets. City Council, including Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, has not advanced a bill allowing citizen reporting of blocked lanes, despite majority support. DOT spokeswoman Mona Bruno promises to work with police, but for now, the barriers fail to protect vulnerable cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation and NYPD cleared all souvenir stands and food sellers at midnight. A sign now reads, 'No vending allowed.' Councilmember Gale A.

Mayor Eric Adams said, 'Tourists and New Yorkers alike deserve to walk across it and enjoy its beauty without being packed together like sardines or risking their safety.' The ban aims to improve pedestrian flow on the crowded bridge, which sees over 34,000 walkers on a fall weekend. Supporters of vendors mourned the loss of affordable food and art.

This incident marked the 29th cyclist fatality in 2023, a grim milestone in a year of rising traffic violence. Brooks-Powers criticized the Adams administration and the Department of Transportation for failing to meet the Streets Plan's legal requirement of 50 miles of protected bike lanes, achieving only about 30 miles. She stated, 'Thirty-plus miles of completed new bike lane is of course better than none, but falls far short of Streets Plan requirements.' Brooks-Powers also condemned the missed bus lane targets and called out DOT's lack of transparency, pledging to hold the agency accountable and push for safer, more equitable streets.

Sanitation Commissioner Jessica Tisch declared, “For the first time the plan calls for doing both at the same time, rather than prioritizing one over the other or making trade-offs.” This policy change ends years of prioritizing car lanes over bike lanes for snow clearance. The agency updated its annual snow plan and hired 563 new workers, now able to dispatch plows for all routes simultaneously. The new approach means protected bike lanes—165 miles worth—will be cleared alongside roads, not after. Tisch emphasized, “Every street in the city is on a route and we are staffed to dispatch every route at the same time. Prioritization of certain streets is a thing of the past.” Advocates, including Jon Orcutt of Bike New York, praised the move as overdue and vital for cyclists’ safety. The city’s snow fleet now includes smaller plows fit for bike lanes, ending the era of neglect.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The policy, shaped by advocacy campaigns, was summarized as offering 'more flexibility to design roads safely,' but advocates say it is 'a transitional document; it’s not a transformational document.' FHWA Administrator Shailen Bhatt claimed the update empowers cities to prioritize active transportation, stating, 'The cities that are really thriving... are the ones who are really putting active transportation at the forefront.' However, advocates like Mike McGinn and Beth Osborne criticized the weak reforms to the 85th percentile speed rule and the lack of bold safety mandates. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law now requires updates every four years, giving hope for future, stronger reforms. For now, the MUTCD still leaves vulnerable road users at risk, with only incremental gains.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danger persists on city streets.</p><p class=mb3>On December 11, 2023, a congressional panel advanced the Setting Consumer Standards for Lithium-Ion Batteries Act, introduced by Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-Bronx). The bill, supported by the city and FDNY Commissioner Laura Kavanagh, requires the Consumer Product Safety Commission to create federal safety standards for micromobility batteries. The matter summary states the bill aims to 'protect against the risk of fires.' Torres and advocates like Ligia Guallpa of the Worker's Justice Project pushed for app-based companies to supply certified batteries, but tech giants oppose this. Kavanagh said, 'A strong federal standard for lithium-ion batteries is required to ensure public safety.' Despite new laws, the cost of safe batteries—up to $5,000—still falls on low-paid delivery workers. Sixteen people have died in 253 battery fires this year. The city passed a buyback program for faulty batteries, but it has not started. The burden remains on the most vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable riders pay the price in time and danger.</p><p class=mb3>This Streetsblog NYC analysis, published November 13, 2023, examines New York’s failure to deliver true Bus Rapid Transit (BRT). The article, titled 'Want More Rapid Bus Transit? Build Real Bus Rapid Transit,' criticizes Mayor Adams for not following through on campaign pledges to expand bus lanes and implement full BRT. Advocates like Annie Weinstock and JP Patafio argue that dedicated center-running lanes, off-board fare collection, and strict enforcement are needed to speed up buses and protect riders. The piece notes, 'Current bus lanes, like on Utica [Avenue], really it’s almost like a parking lot, because they cover the plates and there’s no enforcement.' The report highlights that without strong leadership and commitment, bus riders—often the city’s most vulnerable—remain exposed to slow service and street danger.

Adams’s administration has failed to meet even the minimum legal standards for new lanes. A mayoral spokesman claimed the city still delivers "safe, efficient streets," but advocates say Adams’s approach relies on vague metrics and lacks accountability.

The lawsuit seeks damages and policy reforms to protect civilians who report illegal traffic activity.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
