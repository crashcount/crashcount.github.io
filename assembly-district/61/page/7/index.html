Six hundred thirty-nine injured. Eight seriously hurt.</strong> That’s just the last twelve months in Assembly District 61. The numbers don’t blink. They don’t care if you’re young or old. One child dead. One senior dead. One more gone in the prime of life. The street does not forgive.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>16-year-old on an e-scooter was killed</a> on College Avenue. Head trauma. The driver stayed. The boy did not. The NYPD is still investigating. No charges. No comfort. The city moves on.</p><p>In January, a <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>68-year-old man was struck and killed</a> in a crosswalk at Forest Avenue and Raymond Place. The driver failed to yield. The man never made it home.</p><h2 id=the-system-fails-the-vulnerable>The System Fails the Vulnerable</h2><p><strong>Most victims are not in cars.</strong> They are walking, riding, or crossing. The city’s own data shows cars and SUVs did the most harm—<strong>361 pedestrian injuries and 2 deaths</strong> in this district alone. Trucks and buses followed. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left their own scars.</p><p>The city blames the dead for crossing wrong. The law blames the cyclist for a missing light. But the street stays the same. As one advocate <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/cyclists-frustrated-nypd-crackdown-bike-traffic-laws-nyc/17260980/>put it</a>, &ldquo;This is a war on people just for riding a bike.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=what-has-charles-fall-done>What Has Charles Fall Done?</h2><p>Assembly Member Charles Fall voted yes to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>extend school speed zones</a>, keeping cameras rolling near schools. That helps. But the carnage continues outside those zones. Fall has spoken up for protected bike lanes, slow zones, and safer street designs, but the pace is slow. Projects stall. Promises fade. The dead do not come back.</p><h2 id=the-call-demand-action-now>The Call: Demand Action Now</h2><p><strong>Every day without change is another day someone dies.</strong> Call Charles Fall. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph citywide speed limit. Demand real street redesigns, not just more tickets for the vulnerable.

The plan will close the current narrow walkway this fall and replace it with an eight-foot-wide path for cyclists and pedestrians by year’s end. The project is part of a broader push to make three MTA bridges accessible to non-drivers. MTA Construction and Development President Jamie Torres-Springer said, 'The MTA has made great progress in planned capital improvements to pedestrian and bike accessibility on bridges.' Local cyclist Allegra LeGrande called the move overdue, noting, 'If they build it they will come.' The project includes a cantilevered ramp for wheelchair access and improved exits. While the path is closed, a shuttle bus may run for six weeks. The overhaul answers years of calls for safe, direct bike connections between the Bronx and Manhattan, and throws down a challenge to city agencies to fix the patchwork of local bike paths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Departments of Sanitation and Transportation used narrow plows to clear bike lanes, including the East River bridges and key protected paths. Commissioner Jessica Tisch said, "We put salt on every street, every highway, every bike lane in the city, we've done multiple passes at it." The DOT boasted about clearing the Brooklyn Bridge bike path before sunrise. Citi Bike stayed open. But sidewalks, left to property owners, remained treacherous. Mayor Adams praised road crews while standing by snow-covered pedestrian space. Commissioner Tisch warned, "We want those sidewalks safe tomorrow." The city’s effort favored cyclists and drivers. Pedestrians were left behind, forced to wait for landlords to shovel.

He writes, 'The increasing size of passenger vehicles has been catastrophic for road safety, traffic congestion, climate viability, and household budgets.' Komanoff opposes SUV and pickup proliferation and supports downsizing, electrification, and policies like road pricing and better transit. He stresses that larger vehicles are far more likely to kill other road users. He argues that electrification and smaller cars alone cannot cut emissions or deaths enough. Only less driving, paired with systemic changes—congestion pricing, curb pricing, and livable streets—will protect the vulnerable and the climate. No council bill is attached, but the warning is clear: car bloat endangers everyone outside the vehicle.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law aims to cut truck miles in half, add backup cameras, GPS, and safety training. DSNY spokesperson Joshua Goodman said contracts target safety and worker protections. Reynoso urged ongoing oversight, saying, 'It is important that DSNY continuously reassess implementation and course correct as needed.' Yet, delays persist, especially on installing guard rails to prevent pedestrians and cyclists from being swept under trucks. Justin Wood of NYLPI voiced concern over the slow rollout.

The bill responds to a new report showing Sunset Park and Red Hook face the city's highest truck volumes—over 9,000 daily trips—linked to sprawling Amazon, FedEx, and UPS facilities. The report states, 'a quarter of residents across the Empire State live within half a mile of a distribution center that’s at least 50,000 square feet, disproportionately harming Black and Latino communities.' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, representing the affected Brooklyn neighborhoods, calls for urgent action 'for the sake of our climate and the safety of our streets.' Assembly Member Marcela Mitaynes, whose district sees the most daily truck traffic, urges colleagues to pass the Act. Advocates like Kevin Garcia say the bill is 'key legislation to protect frontline communities from increased vehicular traffic and tailpipe emissions.' The Act would require emissions reviews, pollution minimization, and studies of low-emission zones in hotspots.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill remains stalled after DSNY Commissioner Jessica Tisch testified against it, citing operational and legal hurdles. The matter, discussed in the Sanitation Committee led by Council Member Sandy Nurse, highlights a citywide crisis: over 51,000 complaints about plateless cars in 2023, but only 1,821 removals. The article quotes Nurse—'Cars with ghost plates are a risk to public safety'—and Abreu, who calls the city’s inaction a repurposing of public space for dumping. Despite a DSNY/NYPD task force, enforcement remains weak.

The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, installed these barriers in fall 2023, aiming to 'harden' bike lanes in a borough with few safe cycling routes. Cyclists like Joseph Rienti say the barriers are better than nothing, but drivers now park at both ends, forcing riders into car traffic. Rienti urges better design or enforcement, not removal. Police enforcement is almost nonexistent: less than 2 percent of 76,000 complaints led to tickets. City Council, including Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, has not advanced a bill allowing citizen reporting of blocked lanes, despite majority support. DOT spokeswoman Mona Bruno promises to work with police, but for now, the barriers fail to protect vulnerable cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brooks-Powers criticized the Adams administration and the Department of Transportation for failing to meet the Streets Plan's legal requirement of 50 miles of protected bike lanes, achieving only about 30 miles. She stated, 'Thirty-plus miles of completed new bike lane is of course better than none, but falls far short of Streets Plan requirements.' Brooks-Powers also condemned the missed bus lane targets and called out DOT's lack of transparency, pledging to hold the agency accountable and push for safer, more equitable streets.

Sanitation Commissioner Jessica Tisch declared, “For the first time the plan calls for doing both at the same time, rather than prioritizing one over the other or making trade-offs.” This policy change ends years of prioritizing car lanes over bike lanes for snow clearance. The agency updated its annual snow plan and hired 563 new workers, now able to dispatch plows for all routes simultaneously. The new approach means protected bike lanes—165 miles worth—will be cleared alongside roads, not after. Tisch emphasized, “Every street in the city is on a route and we are staffed to dispatch every route at the same time. Prioritization of certain streets is a thing of the past.” Advocates, including Jon Orcutt of Bike New York, praised the move as overdue and vital for cyclists’ safety.

However, advocates like Mike McGinn and Beth Osborne criticized the weak reforms to the 85th percentile speed rule and the lack of bold safety mandates. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law now requires updates every four years, giving hope for future, stronger reforms.

Torres and advocates like Ligia Guallpa of the Worker's Justice Project pushed for app-based companies to supply certified batteries, but tech giants oppose this. Kavanagh said, 'A strong federal standard for lithium-ion batteries is required to ensure public safety.' Despite new laws, the cost of safe batteries—up to $5,000—still falls on low-paid delivery workers. Sixteen people have died in 253 battery fires this year.

The article, titled 'Want More Rapid Bus Transit? Build Real Bus Rapid Transit,' criticizes Mayor Adams for not following through on campaign pledges to expand bus lanes and implement full BRT. Advocates like Annie Weinstock and JP Patafio argue that dedicated center-running lanes, off-board fare collection, and strict enforcement are needed to speed up buses and protect riders. The piece notes, 'Current bus lanes, like on Utica [Avenue], really it’s almost like a parking lot, because they cover the plates and there’s no enforcement.' The report highlights that without strong leadership and commitment, bus riders—often the city’s most vulnerable—remain exposed to slow service and street danger.
