In the last twelve months, two people have died and 569 have been injured in crashes across Assembly District 36 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). These are not just numbers. They are children with broken bones, cyclists thrown from bikes, and families left waiting at hospital doors.</p><p>On October 22, 2024, a pickup truck fleeing police struck and killed Amanda Servedio, a cyclist returning from a ride. She &ldquo;went airborne. She flew like 30 feet. It was a lot of force,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>said witness Jake Kwok</a>. The chase ended, but the damage did not. Her father said, &ldquo;We were certainly upset that they didn&rsquo;t stop the chase&mldr; It was probably not the place to be doing a high-speed chase, in the residential neighborhood&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>Just months later, an unlicensed driver reversed onto the sidewalk outside a local school, hitting two girls and a man. A seven-year-old was left with a broken femur and a head injury. The driver was charged with reckless endangerment and driving without a license (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/04/us-news/out-of-control-nyc-driver-hits-two-kids-1-adult-during-evening-rush-leaving-girl-7-with-broken-femur-cops/>New York Post</a>).</p><p>No one is safe. Not on the sidewalk. Not on a bike. Not even at the school gate.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-silence>Leadership: Action and Silence</h3><p>Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani has spoken for safer streets. He has backed bills for protected bike lanes, faster and fare-free buses, and higher fees for heavy vehicles (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/26/heres-what-mamdani-can-steal-from-other-candidates-to-strengthen-his-livable-streets-platform>Streetsblog NYC</a>). He has supported the &ldquo;Stop Super Speeders Act&rdquo; to rein in the worst repeat offenders. He called for street redesigns and bus lane expansion (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/25/down-ballot-recap-a-great-night-for-the-livable-streets-movement>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>But the carnage continues. Policies move slow. Asphalt does not wait. Every delay is another family broken.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p>The crisis is not fate. It is policy. The city can lower speed limits. It can redesign streets. It can end police chases through crowded neighborhoods. It can build real protection for people outside cars.</p><p>Call Assembly Member Mamdani. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes and sidewalks that do not end in blood.</p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list.

Sara Lind, speaking for her organization, urges city and state leaders to seize the moment. She calls for free bus and ferry rides during the first week, dedicated bus lanes, double-wide bike lanes on major avenues, and car-free streets near schools. The statement reads: 'Congestion pricing isn't important only because it will reduce the number of cars below 60th Street in Manhattan; its true value lies in what else we can get when that happens.' No council bill number or committee is attached, as this is an advocacy statement. The proposals center vulnerable road users—children, cyclists, bus riders—by demanding space and safety where cars once ruled.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

These measures, part of the 'Get Congestion Pricing Right' package, appear in both houses’ 'one-house' budgets as of March 12, 2024. The matter summary states: 'City buses would run more frequently under new proposals from state legislators in Albany, who included increased bus services and new fare discounts in budget proposals.' Mamdani and Gianaris led the push, citing the need for better transit before congestion pricing launches this summer. Their plan includes expanded Fair Fares, new discounts for seniors and disabled riders, and a weekly CityTicket for unlimited intracity rail travel. Advocates and lawmakers argue these steps are critical for equity and access, especially as the city prepares to charge drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street.

The proposal responds to a Transportation Alternatives report showing a 91% jump in injuries and a 75% rise in fatalities from large vehicle crashes between 2016 and 2019.

Lawmakers and advocates say this will speed up buses and protect the vulnerable.</p><p class=mb3>The 2023 state budget, agreed on May 1, expands the MTA's automated bus lane enforcement camera system. The bill, backed by Governor Hochul and legislative leaders, broadens enforcement to drivers blocking bus stops, truck loading zones, bike lanes, intersections, and crosswalks. Fines start at $50, escalating for repeat offenses. The MTA will increase buses with cameras from 450 to 1,000 by year's end. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and advocate Sara Lind support the move, calling it vital for bus reliability and street safety. Lind says, 'Camera-based enforcement is such a powerful tool for making our streets safer.' The budget also addresses MTA funding, but some, like Mamdani, criticize the city's increased financial burden. The bill aims to clear the way for buses and vulnerable road users, reducing dangerous blockages.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
