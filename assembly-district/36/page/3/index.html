Hundreds Broken. Streets Bleed While Albany Stalls.</h1><p class="byline f6 silver">Written July 6, 2025 <em>(Revised July 18, 2025 – Minor stats refresh)</em></p></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>AD 36: Jan 1, 2022 - Jul 6, 2025</h2><h3 id=the-death-count-grows>The Death Count Grows</h3><p>In Assembly District 36, the numbers do not lie. <strong>Nine people killed. Eleven left with serious injuries.</strong> Nearly two thousand hurt since 2022. Each number is a name, a family, a life cut or changed. In the last twelve months alone, two people died and 560 were injured in 979 crashes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a>).</p><p>The wounds are not spread evenly. <strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> Cars and SUVs caused over 300 injuries. Trucks and buses, 27. Motorcycles and mopeds, 23. Bikes, 8. The street is a gauntlet. The sidewalk is no refuge.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-fresh-grief>Recent Crashes, Fresh Grief</h3><p>The carnage does not pause. On June 8, an SUV struck an elderly pedestrian on 33rd Street. On June 19, a cyclist was injured by a car door on 36th Avenue. On June 27, a police pursuit ended with a sedan hitting a pedestrian on 40th Avenue (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a>).</p><p>The city calls these crashes. But the pain is not accidental. It is built into the street. It is written in the speed, the steel, the silence after sirens fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani has not stood still. He has called for <strong>more protected bike lanes, faster and free buses, and car-free public space</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/04/beach-reading-zohran-mamdanis-answers-to-streetsblogs-mayoral-candidate-survey>Streetsblog survey answers</a>). He has backed the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force the worst repeat offenders to slow down. He has demanded street redesigns and better enforcement. He has said, &ldquo;make buses fast and free, add more protected bike lanes, and increase car-free public space&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/26/heres-what-mamdani-can-steal-from-other-candidates-to-strengthen-his-livable-streets-platform>livable streets platform</a>).</p><p>But the work is not done. <strong>A handful of drivers cause outsized harm.</strong> One bill would require speeders with 16 camera tickets in a year to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. It has not passed. The dead keep coming.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h3><p>A business owner in Astoria, facing a new bike lane plan, said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be forced to shut down because we will not be able to load and unload the materials and products&rdquo; (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/05/us-news/astoria-businesses-residents-fighting-nyc-dots-bike-lane-plan/>Queens clash</a>). But the DOT calls 31st Street &ldquo;one of the most dangerous streets in Queens.&rdquo; <strong>126 injured drivers, 33 injured walkers, 24 injured cyclists, two dead in four years</strong> (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/05/us-news/astoria-businesses-residents-fighting-nyc-dots-bike-lane-plan/>Queens clash</a>).</p><h3 id=act-now-demand-action>Act Now: Demand Action</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Assembly Member Mamdani. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand the Stop Super Speeders Act. Demand streets where a child can cross without fear. <strong>Every day of delay is another name on the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The decision ended funding for the MTA's pilot program that made one bus route in each borough free. The matter, titled 'NYC to get a boost in bus service, but pilot program for free routes ends,' highlights the trade-off: more buses, but no more free rides. Councilmember Kamillah Hanks of District 49 introduced a resolution urging the MTA to install at least 30 OMNY card vending machines in every borough, noting not all riders can pay by smartphone. The bill is not tied to a specific council committee or number. Hanks is mentioned for her advocacy on OMNY access. The move increases bus frequency but leaves low-income and cash riders behind.

Sara Lind, speaking for her organization, urges city and state leaders to seize the moment. She calls for free bus and ferry rides during the first week, dedicated bus lanes, double-wide bike lanes on major avenues, and car-free streets near schools. The statement reads: 'Congestion pricing isn't important only because it will reduce the number of cars below 60th Street in Manhattan; its true value lies in what else we can get when that happens.' No council bill number or committee is attached, as this is an advocacy statement. The proposals center vulnerable road users—children, cyclists, bus riders—by demanding space and safety where cars once ruled.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Mamdani and Gianaris led the push, citing the need for better transit before congestion pricing launches this summer. Their plan includes expanded Fair Fares, new discounts for seniors and disabled riders, and a weekly CityTicket for unlimited intracity rail travel. Advocates and lawmakers argue these steps are critical for equity and access, especially as the city prepares to charge drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street. The proposals now enter negotiations with Governor Hochul.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, now before the legislature, seeks to expand New York City's fare-free bus pilot from five to fifteen lines, with three in each borough. The measure promises $45 million for better bus reliability and frequency, targeting low-income and disadvantaged communities. The bill summary states: 'expand and extend New York City's fare-free bus pilot program.' Gianaris, as sponsor, aims to boost mass transit before congestion pricing takes effect. Supporters, including Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, Riders Alliance, and the Transport Workers Union, stress that affordable, frequent buses are vital for safety and equity. MTA Chair Janno Lieber backs more service but warns that bus lanes lag behind. The bill focuses on routes that can handle more buses without new infrastructure, aiming to make public transit a real alternative to cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Mike Gianaris and Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani announced a $90-million proposal to expand bus service and the MTA's free bus pilot. The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, became a public reckoning for Mayor Adams's transportation record. The matter: 'a proposal in Albany to increase bus service before congestion pricing begins.' Mamdani accused Adams of 'incompetence' and violating the Streets Master Plan law, which requires 30 miles of new bus lanes each year. Reporters pressed for answers on mayoral compliance. MTA CEO Janno Lieber praised Adams's past promises but noted the lack of progress. The mayor's spokesperson defended the administration, but data shows bus speeds have dropped since Adams took office. No safety analyst has formally assessed the impact, but the lack of bus lanes leaves vulnerable road users exposed to traffic danger and slow, unreliable transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Mamdani said, 'he's made 1.4 million daily bus riders take the slowest buses in the country.' The mayor’s promises remain unmet.

The MTA claims fare compliance is vital, but Mamdani and union voices like JP Patafio of TWU Local 100 urge investment in service and affordability. The matter underscores the working-class reliance on buses and the stalled rollout of OMNY, which limits all-door boarding. The debate pits fare enforcement against calls for free or reduced fares, with advocates demanding progressive taxation to fund transit. No formal council bill or vote is attached, but the stakes for vulnerable riders are clear: service, not policing, keeps them moving.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
