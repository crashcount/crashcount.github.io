Her femur snapped. Blood on the curb. A 14-year-old limped, her leg torn. A 58-year-old man, bruised and stunned, stared at the car that had just jumped the sidewalk. The driver did not have a license. She was charged with reckless endangerment and reckless driving. The street was not safe for children. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/04/us-news/out-of-control-nyc-driver-hits-two-kids-1-adult-during-evening-rush-leaving-girl-7-with-broken-femur-cops/>&ldquo;An out-of-control unlicensed driver rammed into two kids and one adult,&rdquo; police said.</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>581 people were injured</strong> and <strong>2 killed</strong> in Assembly District 36. Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers all bled. The numbers do not flinch. <strong>SUVs, trucks, sedans, and mopeds</strong> struck down dozens.

He wants traffic enforcement moved from NYPD to DOT, to end bias and focus on safety. He has not been silent. But the streets are still red.</p><p>The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has not used it. Cameras that catch speeders are at risk of going dark. The law is there. The action is not. Residents call for speed bumps. They get promises.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-no-more-waiting>The Next Step: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of blood.</strong> The disaster is not fate. It is policy. It is choice. Call your Assembly Member. Call your Council Member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never sleep. Demand streets where children can walk home. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/queens-crash-children-run-over-driver-charges/>Do not wait for another child’s bones to break.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The MTA pushes fare enforcement. Lawmakers and labor say focus on service, not punishment. Riders, mostly working class, depend on these buses to survive.</p><p class=mb3>This policy debate, highlighted on November 16, 2023, centers on bus fare evasion, free bus pilot expansion, and transit funding. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani (D-Astoria) leads the charge, arguing, "We are hitting numbers that we are not recognizing, because our focus has been on fares." The MTA claims fare compliance is vital, but Mamdani and union voices like JP Patafio of TWU Local 100 urge investment in service and affordability. The matter underscores the working-class reliance on buses and the stalled rollout of OMNY, which limits all-door boarding. The debate pits fare enforcement against calls for free or reduced fares, with advocates demanding progressive taxation to fund transit. No formal council bill or vote is attached, but the stakes for vulnerable riders are clear: service, not policing, keeps them moving.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The fight is on.</p><p class=mb3>On February 22, 2023, Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani (District 36) joined advocates and labor at a rally urging Governor Hochul and state legislators to increase MTA funding and expand service in the state budget. The event, covered by amny.com, called for a $300 million boost to the governor's plan, aiming to cut subway headways to six minutes, make buses free, and avoid fare hikes. The coalition, including the Riders Alliance and TWU Local 100, argued that current service leaves riders waiting over ten minutes and crawling on slow buses. Mamdani, prime sponsor of the Fix the MTA package, said, 'They are at risk of being priced out of one of their most basic human rights, the right to go around their city.' He pushed for higher corporate taxes to fund these improvements. TWU Local 100 president Richard Davis and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams also spoke out against service cuts. The governor's office did not endorse Mamdani's tax proposal. No formal safety analyst assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On February 5, 2023, legislators and advocates rallied for increased MTA funding and more frequent subway service. The event, led by Assembly Members Zohran Mamdani and Robert Carroll, State Senator Andrew Gounardes, and Riders Alliance’s Betsy Plum, responded to Governor Hochul’s budget proposal. The matter: 'Advocates and legislators raced up the stairs...to press their case for Gov. Hochul to do more to fill the MTA's fiscal gap.' Hochul’s plan stabilizes finances but does not boost service or halt fare hikes. Mamdani and Gounardes called for six-minute off-peak trains and new taxes on the wealthy. Gounardes said, 'We all know that we need better service and we need more service.' The proposal remains under negotiation. No safety analyst has assessed the direct impact on vulnerable road users, but frequent, reliable transit is vital for their safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Riders wait.</p><p class=mb3>On January 27, 2023, nineteen New York City Council members, led by Tiffany Cabán, sent a letter urging Mayor Adams to support the Fix the MTA package in Albany. The package, introduced by Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and Senator Mike Gianaris, includes eight bills: funding for six-minute off-peak subway and bus service, four years of free bus rides, and closing the MTA's fiscal gap. Council Member Amanda Farías introduced a resolution backing six-minute service. The letter states, 'Just as fund libraries and schools, we must fund transit—a public good that creates access to opportunities in life.' Cabán called the push a 'critical public safety initiative,' linking frequent, reliable transit to safer streets. The council's action signals a unified demand for robust, equitable transit funding.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The centerpiece: advancing the Brooklyn-to-Queens Interborough Express light rail, described as 'better access to jobs, education and economic opportunities for some 900,000 New Yorkers.' Hochul also backed city control of speed limits, expanded CityTicket, and transit-oriented development. Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, representing District 36, criticized Hochul for omitting a concrete plan to address the MTA’s financial crisis, warning 'fare hikes and service cuts remain possible.' The speech left the MTA’s future in limbo. No safety analyst assessment was provided for vulnerable road users.
