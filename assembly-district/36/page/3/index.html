Since 2022, nine people have died in traffic crashes across Assembly District 36. Over 2,000 have been injured. In the last twelve months alone, 609 people were hurt, three were seriously injured, and two did not make it home. The youngest lost was just 36, a cyclist killed at 34th Avenue and 37th Street. The oldest, 59, died riding a moped on Northern Boulevard. The numbers do not tell you about the silence that follows, or the families left behind.</p><p>Just last month, a cyclist was killed in a police chase. Weeks before, a pick-up truck struck an infant on Steinway Street. The pattern repeats: cars, trucks, and SUVs do the most harm. The city counts the bodies. The crisis crawls on.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-absence>Leadership: Action and Absence</h3><p>Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani has backed bills to curb repeat speeders, co-sponsoring legislation to force speed-limiting tech into the cars of the worst offenders (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">A2299</a>). He has called for more protected bike lanes and for moving traffic enforcement out of NYPD hands (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/04/beach-reading-zohran-mamdanis-answers-to-streetsblogs-mayoral-candidate-survey>called for more protected bike lanes</a>). He stood with advocates against the removal of proven safety measures, like the Bedford Avenue bike lane (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/13/breaking-mayor-adams-to-remove-bedford-avenue-protected-bike-lane-citing-bizarrely-safety>stood with advocates</a>).</p><p>But when it mattered, Mamdani missed a key vote to extend school speed zone protections (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>missed a key vote</a>). The bill passed, but absence leaves a mark. The work is not done.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>A mother’s words after her son died subway surfing cut through the noise: “We were blindsided. We never planned for a funeral for a child. They’re kids. They think they are having fun, they think it doesn’t affect other people but then it does.” (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/07/family-of-boy-15-who-died-in-queens-subway-surfing-incident-says-he-started-hanging-out-with-the-wrong-crowd/>her son died subway surfing</a>)</p><p>The city’s transit chief put it plain: “This was as avoidable as it is tragic.” (<a href=https://licpost.com/bronx-boy-killed-subway-surfing-queensboro-plaza-long-island-city>transit chief put it plain</a>)</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>Every crash is preventable. Lower the speed limit. Build the lanes. Enforce the law against the reckless, not the vulnerable. Call Assembly Member Mamdani. Call your council member.

Metal twisted, blood spilled. Alcohol lingered in the night air. The Honda’s driver, 56, suffered a neck wound but stayed conscious. Parked vehicles absorbed the force. Systemic danger left its mark.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a Jeep collided with a Honda near 28-10 Astoria Boulevard in Queens at 9:00 p.m. The impact crushed metal and sent both vehicles into a parked Dodge pickup. The Honda’s 56-year-old driver suffered severe neck bleeding but remained conscious. The report states, 'Alcohol Involvement' as a contributing factor. The narrative describes the Jeep 'tore into a Honda, metal folding like paper,' and notes, 'Alcohol hung in the air.' No seatbelt was used by the injured driver, but this is mentioned only after the primary driver error. The crash underscores the lethal mix of alcohol and speed on city streets, with parked vehicles and bystanders left vulnerable to the violence of impact.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The Adams administration, through spokesperson Liz Garcia, claimed progress: 'We continue to work with our partners in the MTA and with communities across the city to build on this record of success.' But the numbers tell a harsher story. Bus speeds have dropped since Adams took office. Riders, many with no other option, face longer waits and slower trips. The city’s failure to build bus lanes leaves streets more dangerous for those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Sara Lind, speaking for her organization, urges city and state leaders to seize the moment. She calls for free bus and ferry rides during the first week, dedicated bus lanes, double-wide bike lanes on major avenues, and car-free streets near schools. The statement reads: 'Congestion pricing isn't important only because it will reduce the number of cars below 60th Street in Manhattan; its true value lies in what else we can get when that happens.' No council bill number or committee is attached, as this is an advocacy statement. The proposals center vulnerable road users—children, cyclists, bus riders—by demanding space and safety where cars once ruled.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

These measures, part of the 'Get Congestion Pricing Right' package, appear in both houses’ 'one-house' budgets as of March 12, 2024. The matter summary states: 'City buses would run more frequently under new proposals from state legislators in Albany, who included increased bus services and new fare discounts in budget proposals.' Mamdani and Gianaris led the push, citing the need for better transit before congestion pricing launches this summer. Their plan includes expanded Fair Fares, new discounts for seniors and disabled riders, and a weekly CityTicket for unlimited intracity rail travel. Advocates and lawmakers argue these steps are critical for equity and access, especially as the city prepares to charge drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street. The proposals now enter negotiations with Governor Hochul.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Mamdani accused Adams of 'incompetence' and violating the Streets Master Plan law, which requires 30 miles of new bus lanes each year. Reporters pressed for answers on mayoral compliance. MTA CEO Janno Lieber praised Adams's past promises but noted the lack of progress. The mayor's spokesperson defended the administration, but data shows bus speeds have dropped since Adams took office. No safety analyst has formally assessed the impact, but the lack of bus lanes leaves vulnerable road users exposed to traffic danger and slow, unreliable transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
