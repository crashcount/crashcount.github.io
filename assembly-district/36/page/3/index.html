The Adams administration, through spokesperson Liz Garcia, claimed progress: 'We continue to work with our partners in the MTA and with communities across the city to build on this record of success.' But the numbers tell a harsher story. Bus speeds have dropped since Adams took office. Riders, many with no other option, face longer waits and slower trips.

She calls for free bus and ferry rides during the first week, dedicated bus lanes, double-wide bike lanes on major avenues, and car-free streets near schools. The statement reads: 'Congestion pricing isn't important only because it will reduce the number of cars below 60th Street in Manhattan; its true value lies in what else we can get when that happens.' No council bill number or committee is attached, as this is an advocacy statement.

Riders in every borough stand to gain.</p><p class=mb3>Bill proposals in the New York State Assembly and Senate, introduced in February 2024 by State Sen. Michael Gianaris and Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani, seek $90 million for increased bus service and 15 more free bus routes. These measures, part of the 'Get Congestion Pricing Right' package, appear in both houses’ 'one-house' budgets as of March 12, 2024. The matter summary states: 'City buses would run more frequently under new proposals from state legislators in Albany, who included increased bus services and new fare discounts in budget proposals.' Mamdani and Gianaris led the push, citing the need for better transit before congestion pricing launches this summer. Their plan includes expanded Fair Fares, new discounts for seniors and disabled riders, and a weekly CityTicket for unlimited intracity rail travel. Advocates and lawmakers argue these steps are critical for equity and access, especially as the city prepares to charge drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street. The proposals now enter negotiations with Governor Hochul.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, now before the legislature, seeks to expand New York City's fare-free bus pilot from five to fifteen lines, with three in each borough. The measure promises $45 million for better bus reliability and frequency, targeting low-income and disadvantaged communities. The bill summary states: 'expand and extend New York City's fare-free bus pilot program.' Gianaris, as sponsor, aims to boost mass transit before congestion pricing takes effect. Supporters, including Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, Riders Alliance, and the Transport Workers Union, stress that affordable, frequent buses are vital for safety and equity. MTA Chair Janno Lieber backs more service but warns that bus lanes lag behind.

Mike Gianaris and Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani announced a $90-million proposal to expand bus service and the MTA's free bus pilot. The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, became a public reckoning for Mayor Adams's transportation record. The matter: 'a proposal in Albany to increase bus service before congestion pricing begins.' Mamdani accused Adams of 'incompetence' and violating the Streets Master Plan law, which requires 30 miles of new bus lanes each year. Reporters pressed for answers on mayoral compliance. MTA CEO Janno Lieber praised Adams's past promises but noted the lack of progress. The mayor's spokesperson defended the administration, but data shows bus speeds have dropped since Adams took office. No safety analyst has formally assessed the impact, but the lack of bus lanes leaves vulnerable road users exposed to traffic danger and slow, unreliable transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The MTA pushes fare enforcement. Lawmakers and labor say focus on service, not punishment. Riders, mostly working class, depend on these buses to survive.</p><p class=mb3>This policy debate, highlighted on November 16, 2023, centers on bus fare evasion, free bus pilot expansion, and transit funding. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani (D-Astoria) leads the charge, arguing, "We are hitting numbers that we are not recognizing, because our focus has been on fares." The MTA claims fare compliance is vital, but Mamdani and union voices like JP Patafio of TWU Local 100 urge investment in service and affordability. The matter underscores the working-class reliance on buses and the stalled rollout of OMNY, which limits all-door boarding. The debate pits fare enforcement against calls for free or reduced fares, with advocates demanding progressive taxation to fund transit. No formal council bill or vote is attached, but the stakes for vulnerable riders are clear: service, not policing, keeps them moving.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Online organizing, especially on the MicromobilityNYC subreddit, brought new voices to the table and pressured NYPD to take traffic enforcement seriously.
