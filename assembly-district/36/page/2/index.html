Her femur snapped. Blood on the curb. A 14-year-old limped, her leg torn. A 58-year-old man, bruised and stunned, stared at the car that had just jumped the sidewalk. The driver did not have a license. She was charged with reckless endangerment and reckless driving. The street was not safe for children. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/04/us-news/out-of-control-nyc-driver-hits-two-kids-1-adult-during-evening-rush-leaving-girl-7-with-broken-femur-cops/>&ldquo;An out-of-control unlicensed driver rammed into two kids and one adult,&rdquo; police said.</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>581 people were injured</strong> and <strong>2 killed</strong> in Assembly District 36. Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers all bled. The numbers do not flinch. <strong>SUVs, trucks, sedans, and mopeds</strong> struck down dozens.

He wants traffic enforcement moved from NYPD to DOT, to end bias and focus on safety. He has not been silent. But the streets are still red.</p><p>The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has not used it. Cameras that catch speeders are at risk of going dark. The law is there. The action is not. Residents call for speed bumps. They get promises.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-no-more-waiting>The Next Step: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of blood.</strong> The disaster is not fate. It is policy. It is choice. Call your Assembly Member. Call your Council Member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never sleep. Demand streets where children can walk home. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/queens-crash-children-run-over-driver-charges/>Do not wait for another child’s bones to break.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report states he was unlicensed but wore a helmet. The motorcycle struck the taxi's right front quarter panel, causing the rider to be ejected and thrown onto the roadway. The motorcycle was demolished. The taxi, operated by a licensed driver, stopped after the collision. The police report lists 'Driver Inexperience' as a contributing factor. The rider died at the scene, suffering injuries to his entire body. The report does not cite any contributing victim behavior beyond helmet use.

The bill, led by Andrea Stewart-Cousins and mentioned in the Assembly and Senate one-house budgets, calls for $90 million to increase bus frequency and expand the MTA's free bus pilot. The matter summary states: 'State lawmakers proposed spending $90 million this year to improve bus service frequency and expand the scope of the MTA's free bus pilot.' The proposal, supported by Sen. Michael Gianaris and Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, also adopts the FARES Act, extending half-price MetroCards to commuter rail, and funds new discounts for seniors and people with disabilities. Lawmakers back the QueensLink rail project and recommend subway improvements. They reject tougher toll enforcement, instead supporting the Toll Payer Protection Act. The plan aims to make transit faster, cheaper, and more accessible for millions of riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They propose $90 million for frequent service and 15 new free routes. The plan targets gridlock and aims to boost ridership before congestion pricing hits. Riders in every borough stand to gain.</p><p class=mb3>Bill proposals in the New York State Assembly and Senate, introduced in February 2024 by State Sen. Michael Gianaris and Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani, seek $90 million for increased bus service and 15 more free bus routes. These measures, part of the 'Get Congestion Pricing Right' package, appear in both houses’ 'one-house' budgets as of March 12, 2024. The matter summary states: 'City buses would run more frequently under new proposals from state legislators in Albany, who included increased bus services and new fare discounts in budget proposals.' Mamdani and Gianaris led the push, citing the need for better transit before congestion pricing launches this summer. Their plan includes expanded Fair Fares, new discounts for seniors and disabled riders, and a weekly CityTicket for unlimited intracity rail travel. Advocates and lawmakers argue these steps are critical for equity and access, especially as the city prepares to charge drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street. The proposals now enter negotiations with Governor Hochul.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Riders want speed, reliability, and access.</p><p class=mb3>Senator Michael Gianaris introduced the 'Congestion Pricing Done Right' bill on March 4, 2024. The bill, now before the legislature, seeks to expand New York City's fare-free bus pilot from five to fifteen lines, with three in each borough. The measure promises $45 million for better bus reliability and frequency, targeting low-income and disadvantaged communities. The bill summary states: 'expand and extend New York City's fare-free bus pilot program.' Gianaris, as sponsor, aims to boost mass transit before congestion pricing takes effect. Supporters, including Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, Riders Alliance, and the Transport Workers Union, stress that affordable, frequent buses are vital for safety and equity. MTA Chair Janno Lieber backs more service but warns that bus lanes lag behind. The bill focuses on routes that can handle more buses without new infrastructure, aiming to make public transit a real alternative to cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Mike Gianaris and Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani announced a $90-million proposal to expand bus service and the MTA's free bus pilot. The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, became a public reckoning for Mayor Adams's transportation record. The matter: 'a proposal in Albany to increase bus service before congestion pricing begins.' Mamdani accused Adams of 'incompetence' and violating the Streets Master Plan law, which requires 30 miles of new bus lanes each year. Reporters pressed for answers on mayoral compliance. MTA CEO Janno Lieber praised Adams's past promises but noted the lack of progress. The mayor's spokesperson defended the administration, but data shows bus speeds have dropped since Adams took office. No safety analyst has formally assessed the impact, but the lack of bus lanes leaves vulnerable road users exposed to traffic danger and slow, unreliable transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The numbers tell a different story. His administration missed legal targets two years running. Bus speeds fell. Promised projects stalled or died. Riders wait. Streets stay dangerous. Words do not move buses.</p><p class=mb3>On February 6, 2024, Mayor Eric Adams declared his administration had done an 'amazing job' building bus lanes in New York City. In reality, Adams missed legal targets: only 12.9 miles built in 2022 out of 20 required, and 13.3 miles in 2023 out of 30. Bus speeds dropped from 7.7 mph in January 2022 to 7.4 mph in December 2023. Adams claimed his approach was 'revolutionary' for prioritizing community input. Critics, including Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and Riders Alliance spokesman Danny Pearlstein, countered that Adams canceled or stalled key projects like Fordham Road, despite strong community support. Mamdani said, 'he's made 1.4 million daily bus riders take the slowest buses in the country.' The mayor’s promises remain unmet. Bus riders and pedestrians still wait for safer, faster streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
