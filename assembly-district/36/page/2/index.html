Eleven left with serious injuries.</strong> Nearly two thousand hurt since 2022. Each number is a name, a family, a life cut or changed. In the last twelve months alone, two people died and 560 were injured in 979 crashes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a>).</p><p>The wounds are not spread evenly. <strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> Cars and SUVs caused over 300 injuries. Trucks and buses, 27. Motorcycles and mopeds, 23. Bikes, 8. The street is a gauntlet. The sidewalk is no refuge.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-fresh-grief>Recent Crashes, Fresh Grief</h3><p>The carnage does not pause. On June 8, an SUV struck an elderly pedestrian on 33rd Street. On June 19, a cyclist was injured by a car door on 36th Avenue. On June 27, a police pursuit ended with a sedan hitting a pedestrian on 40th Avenue (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a>).</p><p>The city calls these crashes. But the pain is not accidental. It is built into the street. It is written in the speed, the steel, the silence after sirens fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani has not stood still. He has called for <strong>more protected bike lanes, faster and free buses, and car-free public space</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/04/beach-reading-zohran-mamdanis-answers-to-streetsblogs-mayoral-candidate-survey>Streetsblog survey answers</a>). He has backed the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force the worst repeat offenders to slow down. He has demanded street redesigns and better enforcement. He has said, &ldquo;make buses fast and free, add more protected bike lanes, and increase car-free public space&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/26/heres-what-mamdani-can-steal-from-other-candidates-to-strengthen-his-livable-streets-platform>livable streets platform</a>).</p><p>But the work is not done. <strong>A handful of drivers cause outsized harm.</strong> One bill would require speeders with 16 camera tickets in a year to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. It has not passed. The dead keep coming.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h3><p>A business owner in Astoria, facing a new bike lane plan, said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be forced to shut down because we will not be able to load and unload the materials and products&rdquo; (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/05/us-news/astoria-businesses-residents-fighting-nyc-dots-bike-lane-plan/>Queens clash</a>). But the DOT calls 31st Street &ldquo;one of the most dangerous streets in Queens.&rdquo; <strong>126 injured drivers, 33 injured walkers, 24 injured cyclists, two dead in four years</strong> (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/05/us-news/astoria-businesses-residents-fighting-nyc-dots-bike-lane-plan/>Queens clash</a>).</p><h3 id=act-now-demand-action>Act Now: Demand Action</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Assembly Member Mamdani. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand the Stop Super Speeders Act. Demand streets where a child can cross without fear. <strong>Every day of delay is another name on the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The event, titled 'Decision 2025: Mayoral Question 2 Seeks Answers on Slow Buses,' asked candidates how they would fix New York’s slowest-in-the-nation bus system. Brad Lander, Jessica Ramos, Scott Stringer, Whitney Tilson, Zellnor Myrie, and Zohran Mamdani answered. They called for more bus lanes, stronger enforcement, and faster service. No council bill was introduced; this was a public policy test, not legislation. According to the safety analyst, the event discussed bus speeds but did not specify any policy action affecting pedestrians or cyclists, so no direct safety impact can be assessed. The debate showed urgency but left vulnerable road users waiting for real change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Mayoral candidates responded. Ben Furnas (Transportation Alternatives) called for universal daylighting and laws against super speeders, urging street redesign and enforcement. Zellnor Myrie backed robust street designs to separate bikers, pedestrians, and drivers. Jessica Ramos supported protected bike lanes for both analog and e-bikes, calling e-bikes 'a vital tool for reducing car dependency.' Whitney Tilson demanded speed caps and insurance for e-bike riders. Despite some focus on e-bikes, advocates and data point to car and truck drivers as the main source of injury and death.

The report, covered by Streetsblog NYC, found that eliminating fares would cut bus trip times by 12 percent and boost annual ridership by 169 million, a 23 percent jump. The study states: 'Each dollar of city government support would produce more than two dollars worth of benefits for residents, primarily by removing the burden of fare payments while providing faster and more reliable bus service.' Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and State Senator Michael Gianaris, both of Queens, have pushed the MTA to consider free buses. Komanoff’s analysis shows that faster buses mean less time waiting, cleaner air, fewer crashes, and a small but real drop in car trips.

State Senator Zellnor Myrie, representing District 20, called for a dedicated busway on Brooklyn's Flatbush Avenue, echoing the success of Manhattan's 14th Street. The forum, hosted by Riders Alliance, saw candidates—including Myrie, Brad Lander, Zohran Mamdani, Jessica Ramos, Scott Stringer, and Jim Walden—debate urgent transit reforms. The matter: 'improving NYC's slow bus service.' Myrie and others backed more bus lanes, fare-free buses, and expanding Fair Fares for low-income riders. Mamdani vowed not to cave to local opposition. All criticized Mayor Adams for stalled bus projects. The forum exposed deep frustration with city inaction and highlighted the need for bold, street-level changes to protect riders and speed up commutes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event focused on congestion pricing, set to begin January 5, and subway safety. The matter summary reads: 'NYC mayoral candidates participated in a transit-focused forum... discussing congestion pricing, subway safety, and transit upgrades.' Zellnor Myrie, representing District 20, criticized Mayor Adams for not defending congestion pricing and promised to support it regardless of federal politics. Ramos pushed for congestion pricing revenue to fund the MTA. Stringer called for bus expansion and DOT reform. Walden wanted more police and exemptions for seniors and disabled riders. Lander and Mamdani argued for housing and outreach teams over policing. The forum highlighted sharp divides on how to protect vulnerable New Yorkers on streets and subways.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Adams’ administration installed only 15.7 miles last fiscal year. State Sen. Jessica Ramos said, 'The current mayor promised 150 miles of bus lanes and hasn't delivered.' Comptroller Brad Lander promised a 'professional, world-class DOT commissioner.' Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani vowed to resist business interests blocking bus projects. Sen.

The article states: “If the governor wants to do the MTA and riders a favor, she should use the money she finds to instead boost MTA operations.” Author Samuel Santaella criticizes Hochul’s move, arguing it jeopardizes service for working-class New Yorkers. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and State Senator Michael Gianaris are cited as proponents of fare-free buses, while Riders Alliance pushes for six-minute service. The piece urges Hochul to reject highway expansions and instead invest in frequent, affordable transit. The editorial frames this as a fight for clean air, equity, and safety for all New Yorkers who rely on public transportation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary sponsor), Lincoln Restler, and Erik D. Bottcher back the resolution.
