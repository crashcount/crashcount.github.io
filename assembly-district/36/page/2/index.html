Hundreds Broken. Streets Bleed While Albany Stalls.</h1><p class="byline f6 silver">Written July 6, 2025 <em>(Revised July 16, 2025 – Minor stats refresh)</em></p></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>AD 36: Jan 1, 2022 - Jul 6, 2025</h2><h3 id=the-death-count-grows>The Death Count Grows</h3><p>In Assembly District 36, the numbers do not lie. <strong>Nine people killed. Eleven left with serious injuries.</strong> Nearly two thousand hurt since 2022. Each number is a name, a family, a life cut or changed. In the last twelve months alone, two people died and 560 were injured in 979 crashes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a>).</p><p>The wounds are not spread evenly. <strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> Cars and SUVs caused over 300 injuries. Trucks and buses, 27. Motorcycles and mopeds, 23. Bikes, 8. The street is a gauntlet. The sidewalk is no refuge.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-fresh-grief>Recent Crashes, Fresh Grief</h3><p>The carnage does not pause. On June 8, an SUV struck an elderly pedestrian on 33rd Street. On June 19, a cyclist was injured by a car door on 36th Avenue. On June 27, a police pursuit ended with a sedan hitting a pedestrian on 40th Avenue (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a>).</p><p>The city calls these crashes. But the pain is not accidental. It is built into the street. It is written in the speed, the steel, the silence after sirens fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani has not stood still. He has called for <strong>more protected bike lanes, faster and free buses, and car-free public space</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/04/beach-reading-zohran-mamdanis-answers-to-streetsblogs-mayoral-candidate-survey>Streetsblog survey answers</a>). He has backed the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force the worst repeat offenders to slow down. He has demanded street redesigns and better enforcement. He has said, &ldquo;make buses fast and free, add more protected bike lanes, and increase car-free public space&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/26/heres-what-mamdani-can-steal-from-other-candidates-to-strengthen-his-livable-streets-platform>livable streets platform</a>).</p><p>But the work is not done. <strong>A handful of drivers cause outsized harm.</strong> One bill would require speeders with 16 camera tickets in a year to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. It has not passed. The dead keep coming.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h3><p>A business owner in Astoria, facing a new bike lane plan, said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be forced to shut down because we will not be able to load and unload the materials and products&rdquo; (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/05/us-news/astoria-businesses-residents-fighting-nyc-dots-bike-lane-plan/>Queens clash</a>). But the DOT calls 31st Street &ldquo;one of the most dangerous streets in Queens.&rdquo; <strong>126 injured drivers, 33 injured walkers, 24 injured cyclists, two dead in four years</strong> (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/05/us-news/astoria-businesses-residents-fighting-nyc-dots-bike-lane-plan/>Queens clash</a>).</p><h3 id=act-now-demand-action>Act Now: Demand Action</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Assembly Member Mamdani. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand the Stop Super Speeders Act. Demand streets where a child can cross without fear. <strong>Every day of delay is another name on the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill would require 16- and 17-year-olds riding Class 1 or 2 e-bikes, including Citi Bikes, to wear helmets. Committee Chair William Magnarelli (D-Syracuse) defended the bill, stating, "My only concern is the safety of the people riding the bike." The bill summary notes, 'studies have shown [helmet mandates] can dramatically reduce ridership of the city’s bike share system.' Experts warn such laws lead to fewer cyclists and open the door to discriminatory enforcement, especially against youth of color. Seattle dropped its helmet law in 2022 for these reasons. Despite evidence that helmet laws hurt vulnerable road users, the committee advanced the bill without addressing these harms.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Zellnor Myrie backed robust street designs to separate bikers, pedestrians, and drivers. Jessica Ramos supported protected bike lanes for both analog and e-bikes, calling e-bikes 'a vital tool for reducing car dependency.'

The report, covered by Streetsblog NYC, found that eliminating fares would cut bus trip times by 12 percent and boost annual ridership by 169 million, a 23 percent jump. The study states: 'Each dollar of city government support would produce more than two dollars worth of benefits for residents, primarily by removing the burden of fare payments while providing faster and more reliable bus service.' Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and State Senator Michael Gianaris, both of Queens, have pushed the MTA to consider free buses. Komanoff’s analysis shows that faster buses mean less time waiting, cleaner air, fewer crashes, and a small but real drop in car trips.

State Senator Michael Gianaris, representing District 12, is mentioned as a supporter. The analysis, led by Charles Komanoff, shows that removing fares slashes dwell times and makes service faster and more reliable. While the shift from cars to buses is modest, the benefits for bus riders are clear: less waiting, more access, and safer streets.

In Astoria, a 35-year-old driver 'lost control of her vehicle and went onto the sidewalk, running over two girls, ages 7 and 14.' Police charged her with reckless driving and driving without a license. Later, in South Ozone Park, a 79-year-old driver swerved, sideswiped a bus, then 'jumped the curb and struck four women who were standing at a bus shelter.' All victims survived, but injuries ranged from broken bones to head trauma. The incidents highlight ongoing dangers for pedestrians and raise questions about driver screening and street design.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cuomo called for a new city bureaucracy and stricter enforcement, saying, 'There’s virtually no rules and no regulations regarding e-bike use in New York City and too many New Yorkers are getting hurt, and even killed.' At a campaign event, Cuomo called bike lanes 'crazy.' Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani criticized the plan, warning it would 'increase unwarranted police stops and create a bureaucratic nightmare.' Comptroller Brad Lander said Cuomo's proposal 'puts his failure to govern on the backs of delivery workers.' Safety experts and advocates argue the plan would not improve safety, but instead target delivery workers—many undocumented—while cars and trucks remain the main source of road violence.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Intro 606 faces opposition from DOT, which says, 'there is no evidence that registration improves safety.' The matter’s summary warns that Hochul’s plan would let NYPD enforce bike lane speed limits and reclassify heavy e-bikes as mopeds, requiring licenses and registration. Council members are split: Brad Lander supports regulation targeting app companies, not workers; Jessica Ramos and Zohran Mamdani call for better street design; Michael Blake urges targeted safety solutions and more infrastructure. Advocates like Ligia Guallpa say these measures would criminalize delivery workers and create a 'ticketing-to-deportation pipeline.' The Council press office did not comment.

The panel condemned the rollback of protections for immigrants and the firing of NLRB board member Gwynne A. Wilcox. Velázquez declared, 'We’ll see him in court,' after Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy revoked federal approval for congestion pricing. She pledged to fight budget cuts targeting vulnerable communities and criticized tax breaks for the wealthy. Julie Won joined the call for grassroots activism.
