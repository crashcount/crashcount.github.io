A seven-year-old girl lies on the pavement with a broken femur and a head wound. A 14-year-old girl and a 58-year-old man are hit too. The driver has no license.

He has called for more protected bike lanes, busways, and moving traffic enforcement out of the NYPD’s hands. He stood with advocates after each new death. He called out reckless driving by public officials and backed bills to raise fees on heavy SUVs and expand bus lanes. But the blood on the street is not washed away by words. <strong>Every delay, every loophole, every unbuilt lane is another risk.</strong></p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Call your leaders. Demand action.</strong> The city can lower speed limits. The state can keep speed cameras running. The district can build more protected space for people who walk and bike. <strong>Every day without change is another day someone does not come home.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Nydia Velázquez led a Queens town hall to rally opposition against Trump Administration policies, including the federal move to block New York City's congestion pricing plan. The event, held at Sunnyside Community Services, featured Council Member Julie Won (District 26) and other local officials. The panel condemned the rollback of protections for immigrants and the firing of NLRB board member Gwynne A. Wilcox. Velázquez declared, 'We’ll see him in court,' after Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy revoked federal approval for congestion pricing. She pledged to fight budget cuts targeting vulnerable communities and criticized tax breaks for the wealthy. Julie Won joined the call for grassroots activism. The town hall spotlighted the threat to New York’s sovereignty and the urgent need to defend city streets and programs from federal interference.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The free bus pilot dies. Riders get more buses but lose free rides. Councilmember Hanks pushes for more OMNY machines. The city moves, but not all riders win.</p><p class=mb3>On April 26, 2024, New York State lawmakers approved over $12 million to increase bus service across New York City. The decision ended funding for the MTA's pilot program that made one bus route in each borough free. The matter, titled 'NYC to get a boost in bus service, but pilot program for free routes ends,' highlights the trade-off: more buses, but no more free rides. Councilmember Kamillah Hanks of District 49 introduced a resolution urging the MTA to install at least 30 OMNY card vending machines in every borough, noting not all riders can pay by smartphone. The bill is not tied to a specific council committee or number. Hanks is mentioned for her advocacy on OMNY access. The move increases bus frequency but leaves low-income and cash riders behind. No direct safety impact for vulnerable road users was assessed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Sara Lind, speaking for her organization, urges city and state leaders to seize the moment. She calls for free bus and ferry rides during the first week, dedicated bus lanes, double-wide bike lanes on major avenues, and car-free streets near schools. The statement reads: 'Congestion pricing isn't important only because it will reduce the number of cars below 60th Street in Manhattan; its true value lies in what else we can get when that happens.' No council bill number or committee is attached, as this is an advocacy statement. The proposals center vulnerable road users—children, cyclists, bus riders—by demanding space and safety where cars once ruled.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary states: 'State lawmakers proposed spending $90 million this year to improve bus service frequency and expand the scope of the MTA's free bus pilot.' The proposal, supported by Sen.

Michael Gianaris and Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani, seek $90 million for increased bus service and 15 more free bus routes. These measures, part of the 'Get Congestion Pricing Right' package, appear in both houses’ 'one-house' budgets as of March 12, 2024. The matter summary states: 'City buses would run more frequently under new proposals from state legislators in Albany, who included increased bus services and new fare discounts in budget proposals.' Mamdani and Gianaris led the push, citing the need for better transit before congestion pricing launches this summer. Their plan includes expanded Fair Fares, new discounts for seniors and disabled riders, and a weekly CityTicket for unlimited intracity rail travel. Advocates and lawmakers argue these steps are critical for equity and access, especially as the city prepares to charge drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street. The proposals now enter negotiations with Governor Hochul.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Supporters, including Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, Riders Alliance, and the Transport Workers Union, stress that affordable, frequent buses are vital for safety and equity. MTA Chair Janno Lieber backs more service but warns that bus lanes lag behind.

The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, became a public reckoning for Mayor Adams's transportation record. The matter: 'a proposal in Albany to increase bus service before congestion pricing begins.' Mamdani accused Adams of 'incompetence' and violating the Streets Master Plan law, which requires 30 miles of new bus lanes each year. Reporters pressed for answers on mayoral compliance. MTA CEO Janno Lieber praised Adams's past promises but noted the lack of progress. The mayor's spokesperson defended the administration, but data shows bus speeds have dropped since Adams took office. No safety analyst has formally assessed the impact, but the lack of bus lanes leaves vulnerable road users exposed to traffic danger and slow, unreliable transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
