In the past year, three people were killed and 733 injured in 1,231 crashes. Four suffered life-altering injuries. The dead do not speak. The injured carry the story in scars and limps.</p><p>Just last October, a 36-year-old cyclist was killed at 34th Avenue and 37th Street. A truck, a sedan, and a bike. The cyclist died at the scene. No helmet could save her. No law protected her. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>On 31st Street, the city tried to build a protected bike lane. Businesses sued to stop it. The Department of Transportation stood firm: “We stand firmly behind this project and will defend our work in court.” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/08/dot-stands-by-astoria-safety-project-despite-foes-anti-bike-lawsuit>said DOT spokesman Will Livingston</a>. The fight is not over. The street remembers every injury.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-votes-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Words, Votes, and Missed Chances</h3><p>Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani has spoken for safer streets. He co-sponsored the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting devices. He called for more bus lanes, bike lanes, and car-free spaces. He stood against the removal of protected bike lanes in Brooklyn. But when the vote came to extend school speed zone protections, he was excused—absent. The bill passed without him. The streets do not wait for anyone.</p><p>Mamdani said, “Everything has to be assessed on its merits, and the merit that we are measuring these projects by is whether or not they deliver for working class New Yorkers who are currently taking the slowest buses in the country.” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/08/mamdani-promises-new-path-for-bus-projects-as-mta-leader-finally-loses-patience-with-mayor-adams>Streetsblog NYC</a>. The buses crawl. The cars speed. The bodies pile up.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p>The crisis is not abstract. It is flesh and bone on the road. Call Assembly Member Mamdani. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes, not lawsuits. Demand action, not absence. Every day of delay is another family broken.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The poll, highlighted in Streetsblog NYC, found deep worry among women, seniors, and Bronx residents. The matter summary reads: '77% of NYC voters consider pedestrian safety a serious issue.' Mayoral candidates responded. Ben Furnas (Transportation Alternatives) called for universal daylighting and laws against super speeders, urging street redesign and enforcement. Zellnor Myrie backed robust street designs to separate bikers, pedestrians, and drivers. Jessica Ramos supported protected bike lanes for both analog and e-bikes, calling e-bikes 'a vital tool for reducing car dependency.' Whitney Tilson demanded speed caps and insurance for e-bike riders. Despite some focus on e-bikes, advocates and data point to car and truck drivers as the main source of injury and death. The poll signals a mandate: fix the streets, protect the vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Faster boarding slashes dwell times. Riders save time. Streets get safer, air gets cleaner. The city must weigh the cost—and the gains.</p><p class=mb3>On April 14, 2025, a policy analysis by Charles Komanoff examined the impact of fare-free buses in New York City. The report, covered by Streetsblog NYC, found that eliminating fares would cut bus trip times by 12 percent and boost annual ridership by 169 million, a 23 percent jump. The study states: 'Each dollar of city government support would produce more than two dollars worth of benefits for residents, primarily by removing the burden of fare payments while providing faster and more reliable bus service.' Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and State Senator Michael Gianaris, both of Queens, have pushed the MTA to consider free buses. Komanoff’s analysis shows that faster buses mean less time waiting, cleaner air, fewer crashes, and a small but real drop in car trips. The report adds fuel to the debate over city funding for free bus service.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The MTA previously ran free bus pilots, reporting increased ridership and fewer operator assaults, though the agency questioned whether new riders joined.

Bah was charged with reckless endangerment, reckless driving, and driving without a license. She has never held a valid New York driver's license.

Cuomo called for a new city bureaucracy and stricter enforcement, saying, 'There’s virtually no rules and no regulations regarding e-bike use in New York City and too many New Yorkers are getting hurt, and even killed.' At a campaign event, Cuomo called bike lanes 'crazy.' Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani criticized the plan, warning it would 'increase unwarranted police stops and create a bureaucratic nightmare.' Comptroller Brad Lander said Cuomo's proposal 'puts his failure to govern on the backs of delivery workers.'

Streets stay dangerous for those on foot and bike.</p><p class=mb3>On February 27, 2025, the City Council considered three bills: Intro 606 (register and license all e-bikes), Intro 1133 (expand minimum wage, study delivery worker conditions), and Intro 1135 (set minimum pay for grocery delivery). Intro 606 faces opposition from DOT, which says, 'there is no evidence that registration improves safety.' The matter’s summary warns that Hochul’s plan would let NYPD enforce bike lane speed limits and reclassify heavy e-bikes as mopeds, requiring licenses and registration. Council members are split: Brad Lander supports regulation targeting app companies, not workers; Jessica Ramos and Zohran Mamdani call for better street design; Michael Blake urges targeted safety solutions and more infrastructure. Advocates like Ligia Guallpa say these measures would criminalize delivery workers and create a 'ticketing-to-deportation pipeline.' The Council press office did not comment.

He built too few bus lanes. Riders wait. Buses crawl. Council Member Mamdani calls him out. City Hall dodges. Streets stay clogged. Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price. The city drags its feet. The danger grows.</p><p class=mb3>This is not a bill, but a policy failure. In 2022, city law required 20 miles of new bus lanes. Adams built 12.9. In 2023, the law demanded 30 miles. Only 7.8 appeared. Council Member Zohran Kwame Mamdani slammed the mayor: 'How can he call himself a law and order mayor, when New Yorkers can’t trust him to follow the law?' The Adams administration, through spokesperson Liz Garcia, claimed progress: 'We continue to work with our partners in the MTA and with communities across the city to build on this record of success.' But the numbers tell a harsher story. Bus speeds have dropped since Adams took office. Riders, many with no other option, face longer waits and slower trips. The city’s failure to build bus lanes leaves streets more dangerous for those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
