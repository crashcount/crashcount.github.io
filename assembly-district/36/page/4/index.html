Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On April 19, 2023, Mayor Eric Adams endorsed a pilot to make two bus routes free in each borough, totaling ten free buses. The plan is part of the 'Fix the MTA' package, originally championed by Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and progressive allies. Adams said, 'I strongly support the thought of having 10 buses being free on lines in the city. I think it would make a major impact.' Mamdani called free buses 'transformative' for working-class New Yorkers. Despite this, other bus improvements lag. Adams pledged 150 miles of new bus lanes in four years, but only 11.95 miles were built last year. Some projects stalled amid political opposition. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber stressed the need for city commitment to bus lanes and warned of fare hikes and service cuts if funding gaps persist. No formal safety analysis was provided for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, covered by amny.com, called for a $300 million boost to the governor's plan, aiming to cut subway headways to six minutes, make buses free, and avoid fare hikes. The coalition, including the Riders Alliance and TWU Local 100, argued that current service leaves riders waiting over ten minutes and crawling on slow buses. Mamdani, prime sponsor of the Fix the MTA package, said, 'They are at risk of being priced out of one of their most basic human rights, the right to go around their city.' He pushed for higher corporate taxes to fund these improvements. TWU Local 100 president Richard Davis and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams also spoke out against service cuts. The governor's office did not endorse Mamdani's tax proposal.
