Hundreds Broken. Streets Bleed While Albany Stalls.</h1><p class="byline f6 silver">Written July 6, 2025 <em>(Revised July 17, 2025 – Minor stats refresh)</em></p></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>AD 36: Jan 1, 2022 - Jul 6, 2025</h2><h3 id=the-death-count-grows>The Death Count Grows</h3><p>In Assembly District 36, the numbers do not lie. <strong>Nine people killed. Eleven left with serious injuries.</strong> Nearly two thousand hurt since 2022. Each number is a name, a family, a life cut or changed. In the last twelve months alone, two people died and 560 were injured in 979 crashes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a>).</p><p>The wounds are not spread evenly. <strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> Cars and SUVs caused over 300 injuries. Trucks and buses, 27. Motorcycles and mopeds, 23. Bikes, 8. The street is a gauntlet. The sidewalk is no refuge.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-fresh-grief>Recent Crashes, Fresh Grief</h3><p>The carnage does not pause. On June 8, an SUV struck an elderly pedestrian on 33rd Street. On June 19, a cyclist was injured by a car door on 36th Avenue. On June 27, a police pursuit ended with a sedan hitting a pedestrian on 40th Avenue (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a>).</p><p>The city calls these crashes. But the pain is not accidental. It is built into the street. It is written in the speed, the steel, the silence after sirens fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani has not stood still. He has called for <strong>more protected bike lanes, faster and free buses, and car-free public space</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/04/beach-reading-zohran-mamdanis-answers-to-streetsblogs-mayoral-candidate-survey>Streetsblog survey answers</a>). He has backed the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force the worst repeat offenders to slow down. He has demanded street redesigns and better enforcement. He has said, &ldquo;make buses fast and free, add more protected bike lanes, and increase car-free public space&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/26/heres-what-mamdani-can-steal-from-other-candidates-to-strengthen-his-livable-streets-platform>livable streets platform</a>).</p><p>But the work is not done. <strong>A handful of drivers cause outsized harm.</strong> One bill would require speeders with 16 camera tickets in a year to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. It has not passed. The dead keep coming.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h3><p>A business owner in Astoria, facing a new bike lane plan, said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be forced to shut down because we will not be able to load and unload the materials and products&rdquo; (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/05/us-news/astoria-businesses-residents-fighting-nyc-dots-bike-lane-plan/>Queens clash</a>). But the DOT calls 31st Street &ldquo;one of the most dangerous streets in Queens.&rdquo; <strong>126 injured drivers, 33 injured walkers, 24 injured cyclists, two dead in four years</strong> (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/05/us-news/astoria-businesses-residents-fighting-nyc-dots-bike-lane-plan/>Queens clash</a>).</p><h3 id=act-now-demand-action>Act Now: Demand Action</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Assembly Member Mamdani. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand the Stop Super Speeders Act. Demand streets where a child can cross without fear. <strong>Every day of delay is another name on the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

No formal council bill number is listed, but the Transportation Committee of Community Board 1 passed a resolution urging DOT to daylight all intersections. The matter, described as 'community advocacy for street safety and bike infrastructure,' drew over 150 residents to a public workshop. Council Member Zohran Kwame Mamdani attended, stating, 'Astorians showed up last night for pedestrian + bike safety.' Online organizing, especially on the MicromobilityNYC subreddit, brought new voices to the table and pressured NYPD to take traffic enforcement seriously. The area lacks protected bike lanes—only 3 percent of streets have them—while most residents do not own cars and rely on walking, biking, or transit. The activism is diverse, persistent, and focused on ending traffic violence.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The workshop addressed a 'significant increase in traffic-related deaths, including several high-profile fatalities involving cyclists and pedestrians.'

Cabán stated, 'If it saves lives, it’s worth doing.'

Lawmakers and advocates say this will speed up buses and protect the vulnerable.</p><p class=mb3>The 2023 state budget, agreed on May 1, expands the MTA's automated bus lane enforcement camera system. The bill, backed by Governor Hochul and legislative leaders, broadens enforcement to drivers blocking bus stops, truck loading zones, bike lanes, intersections, and crosswalks. Fines start at $50, escalating for repeat offenses. The MTA will increase buses with cameras from 450 to 1,000 by year's end. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and advocate Sara Lind support the move, calling it vital for bus reliability and street safety. Lind says, 'Camera-based enforcement is such a powerful tool for making our streets safer.' The budget also addresses MTA funding, but some, like Mamdani, criticize the city's increased financial burden. The bill aims to clear the way for buses and vulnerable road users, reducing dangerous blockages.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The pilot is a key piece of the 'Fix the MTA' package. Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, a main sponsor, celebrated the inclusion of free buses, stating, 'I’m excited that the vision of free buses from our Fix the MTA package has been included in this year’s budget.' The pilot aims to increase bus ridership and keep fares low, while new funding measures—like a payroll mobility tax and increased city contributions—shore up the MTA’s finances. The plan also promises more frequent subway service and avoids steep fare hikes or service cuts. The official cost of the pilot is not yet clear, but advocates and officials say it will keep the MTA stable for four years.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Mamdani called free buses 'transformative' for working-class New Yorkers. Despite this, other bus improvements lag. Adams pledged 150 miles of new bus lanes in four years, but only 11.95 miles were built last year. Some projects stalled amid political opposition. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber stressed the need for city commitment to bus lanes and warned of fare hikes and service cuts if funding gaps persist.

Mamdani, prime sponsor of the Fix the MTA package, said, 'They are at risk of being priced out of one of their most basic human rights, the right to go around their city.' He pushed for higher corporate taxes to fund these improvements. TWU Local 100 president Richard Davis and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams also spoke out against service cuts.
