Critics say it boosts driving, cuts transit funds, and worsens air. Councilmember Mamdani voted no. Advocates slam the move as reckless. Congestion pricing still waits. Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On April 8, 2022, Governor Hochul signed a budget bill eliminating New York State’s gas tax. The measure passed quickly, bypassing lengthy review. The bill’s summary: relief from rising fuel prices. Councilmember Zohran Kwame Mamdani voted against it, citing environmental and equity harms: “This subsidizes the fossil fuel industry by $585M... I voted no.” Advocates like Danny Pearlstein (Riders Alliance) and Eric McClure (StreetsPAC) condemned the holiday as bad policy, warning it undercuts transit funding and encourages driving. Kate Slevin (Regional Plan Association) questioned future road repair funding. Meanwhile, congestion pricing—meant to cut traffic and fund transit—remains stalled. The swift gas tax cut, critics say, leaves vulnerable road users exposed to more cars, more danger, and less support.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
