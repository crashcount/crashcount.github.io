Since 2022, nine people have died in traffic crashes across Assembly District 36. Over 2,000 have been injured. In the last twelve months alone, 609 people were hurt, three were seriously injured, and two did not make it home. The youngest lost was just 36, a cyclist killed at 34th Avenue and 37th Street. The oldest, 59, died riding a moped on Northern Boulevard. The numbers do not tell you about the silence that follows, or the families left behind.</p><p>Just last month, a cyclist was killed in a police chase. Weeks before, a pick-up truck struck an infant on Steinway Street. The pattern repeats: cars, trucks, and SUVs do the most harm. The city counts the bodies. The crisis crawls on.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-absence>Leadership: Action and Absence</h3><p>Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani has backed bills to curb repeat speeders, co-sponsoring legislation to force speed-limiting tech into the cars of the worst offenders (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">A2299</a>). He has called for more protected bike lanes and for moving traffic enforcement out of NYPD hands (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/04/beach-reading-zohran-mamdanis-answers-to-streetsblogs-mayoral-candidate-survey>called for more protected bike lanes</a>). He stood with advocates against the removal of proven safety measures, like the Bedford Avenue bike lane (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/13/breaking-mayor-adams-to-remove-bedford-avenue-protected-bike-lane-citing-bizarrely-safety>stood with advocates</a>).</p><p>But when it mattered, Mamdani missed a key vote to extend school speed zone protections (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>missed a key vote</a>). The bill passed, but absence leaves a mark. The work is not done.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>A mother’s words after her son died subway surfing cut through the noise: “We were blindsided. We never planned for a funeral for a child. They’re kids. They think they are having fun, they think it doesn’t affect other people but then it does.” (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/07/family-of-boy-15-who-died-in-queens-subway-surfing-incident-says-he-started-hanging-out-with-the-wrong-crowd/>her son died subway surfing</a>)</p><p>The city’s transit chief put it plain: “This was as avoidable as it is tragic.” (<a href=https://licpost.com/bronx-boy-killed-subway-surfing-queensboro-plaza-long-island-city>transit chief put it plain</a>)</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>Every crash is preventable. Lower the speed limit. Build the lanes. Enforce the law against the reckless, not the vulnerable. Call Assembly Member Mamdani. Call your council member.

Hochul also backed city control of speed limits, expanded CityTicket, and transit-oriented development. Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, representing District 36, criticized Hochul for omitting a concrete plan to address the MTA’s financial crisis, warning 'fare hikes and service cuts remain possible.' The speech left the MTA’s future in limbo. No safety analyst assessment was provided for vulnerable road users.

Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani called the crash 'absolutely heartbreaking,' noting Kao was the fourth cyclist killed in Astoria in 2.5 years. State Senator Kristen Gonzalez blamed 'poorly designed streets,' saying, 'traffic violence is the outcome of poorly designed streets and is a solvable problem.' The area has almost no protected bike lanes. In 2022, Community Board 1 saw 1,979 crashes, injuring 120 cyclists and 163 pedestrians. Politicians and residents demand safer streets, better enforcement, and an end to car dominance.

Funding would rise from $200 million in 2023 to $638 million in 2026, with $488 million yearly for more buses and $300 million annually for frequent subways. Mamdani called the proposal 'urgent and necessary,' stressing that 'seniors, working class New Yorkers, people who use the bus the most are able to do so without fear of being priced out.'

Critics say it boosts driving, cuts transit funds, and worsens air. Councilmember Mamdani voted no. Advocates slam the move as reckless. Congestion pricing still waits. Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On April 8, 2022, Governor Hochul signed a budget bill eliminating New York State’s gas tax. The measure passed quickly, bypassing lengthy review. The bill’s summary: relief from rising fuel prices. Councilmember Zohran Kwame Mamdani voted against it, citing environmental and equity harms: “This subsidizes the fossil fuel industry by $585M... I voted no.” Advocates like Danny Pearlstein (Riders Alliance) and Eric McClure (StreetsPAC) condemned the holiday as bad policy, warning it undercuts transit funding and encourages driving. Kate Slevin (Regional Plan Association) questioned future road repair funding. Meanwhile, congestion pricing—meant to cut traffic and fund transit—remains stalled. The swift gas tax cut, critics say, leaves vulnerable road users exposed to more cars, more danger, and less support.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
