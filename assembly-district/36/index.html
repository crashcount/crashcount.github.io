In the past year, three people were killed and 733 injured in 1,231 crashes. Four suffered life-altering injuries. The dead do not speak. The injured carry the story in scars and limps.</p><p>Just last October, a 36-year-old cyclist was killed at 34th Avenue and 37th Street. A truck, a sedan, and a bike. The cyclist died at the scene. No helmet could save her. No law protected her. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>On 31st Street, the city tried to build a protected bike lane. Businesses sued to stop it. The Department of Transportation stood firm: “We stand firmly behind this project and will defend our work in court.” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/08/dot-stands-by-astoria-safety-project-despite-foes-anti-bike-lawsuit>said DOT spokesman Will Livingston</a>. The fight is not over. The street remembers every injury.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-votes-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Words, Votes, and Missed Chances</h3><p>Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani has spoken for safer streets. He co-sponsored the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting devices. He called for more bus lanes, bike lanes, and car-free spaces. He stood against the removal of protected bike lanes in Brooklyn. But when the vote came to extend school speed zone protections, he was excused—absent. The bill passed without him. The streets do not wait for anyone.</p><p>Mamdani said, “Everything has to be assessed on its merits, and the merit that we are measuring these projects by is whether or not they deliver for working class New Yorkers who are currently taking the slowest buses in the country.” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/08/mamdani-promises-new-path-for-bus-projects-as-mta-leader-finally-loses-patience-with-mayor-adams>Streetsblog NYC</a>. The buses crawl. The cars speed. The bodies pile up.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p>The crisis is not abstract. It is flesh and bone on the road. Call Assembly Member Mamdani. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes, not lawsuits. Demand action, not absence. Every day of delay is another family broken.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Meyer supports the busway and criticizes the mayor’s retreat. No council bill number or committee is tied to this action. The delay blocks safer, more equitable streets.
