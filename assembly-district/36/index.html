Since 2022, nine people have died in traffic crashes across Assembly District 36. Over 2,000 have been injured. In the last twelve months alone, 609 people were hurt, three were seriously injured, and two did not make it home. The youngest lost was just 36, a cyclist killed at 34th Avenue and 37th Street. The oldest, 59, died riding a moped on Northern Boulevard. The numbers do not tell you about the silence that follows, or the families left behind.</p><p>Just last month, a cyclist was killed in a police chase. Weeks before, a pick-up truck struck an infant on Steinway Street. The pattern repeats: cars, trucks, and SUVs do the most harm. The city counts the bodies. The crisis crawls on.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-absence>Leadership: Action and Absence</h3><p>Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani has backed bills to curb repeat speeders, co-sponsoring legislation to force speed-limiting tech into the cars of the worst offenders (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">A2299</a>). He has called for more protected bike lanes and for moving traffic enforcement out of NYPD hands (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/04/beach-reading-zohran-mamdanis-answers-to-streetsblogs-mayoral-candidate-survey>called for more protected bike lanes</a>). He stood with advocates against the removal of proven safety measures, like the Bedford Avenue bike lane (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/13/breaking-mayor-adams-to-remove-bedford-avenue-protected-bike-lane-citing-bizarrely-safety>stood with advocates</a>).</p><p>But when it mattered, Mamdani missed a key vote to extend school speed zone protections (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>missed a key vote</a>). The bill passed, but absence leaves a mark. The work is not done.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>A mother’s words after her son died subway surfing cut through the noise: “We were blindsided. We never planned for a funeral for a child. They’re kids. They think they are having fun, they think it doesn’t affect other people but then it does.” (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/07/family-of-boy-15-who-died-in-queens-subway-surfing-incident-says-he-started-hanging-out-with-the-wrong-crowd/>her son died subway surfing</a>)</p><p>The city’s transit chief put it plain: “This was as avoidable as it is tragic.” (<a href=https://licpost.com/bronx-boy-killed-subway-surfing-queensboro-plaza-long-island-city>transit chief put it plain</a>)</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>Every crash is preventable. Lower the speed limit. Build the lanes. Enforce the law against the reckless, not the vulnerable. Call Assembly Member Mamdani. Call your council member. Demand action.</p><p>Do not wait for another child’s funeral.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Mayoral rival Brad Lander and Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani criticized Cuomo’s record, calling his driving 'reckless and unlawful.' Zellnor Myrie’s spokesperson, Julia Rose, said Cuomo acts above the law. The safety analyst notes: this event describes an individual's driving and parking behavior but does not constitute a policy change or legislation affecting population-level safety for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Safety for Brooklyn’s most vulnerable is stripped away.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13, 2025, Mayor Adams announced the removal of the protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue, Brooklyn. The lane, installed in 2024, calmed a corridor once plagued by crashes and deaths. Streetsblog NYC reported: 'A protected bike lane that was installed last year to calm a notoriously dangerous Brooklyn corridor will be removed by the Adams administration, making the roadway less safe.' Council Members Lincoln Restler and Chi Ossé condemned the move, calling it reckless and political. Brad Lander and Zohran Mamdani joined in opposition. No council bill or committee review occurred; this was a unilateral mayoral action. Removing the lane eliminates a proven safety intervention, increasing risk for cyclists and pedestrians and discouraging active transportation, which undermines safety in numbers and equitable street access.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, detailed in his mayoral campaign, calls for fully staffing the Department of Transportation's bus unit, painting at least 30 miles of new bus lanes each year, and expanding transit signal priority. Mamdani says, 'There is a portion of that 'fast' that comes from the fact that if you make it free [you get] a faster ride.' He also pledges to lockbox dedicated funding for free service, citing his past work on MTA rescue packages. Mamdani and his allies point to a recent free bus pilot that increased ridership and reduced assaults. The proposal, if enacted, would shift street space from cars to buses, aiming to make public transit safer and more reliable for all riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
