Twenty-one left with wounds that will not heal. In the last three years, Assembly District 63 has seen <strong>over 4,000 crashes</strong>. <strong>More than 2,000 people hurt</strong>. The numbers are blunt. The pain is not.</p><p>On May 17, 2025, <strong>Jose Luis Gomez-Guallazaca, 58, was crossing Targee Street</strong>. An e-scooter hit him. The driver flew off the scooter. Jose did not get up. Paramedics took him to Richmond University Medical Center. He was pronounced dead. Police said, &ldquo;upon impact, the driver was violently ejected off the scooter while Gomez-Guallazaca sustained severe trauma&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/bronx-man-killed-by-e-scooter-driver-05172025/>amNY</a>).</p><p>A month earlier, <strong>Leony Salcedo-Chevalier, 34, was killed by a reversing box truck</strong> at the Amazon warehouse on Gulf Avenue. He had two daughters. He was killed on the job. &ldquo;He was 34 years old. He had two daughters.

In the last year alone, <strong>two people killed, twelve left with serious injuries</strong>. Children, elders, workers. Cars and trucks did most of the damage. SUVs killed at least two. Trucks killed two more. A van, a bus, a bike—each left someone broken or gone.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h2><p><strong>Assembly Member Sam Pirozzolo has not led on safety.</strong> In June 2024, he voted <strong>against a bill to install speed cameras near schools</strong>—a measure proven to slow drivers and save children (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">Open States</a>). He signed letters about train cars. He did not sign bills to protect people on foot or bike.</p><p>No press quotes. No bills to lower speed. No push for safer crossings. The silence is loud.</p><h2 id=what-next-the-choice-is-yours>What Next? The Choice Is Yours</h2><p><strong>This is not fate.
