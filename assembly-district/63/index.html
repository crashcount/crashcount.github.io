Police said the SUV driver was making a K‑turn across lanes when it happened. <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/staten-island-motorcyclist-killed-k-turn-07062025/>amNY</a> linked the scene and the man’s name to the crash. City data confirm the time, place, and injuries. The NYPD Collision Investigation Squad took the case. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a> lists the factors as &ldquo;Unsafe Speed&rdquo; and &ldquo;Making U Turn.&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>On Targee Street at Pierce, an e‑scooter struck a 58‑year‑old man crossing. He died. The rider was ejected. Both were taken to Richmond University Medical Center. No arrests at the time. The Highway District is investigating. That is what police told <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/bronx-man-killed-by-e-scooter-driver-05172025/>amNY</a>. City records mark &ldquo;Unsafe Speed.&rdquo; <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a> shows the pedestrian killed and the rider injured.</p></li><li><p>At 546 Gulf Ave., a box truck backed up and killed a 34‑year‑old worker.

The Staten Island Expressway logged 412 injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. Victory Boulevard shows 87 injuries; Victory Blvd another 78 with multiple serious injuries. Forest Avenue holds deaths and dozens hurt. These are the places where speed and size meet bone.</p><p>Nights cut deep. From 7 p.m. to 11 p.m., AD 63 saw spikes, including deaths at 7 p.m., 9 p.m., and 10 p.m. Early hours hurt too: deaths at 4, 5, and 6 a.m. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. The clock tells the truth.</p><p>Heavy machines do heavy damage. Trucks and buses killed four pedestrians here; cars and SUVs killed three. <a href=#>District stats</a> show trucks and buses behind seven of the most severe pedestrian outcomes citywide for this district, with SUVs and sedans close behind. Pedestrians are not safe against steel.</p><h3 id=what-the-numbers-say>What the numbers say</h3><p>In this district since 2022: pedestrians killed, cyclists hurt, riders ejected, workers crushed. The mode split tells it straight: Pedestrians — 10 dead, 314 injured. Cyclists — 1 dead, 50 hurt. People inside vehicles — 7 dead, 2,056 hurt. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Speed threads through it. &ldquo;Unsafe Speed&rdquo; appears in fatal files on Bay Street and Targee Street. Across the district, speed sits inside the catch‑all &ldquo;other&rdquo; that leads deaths and injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>This year is worse. Year‑to‑date crashes are up 26% over last year. Deaths up from 2 to 5.

A bulldozer rolled. &ldquo;This morning is not just about crushing mopeds. It is about crushing the criminal activity and quality of life activities that come with them,&rdquo; said Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/super-smash-nyc-destroys-mopeds-e-bikes-as-mayor-celebrates-illegal-vehicle-crackdown>Gothamist</a>.

The files show deaths and serious injuries on both. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</li><li>Gulf Avenue needs hard rules for trucks that back. No blind moves without a spotter. A man died under a box truck there. <a href=https://www.amny.com/police-fire/staten-island-amazon-warehouse-collision-04092025/>amNY</a>.</li><li>Bay Street needs turn protection where K‑turns and U‑turns cross live lanes.

The toll will be measured in blood, not words.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13 and June 17, 2025, the New York State Senate and Assembly voted on reauthorizing New York City's school zone speed camera program. The Senate passed the measure 38-21; three city senators—Stephen Chan, Andrew Lanza, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton—voted no. The Assembly passed it 110-31, with nine city lawmakers—Alec Brook-Krasny, Lester Chang, Simcha Eichenstein, Michael Novakhov, Stacey Pheffer Amato, Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Reilly, David Weprin, Kalman Yeger—opposing. The Streetsblog NYC article, 'Ye Shall Know Their Names! Meet the Dirty Dozen City Pols Who Voted Against Speed Camera Program,' quotes lawmakers dismissing speed cameras as revenue grabs or burdens. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action, so no direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists can be assessed.' Still, the votes signal disregard for proven tools that protect those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
