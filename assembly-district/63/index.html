On May 17, 2025, police said Jose Luis Gomez-Guallazaca, 58, was crossing Targee Street when an e‑scooter struck him; he died at the hospital (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/bronx-man-killed-by-e-scooter-driver-05172025/>amNY</a>).</p><h3 id=where-the-street-bites-back>Where the street bites back</h3><p>Forest Avenue shows two deaths and dozens hurt.

Daytime hurts too, but night takes its cut (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). “This morning is not just about crushing mopeds. It is about crushing the criminal activity and quality of life activities that come with them,” Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said at a Staten Island crackdown as officials destroyed unregistered mopeds and e‑bikes (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/super-smash-nyc-destroys-mopeds-e-bikes-as-mayor-celebrates-illegal-vehicle-crackdown>Gothamist</a>).</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The machines that kill</h3><p>In crashes hurting people on foot here, trucks and buses show up heavy: <strong>7 pedestrian deaths</strong> trace to them in the period covered (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Cars and SUVs still do the most harm by volume, but mass and height make big vehicles unforgiving. “Far too often, they are used to rob, to hit, and to run, to cause chaos on our streets and cheat the system,” Tisch said of illegal mopeds at that same event (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/super-smash-nyc-destroys-mopeds-e-bikes-as-mayor-celebrates-illegal-vehicle-crackdown>Gothamist</a>).</p><p>Disregarding signals shows up in deadly files here.

The clock doesn’t stop.</p><h3 id=who-stood-where-when-it-counted>Who stood where when it counted</h3><p>In June, the Legislature voted on S 8344 to extend and clean up New York City’s school‑zone speed rules. Assembly Member Sam Pirozzolo, who represents this district, voted no (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Open States</a>). Weeks later, a tally of city politicians who opposed renewing NYC’s speed‑camera program named him among the no votes (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>Streetsblog NYC</a>). Children still cross.</p><h3 id=fix-what-we-can-see>Fix what we can see</h3><p>Start where people die and where they get hit: Forest Avenue, Victory Boulevard, 546 Gulf Ave. Daylight the corners. Harden the turns. Give pedestrians a head start and protect them with concrete. Aim truck safety at warehouse zones and set strict backing controls. Focus night enforcement where the deaths cluster (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Citywide, two steps are on the table now. Lower the default speed so crashes are fewer and survivable. Fit cars driven by repeat speeders with devices that keep them within the limit, as outlined in the Stop Super Speeders push on our site’s <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a> page.

Their votes keep streets exposed. Pedestrians and cyclists lose a shield. Reckless drivers win. The city’s most basic defense—rejected. The toll will be measured in blood, not words.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13 and June 17, 2025, the New York State Senate and Assembly voted on reauthorizing New York City's school zone speed camera program. The Senate passed the measure 38-21; three city senators—Stephen Chan, Andrew Lanza, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton—voted no. The Assembly passed it 110-31, with nine city lawmakers—Alec Brook-Krasny, Lester Chang, Simcha Eichenstein, Michael Novakhov, Stacey Pheffer Amato, Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Reilly, David Weprin, Kalman Yeger—opposing. The Streetsblog NYC article, 'Ye Shall Know Their Names! Meet the Dirty Dozen City Pols Who Voted Against Speed Camera Program,' quotes lawmakers dismissing speed cameras as revenue grabs or burdens. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action, so no direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists can be assessed.' Still, the votes signal disregard for proven tools that protect those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Sponsored by Senator Andrew Gounardes, the bill passed Senate votes on June 12 and June 13, and cleared the Assembly on June 17. The measure extends and corrects school speed zone laws in New York City, repealing outdated provisions. Gounardes led the push, with strong support from most Senate Democrats and a split Assembly. The bill's technical fixes aim to keep protections in place for children and other vulnerable road users near schools.
