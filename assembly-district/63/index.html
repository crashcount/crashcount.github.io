He voted <strong>against a bill to bring speed cameras to school zones</strong> in Schenectady, a measure proven to slow drivers and protect children. He also voted <strong>against renewing New York City&rsquo;s own speed camera program</strong>, a tool that has cut speeding by more than 60% where installed. Streetsblog NYC <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>named him among the lawmakers who opposed the cameras</a>. The votes are public. The risk is real.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Most pedestrian injuries and deaths in AD 63 come from cars, SUVs, trucks, and buses.</strong> In the last three years, these vehicles killed 10 people and injured hundreds more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll. The streets are not safe for the old, the young, or anyone on foot.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-thoughts-and-prayers>Call to Action: Demand More Than Thoughts and Prayers</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Speed cameras save lives. Lower speed limits save lives. If your Assembly Member votes against these tools, call them. Demand action. Demand streets where you can cross without fear. <strong>Contact Sam Pirozzolo and tell him: Enough.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Senate passed the measure 38-21; three city senators—Stephen Chan, Andrew Lanza, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton—voted no. The Assembly passed it 110-31, with nine city lawmakers—Alec Brook-Krasny, Lester Chang, Simcha Eichenstein, Michael Novakhov, Stacey Pheffer Amato, Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Reilly, David Weprin, Kalman Yeger—opposing. The Streetsblog NYC article, 'Ye Shall Know Their Names! Meet the Dirty Dozen City Pols Who Voted Against Speed Camera Program,' quotes lawmakers dismissing speed cameras as revenue grabs or burdens. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action, so no direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists can be assessed.' Still, the votes signal disregard for proven tools that protect those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Mayor Eric Adams and Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch oversaw the event, where a Sanitation Department bulldozer crushed the vehicles. Adams said, 'New Yorkers have strong feelings about illegal mopeds and scooters, especially when they are driving the wrong way down streets or sidewalks or in the dark without lights.' The city links these vehicles to traffic violations and crimes, including robberies and reckless riding. Since Adams took office, police have removed about 62,000 illegal vehicles, aiming to reduce hazards for pedestrians. NYPD data shows a 57% drop in moped-related crime in 2025.

No criminal charges were filed at the time of reporting. An Amazon spokesperson called it a 'horrible tragedy' and said the company was cooperating with police. The article quotes a coworker: 'He was 34 years old. He had two daughters. He was killed on the job.'
