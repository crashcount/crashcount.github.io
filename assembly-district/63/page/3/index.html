The bodies are not abstractions. On May 17, 2025, police said Jose Luis Gomez-Guallazaca, 58, was crossing Targee Street when an e‑scooter struck him; he died at the hospital (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/bronx-man-killed-by-e-scooter-driver-05172025/>amNY</a>).</p><h3 id=where-the-street-bites-back>Where the street bites back</h3><p>Forest Avenue shows two deaths and dozens hurt.

Victory Boulevard and Richmond Avenue rack up injuries, month after month (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>At the hour of 10 PM, this district records four deaths; the 7 PM hour shows three. Daytime hurts too, but night takes its cut (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). “This morning is not just about crushing mopeds. It is about crushing the criminal activity and quality of life activities that come with them,” Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said at a Staten Island crackdown as officials destroyed unregistered mopeds and e‑bikes (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/super-smash-nyc-destroys-mopeds-e-bikes-as-mayor-celebrates-illegal-vehicle-crackdown>Gothamist</a>).</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The machines that kill</h3><p>In crashes hurting people on foot here, trucks and buses show up heavy: <strong>7 pedestrian deaths</strong> trace to them in the period covered (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Cars and SUVs still do the most harm by volume, but mass and height make big vehicles unforgiving. “Far too often, they are used to rob, to hit, and to run, to cause chaos on our streets and cheat the system,” Tisch said of illegal mopeds at that same event (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/super-smash-nyc-destroys-mopeds-e-bikes-as-mayor-celebrates-illegal-vehicle-crackdown>Gothamist</a>).</p><p>Disregarding signals shows up in deadly files here. So do left turns. The record lists a pedestrian killed at Forest and Bard after a driver went straight and struck them in the intersection; another died at Clove and Tioga with unsafe speed marked in the log (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-trend-isnt-easing>The trend isn’t easing</h3><p>This year to date, this district shows <strong>1,009 crashes, 5 deaths, 657 injuries</strong>.

That’s a jump of 24.6% in crashes and 150% in deaths year over year (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The map doesn’t lie. The clock doesn’t stop.</p><h3 id=who-stood-where-when-it-counted>Who stood where when it counted</h3><p>In June, the Legislature voted on S 8344 to extend and clean up New York City’s school‑zone speed rules. Assembly Member Sam Pirozzolo, who represents this district, voted no (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Open States</a>). Weeks later, a tally of city politicians who opposed renewing NYC’s speed‑camera program named him among the no votes (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>Streetsblog NYC</a>). Children still cross.</p><h3 id=fix-what-we-can-see>Fix what we can see</h3><p>Start where people die and where they get hit: Forest Avenue, Victory Boulevard, 546 Gulf Ave. Daylight the corners. Harden the turns. Give pedestrians a head start and protect them with concrete. Aim truck safety at warehouse zones and set strict backing controls. Focus night enforcement where the deaths cluster (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Citywide, two steps are on the table now. Lower the default speed so crashes are fewer and survivable. Fit cars driven by repeat speeders with devices that keep them within the limit, as outlined in the Stop Super Speeders push on our site’s <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a> page. These are not theories. They are tools.</p><p>The last entry in the ledger came last week. The next one doesn’t have to.</p><p>Take one step today.
