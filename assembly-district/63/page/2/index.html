When asked about illegal mopeds and scooters, the mayor <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/nyc-officials-destroy-illegal-mopeds-nypd-06132025/>said</a>, &ldquo;New Yorkers have strong feelings about illegal mopeds and scooters, because we hear it all the time, especially when they are driving the wrong way down streets or sidewalks or in the dark without lights.&rdquo; But in Albany, Pirozzolo&rsquo;s record is clear: he stands in the way of proven tools.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h3><p><strong>Every day without action is another day of risk.</strong> The dead cannot call their representatives.
