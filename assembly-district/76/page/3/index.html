She died there (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>On the FDR by E 70th, a Tesla flipped, burned, and threw both people out. The driver died. “At least 120, 130 [mph],” a witness said.

On the avenues, <strong><a href=#>2nd Avenue</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>1st Avenue</a></strong> rack up injuries. York Avenue shows two separate death entries in the state logs since 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Night brings more pain. The tall spikes come around 4–6 a.m., and again at the evening rush. Deaths peak at 4, 5, 6, 17, 18, and 21 hours on the clock in this district’s record (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>SUVs hit people hardest here. They are tied to the largest share of pedestrian deaths and serious injuries in the district’s rollup.

The data marks “other” factors most often, but the bodies are real: pedestrians killed at the crosswalk, at the corner, and mid‑block on York (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>A city bridge nearby finally split space for people on foot and on bikes.

One fix.</h3><ul><li>York at E 68th and York at E 72nd: Harden the turns. Daylight the corners. Give a leading pedestrian interval. Ticket U‑turns at the crosswalk.

Assembly Member Rebecca Seawright voted yes on a bill to keep protections in place near schools (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>S 8344</a>). She also co‑sponsors a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed‑limiting tech (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">A 2299</a>).</p><p>The city already has tools. Advocates won separate paths on the Queensboro. Cameras run around the clock near schools through 2030.
