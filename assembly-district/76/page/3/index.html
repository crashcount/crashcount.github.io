Nearly 200 injured.</strong> That is the toll in Assembly District 76 since last summer. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors. Frances Rickard, age 90, was crossing York Avenue at dusk. A yellow taxi made a U-turn and hit her. A second car struck her moments later. She died at the hospital. Both drivers stayed. No charges were filed. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/02/06/us-news/woman-90-fatally-struck-by-2-cars-including-yellow-taxi-in-nyc-cops/>Frances Rickard was crossing at York Avenue and East 72nd Street around 5:40 p.m. when the 68-year-old man driving the cab made a U-turn and hit her, authorities said. Moments later, a 35-year-old woman driving a 2023 Chevrolet Trailblazer also struck her, police said.</a></p><p>A day before, a Tesla flipped and burned on the FDR.

Most vehicles were cars, SUVs, or trucks. The old and the young are not spared. Two of the dead were over 75. One was just 30. The violence is steady. The pain is silent. The street does not care who you are.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—and What Hasn’t</h2><p>Assembly Member Rebecca Seawright has taken some steps. She co-sponsored bills to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting devices and to hold vehicle owners liable for dangerous driving. She voted to extend school speed zones and speed cameras. These are real actions. But she also backed bills that weaken bus lane rules, putting walkers and cyclists at risk. She called for more e-bike crackdowns after a high-profile injury, but the worst harm comes from cars and trucks. The laws keep shifting blame to the street’s most vulnerable.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Seawright. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people outside the car. Every day of delay is another life at risk. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
