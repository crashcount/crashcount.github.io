Another body in the road.</h1></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>AD 76: Jan 1, 2022 - Sep 4, 2025</h2><p>Just before dawn on Aug 30, a man crossing York Ave near E 72nd St was hit and killed around 5 AM. Police later arrested a driver in connection with the death of 36‑year‑old James Mossetty, an Upper East Side resident, after a crash that began in this area and continued onto the Queensboro Bridge, according to reporters’ summaries of police statements (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/driver-arrested-queensboro-bridge-crash-death-083032025/>AMNY</a>; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/09/01/man-dragged-killed-by-hit-run-nyc-suv-driver-year-after-escaping-correction-custody-james-mossetty/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>He is one of <strong>11 people killed</strong> on the streets of Assembly District 76 since Jan 1, 2022, alongside 987 injuries in 2,024 crashes logged in that span (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The pattern is not easing. <strong>Five people have been killed so far this year</strong>, compared with one at this point last year—a 400% jump by the city’s own crash records for this district (same source).</p><blockquote><p>“At least 120, 130 [mph]. At least. The damage was just so much that it split in half.” (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/04/woman-dies-in-fiery-tesla-crash-on-manhattans-fdr-drive/>NY Daily News</a>)</p></blockquote><p>That witness was talking about a fatal Tesla wreck on the FDR near E 70th St on Feb 4. It shut the highway and sent a passenger to the hospital. One woman died. Same district. Same road system.</p><h3 id=york-and-72nd-keeps-coming-up>York and 72nd keeps coming up</h3><p>This corner and the blocks around it are a drumbeat. On Feb 5, 90‑year‑old Frances Rickard was struck while crossing York Ave at E 72nd St and later died at the hospital, police told reporters (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/02/06/us-news/woman-90-fatally-struck-by-2-cars-including-yellow-taxi-in-nyc-cops/>New York Post</a>). Open data also logs a fatal crash at York and E 87th (Apr 2, 2024) and another at York and E 68th (Sep 21, 2023) where a turning driver hit a woman crossing with the signal (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The district’s worst corridor is <strong>FDR Drive</strong> by sheer harm: three deaths and 334 injuries since 2022. Two Avenue and 1 Avenue also show heavy tolls (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Records repeatedly cite driver inattention and failure to yield among contributing factors in these crashes (same source).</p><h3 id=the-danger-after-midnight>The danger after midnight</h3><p>Nights are hard here. From 4 AM to 6 AM alone, <strong>five people were killed</strong> in district crashes since 2022, according to the city’s hourly breakdown (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The latest death on York Ave came in that window.</p><h3 id=who-can-stop-the-next-one>Who can stop the next one</h3><p>Some tools exist. The city has extended 24‑hour school‑zone protections; state lawmakers passed technical fixes in June. Our Assembly Member <strong>Rebecca Seawright</strong> voted yes on that package, according to the record (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Open States: S 8344</a>).</p><p>Chronic speeders keep showing up in the files. Seawright is a co‑sponsor on bills to require <strong>intelligent speed assistance</strong> for drivers who rack up points or camera tickets (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">A 2299</a>; <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">A 7979</a>). Those devices cap a car’s speed to the limit plus a small margin. The Legislature can move them.</p><h3 id=fix-the-corners-where-people-die>Fix the corners where people die</h3><p>At York Ave and its cross streets, the files point to turning conflicts and visibility. <strong>Daylight the corners</strong> to clear sightlines. <strong>Add leading pedestrian intervals</strong> and <strong>hardened turns</strong> to slow drivers into the crosswalk. Target the <strong>late‑night hours</strong> for enforcement and calming on the FDR access routes. These are standard tools the city already uses; the data here says use them at the places that keep killing people (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Lower speeds save lives. Enforce limits on the worst drivers. If you want that work done, tell City Hall and Albany.
