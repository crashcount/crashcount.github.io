She voted yes to bring speed cameras to more school zones <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">A 7652</a>. These are steps in the right direction.

Years of crowding end. The bridge’s narrow lane forced conflict. Now, riders and pedestrians move apart. The city takes a lane from cars. The danger shrinks. The span breathes easier.</p><p class=mb3>amNY reported on May 13, 2025, that New York City will separate cyclists and pedestrians on the Ed Koch-Queensboro Bridge. Starting May 18, the north outer roadway becomes bike-only, while the south outer roadway, once for vehicles, opens to pedestrians. The article notes, “Advocates have fought to open a separate pedestrian path, citing dangerous overcrowding that has led to conflicts among cyclists, pedestrians and micromobility users.” The bridge was the last city-owned East River crossing without split paths. Manhattan Community Board 6 urged the city to act, pressing DOT to open the path despite construction delays. The change doubles space for non-drivers and removes a vehicle lane, addressing years of systemic risk from forced mixing of vulnerable users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
