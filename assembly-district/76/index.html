Another body in the road.</h1></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>AD 76: Jan 1, 2022 - Sep 4, 2025</h2><p>Just before dawn on Aug 30, a man crossing York Ave near E 72nd St was hit and killed around 5 AM. Police later arrested a driver in connection with the death of 36‑year‑old James Mossetty, an Upper East Side resident, after a crash that began in this area and continued onto the Queensboro Bridge, according to reporters’ summaries of police statements (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/driver-arrested-queensboro-bridge-crash-death-083032025/>AMNY</a>; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/09/01/man-dragged-killed-by-hit-run-nyc-suv-driver-year-after-escaping-correction-custody-james-mossetty/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>He is one of <strong>11 people killed</strong> on the streets of Assembly District 76 since Jan 1, 2022, alongside 987 injuries in 2,024 crashes logged in that span (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The pattern is not easing. <strong>Five people have been killed so far this year</strong>, compared with one at this point last year—a 400% jump by the city’s own crash records for this district (same source).</p><blockquote><p>“At least 120, 130 [mph]. At least. The damage was just so much that it split in half.” (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/04/woman-dies-in-fiery-tesla-crash-on-manhattans-fdr-drive/>NY Daily News</a>)</p></blockquote><p>That witness was talking about a fatal Tesla wreck on the FDR near E 70th St on Feb 4. It shut the highway and sent a passenger to the hospital. One woman died. Same district. Same road system.</p><h3 id=york-and-72nd-keeps-coming-up>York and 72nd keeps coming up</h3><p>This corner and the blocks around it are a drumbeat. On Feb 5, 90‑year‑old Frances Rickard was struck while crossing York Ave at E 72nd St and later died at the hospital, police told reporters (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/02/06/us-news/woman-90-fatally-struck-by-2-cars-including-yellow-taxi-in-nyc-cops/>New York Post</a>). Open data also logs a fatal crash at York and E 87th (Apr 2, 2024) and another at York and E 68th (Sep 21, 2023) where a turning driver hit a woman crossing with the signal (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The district’s worst corridor is <strong>FDR Drive</strong> by sheer harm: three deaths and 334 injuries since 2022. Two Avenue and 1 Avenue also show heavy tolls (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Records repeatedly cite driver inattention and failure to yield among contributing factors in these crashes (same source).</p><h3 id=the-danger-after-midnight>The danger after midnight</h3><p>Nights are hard here. From 4 AM to 6 AM alone, <strong>five people were killed</strong> in district crashes since 2022, according to the city’s hourly breakdown (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The latest death on York Ave came in that window.</p><h3 id=who-can-stop-the-next-one>Who can stop the next one</h3><p>Some tools exist. The city has extended 24‑hour school‑zone protections; state lawmakers passed technical fixes in June. Our Assembly Member <strong>Rebecca Seawright</strong> voted yes on that package, according to the record (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Open States: S 8344</a>).</p><p>Chronic speeders keep showing up in the files. Seawright is a co‑sponsor on bills to require <strong>intelligent speed assistance</strong> for drivers who rack up points or camera tickets (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">A 2299</a>; <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">A 7979</a>). Those devices cap a car’s speed to the limit plus a small margin. The Legislature can move them.</p><h3 id=fix-the-corners-where-people-die>Fix the corners where people die</h3><p>At York Ave and its cross streets, the files point to turning conflicts and visibility. <strong>Daylight the corners</strong> to clear sightlines. <strong>Add leading pedestrian intervals</strong> and <strong>hardened turns</strong> to slow drivers into the crosswalk. Target the <strong>late‑night hours</strong> for enforcement and calming on the FDR access routes. These are standard tools the city already uses; the data here says use them at the places that keep killing people (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Lower speeds save lives. Enforce limits on the worst drivers. If you want that work done, tell City Hall and Albany.

School speed zone rules in New York City get extended. Lawmakers make technical fixes. The bill keeps pressure on drivers near schools. Streets stay a little safer for kids.</p><p class=mb3>Bill S 8344, titled 'Extends provisions and makes technical corrections to school speed zones in NYC; repealer,' moved through the Senate and Assembly in June 2025. Sponsored by Senator Andrew Gounardes, the bill passed Senate votes on June 12 and June 13, and cleared the Assembly on June 17. The measure extends and corrects school speed zone laws in New York City, repealing outdated provisions. Gounardes led the push, with strong support from most Senate Democrats and a split Assembly. The bill's technical fixes aim to keep protections in place for children and other vulnerable road users near schools.

Starting May 18, the north outer roadway becomes bike-only, while the south outer roadway, once for vehicles, opens to pedestrians. The article notes, “Advocates have fought to open a separate pedestrian path, citing dangerous overcrowding that has led to conflicts among cyclists, pedestrians and micromobility users.” The bridge was the last city-owned East River crossing without split paths. Manhattan Community Board 6 urged the city to act, pressing DOT to open the path despite construction delays. The change doubles space for non-drivers and removes a vehicle lane, addressing years of systemic risk from forced mixing of vulnerable users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

City leaders promised a summer crackdown on illegal vehicles.</p><p class=mb3>On June 5, 2024, Assemblywoman Rebecca Seawright (District 76) called for increased regulation and enforcement of e-bikes and mopeds after Rabbi Michael Miller was hit and injured by a hit-and-run e-bike driver on Third Avenue. The incident sparked public outcry. Seawright visited Miller and advocated for a legislative package to increase penalties for leaving crash scenes and to require registration, inspection, insurance, and license plates for e-bikes. The matter summary states: 'No New Yorker should have to fear suffering collisions while walking in their own neighborhood from the epidemic of e-vehicles causing horrible injuries and even fatalities.' Mayor Eric Adams and the NYPD announced a summer enforcement blitz to seize illegal, unregistered vehicles. Seawright’s push centers on holding reckless drivers accountable and removing dangerous, unlicensed vehicles from city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
