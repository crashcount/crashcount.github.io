A yellow taxi made a U-turn and hit her. Seconds later, an SUV struck her again. She died at the hospital. Both drivers stayed. No charges. The street was cleared. Her name was Frances Rickard. She lived on the Upper West Side. She did not make it home. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/02/06/us-news/woman-90-fatally-struck-by-2-cars-including-yellow-taxi-in-nyc-cops/>Frances Rickard was crossing at York Avenue and East 72nd Street around 5:40 p.m. when the 68-year-old man driving the cab made a U-turn and hit her, authorities said.</a></p><p>A day earlier, a Tesla tore down the FDR. It flipped. It burned. The driver died. A witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/04/woman-dies-in-fiery-tesla-crash-on-manhattans-fdr-drive/>described the speed and destruction</a>: &ldquo;At least 120, 130 [mph]. At least. The damage was just so much that it split in half. And that just started going on fire.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h2><p><strong>In the last year, 3 people died and 250 were injured in crashes in AD 76.</strong> Five suffered serious injuries. The dead are mostly the old and the vulnerable. Two were over 75. One was a woman in her thirties. Most were pedestrians. The machines that killed: SUVs, taxis, trucks, sedans. The numbers do not show the faces. But they do not let you look away.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h2><p>Assembly Member Rebecca Seawright has signed on to bills that could help. She co-sponsored a law to force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed-limiting tech <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">A 7979</a>. She voted yes to bring speed cameras to more school zones <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">A 7652</a>. These are steps in the right direction. But she also backs bills that shift the burden to cyclists and e-scooter riders, demanding licenses and insurance for the smallest vehicles <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A116&amp;term=2025">A 116</a>. These laws do not stop the SUVs and trucks that kill. They do not slow the traffic. They do not protect the old woman crossing the street.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Streets can be made safe. Speed can be tamed. Cameras can stay on. But only if you demand it. Call your council member. Call Seawright. Tell them: Lower the speed limit. Keep the cameras. Build streets for people, not cars. Do not wait for another name in the news. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill sits in the Assembly, awaiting committee action. Its summary reads: 'Requires the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices if a driver accumulates eleven or more points on their driving record during an eighteen month period, or receives 6 speed camera or red light camera tickets during a twelve month period.' The primary sponsor is Emily Gallagher (District 50), joined by co-sponsors Rebecca Seawright, Andrew Hevesi, Tony Simone, Jo Anne Simon, Patricia Fahy, Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, MaryJane Shimsky, Yudelka Tapia, Steven Raga, Anna Kelles, Robert C. Carroll, and Sarahana Shrestha. The bill cracks down on repeat offenders, forcing them to install technology that blocks speeding. No safety analyst note is available, but the bill’s intent is clear: rein in drivers who endanger others again and again.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
