No answers. Just another family left waiting for a call that will never come.</p><p>A few blocks away, a van turns right at Kingsbridge and University. A 65-year-old man is crossing with the signal. He does not make it to the other side. The city records another death. The street stays the same.</p><p><strong>In the last twelve months, 471 people were hurt in 735 crashes here.

In three and a half years, <strong>nine people have died</strong> and <strong>over 1,500 have been injured</strong> on these streets. Cars and SUVs did most of the killing.

He backed <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">A 1077</a>, a bill for streets built for people, not just cars. He voted yes on <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">school speed cameras</a>.</p><p>But the blood keeps coming. The bills sit.
