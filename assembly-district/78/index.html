Demand Action Now.</h1><p class="byline f6 silver">Written June 17, 2025 <em>(Revised June 28, 2025 – Minor stats refresh)</em></p></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>AD 78: Jan 1, 2022 - Jun 28, 2025</h2><h2 id=the-numbers-dont-lie>The Numbers Don’t Lie</h2><p>In Assembly District 78, the street is a wound that never closes. Nine people have died since 2022. Twenty people suffered injuries so severe they changed lives. In the last year alone, 484 neighbors were hurt, five of them gravely. The dead include a 65-year-old man crushed by a van while crossing with the light, and a 15-year-old girl ejected from a moped, her life ended on University Avenue. The numbers are not just numbers. They are fathers, daughters, elders, children.</p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>A man lay dying on the Major Deegan Expressway. The driver who hit him ran. Police said, <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/police-looking-for-suspect-in-fatal-hit-and-run-on-major-deegan-expressway-nypd-says>they were looking for a man who ran away after crashing his car.</a> No arrest. No answers. Only another family left with silence.</p><p>On Southern Boulevard, two drivers turned the street into a shooting gallery. A deli worker watched the chaos and said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/01/dueling-drivers-exchange-gunfire-near-bronx-zoo-wounded-man-calls-cab-to-hospital-later-dies/>&ldquo;It was like a movie.&rdquo;</a> But there was no hero. Only gunfire, a crash, and a body in the street.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h2><p>Assembly Member George Alvarez has signed on to bills that could help. He co-sponsored a law to force speed limiters on repeat dangerous drivers—those who rack up tickets or points (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">A 2299</a>). He backed a &ldquo;complete streets&rdquo; bill to make roads safer for everyone (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">A 1077</a>). He voted yes on speed cameras near schools (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">A 7652</a>).</p><p>But the blood on the street says it is not enough. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not. Cameras catch speeders, but only if Albany keeps them turned on. Each delay is another risk, another name for the list.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p>Call George Alvarez. Call the Mayor. Call the DOT. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets built for people, not just cars. The dead cannot speak. The living must.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Adriano Espaillat quietly lobbied Bronx officials against proposed Fordham Road bus lane upgrades. The project, under city review since 2022, aimed to speed up buses for 85,000 daily riders by installing dedicated busways or offset lanes. According to Streetsblog, Espaillat leaned on younger electeds to align with Council Member Oswald Feliz, a vocal critic. 'He defers to the local elected officials, and all of them seem to be in agreement,' said Espaillat’s chief of staff, Aneiry Batista. Lawmakers who once supported the upgrades grew silent or opposed them after Espaillat’s intervention. The Department of Transportation, MTA, and governor’s office met with Espaillat to discuss the project, but delays persisted. The opposition from Feliz and business groups led DOT to scrap the most ambitious safety options. Riders, many without cars, remain exposed to slow, hazardous conditions as cars block bus lanes and traffic crawls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
