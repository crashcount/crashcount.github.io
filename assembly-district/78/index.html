Unsafe speed is there too.</p><h3 id=what-alvarez-did--and-didnt>What Alvarez did — and didn’t</h3><p>Assembly Member <strong>George Alvarez</strong> voted yes to expand school speed cameras, multiple times (<strong>S 5677</strong>, <strong>S 7678</strong>) and missed a committee vote on a school speed‑zone fix (<strong>S 8344</strong>) but it passed. He <strong>co‑sponsored A 1077</strong> (complete streets) and <strong>A 2299</strong> to force speed limiters on repeat offenders.</p><p>He also voted yes on <strong>S 7785</strong> and <strong>S 6815</strong>, bills that <strong>weaken or carve out bus‑lane rules</strong>.
