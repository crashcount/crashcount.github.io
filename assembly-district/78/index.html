No answers. Just another family left waiting for a call that will never come.</p><p>A few blocks away, a van turns right at Kingsbridge and University. A 65-year-old man is crossing with the signal. He does not make it to the other side. The city records another death. The street stays the same.</p><p><strong>In the last twelve months, 471 people were hurt in 735 crashes here.

In three and a half years, <strong>nine people have died</strong> and <strong>over 1,500 have been injured</strong> on these streets. Cars and SUVs did most of the killing.

He backed <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">A 1077</a>, a bill for streets built for people, not just cars. He voted yes on <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">school speed cameras</a>.</p><p>But the blood keeps coming. The bills sit.

Tell him to fight for speed limiters, for complete streets, for real enforcement against reckless drivers—not just more tickets for cyclists and walkers. Demand action. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Adriano Espaillat quietly lobbied Bronx officials against proposed Fordham Road bus lane upgrades. The project, under city review since 2022, aimed to speed up buses for 85,000 daily riders by installing dedicated busways or offset lanes. According to Streetsblog, Espaillat leaned on younger electeds to align with Council Member Oswald Feliz, a vocal critic. 'He defers to the local elected officials, and all of them seem to be in agreement,' said Espaillat’s chief of staff, Aneiry Batista. Lawmakers who once supported the upgrades grew silent or opposed them after Espaillat’s intervention. The Department of Transportation, MTA, and governor’s office met with Espaillat to discuss the project, but delays persisted. The opposition from Feliz and business groups led DOT to scrap the most ambitious safety options. Riders, many without cars, remain exposed to slow, hazardous conditions as cars block bus lanes and traffic crawls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
