The cyclist, a 41-year-old man, was ejected from his bike and suffered severe facial lacerations. He remained conscious at the scene. The narrative describes the impact: 'Metal struck flesh. He flew, helmetless. His face hit pavement. Blood pooled.' The police report notes the cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this is mentioned only after the primary driver error. The crash underscores the danger posed by inattentive drivers making turns across the paths of vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

A moped, operated by an unlicensed and helmetless 41-year-old man, overturned and left its rider ejected and crushed, suffering injuries to his entire body but remaining conscious in the aftermath. The report states that 'Unsafe Speed' was a contributing factor. One sedan, an Audi driven by an unlicensed man, was engaged in a police pursuit and fled the scene. The violence of the crash is underscored by the report’s vivid description: 'Metal screamed. Glass rained.' The moped’s lack of safety equipment is noted in the data, but the central danger stemmed from driver actions—specifically, unsafe speed and a police pursuit. No evidence in the report attributes fault to the moped rider’s behavior beyond these systemic and driver errors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
