He also co-sponsored a bill for safer street designs (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">File A 1077</a>). But he backed bills to weaken bus rules (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>File S 8344</a>) and add red tape for e-scooter riders (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A8079&amp;term=2023">File A 8079</a>), shifting the burden to those already at risk. He stood up for a campaign donor seeking exemption from anti-idling laws (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/05/30/bronx-pol-wants-city-to-exempt-campaign-donor-from-idling-law>sought exemption</a>), even as children and the elderly breathe the air.</p><p>The work is not done. <strong>Every day without a citywide 20 mph speed limit, another life is at risk.</strong></p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p><strong>Call Benedetto. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit, more speed cameras, and street designs that protect the most vulnerable.</strong> The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice.

DJ Transportation owes $65,000 for idling. Advocates say fumes harm neighborhoods. The company refuses to electrify. Disabled riders are used as a shield. Health loses. Industry wins.</p><p class=mb3>On May 30, 2024, Bronx Assembly Member Michael Benedetto testified in support of exempting DJ Transportation from New York City’s anti-idling law. The matter, heard by city officials, centered on whether companies serving students with disabilities should avoid fines for running engines. Benedetto argued, "I believe DJ Ambulette should be ... given a variance to let them have their buses idle to properly maintain their temperature on their buses." DJ Transportation, a campaign donor, owes over $65,000 in unpaid fines and has not committed to electrifying its fleet. Benedetto denied any influence from donations. The Department of Environmental Protection and advocates rejected claims that idling is needed for temperature control, citing community health risks. Critics condemned the use of disabled clients as justification for continued pollution. No safety analyst assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
