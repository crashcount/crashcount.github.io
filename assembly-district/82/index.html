Paramedics checked her body. The sound of the crash still hung in the air. &ldquo;It was a terrible sound &ndash; it was a terrible incident that happened,&rdquo; a neighbor <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/op-city-crash-multiple-people-injured-including-1-critically-bronx/17075710/>said after the three-car pileup in Co-op City</a>. She did not get up. She died at 71. Six others were hurt. The driver was 79. The street was Bartow Avenue. The date was July 11, 2025. The next day, the news <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/71-year-old-passenger-killed-in-co-op-city-crash/>reported a passenger dead after a car slammed into two others and a pole</a>.</p><p>This is not rare. In the last year, <strong>five people died</strong> in crashes in AD 82. <strong>655 were injured</strong>. <strong>Seven were left with serious, life-changing wounds</strong>. Children, elders, men, women. The numbers do not stop. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-no-end-in-sight>The Pattern: No End in Sight</h3><p>The streets do not forgive. In June, a scooter crash on the Hutchinson River Parkway left an 18-year-old woman fighting for her life. The driver fled. She was left on the asphalt, alone. &ldquo;One lady was out on the ground. They was giving her medical attention, checking her body. She was laid out,&rdquo; a witness <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/op-city-crash-multiple-people-injured-including-1-critically-bronx/17075710/>said at the scene</a>.</p><p>In the last twelve months, the district saw <strong>923 crashes</strong>.

They are the people who walk, ride, and drive these streets.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h3><p>Assembly Member Michael Benedetto <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted to keep speed cameras near schools and extend enforcement</a>. He co-sponsored a bill to make streets safer for all users. He also backed a bill to require e-scooter licenses and insurance—a move that burdens riders, not drivers. He <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/05/30/bronx-pol-wants-city-to-exempt-campaign-donor-from-idling-law>supported an exemption for a campaign donor to keep polluting buses idling in the Bronx</a>. Some votes help. Some votes hurt. The record is mixed. The streets are not safe.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a failure. The city has the power to lower speed limits. The state can rein in repeat speeders. The Assembly Member can lead or stand aside. <strong>Call Michael Benedetto. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat offenders. Demand streets where no one is left bleeding on the asphalt.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The point of impact was the taxi's left front bumper and the moped's center front end. The 21-year-old moped rider, unlicensed and not wearing a helmet, was ejected and sustained a severe head injury with significant bleeding. The report identifies 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Unsafe Speed' as contributing factors to the crash. The taxi driver was licensed and operating the vehicle during the turn. The moped rider's unlicensed status and lack of helmet are noted but secondary to the primary driver errors. This collision underscores the dangers posed by distracted driving and unsafe speeds, especially to vulnerable road users in the Bronx.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The matter, heard by city officials, centered on whether companies serving students with disabilities should avoid fines for running engines. Benedetto argued, "I believe DJ Ambulette should be ... given a variance to let them have their buses idle to properly maintain their temperature on their buses." DJ Transportation, a campaign donor, owes over $65,000 in unpaid fines and has not committed to electrifying its fleet. Benedetto denied any influence from donations. The Department of Environmental Protection and advocates rejected claims that idling is needed for temperature control, citing community health risks. Critics condemned the use of disabled clients as justification for continued pollution. No safety analyst assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The collision occurred as the taxi was traveling straight ahead and hit the pedestrian head-on, causing severe bleeding from her head. The report notes the cab’s front end was crumpled and its tinted windows obscured the driver’s face. According to the police report, 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' and 'Tinted Windows' were listed as contributing factors. The pedestrian was crossing against the signal and was not at an intersection, as documented in the report, but the presence of tinted windows is also cited as a factor. The focus remains on the driver’s visibility and the systemic risks posed by vehicle design and street conditions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
