The matter, heard by city officials, centered on whether companies serving students with disabilities should avoid fines for running engines. Benedetto argued, "I believe DJ Ambulette should be ... given a variance to let them have their buses idle to properly maintain their temperature on their buses." DJ Transportation, a campaign donor, owes over $65,000 in unpaid fines and has not committed to electrifying its fleet. Benedetto denied any influence from donations. The Department of Environmental Protection and advocates rejected claims that idling is needed for temperature control, citing community health risks. Critics condemned the use of disabled clients as justification for continued pollution.
