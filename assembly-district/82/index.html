He also co-sponsored a bill for safer street designs (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">File A 1077</a>). But he backed bills to weaken bus rules (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>File S 8344</a>) and add red tape for e-scooter riders (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A8079&amp;term=2023">File A 8079</a>), shifting the burden to those already at risk. He stood up for a campaign donor seeking exemption from anti-idling laws (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/05/30/bronx-pol-wants-city-to-exempt-campaign-donor-from-idling-law>sought exemption</a>), even as children and the elderly breathe the air.</p><p>The work is not done. <strong>Every day without a citywide 20 mph speed limit, another life is at risk.</strong></p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p><strong>Call Benedetto.
