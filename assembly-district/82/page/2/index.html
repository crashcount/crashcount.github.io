He also co-sponsored a bill for safer street designs (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">File A 1077</a>). But he backed bills to weaken bus rules (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>File S 8344</a>) and add red tape for e-scooter riders (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A8079&amp;term=2023">File A 8079</a>), shifting the burden to those already at risk. He stood up for a campaign donor seeking exemption from anti-idling laws (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/05/30/bronx-pol-wants-city-to-exempt-campaign-donor-from-idling-law>sought exemption</a>), even as children and the elderly breathe the air.</p><p>The work is not done. <strong>Every day without a citywide 20 mph speed limit, another life is at risk.</strong></p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p><strong>Call Benedetto. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit, more speed cameras, and street designs that protect the most vulnerable.</strong> The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice.

The collision occurred as the taxi was traveling straight ahead and hit the pedestrian head-on, causing severe bleeding from her head.

According to the police report, 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' and 'Tinted Windows' were listed as contributing factors. The pedestrian was crossing against the signal and was not at an intersection, as documented in the report, but the presence of tinted windows is also cited as a factor. The focus remains on the driver’s visibility and the systemic risks posed by vehicle design and street conditions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The crash occurred at 2:00 PM, with both vehicles traveling southeast. The police report cites 'Tire Failure/Inadequate' and 'Following Too Closely' as contributing factors. The motorcyclist, operating a 2004 Suzuki, was partially ejected from his bike and suffered severe lacerations to his legs. The narrative states, 'A tire gave out. He flew partway off. Legs torn. Awake. Bleeding.' The report further notes the rider wore no protective gear. Driver actions—specifically following too closely—are listed as primary causes. The pickup truck sustained damage to its left rear bumper, while the motorcycle’s front end was crushed. The crash left the young rider conscious but gravely injured, underscoring the lethal consequences of driver error and mechanical failure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
