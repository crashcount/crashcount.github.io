Industry wins.</p><p class=mb3>On May 30, 2024, Bronx Assembly Member Michael Benedetto testified in support of exempting DJ Transportation from New York City’s anti-idling law. The matter, heard by city officials, centered on whether companies serving students with disabilities should avoid fines for running engines. Benedetto argued, "I believe DJ Ambulette should be ... given a variance to let them have their buses idle to properly maintain their temperature on their buses." DJ Transportation, a campaign donor, owes over $65,000 in unpaid fines and has not committed to electrifying its fleet. Benedetto denied any influence from donations. The Department of Environmental Protection and advocates rejected claims that idling is needed for temperature control, citing community health risks. Critics condemned the use of disabled clients as justification for continued pollution. No safety analyst assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The collision occurred as the taxi was traveling straight ahead and hit the pedestrian head-on, causing severe bleeding from her head. The report notes the cab’s front end was crumpled and its tinted windows obscured the driver’s face. According to the police report, 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' and 'Tinted Windows' were listed as contributing factors. The pedestrian was crossing against the signal and was not at an intersection, as documented in the report, but the presence of tinted windows is also cited as a factor. The focus remains on the driver’s visibility and the systemic risks posed by vehicle design and street conditions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
