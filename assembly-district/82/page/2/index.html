Five people have died in crashes here in the last year. Six hundred fifty-five more were injured. Seven suffered wounds so deep they will never be the same. The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie.</p><p>Just days ago, a 71-year-old woman died in Co-op City. A 79-year-old driver crashed into two cars and a pole. &ldquo;I saw one lady was out on the ground. They was giving her medical attention, checking her body. She was laid out,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/op-city-crash-multiple-people-injured-including-1-critically-bronx/17075710/>said Samuel Cherry</a>. Seven others were hurt.

No one was arrested. The dead woman’s name was Stella Nyarko-Dei.</p><p>A week before, an 18-year-old woman was thrown from a moped on the Hutchinson River Parkway. The driver sped off. She was left fighting for her life. &ldquo;The Honda Pilot then collided with the Razor Scooter, causing the 24-year-old man operating the scooter and an 18-year-old woman to be ejected,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/hutchinson-river-parkway-accident-bronx-involving-moped-driver-injures-7/16808062/>reported ABC7</a>. Six others were sent to the hospital.</p><h2 id=benedetto-votes-silence-and-the-cost-of-delay>Benedetto: Votes, Silence, and the Cost of Delay</h2><p>Assembly Member Michael Benedetto has voted to extend school speed zones and expand speed cameras, moves that help protect children and walkers. He co-sponsored a bill to <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">require safer street designs</a> for all users. But he also backed <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A8079&amp;term=2023">bills that weaken bus rules</a>, putting pedestrians and cyclists at greater risk. He supported a donor’s <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/05/30/bronx-pol-wants-city-to-exempt-campaign-donor-from-idling-law>bid to keep polluting buses idling</a> in the Bronx, against the advice of health advocates. Each vote has a cost. Each delay means another family waits for the call that never should come.</p><h2 id=the-road-ahead-no-more-waiting>The Road Ahead: No More Waiting</h2><p>This is not fate. These are not accidents. Every crash is a policy failure. Every injury is a warning. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. The state can pass laws to stop repeat speeders. Residents can demand more from leaders who claim to care.</p><p>Call Assembly Member Benedetto. Call your council member. Demand safer speeds, stronger enforcement, and streets built for people, not just cars.</p><p>Do not wait for the next siren.

The crash occurred at 2:00 PM, with both vehicles traveling southeast. The police report cites 'Tire Failure/Inadequate' and 'Following Too Closely' as contributing factors. The motorcyclist, operating a 2004 Suzuki, was partially ejected from his bike and suffered severe lacerations to his legs. The narrative states, 'A tire gave out. He flew partway off. Legs torn. Awake. Bleeding.' The report further notes the rider wore no protective gear. Driver actions—specifically following too closely—are listed as primary causes. The pickup truck sustained damage to its left rear bumper, while the motorcycle’s front end was crushed.
