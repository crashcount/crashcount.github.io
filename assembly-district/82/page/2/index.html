In the last twelve months, four people died on the streets of Assembly District 82. Five hundred seventy-six were injured. Six were left with wounds so deep they will not heal. The dead include a 13-year-old boy thrown from a motorcycle, a 66-year-old man crushed on the Hutchinson River Parkway, a 64-year-old cyclist struck down on Williamsbridge Road, and a Navy veteran shot after a minor crash.
