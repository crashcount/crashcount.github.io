The report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Following Too Closely' as contributing factors. The narrative states, 'Distraction and speed closed the gap too late.'

The crash occurred at 2:00 PM, with both vehicles traveling southeast. The police report cites 'Tire Failure/Inadequate' and 'Following Too Closely' as contributing factors. The motorcyclist, operating a 2004 Suzuki, was partially ejected from his bike and suffered severe lacerations to his legs. The narrative states, 'A tire gave out. He flew partway off. Legs torn.

The pickup truck sustained damage to its left rear bumper, while the motorcycle’s front end was crushed.

The other driver, a 20-year-old man, was unlicensed. No other injuries were specified. The report lists no explicit driver errors beyond the unlicensed operation.
