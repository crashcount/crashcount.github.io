A 21-year-old and a 13-year-old, both thrown from a motorcycle just before 1 a.m. Police listed “Unsafe Speed.” No helmets. No second chances. The city logged it as <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4747427</a>.</p><p>A month later, Co-op City woke to sirens. A Toyota hit two cars and a pole on Bartow Avenue. The 71-year-old passenger, Stella Nyarko-Dei, died at Jacobi. “I saw one lady was out on the ground,” a witness said. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/op-city-crash-multiple-people-injured-including-1-critically-bronx/17075710/>“They was giving her medical attention.”</a> Police said the 79-year-old driver stayed at the scene; “The cause of the crash was not immediately known.” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/13/multi-car-crash-in-the-bronx-kills-71-year-old-woman-injures-seven-others/>No arrests</a>.</p><p>On the Hutchinson River Parkway before dawn, a scooter rider and his passenger were thrown to the pavement after a chain reaction near Throggs Neck. Seven people were hurt. The teen passenger was critical. “The moped’s driver fled with the bike,” police told the press. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/hutchinson-river-parkway-accident-bronx-involving-moped-driver-injures-7/16808062/>ABC7</a> and the <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/21/us-news/scooter-passenger-clinging-to-life-after-nyc-crash/>Post</a> reported the details.</p><p>Crashes do not stop. They stack.</p><h3 id=parkways-and-expressways-lead-the-toll>Parkways and expressways lead the toll</h3><p>The deadliest spots in AD 82 run on concrete rivers. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Hutchinson River Parkway</a> leads with the most deaths and injuries among local hotspots. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Bruckner Expressway</a> follows. A pedestrian was killed on the Hutch last year, “Crossing, No Signal, or Crosswalk,” struck by northbound traffic. The record shows “Crush Injuries.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4752748</a>.</p><p>Multi-car pileups on the Hutch have killed and maimed. In one December wreck, an adult woman died and a 14-year-old was injured amid a chain of sedans, SUVs, a taxi, and pickups. The log lists “Pavement Slippery.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4780490</a>.</p><p>On the Bruckner at Pelham Parkway, a 31-year-old motorcyclist died after colliding with a turning SUV. The city marked “Passing or Lane Usage Improper.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4824000</a>.</p><h3 id=nights-are-violent>Nights are violent</h3><p>The hours tell their own story. Injuries spike around midnight and again before dawn. The district saw multiple deaths between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., with heavy injury counts at midnight, 1 a.m., 2 a.m., and 4 a.m. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City data</a> shows late-night harm that won’t let up.</p><p>Pedestrians take the hit. Since 2022, three pedestrians have been killed here; 273 were injured. SUVs and sedans dominate those strikes. Trucks killed too. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>Mode split</a> shows where the force lands.</p><h3 id=the-causes-we-can-name>The causes we can name</h3><p>“Unsafe Speed” is stamped on the Co-op City motorcycle double fatal. “Pavement Slippery” on the Hutch multi-car death. “Passing or Lane Usage Improper” at the Bruckner–Pelham Parkway crash. Across the district, “other” factors lead the harm ledger with 3 deaths and 428 injuries; distraction and inexperience show up in the body counts too. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Vehicles/bm4k-52h4>Local rollups</a> confirm the mix.</p><p>Over the last 12 months, AD 82 logged 1,072 crashes, 4 deaths, and 759 injuries. This year to date, crashes are up roughly half over last year’s pace; injuries are up too. The losses aren’t abstract. They have times, places, names. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>District stats</a>.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-did--and-didnt>What leaders did — and didn’t</h3><p>Albany kept the school‑zone cameras running citywide through 2030. The Legislature passed the fix‑it bill, and local members voted yes. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>S 8344</a>. That helps. The parkways at 4 a.m. still bleed.</p><p>Some pushed in the wrong direction. A Bronx Assembly Member backed a donor’s bid to dodge idling penalties despite unpaid fines. “I believe DJ Ambulette should be … given a variance,” he said. The agency and advocates said no. The fines remain. The fumes remain too. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/05/30/bronx-pol-wants-city-to-exempt-campaign-donor-from-idling-law>Streetsblog</a>.</p><h3 id=slow-the-cars-stop-the-repeat-offenders>Slow the cars. Stop the repeat offenders.</h3><p>Lower speeds save lives. Albany handed NYC the power to set its own limits. The city can choose 20 on local streets. The law has a name. It is already on the books. Use it. Our own <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action page</a> lays out who to call.</p><p>The worst drivers do the worst harm. A tiny share racks up camera tickets and kills at far higher rates. Speed‑limiting tech can cap their cars to the limit. Advocates call it the Stop Super Speeders Act. See how to press your lawmakers on our <a href=../../take_action/>action guide</a>.</p><p>One more night like 4 a.m. on the Hutch is one too many.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The collision occurred as the taxi was traveling straight ahead and hit the pedestrian head-on, causing severe bleeding from her head.

According to the police report, 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' and 'Tinted Windows' were listed as contributing factors. The pedestrian was crossing against the signal and was not at an intersection, as documented in the report, but the presence of tinted windows is also cited as a factor. The focus remains on the driver’s visibility and the systemic risks posed by vehicle design and street conditions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The crash occurred at 2:00 PM, with both vehicles traveling southeast. The police report cites 'Tire Failure/Inadequate' and 'Following Too Closely' as contributing factors.
