In the last twelve months alone, five families lost someone forever. <strong>Children, elders, and working people—no one is spared.</strong></p><p>Just last week, a 71-year-old woman was killed in Co-op City. A 79-year-old driver crashed into two cars and a pole. &ldquo;I saw one lady was out on the ground. They was giving her medical attention, checking her body. She was laid out,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/op-city-crash-multiple-people-injured-including-1-critically-bronx/17075710/>said a witness</a>. Seven others were hurt. The street was quiet after, except for the sirens.</p><p>A month before, an 18-year-old woman was thrown from a moped on the Hutchinson River Parkway. The driver sped away. She was left fighting for her life. &ldquo;Police said the moped driver sped away from the 3:45 a.m. crash&mldr; leaving the young woman to die on the road,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/21/woman-passenger-18-clings-to-life-after-falling-off-moped-in-bronx-crash-driver-speeds-off/>reported the Daily News</a>.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Most deaths come at the hands of cars and SUVs.</strong> Of the pedestrian injuries and deaths, sedans and SUVs account for the largest share. Trucks, motorcycles, and mopeds add to the toll. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not. In the last year, children under 18 were hurt in 45 crashes. Elders over 65 were struck 61 times. Each number is a name, a family, a future cut short.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn&rsquo;t</h2><p>Assembly Member Michael Benedetto has voted to extend school speed zones and expand speed cameras—steps that protect children on their way to class. He co-sponsored bills for safer street designs and &ldquo;complete streets&rdquo; for all users. But Benedetto also <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/05/30/bronx-pol-wants-city-to-exempt-campaign-donor-from-idling-law>backed measures to weaken bus rules</a> and exempt some drivers from bus lane enforcement, moves that put pedestrians and cyclists at risk. He <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A8079&amp;term=2023">supported a bill to require e-scooter licenses and insurance</a>, a burden that falls hardest on the most vulnerable.</p><p><strong>The work is not finished.</strong> Every delay, every loophole, every carve-out for drivers means another family waits for the call no one wants.</p><h2 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Assembly Member Benedetto. Demand a 20 mph speed limit on every street. Demand real protection for people walking and biking. Tell him: No more half-measures. No more excuses. The blood on the street is not an accident.
