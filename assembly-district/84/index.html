One morning. One Mustang. On July 3, a driver in Melrose slammed through a crosswalk at East 149th and Courtlandt, then mounted the curb and crashed into scaffolding. The driver and passenger ran. The victims were left on the ground, crying out. “People were yelling, were in pain, so yelling, crying, it was very upsetting,” <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>said Vivian Cole</a>. Police are still searching for the suspects. All six were hospitalized. No one died this time. Not yet.</p><p>Just days earlier, three more pedestrians were struck at Hunts Point and Bruckner. One man was left in critical condition. The driver faces charges. The street keeps its secrets, but the numbers do not.</p><h3 id=the-slow-grind-of-loss>The Slow Grind of Loss</h3><p>In the last twelve months, six people have died on these streets. Eight hundred thirty-two have been injured. Twelve suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. Cars and trucks do most of the harm: five deaths, nearly four hundred injuries. Motorcycles, mopeds, bikes—they all draw blood, but the weight of steel does the killing.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Assembly Member Amanda Septimo has signed on to bills that could slow the carnage. She co-sponsors <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">A2299</a>, which would force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. She backs <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">A1077</a>, calling for streets built for people, not just cars. She voted yes on <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">school speed cameras</a>. These are steps. But the bodies keep coming.</p><p>The street does not care about bills in committee. It cares about speed, steel, and silence. “We thought it was a bomb or something, because we are all panicking around here,” <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/03/us-news/6-pedestrians-struck-by-ford-mustang-that-crashed-into-nyc-scaffolding-before-driver-passenger-flee/>said Christina Sieh</a>.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p>Call Assembly Member Septimo. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement. Demand streets for people, not cars.</p><p>Every day of delay is another body on the ground.
