She also co‑sponsored <strong>A 1077</strong> to apply complete‑street design principles statewide (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">Open States: A 1077</a>).</p><p>On school‑zone safety, the Legislature moved a fix‑and‑extend bill, <strong>S 8344</strong>. Septimo was marked “excused” on the June 17 vote (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Open States: S 8344</a>).
