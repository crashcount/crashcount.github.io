July 3rd. A Ford Mustang lunges from a turn, mounts the curb, and plows through a crosswalk. Six people are hit. The youngest is 30. The oldest, 79. The driver and passenger run. The Mustang sits, battered and empty. The sidewalk is left with blood and broken scaffolding. &ldquo;People were yelling, were in pain, so yelling, crying, it was very upsetting,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>said Vivian Cole</a>. No arrests. No answers. Only pain.</p><p>This is not rare. In the last twelve months, six people have died and 830 have been injured in crashes in AD 84. Twelve were left with injuries so severe they may never walk right again. The numbers do not slow. The street does not forgive.</p><h3 id=the-toll-grows-the-danger-remains>The Toll Grows, The Danger Remains</h3><p>The Mustang was not the first. It will not be the last. In just the first half of this year, five are dead, 428 are hurt, and the year is only half over. The wounds are not just numbers. They are lives. They are families waiting in hospital halls. &ldquo;We thought it was a bomb or something, because we are all panicking around here,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/03/us-news/6-pedestrians-struck-by-ford-mustang-that-crashed-into-nyc-scaffolding-before-driver-passenger-flee/>said Christina Sieh</a>.</p><p>Most victims are on foot. Some ride bikes. Some are children. Cars and SUVs do the most harm, but trucks, motorcycles, and bikes all leave scars. The street belongs to the fast and the reckless.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-taken-steps-needed>Leadership: Steps Taken, Steps Needed</h3><p>Assembly Member Amanda Septimo has signed on to bills that could help. She co-sponsored <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">A 2299</a>, which would force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. She backed <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">A 1077</a>, calling for streets built for people, not just cars. She voted yes on <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">school speed cameras</a>. These are steps. But the blood on the sidewalk says it is not enough.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-no-more-waiting>Call to Action: No More Waiting</h3><p>Six people hit in one morning. Six families changed. No arrests. No justice.</p><p>Call Assembly Member Septimo. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement. Demand streets that put people first. Do not wait for another body on the curb.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
