One morning. One intersection.</strong> On July 3, a Ford Mustang turned left at East 149th and Courtlandt and plowed onto the sidewalk. The driver hit a woman in the crosswalk, then five more under the scaffolding. The car stopped, the men inside ran. The street was left with blood and broken glass. &ldquo;People were yelling, were in pain, so yelling, crying, it was very upsetting,&rdquo; said <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>Vivian Cole</a>.

Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. Cars and SUVs did most of the damage: 5 deaths, 408 injuries. Trucks and buses killed 2, injured 45. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left dozens more hurt.
