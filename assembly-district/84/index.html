Deaths spike at 1 a.m., 2 a.m., 5 a.m., and again in the late rush, with a hard run from 7 a.m. through the evening.

Put <strong>physical protection</strong> where people stand—concrete, not paint. The truck streets need <strong>tight turn radii</strong> and <strong>clear truck routes</strong> away from foot traffic.

The <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (A2299/S4045C)</strong> would force drivers with bad records and camera histories to use speed‑limiting tech.
