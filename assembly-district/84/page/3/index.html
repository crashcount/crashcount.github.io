Six people walking in the crosswalk were struck. The car smashed into scaffolding. The driver and passenger ran. The sidewalk was left with blood and twisted metal. &ldquo;People were yelling, were in pain, so yelling, crying, it was very upsetting,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>said Vivian Cole</a>. All six went to the hospital. The youngest was 30. The oldest was 79. No one has been arrested. The street is busy again. The fear lingers.</p><p>This is not rare. In the last twelve months, <strong>six people have died and 951 have been injured</strong> in crashes in AD 84. Twelve were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Most were walking or riding bikes. The numbers do not stop. They only climb.</p><h3 id=the-record-of-leadership>The Record of Leadership</h3><p>Assembly Member Amanda Septimo has backed some bills for safer streets. She co-sponsored a measure to require speed-limiting tech for repeat speeders. She signed on to a bill for safer street design. She voted to extend school speed cameras. But when it mattered, she missed the vote to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>fix school speed zone laws</a>. The law passed, but her absence left a mark. The streets do not wait for committee schedules.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>The numbers are plain. <strong>Cars and SUVs</strong> did the most harm—five deaths, 419 injuries. <strong>Trucks and buses</strong> killed two, injured 52. <strong>Motorcycles and mopeds</strong> killed one, injured 25. <strong>Bikes</strong> injured 16. The street does not care who you are. It only cares who is bigger, faster, heavier.</p><h3 id=the-voices-in-the-aftermath>The Voices in the Aftermath</h3><p>&ldquo;We thought it was a bomb or something, because we are all panicking around here,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>said Christina Sieh</a>. The panic fades. The danger does not.</p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Assembly Member Septimo. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed limiters for repeat offenders. Demand streets where children and elders can cross without fear. <strong>Do not wait for the next siren.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
