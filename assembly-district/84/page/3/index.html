A motorcyclist &ldquo;blew through a red light, slammed into him and sped away,&rdquo; police said <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/11/boy-15-on-scooter-struck-by-hit-and-run-bronx-motorcyclist-critically-hurt/>NY Daily News</a>. The boy is in the hospital. The driver is gone.</p><h3 id=patterns-the-same-old-story>Patterns: The Same Old Story</h3><p><strong>Red lights mean nothing if no one enforces them.</strong> Unlicensed drivers, hit-and-runs, speeders—these are not rare. They are the rule. In the last year, SUVs and cars caused the most harm: five deaths, 278 minor injuries, 109 moderate, 11 serious. Trucks and buses killed two and left seven with serious wounds. Motorcycles and mopeds, one dead, 17 more hurt. Even bikes are not blameless—one serious injury, eight others hurt. The street is a war zone, and the most vulnerable pay the price.</p><h3 id=leadership-what-has-been-done>Leadership: What Has Been Done</h3><p>Assembly Member Amanda Septimo has signed on to bills that matter. She co-sponsored a law to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">A2299</a>. She backed &ldquo;complete streets&rdquo; design for all users <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">A1077</a>. She voted yes on school speed cameras <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">A7652</a>. These are steps. But the blood keeps flowing. <strong>Every day without action is another day someone does not come home.</strong></p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Call Assembly Member Septimo. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat offenders.</strong> Join <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a> and <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a>.

They demanded more money for the MTA. They want six-minute bus and subway service. They warned against service cuts and fare hikes. They called for gas tax revenue to fund transit. Riders need safe, frequent service.</p><p class=mb3>On November 17, 2022, state legislators and transit advocates pressed for increased MTA funding and six-minute off-peak service. The push comes ahead of the next budget cycle. Assembly Members Zohran Mamdani and Amanda Septimo, State Senator Andrew Gounardes, and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher led the call. Mamdani said, 'If we implement six-minute service, the consequences would be felt for riders across all aspects of their life.' Septimo called transit an economic and racial justice issue. Gounardes urged the governor to include MTA funding in the initial budget. Gallagher criticized the gas tax holiday, urging funds go to transit. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber warned that cuts or fare hikes would devastate working- and middle-class New Yorkers. The group demanded action to protect and improve transit for all riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
