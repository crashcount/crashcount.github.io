The car tried to turn, jumped the curb, and plowed into the sidewalk. The driver and passenger ran, leaving pain and panic behind. &ldquo;People were yelling, were in pain, so yelling, crying, it was very upsetting,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/03/us-news/6-pedestrians-struck-by-ford-mustang-that-crashed-into-nyc-scaffolding-before-driver-passenger-flee/>said Vivian Cole</a>. All six went to the hospital. They survived. This time.</p><p>In the last twelve months, five people have died in crashes in AD 84. Over 1,000 have been injured. Twenty were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The numbers do not stop. They do not slow down. They pile up like bodies in the street.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p>The dead are not just numbers. They are the old man crossing East 149th. The cyclist hit by a turning bus. The woman crushed between SUVs. The child who never made it home. Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</p><p>Cars and trucks caused the most harm: 5 deaths, 13 serious injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds: 1 death, 1 serious injury. Bikes: no deaths, 1 serious injury. The street does not care who you are. It only cares that you are in the way.</p><h3 id=what-has-leadership-done>What Has Leadership Done?</h3><p>Assembly Member Amanda Septimo has <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored bills</a> to require speed limiters for repeat offenders and to make streets safer for all users. She has <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">voted yes</a> on funding for safer street designs and extending school speed cameras. But when it mattered most—the June 2025 vote to extend school speed zone protections—she was absent. The bill passed, but her silence was felt. The streets stayed the same.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p>No more waiting. Call Assembly Member Septimo. Demand action. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people on foot and on bikes. The next crash is already on its way. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
