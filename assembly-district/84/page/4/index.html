A 33-year-old man now fights for his life after a car ran a red light and plowed onto the sidewalk at Bruckner and Hunts Point. Two others were thrown down beside him. Police said the driver &ldquo;allegedly ran a red light&rdquo; and then &ldquo;got out of his vehicle and ran away, but he was later arrested&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/bronx-hunts-point-pedestrians-struck/>CBS New York</a>).</p><p>A week before, a 15-year-old boy on a scooter was hit by a motorcyclist who &ldquo;blew through a red light, slammed into him and sped away&rdquo;. The boy is in critical condition. The driver did not stop.

It is relentless. In the last year, SUVs and cars did the most harm—<strong>five deaths, 398 injuries</strong>. Trucks and buses killed two, hurt thirty.
