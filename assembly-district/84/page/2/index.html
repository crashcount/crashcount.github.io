A man crossing the street. A cyclist at night. In Assembly District 84, the story repeats. <strong>Seven dead in the last year. Fourteen left with injuries that will never heal.</strong> In the last twelve months, <strong>842 people were hurt</strong> in crashes here. The numbers are blunt, but the pain is sharp.</p><p>A 15-year-old was riding north on Jerome Avenue. A motorcyclist ran the red at 167th, hit him, and sped off. The boy was left in the street, fighting for his life. Police said, &ldquo;A 15-year-old boy riding his scooter was critically hurt when a Bronx motorcyclist blew through a red light, slammed into him and sped away&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/11/boy-15-on-scooter-struck-by-hit-and-run-bronx-motorcyclist-critically-hurt/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>In April, Inza Fofana tried to cross East 149th. A van turned left and struck him. He died at Lincoln Hospital. The driver stayed. No arrest. The story ends there for Fofana. &ldquo;A 52-year-old man died after being hit by a van while crossing the street in the Bronx, police said&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/04/52-year-old-man-killed-crossing-bronx-street-hit-van/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><h2 id=the-shape-of-the-danger>The Shape of the Danger</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs kill. Trucks crush. Buses turn and take lives.</strong> In the last three years, 23 people have died on these streets. Fifty-six suffered serious injuries. Most were walking, biking, or just trying to get home. The dead include children, elders, and workers. The killers are often SUVs, trucks, and buses. Speed, red lights, and left turns are the weapons.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Assembly Member Amanda Septimo has taken some steps. She co-sponsored bills to require speed limiters for repeat dangerous drivers and to redesign streets for all users (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">A 2299</a>, <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">A 1077</a>). She voted yes on a bill to expand school speed cameras (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">A 7652</a>). She has called transit an economic and racial justice issue (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/11/17/legislators-and-advocates-press-case-for-mta-rescue-and-six-minute-service>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>But the blood keeps flowing. <strong>No law has yet forced the city to lower speed limits to 20 mph. No bill has ended the daily risk for kids and elders crossing the street.</strong></p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>Call Amanda Septimo. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings and real enforcement.</strong> Every day of delay is another name on a slab. The dead cannot call. You can. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
