The light was green for people crossing. The car hit a woman, then jumped the curb and plowed into five more under the scaffolding. The driver and passenger ran. Six people went to Lincoln Hospital. They were alive. They were lucky. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>&ldquo;People were yelling, were in pain, so yelling, crying, it was very upsetting,&rdquo;</a> said Vivian Cole. The Mustang sat wrecked, plates gone. The street was left with blood and fear.</p><p>This is not rare. In the last year, <strong>five people have died and 418 have been injured in crashes in AD 84</strong>. Six were seriously hurt. The dead do not get a second chance. The living carry scars.</p><h3 id=the-toll-grows-the-work-remains>The Toll Grows, The Work Remains</h3><p>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price. In three years, <strong>23 people killed, 2,989 injured, 56 seriously</strong>. Cars and SUVs did most of the harm. Trucks, buses, motorcycles, mopeds, bikes—none innocent. The numbers do not lie. The bodies do not lie.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-done-what-must-be-done>What Has Been Done, What Must Be Done</h3><p>Assembly Member Amanda Septimo has signed on to bills that matter. She co-sponsored <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">A 2299</a>, which would force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting tech. She backed <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">A 1077</a>, pushing for streets built for people, not just cars. She voted yes on <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">school speed cameras</a>. She stood with others to call transit a justice issue.</p><p>But the street keeps taking. The Mustang driver ran. The city waits for lower speed limits, for real enforcement, for streets that do not kill. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>&ldquo;We thought it was a bomb or something, because we are all panicking around here,&rdquo;</a> said Christina Sieh.
