She never made it. A dark minivan hit her and kept going. Police said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/woman-78-killed-queens-hit-and-run-driver/>&ldquo;A 78-year-old woman was fatally struck by a hit-and-run driver as she crossed a Queens street&rdquo;</a>. No one has been arrested. Her name is not in the news. Her absence is.</p><p>Children are not spared. In late 2023, a driver pulled out of a parking lot on College Point Boulevard and killed 3-year-old Quintas Chen. The driver fled. Assembly Member Ron Kim, who walks that block every day, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/11/30/cops-search-for-hit-and-run-driver-who-killed-3-year-old-in-queens>said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve always recognized there was a problem on this block&rdquo;</a>. The problem remains.</p><p>In the last 12 months, <strong>2 people died and 448 were injured</strong> in crashes in AD 40. Fourteen were seriously hurt. The dead are mostly the old and the young. The numbers do not bleed, but the streets do.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the killing. Since 2022, <strong>cars and trucks have caused 7 deaths and 13 serious injuries</strong> to pedestrians here. Motorcycles and mopeds have hurt more. Bikes, too, leave scars. No one is safe—not the man pinned under a car with a child beside him, not the cyclist crushed by a turning truck, not the grandmother who never left the crosswalk.</p><h3 id=what-has-ron-kim-done>What Has Ron Kim Done?</h3><p>Assembly Member Kim has voted to extend school speed cameras and backed bills for safer street designs. He co-sponsored measures to make streets safer for all users. He voted yes to expand speed cameras near schools (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S7678>S 7678</a>), and yes to require complete street designs (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A8936&amp;term=2022">A 8936</a>).</p><p>But Kim also voted to weaken bus lane rules (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S7785>S 7785</a>), a move that puts pedestrians and cyclists at risk. The work is not done. The danger is not gone.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more>Call to Action: Demand More</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable. Every death is a failure.</strong> Call Assembly Member Ron Kim. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for the old, the young, and everyone in between. Do not wait for another name to be lost to the street. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The driver pulled out of a parking lot, struck Chen, and fled. Police later arrested a 20-year-old suspect for leaving the scene and driving without a license. Assembly Member Ron Kim, who walks the block daily, called out the area’s longstanding dangers: 'We've always recognized there was a problem on this block.' The street, College Point Boulevard, has seen 276 crashes since 2019. Advocates, including Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives, called Chen’s death preventable and demanded citywide safe street improvements. Harris said, 'We know how to make our streets safe, especially for our youngest and most vulnerable New Yorkers.' Mayor Adams pledged to daylight and redesign 1,000 intersections each year, but advocates argue this is not enough. The tragedy highlights the deadly risk curb cuts and poor street design pose to children and families.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
