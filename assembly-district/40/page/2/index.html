She never made it. A dark minivan hit her and kept going. Police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/woman-78-killed-queens-hit-and-run-driver/>reported</a> she was fatally struck by a hit-and-run driver as she crossed a Queens street.</p><p>A child, three years old, was killed on College Point Boulevard.

Twelve more suffered serious injuries. Four hundred were hurt. The numbers do not bleed, but the families do.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-who-pays-the-price>The Pattern: Who Pays the Price</h3><p>Elderly people and children are struck down most often. In one year, two people over 75 died. One child under 18 died. The injuries are not numbers. They are broken bones, crushed bodies, and lives that do not heal.</p><p>The killers are cars, SUVs, and trucks. SUVs and cars caused seven deaths and eleven serious injuries. Trucks and buses added more. Bikes and mopeds are blamed, but the numbers do not lie: the deadliest machines are the biggest ones.</p><h3 id=what-ron-kim-has-doneand-not-done>What Ron Kim Has Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Ron Kim has <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored bills</a> to make streets safer for everyone and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1280&amp;term=2023">supported</a> other safety measures. He voted yes on a bill to <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">put speed cameras near schools</a>. He has spoken about the dangers on local blocks. But the bodies keep coming. The bills are not yet law. The cameras are not everywhere. The streets are not safe.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-no-more-waiting>The Next Step: No More Waiting</h3><p>Every day of delay is another day of blood on the street. Call Ron Kim. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras on every deadly block. Demand streets built for people, not for cars. Do not wait for another child’s name in the news.</p><p>Act now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The driver pulled out of a parking lot, struck Chen, and fled. Police later arrested a 20-year-old suspect for leaving the scene and driving without a license. Assembly Member Ron Kim, who walks the block daily, called out the area’s longstanding dangers: 'We've always recognized there was a problem on this block.' The street, College Point Boulevard, has seen 276 crashes since 2019. Advocates, including Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives, called Chen’s death preventable and demanded citywide safe street improvements. Harris said, 'We know how to make our streets safe, especially for our youngest and most vulnerable New Yorkers.' Mayor Adams pledged to daylight and redesign 1,000 intersections each year, but advocates argue this is not enough. The tragedy highlights the deadly risk curb cuts and poor street design pose to children and families.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
