She never made it. A dark minivan hit her and kept going. Police said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/woman-78-killed-queens-hit-and-run-driver/>&ldquo;A 78-year-old woman was fatally struck by a hit-and-run driver as she crossed a Queens street&rdquo;</a>. No one has been arrested. Her name is not in the news. Her absence is.</p><p>Children are not spared. In late 2023, a driver pulled out of a parking lot on College Point Boulevard and killed 3-year-old Quintas Chen. The driver fled. Assembly Member Ron Kim, who walks that block every day, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/11/30/cops-search-for-hit-and-run-driver-who-killed-3-year-old-in-queens>said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve always recognized there was a problem on this block&rdquo;</a>. The problem remains.</p><p>In the last 12 months, <strong>2 people died and 448 were injured</strong> in crashes in AD 40. Fourteen were seriously hurt. The dead are mostly the old and the young. The numbers do not bleed, but the streets do.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the killing. Since 2022, <strong>cars and trucks have caused 7 deaths and 13 serious injuries</strong> to pedestrians here. Motorcycles and mopeds have hurt more. Bikes, too, leave scars. No one is safe—not the man pinned under a car with a child beside him, not the cyclist crushed by a turning truck, not the grandmother who never left the crosswalk.</p><h3 id=what-has-ron-kim-done>What Has Ron Kim Done?</h3><p>Assembly Member Kim has voted to extend school speed cameras and backed bills for safer street designs. He co-sponsored measures to make streets safer for all users. He voted yes to expand speed cameras near schools (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S7678>S 7678</a>), and yes to require complete street designs (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A8936&amp;term=2022">A 8936</a>).</p><p>But Kim also voted to weaken bus lane rules (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S7785>S 7785</a>), a move that puts pedestrians and cyclists at risk. The work is not done. The danger is not gone.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more>Call to Action: Demand More</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable. Every death is a failure.</strong> Call Assembly Member Ron Kim. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for the old, the young, and everyone in between. Do not wait for another name to be lost to the street. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
