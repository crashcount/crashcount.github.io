She never made it. A dark minivan hit her and kept going. Police said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/woman-78-killed-queens-hit-and-run-driver/>&ldquo;A 78-year-old woman was fatally struck by a hit-and-run driver as she crossed a Queens street&rdquo;</a>. No one has been arrested. Her name is not in the news. Her absence is.</p><p>Children are not spared. In late 2023, a driver pulled out of a parking lot on College Point Boulevard and killed 3-year-old Quintas Chen. The driver fled. Assembly Member Ron Kim, who walks that block every day, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/11/30/cops-search-for-hit-and-run-driver-who-killed-3-year-old-in-queens>said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve always recognized there was a problem on this block&rdquo;</a>. The problem remains.</p><p>In the last 12 months, <strong>2 people died and 448 were injured</strong> in crashes in AD 40. Fourteen were seriously hurt. The dead are mostly the old and the young. The numbers do not bleed, but the streets do.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the killing. Since 2022, <strong>cars and trucks have caused 7 deaths and 13 serious injuries</strong> to pedestrians here. Motorcycles and mopeds have hurt more. Bikes, too, leave scars. No one is safe—not the man pinned under a car with a child beside him, not the cyclist crushed by a turning truck, not the grandmother who never left the crosswalk.</p><h3 id=what-has-ron-kim-done>What Has Ron Kim Done?</h3><p>Assembly Member Kim has voted to extend school speed cameras and backed bills for safer street designs. He co-sponsored measures to make streets safer for all users. He voted yes to expand speed cameras near schools (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S7678>S 7678</a>), and yes to require complete street designs (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A8936&amp;term=2022">A 8936</a>).</p><p>But Kim also voted to weaken bus lane rules (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S7785>S 7785</a>), a move that puts pedestrians and cyclists at risk. The work is not done. The danger is not gone.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more>Call to Action: Demand More</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable. Every death is a failure.</strong> Call Assembly Member Ron Kim. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for the old, the young, and everyone in between. Do not wait for another name to be lost to the street. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report states she was not at an intersection and was crossing without a signal or crosswalk. The impact killed her instantly, leaving her body in the roadway. The vehicle involved was a station wagon or SUV traveling straight ahead, with the point of impact at the center front end. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified,' offering no further detail on driver behavior or conditions. The narrative underscores the stark aftermath: 'her body still beneath the glare of headlights, as silence settled over the blacktop.' No evidence from the report suggests any action by the victim contributed to the crash; the focus remains on the lethal force of the vehicle and the vulnerability of the pedestrian.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
