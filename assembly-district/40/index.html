Thirty-five were left with wounds so deep they may never heal. The dead are not numbers. A 78-year-old woman, crossing Northern Boulevard near Parsons, was struck down by a driver who did not stop. Police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/woman-78-killed-queens-hit-and-run-driver/>reported</a> that &ldquo;a 78-year-old woman was fatally struck by a hit-and-run driver as she crossed a Queens street.&rdquo; Her name was not released. The driver kept going. No arrest. No justice.</p><p>Children are not spared. A three-year-old boy, walking with his family on College Point Boulevard, was killed by a driver pulling out of a parking lot. The driver fled. Assembly Member Ron Kim, who walks that block every day, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/11/30/cops-search-for-hit-and-run-driver-who-killed-3-year-old-in-queens>admitted</a>, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve always recognized there was a problem on this block.&rdquo; The problem remains.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-who-pays-the-price>The Pattern: Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do the most harm.</strong> Since 2022, cars and trucks have killed seven, left 13 with serious injuries, and caused 84 moderate injuries. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll, but the steel and speed of larger vehicles do most of the killing. The old and the young fall first. Two deaths were children. Four were over 75.</p><p>The violence is not random. It is built into the streets. It is in every wide road, every missing crosswalk, every curb cut that lets a car lurch into a family’s path. It is in the silence after the sirens fade.</p><h2 id=the-response-what-ron-kim-has-done>The Response: What Ron Kim Has Done</h2><p>Ron Kim has taken some steps. He co-sponsored bills to require safer street design for all users, not just drivers. He voted yes on a bill to bring speed cameras to school zones in Schenectady, a small move for a distant city, but a vote for safety all the same. After the death of the three-year-old, Kim <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/11/30/cops-search-for-hit-and-run-driver-who-killed-3-year-old-in-queens>spoke out</a> about the dangers on College Point Boulevard. But the danger remains. The bills sit in committee. The streets do not change.</p><h2 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>The bodies pile up. The danger is known. The fixes are known.</strong> Lower the speed limits. Build real protection for people walking and biking. Flood the streets with cameras that never blink. Call Ron Kim. Call the council. Demand action. <strong>Do not wait for another child’s name to be lost in the noise.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
