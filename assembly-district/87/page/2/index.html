In the last year alone, six people died and over 500 were hurt. A 17-year-old boy, Juan Alexander Quizhpi Naranjo, rode his dirt bike with a friend. He never made it home. His father remembered, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/25/dirt-bike-minivan-bronx-crash-juan-alexander-quizhpi-naranjo/>&ldquo;When he didn&rsquo;t return in the evening I tried calling him but he didn&rsquo;t pick up. Later his mom called him many times but no one picked up. Then around 7 p.m. someone picked up his phone and asked us to come to the hospital.&rdquo;</a></p><h2 id=who-bears-the-weight>Who Bears the Weight</h2><p><strong>Most victims are the vulnerable.</strong> Pedestrians and cyclists. Children and elders. SUVs and cars do most of the damage—<strong>seven deaths</strong> and dozens of injuries. Trucks, buses, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll. The street does not care who you are. The pain is the same. The NYPD is still investigating who had the right of way in Juan’s crash. The driver stayed at the scene. No charges. The city moves on. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/bronx-teen-dies-in-traffic-crash-another-teen-injured-nypd-says>&ldquo;The NYPD&rsquo;s Collision Investigation Squad was still working to determine who had the right of way and whether a traffic violation played a role in the crash.&rdquo;</a></p><h2 id=what-has-been-done>What Has Been Done</h2><p>Assembly Member <strong>Karines Reyes has taken steps</strong>. She <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A5440&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored bills</a> to hold vehicle owners accountable for red-light violations and to <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">require speed limiters</a> for repeat dangerous drivers. She <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">voted yes on school speed cameras</a>. She <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/11/05/state-now-considering-car-free-connector-next-to-cross-bronx-expwy-instead-of-covert-highway>signed a letter urging the state to consider a bike-pedestrian path</a> instead of a new bypass near the Cross-Bronx Expressway. These are steps. But the deaths keep coming. The bills are not yet law. The cameras are not everywhere. The streets are not safe.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay is another family waiting for a call that never should come. <strong>Demand more.</strong> Call Assembly Member Reyes. Call the council. Call the mayor. Tell them: <strong>Lower the speed limit. Build real protection. End the excuses.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
