In the last year alone, six families lost someone forever. Eleven more suffered injuries so severe they may never heal. The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price.</strong> Wahid Miah, 75, was crossing Wood Avenue and White Plains Road. He had the light. A BMW SUV turned left and hit him. Miah tried to wave the driver off. He died in the street. &ldquo;The accident is so terrible,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/19/bronx-bmw-driver-arrested-for-fatally-striking-75-year-old-man-walking-home-from-mosque/>said his neighbor, Shameem Ahmed</a>. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like this in my life.&rdquo;</p><p>A 17-year-old, Juan Alexander Quizhpi Naranjo, rode his dirt bike with a 14-year-old girl on the back. A minivan struck them at Metcalf Avenue and East 172nd Street. Both were thrown. Juan died at Jacobi Hospital. His father <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/25/dirt-bike-minivan-bronx-crash-juan-alexander-quizhpi-naranjo/>remembered</a>, &ldquo;He was fond of bikes. Even in his home country, he was riding bikes. His mother even got him one here.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=who-bears-the-risk>Who Bears the Risk</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> Out of all pedestrian injuries and deaths, cars and SUVs are responsible for the vast majority. Trucks and buses add to the toll. Bikes and mopeds cause a handful of injuries, but the numbers are small. The street is not equal. The bigger vehicle wins. The person on foot or bike loses.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Assembly Member Karines Reyes has taken steps. She co-sponsored bills to force speed limiters on repeat dangerous drivers (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">A2299</a>), and to hold car owners liable for red-light violations (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A5440&amp;term=2025">A5440</a>). She voted yes on school speed cameras. These are the right moves. But the deaths keep coming. The pace of change is slow. The street does not wait.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a failure. Call Assembly Member Reyes. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed limiters for repeat offenders. Demand streets where a child can cross and live. Do not wait for the next name. <strong>Act now.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
