The numbers do not heal. They only grow.</p><p>Just this February, a 75-year-old man was killed crossing Wood Avenue at White Plains Road. He had the light. The driver turned left and hit him. The man tried to wave the car off, but the car did not stop. &ldquo;The accident is so terrible,&rdquo; a neighbor <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/19/bronx-bmw-driver-arrested-for-fatally-striking-75-year-old-man-walking-home-from-mosque/>said</a>. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like this in my life.&rdquo;</p><p>A few months earlier, a 17-year-old boy and his 14-year-old passenger were thrown from a moped after a crash with a minivan.

Now weighs bike and pedestrian path. Bronx officials and advocates push back against more lanes, more overpasses. Public left out. Final decision coming. Streets remain dangerous. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On November 5, 2024, the New York State Department of Transportation announced it is reconsidering its plan for a four-lane bypass road next to the Cross-Bronx Expressway. The agency now weighs three options: the original bypass, a bike-pedestrian path, or a two-lane road with a two-way bike lane. This shift follows a September letter from Bronx elected officials, including Assembly Member Karines Reyes, urging DOT to drop the bypass. The official matter summary states, 'DOT is now presenting three options as part of a $900-million project to rebuild five elevated sections of the expressway.' Environmental advocates remain opposed to more lanes and overpasses, wary of obscuring Starlight Park and the Bronx River. Daniel Ranells of the Bronx River Alliance said, 'We like east-west connections that make things safer for people who are walking and biking,' but called for better public involvement. DOT will release a draft environmental assessment and hold hearings this winter, with a final decision due in spring 2025.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
