In the last twelve months, seven people died and 655 were injured in crashes. Thirteen suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. The dead include a 75-year-old man walking home from mosque, struck in the crosswalk by a BMW SUV. He tried to wave the driver off. The driver kept turning. The man died in the road. His neighbor <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/19/bronx-bmw-driver-arrested-for-fatally-striking-75-year-old-man-walking-home-from-mosque/>called it &ldquo;so terrible. I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like this in my life.&rdquo;</a></p><p>Just months before, a 17-year-old on a dirt bike collided with a minivan. He died. His passenger, a 14-year-old girl, survived. His father <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/25/dirt-bike-minivan-bronx-crash-juan-alexander-quizhpi-naranjo/>remembered, &ldquo;He was here yesterday morning, sitting on the bed and watching TV.&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=the-numbers-that-dont-lie>The Numbers That Don’t Lie</h3><p>SUVs and cars do the most harm. In three and a half years, they killed eight and injured 273 people walking or biking. Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left others bloodied or broken. No one is safe: children, elders, workers, all caught in the crossfire of traffic.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—and What Hasn’t</h3><p>Assembly Member Karines Reyes has voted to extend school speed zones and boost funding for safer street designs. She co-sponsored <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">bills to hold vehicle owners liable for camera violations</a> and to <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A5440&amp;term=2025">require speed-limiting tech for repeat offenders</a>. She backed a <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/11/05/state-now-considering-car-free-connector-next-to-cross-bronx-expwy-instead-of-covert-highway>plan for a bike-pedestrian path instead of a new highway lane</a>. But she also <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted to weaken bus rules</a>, putting walkers and cyclists at greater risk. The work is not finished. The danger remains.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Every day without change is another day someone does not come home. Call Assembly Member Reyes. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras on every block. Demand streets built for people, not for cars. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On November 5, 2024, the New York State Department of Transportation announced it is reconsidering its plan for a four-lane bypass road next to the Cross-Bronx Expressway. The agency now weighs three options: the original bypass, a bike-pedestrian path, or a two-lane road with a two-way bike lane. This shift follows a September letter from Bronx elected officials, including Assembly Member Karines Reyes, urging DOT to drop the bypass. The official matter summary states, 'DOT is now presenting three options as part of a $900-million project to rebuild five elevated sections of the expressway.' Environmental advocates remain opposed to more lanes and overpasses, wary of obscuring Starlight Park and the Bronx River. Daniel Ranells of the Bronx River Alliance said, 'We like east-west connections that make things safer for people who are walking and biking,' but called for better public involvement. DOT will release a draft environmental assessment and hold hearings this winter, with a final decision due in spring 2025.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
