In the last year alone, six families lost someone forever. Eleven more suffered injuries so severe they may never heal. The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price.</strong> Wahid Miah, 75, was crossing Wood Avenue and White Plains Road. He had the light. A BMW SUV turned left and hit him. Miah tried to wave the driver off. He died in the street. &ldquo;The accident is so terrible,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/19/bronx-bmw-driver-arrested-for-fatally-striking-75-year-old-man-walking-home-from-mosque/>said his neighbor, Shameem Ahmed</a>. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like this in my life.&rdquo;</p><p>A 17-year-old, Juan Alexander Quizhpi Naranjo, rode his dirt bike with a 14-year-old girl on the back. A minivan struck them at Metcalf Avenue and East 172nd Street. Both were thrown. Juan died at Jacobi Hospital. His father <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/25/dirt-bike-minivan-bronx-crash-juan-alexander-quizhpi-naranjo/>remembered</a>, &ldquo;He was fond of bikes. Even in his home country, he was riding bikes. His mother even got him one here.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=who-bears-the-risk>Who Bears the Risk</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> Out of all pedestrian injuries and deaths, cars and SUVs are responsible for the vast majority. Trucks and buses add to the toll. Bikes and mopeds cause a handful of injuries, but the numbers are small. The street is not equal. The bigger vehicle wins. The person on foot or bike loses.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Assembly Member Karines Reyes has taken steps. She co-sponsored bills to force speed limiters on repeat dangerous drivers (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">A2299</a>), and to hold car owners liable for red-light violations (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A5440&amp;term=2025">A5440</a>). She voted yes on school speed cameras. These are the right moves. But the deaths keep coming. The pace of change is slow. The street does not wait.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a failure. Call Assembly Member Reyes. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed limiters for repeat offenders. Demand streets where a child can cross and live. Do not wait for the next name. <strong>Act now.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Now weighs bike and pedestrian path. Bronx officials and advocates push back against more lanes, more overpasses. Public left out. Final decision coming. Streets remain dangerous. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On November 5, 2024, the New York State Department of Transportation announced it is reconsidering its plan for a four-lane bypass road next to the Cross-Bronx Expressway. The agency now weighs three options: the original bypass, a bike-pedestrian path, or a two-lane road with a two-way bike lane. This shift follows a September letter from Bronx elected officials, including Assembly Member Karines Reyes, urging DOT to drop the bypass. The official matter summary states, 'DOT is now presenting three options as part of a $900-million project to rebuild five elevated sections of the expressway.' Environmental advocates remain opposed to more lanes and overpasses, wary of obscuring Starlight Park and the Bronx River. Daniel Ranells of the Bronx River Alliance said, 'We like east-west connections that make things safer for people who are walking and biking,' but called for better public involvement. DOT will release a draft environmental assessment and hold hearings this winter, with a final decision due in spring 2025.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states she suffered a neck injury and severe bleeding but remained conscious at the scene. Police attribute the crash to 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way.' The driver, licensed and operating a 2015 Honda sedan, looked away during the turn, according to the narrative. The vehicle sustained no damage. The woman’s action—'Crossing With Signal'—is noted in the report, but only after the driver’s errors are cited as contributing factors. The collision underscores the persistent danger left-turning vehicles pose to pedestrians in city intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
