Since 2022, ten people have died in crashes here. Over 2,000 have been injured. Sixteen left with wounds so deep they are called serious injuries. The old and the young are not spared. In the last twelve months, two people died—one was 75, the other just 18. Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians are all at risk.</p><p>Every week, another crash. A 95-year-old woman struck dead at a Brooklyn intersection. A cyclist, 24, thrown from his bike and killed by an SUV. A pedestrian, 72, crushed while crossing Marine Avenue. The numbers do not flinch: over 1,100 crashes in the last year alone, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. Each one a life changed, a family left to pick up the pieces.</p><h3 id=the-record-of-leadership>The Record of Leadership</h3><p>Assembly Member Alec Brook-Krasny has <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted against bills</a> that would have made school zones safer and kept speed cameras running. He voted no on extending and fixing school speed zone laws. He voted no on reauthorizing the city&rsquo;s speed camera program. He voted yes to weaken bus lane rules, making streets more dangerous for people outside cars. He co-sponsored a bill to repeal congestion pricing, a move that would put more cars—and more danger—on city streets. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>See the record</a>.</p><p>Brook-Krasny has spoken up against bus stop cuts, citing the needs of seniors and people with disabilities (<a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/brooklyn-bus-redesign-proposal-rankles-riders/>amNY</a>). But when it comes to the laws that protect children and the most vulnerable from speeding cars, his votes say no.</p><h3 id=the-path-forward>The Path Forward</h3><p>This is not fate. These deaths are not accidents. Speed cameras, lower speed limits, and safer street designs save lives. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. The state can pass laws to stop repeat dangerous drivers. But these tools only work if leaders use them.</p><p>Call Assembly Member Alec Brook-Krasny. Demand he support real safety measures: speed cameras, lower speed limits, and laws that protect people outside cars. Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
