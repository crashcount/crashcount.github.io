Two were killed in the last twelve months. <strong>Sixteen more suffered serious injuries</strong>—the kind that do not heal. The numbers are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, elders, children. A 95-year-old woman, dead at the intersection of Cropsey and 24th. A 24-year-old cyclist, crushed on Neptune Avenue. A 72-year-old woman, struck crossing Marine Avenue. The list does not end. It only grows.</p><h3 id=the-vehicles-that-kill>The Vehicles That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs are the main killers.</strong> They caused three deaths and over 300 injuries (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a>). Trucks and buses did their share—24 people hurt, one killed. Motorcycles and mopeds, ten more injured. Bikes, too, but the toll is smaller. The street does not care who you are. It only cares who is bigger, faster, heavier.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-against-safety>Leadership: Votes Against Safety</h3><p>Assembly Member Alec Brook-Krasny has not stood with the dead. <strong>He <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>voted against extending school speed zones</a></strong>—against the cameras that catch the drivers who speed past children. He <a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/brooklyn-bus-redesign-proposal-rankles-riders/>voted to weaken bus rules</a>, making the street more dangerous for those outside a car. He <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>co-sponsored a bill to repeal congestion pricing</a>, a move that would put more cars on the road and more bodies in the morgue. When <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A9877&amp;term=2023">bills came up to make school zones safer</a>, he voted no. Again and again, the answer was no. The silence is not neutral. It is a choice.</p><h3 id=the-path-forward>The Path Forward</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is preventable. Every death is a failure. Call Brook-Krasny. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that work, laws that protect, streets that do not kill. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Senate passed the measure 38-21; three city senators—Stephen Chan, Andrew Lanza, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton—voted no. The Assembly passed it 110-31, with nine city lawmakers—Alec Brook-Krasny, Lester Chang, Simcha Eichenstein, Michael Novakhov, Stacey Pheffer Amato, Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Reilly, David Weprin, Kalman Yeger—opposing. The Streetsblog NYC article, 'Ye Shall Know Their Names! Meet the Dirty Dozen City Pols Who Voted Against Speed Camera Program,' quotes lawmakers dismissing speed cameras as revenue grabs or burdens. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action, so no direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists can be assessed.' Still, the votes signal disregard for proven tools that protect those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
