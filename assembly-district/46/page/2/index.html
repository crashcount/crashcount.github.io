A state proposal known as the Stop Super Speeders Act would fit habitual violators with speed limiters. It is built for the small group that does outsized harm. Our district needs it. Our families need it (/take_action/).</p><h3 id=slow-the-turns-clear-the-corners-protect-the-walk>Slow the turns. Clear the corners. Protect the walk.</h3><p>Start where the blood is: Neptune Avenue, Ocean Parkway, Brighton Beach Avenue. Put daylighting at corners. Harden the turns that drivers take fast. Give walkers a head start at signals. Target failure‑to‑yield at the crossings where people are getting hit. These tools are basic. They work. Use them (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Then go bigger. <strong>Lower the city’s default speed limit.</strong> <strong>Make repeat speeders slow down</strong> with electronic limiters. Albany can pass it. City Hall can set it. Both levels owe us action.</p><p>The woman at Cropsey and 24th never made it across. The rider on Neptune never made it home. We can slow the cars now.
