Six hundred forty-six people were hurt. Nine suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. This is Assembly District 26. This is Queens. This is now.</p><p><strong>In the last twelve months, one child was killed and sixty-seven more were injured in crashes.</strong> The old are not spared. Forty-one people over 75 were hurt.

Trucks and buses added five more serious injuries. No one died on a bike. No one died on a motorcycle. The danger comes on four wheels, not two.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-taken-steps-delayed>Leadership: Steps Taken, Steps Delayed</h3><p>Assembly Member Ed Braunstein voted yes on a bill to bring speed cameras to school zones in Schenectady. Cameras catch drivers who speed where children walk. The bill passed. But this was not for Queens. It was not for Bayside or Douglaston or Little Neck. It was not for the children who cross 73rd Avenue or Utopia Parkway. See <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">A 7652</a>.</p><p>Braunstein has called for more express bus service before congestion pricing begins. He has spoken about funding for the MTA. But on the blood and bone of local streets, the record is thin. The silence is heavy. See <a href=https://nypost.com/2024/05/16/us-news/queens-lawmakers-demand-more-mta-bus-service-to-manhattan-before-15-congestion-toll-begins/>NY Post</a>.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>The disaster is slow, but it is not fate.</strong> Lower the speed limits. Build real protection for people on foot and on bikes. Expand speed cameras to every school, every crossing. Hold drivers—not children—accountable.</p><p><strong>Call Ed Braunstein. Call your council member. Demand action.</strong> Every day of delay is another day for the next siren, the next mother’s scream, the next toy left in the road.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
