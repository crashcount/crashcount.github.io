The report states the driver was distracted, citing 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the primary contributing factor. The woman suffered severe bleeding from her leg but remained conscious at the scene. The driver did not stop after the collision. The pedestrian was not at an intersection and was crossing where there was no signal or crosswalk, but the police report lists driver distraction as the key factor in the crash.
