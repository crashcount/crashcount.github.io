The plan, once a bold vision for a car-free, walkable neighborhood, was gutted after pressure from local politicians like Assembly Member Ed Braunstein and Council Member Joann Ariola. The original proposal called for 2,775 homes and limited parking. Now, density drops by 27 percent. Empire State Development claims compromise, but the statement is aspirational and lacks concrete safety measures for pedestrians or cyclists. Vulnerable road users remain exposed.

According to the police report, all vehicles were traveling northbound when the crash occurred at 19:50. The report describes the scene: 'Three SUVs, metal to metal. A hard strike. Glass burst. Four men, ages 17 to 44, crushed in their seats. Belts held them tight. All awake. All broken. Speed carved the pain into steel.' The official contributing factor listed is 'Unsafe Speed.'
