Pedestrians bear a heavy share here: 4 pedestrians killed, 213 hurt (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=our-highways-eat-people>Our highways eat people</h3><p>The Cross Island Parkway leads our local toll: 3 deaths and 523 injuries since 2022. The Long Island Expressway adds 329 injuries. The Clearview Expressway racks up 106 injuries (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). On Aug 26, 2025, a 24‑year‑old passenger died on the Cross Island in a 1999 BMW; police listed unsafe speed (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Wrong‑way violence hit close, too. In 2023, Joseph Lee drove into southbound traffic on the Clearview and smashed into five cars. A judge gave him eight years. “Joseph Lee terrorized other drivers,” Queens DA Melinda Katz said (<a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY</a>).</p><h3 id=nights-are-the-killing-hours>Nights are the killing hours</h3><p>The body count spikes after dark. Deaths land at 2 AM and 10 PM, with more at 7 PM and mid‑afternoon. Severe injuries stack up late, too (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Speed sits behind too many crashes; distraction and failure to yield show up in the reports (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=streets-where-size-wins>Streets where size wins</h3><p>SUVs and cars are the usual weapons in pedestrian harm here: tied to 4 pedestrian deaths and most injuries in the district period (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>). At ground level, that looks like turning strikes and straight‑through hits on wide arterials and highway ramps.</p><p>Local fixes are simple and proven: daylight corners, harden lefts, add leading walk signals, slow ramps. Target night driving on Northern Blvd and highway service roads. Work the repeat hotspots named above.</p><h3 id=who-acts-and-when>Who acts, and when?</h3><p>Your Assembly Member is <a href=/neighborhood/qn1102/>Ed Braunstein</a> (AD 26). He voted yes on recent school‑zone speed‑camera bills and the NYC school‑zone law fix (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S5677>S 5677</a>, <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S7678>S 7678</a>, <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>S 8344</a> via <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Open States</a>). He also voted yes on measures to carve out bus‑lane exemptions (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S6815>S 6815</a>, <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S7785>S 7785</a>).</p><p>Citywide, two steps would bite hardest: lower the residential default speed, and force repeat speeders to slow down. Albany already gave the city the power to drop speeds; City Hall must use it. And the Stop Super Speeders Act would require speed limiters for the worst offenders. Both are on the table on our <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a> page.</p><p>The man at 217 St. never made it across. The highway death in August never made it home. <strong>Slow the cars.</strong> Hold the repeat offenders.

The original proposal called for 2,775 homes and limited parking. Now, density drops by 27 percent. Empire State Development claims compromise, but the statement is aspirational and lacks concrete safety measures for pedestrians or cyclists. Vulnerable road users remain exposed.
