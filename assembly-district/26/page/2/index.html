The Clearview Expressway racks up 106 injuries (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). On Aug 26, 2025, a 24‑year‑old passenger died on the Cross Island in a 1999 BMW; police listed unsafe speed (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Wrong‑way violence hit close, too. In 2023, Joseph Lee drove into southbound traffic on the Clearview and smashed into five cars. A judge gave him eight years. “Joseph Lee terrorized other drivers,” Queens DA Melinda Katz said (<a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY</a>).</p><h3 id=nights-are-the-killing-hours>Nights are the killing hours</h3><p>The body count spikes after dark.

Severe injuries stack up late, too (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).

Albany already gave the city the power to drop speeds; City Hall must use it. And the Stop Super Speeders Act would require speed limiters for the worst offenders. Both are on the table on our <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a> page.</p><p>The man at 217 St. never made it across.
