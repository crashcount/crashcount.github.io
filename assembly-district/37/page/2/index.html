Thirty-three more are left with serious injuries.</strong> In the past twelve months, two people have died and twelve have been seriously hurt on these streets. The youngest was sixteen. The oldest was seventy-five. Some never made it home from work. Some never made it to school. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the highest price.</strong> Cars and trucks did the most damage—killing and maiming with metal and speed. Trucks crushed legs and lives. SUVs turned and did not see. A sedan made a left and a girl was gone. A box truck took a cyclist at the corner of Greenpoint and 43rd. The numbers are steady. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Assembly Member Claire Valdez has moved on key bills. She co-sponsored a law to force speed limiters on repeat speeders. She backed cameras to keep bike lanes clear. She voted to extend and expand school speed zones and speed cameras. These are steps. They are not enough. The streets are still not safe for the old, the young, or anyone outside a car.</p><p>But there are cracks. Valdez also voted to weaken bus rules, a move that puts more people at risk. She backed exemptions for some drivers in bus lanes. Each carve-out is a risk written into law. Each delay is another family waiting for news that never comes.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. The state can force the worst drivers off the road. Residents can demand more. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call Assembly Member Valdez. Tell them: <strong>No more names on the list. No more waiting.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The crash occurred at 8:15 p.m. The report details that the moped rider, a 26-year-old man, suffered severe crush injuries to his leg and was conscious at the scene. Police cite 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Following Too Closely' as contributing factors. The moped rider was not wearing a helmet, as noted in the report, but this is mentioned only after the driver errors. The Tesla’s left front bumper collided with the moped’s right front, sending the rider to the pavement. The police report’s language—'Steel struck flesh. A 26-year-old man crumpled to the pavement, leg crushed'—underscores the brutal impact and the dangers faced by vulnerable road users when drivers fail to yield or pay attention.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

A moped was making a right turn and struck a bicycle from behind, damaging the moped's left side doors and the bike's center back end. Subsequently, a GMC SUV traveling straight ahead struck a 36-year-old pedestrian head-on, causing contusions and crush injuries to his knee, lower leg, and foot. The pedestrian was conscious at the scene. The report cites 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as a contributing factor for both the moped and SUV drivers. Additionally, the pedestrian was noted for 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Turning Improperly,' while the bicyclist was cited for 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Traffic Control Disregarded.'

The protest, organized by Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives, took place under the 7 train. Jaqi Cohen of Tri-State Transportation Campaign declared, “She can't ignore the needs of New York's eight million transit riders.” Restaurant owner Michael Fuquay said, “You want to know how my employees get to work? They walk, they bike, they take the bus.” State Assembly candidate Claire Valdez called the move “a slap in the face to millions who use public transit.” The MTA’s capital plan, including long-awaited elevator upgrades at 46 St-Bliss St and 33 St-Rawson, now hangs in the balance. Protesters condemned the governor’s action as a blow to vulnerable New Yorkers who depend on safe, reliable transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Yamaha motorcycle, traveling straight ahead, struck the truck's right rear bumper. The 26-year-old motorcyclist, wearing a helmet, was ejected from his bike.
