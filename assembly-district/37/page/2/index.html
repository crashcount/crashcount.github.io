Thirty seriously hurt.</strong> Over 2,500 injured. This is Assembly District 37 since 2022. The dead include a 16-year-old girl crossing at an intersection, a cyclist crushed by a turning truck, an 8-year-old in the back seat, and a 75-year-old man who never made it home. The list grows.

She backed a bill for <strong>complete streets</strong>, demanding roads built for people, not just cars <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">A 1077</a>. She signed on to a bill for automated bike lane enforcement. These are steps. But the blood on the street is not washed away by bills waiting in committee. <strong>No law has passed.
