The dead include a 16-year-old girl crossing at an intersection, a cyclist crushed by a turning truck, an 8-year-old in the back seat, and a 75-year-old man who never made it home. The list grows.

Trucks crush, mopeds and motorcycles add to the toll, and bikes are not spared. The violence is not random. It is relentless. It happens on Skillman, Greenpoint, Laurel Hill, Queens Boulevard. It happens in the crosswalk, at the curb, in the bike lane.

She backed a bill for <strong>complete streets</strong>, demanding roads built for people, not just cars <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">A 1077</a>. She signed on to a bill for automated bike lane enforcement. These are steps. But the blood on the street is not washed away by bills waiting in committee. <strong>No law has passed.
