The LIE logged 476 injuries and 12 serious injuries, with <strong>two deaths</strong> in this district’s slice, making it a top hotspot. The <a href=#>Brooklyn‑Queens Expressway</a> added 202 injuries and another death in the same period. These are not one‑offs. They are the spine of harm.</li><li>The hours tell their own story. Injuries stack up through the afternoon rush and into the night, with sharp spikes at 2 p.m., 4 p.m., and 5 p.m. The body count climbs again late, including deaths logged around 10 a.m., 11 a.m., 4 p.m., 5 p.m., and 10 p.m. The pattern is steady.
