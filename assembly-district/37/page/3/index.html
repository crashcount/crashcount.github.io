Thirty seriously hurt.</strong> Over 2,500 injured. This is Assembly District 37 since 2022. The dead include a 16-year-old girl crossing at an intersection, a cyclist crushed by a turning truck, an 8-year-old in the back seat, and a 75-year-old man who never made it home. The list grows.

Trucks crush, mopeds and motorcycles add to the toll, and bikes are not spared. The violence is not random. It is relentless. It happens on Skillman, Greenpoint, Laurel Hill, Queens Boulevard. It happens in the crosswalk, at the curb, in the bike lane. It happens to the young and the old.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Assembly Member Claire Valdez has put her name to bills that could matter.

She backed a bill for <strong>complete streets</strong>, demanding roads built for people, not just cars <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">A 1077</a>. She signed on to a bill for automated bike lane enforcement. These are steps. But the blood on the street is not washed away by bills waiting in committee. <strong>No law has passed. No street is safer until action is real.</strong></p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Valdez. Call the council.
