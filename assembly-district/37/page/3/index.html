Thirty-three more are left with serious injuries.</strong> In the past twelve months, two people have died and twelve have been seriously hurt on these streets. The youngest was sixteen. The oldest was seventy-five. Some never made it home from work. Some never made it to school. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the highest price.</strong> Cars and trucks did the most damage—killing and maiming with metal and speed. Trucks crushed legs and lives. SUVs turned and did not see. A sedan made a left and a girl was gone. A box truck took a cyclist at the corner of Greenpoint and 43rd. The numbers are steady. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Assembly Member Claire Valdez has moved on key bills. She co-sponsored a law to force speed limiters on repeat speeders. She backed cameras to keep bike lanes clear. She voted to extend and expand school speed zones and speed cameras. These are steps. They are not enough. The streets are still not safe for the old, the young, or anyone outside a car.</p><p>But there are cracks. Valdez also voted to weaken bus rules, a move that puts more people at risk. She backed exemptions for some drivers in bus lanes. Each carve-out is a risk written into law. Each delay is another family waiting for news that never comes.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. The state can force the worst drivers off the road. Residents can demand more. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call Assembly Member Valdez. Tell them: <strong>No more names on the list. No more waiting.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
