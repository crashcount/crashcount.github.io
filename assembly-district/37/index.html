The LIE logged 476 injuries and 12 serious injuries, with <strong>two deaths</strong> in this district’s slice, making it a top hotspot. The <a href=#>Brooklyn‑Queens Expressway</a> added 202 injuries and another death in the same period. These are not one‑offs. They are the spine of harm.</li><li>The hours tell their own story. Injuries stack up through the afternoon rush and into the night, with sharp spikes at 2 p.m., 4 p.m., and 5 p.m. The body count climbs again late, including deaths logged around 10 a.m., 11 a.m., 4 p.m., 5 p.m., and 10 p.m. The pattern is steady. The pain does not keep office hours. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a>.</li></ul><p>Greenpoint and 47th: a right turn, a left turn, a body</p><ul><li>July 18, 2024, late morning at Greenpoint Avenue and 43 Street. A box truck made a right. A 28‑year‑old on an e‑bike was going straight. She was killed. The record lists “Driver Inattention/Distraction.” It also records the turn. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash 4741425</a>.</li><li>June 26, 2024, mid‑afternoon at 47 Avenue and 46 Street. A driver making a left struck a 16‑year‑old in the intersection. She died of crush injuries. The file notes an obstructed view. The turn still happened. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash 4735938</a>.</li></ul><p>Heavy metal, soft bodies</p><ul><li>Trucks and buses do outsized harm. In pedestrian injuries, trucks are linked to two deaths in this district dataset, with 21 total pedestrian casualties attributed to trucks; SUVs and sedans account for many more injuries and deaths combined. The mode split shows four deaths tied to “Other Motorized” and five to vehicle occupants, with cyclists and pedestrians each at four. People outside vehicles keep losing. <a href=#district-stats-cite>District stats</a>.</li><li>Night hours are cruel. From 10 p.m. to midnight, injuries stay high and deaths recur. At 11 p.m., injuries total 127 with two serious injuries; deaths hit two at 10 p.m. and one at 11 p.m. The numbers read like a metronome. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a>.</li></ul><p>Names on the ledger</p><ul><li>March 9, 2024, Laurel Hill Boulevard at 49 Street.

Harden merges. Slow approaches. Keep trucks in lanes that spare local exits.</li><li>On Greenpoint Avenue and 47 Avenue, daylight corners, add leading pedestrian/bike intervals, and harden turns so trucks cannot sweep wide. These are basic tools. They stop the turning strikes that keep killing.</li><li>Nights are bloody here. Target night operations at repeat hotspots with speed cameras where allowed and physical calming where cameras can’t reach. The hourly curve says it plainly. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a>.</li></ul><p>Power must move</p><ul><li>Albany extended school speed protections in June 2025. Senator Andrew Gounardes moved <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>S 8344</a> through, and lawmakers voted yes to keep kids safer near schools. The tools exist. They need to be used at full force.</li><li>Citywide, two steps cut the bloodshed. First, a lower default speed. Second, speed limiters for repeat offenders.</li><li>The Assembly has a live bill to force speed limiters on the worst drivers. <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">A 2299</a> would require intelligent speed assistance after point and camera‑ticket thresholds. It is aimed at the tiny slice doing outsized harm. Advocates have shown that a small cohort racks up violations and carnage; the linkage between extreme ticket histories and deadly risk is documented. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/20/the-1-5-percent-of-drivers-who-cause-21-percent-of-pedestrian-deaths>Streetsblog</a> reported that 1.5% of motorists cause 21% of pedestrian deaths.</li></ul><p>This district’s map is a ledger of grief. Highways roar. Trucks turn. People don’t get up. The fixes are known. <strong>Slow the streets. Stop the repeat offenders.</strong></p><p>Take one step now: tell City Hall and Albany to act.
