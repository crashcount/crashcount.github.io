Thirty seriously hurt.</strong> Over 2,500 injured. This is Assembly District 37 since 2022. The dead include a 16-year-old girl crossing at an intersection, a cyclist crushed by a turning truck, an 8-year-old in the back seat, and a 75-year-old man who never made it home. The list grows.

She backed a bill for <strong>complete streets</strong>, demanding roads built for people, not just cars <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">A 1077</a>. She signed on to a bill for automated bike lane enforcement. These are steps. But the blood on the street is not washed away by bills waiting in committee. <strong>No law has passed.

Anger burned over lost upgrades, broken promises, and a system that favors drivers over straphangers.</p><p class=mb3>On June 11, 2024, three dozen Queens residents rallied against Governor Hochul’s last-minute decision to pause congestion pricing. The protest, organized by Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives, took place under the 7 train. Jaqi Cohen of Tri-State Transportation Campaign declared, “She can't ignore the needs of New York's eight million transit riders.” Restaurant owner Michael Fuquay said, “You want to know how my employees get to work? They walk, they bike, they take the bus.” State Assembly candidate Claire Valdez called the move “a slap in the face to millions who use public transit.” The MTA’s capital plan, including long-awaited elevator upgrades at 46 St-Bliss St and 33 St-Rawson, now hangs in the balance. Protesters condemned the governor’s action as a blow to vulnerable New Yorkers who depend on safe, reliable transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Yamaha motorcycle, traveling straight ahead, struck the truck's right rear bumper. The 26-year-old motorcyclist, wearing a helmet, was ejected from his bike. The helmet cracked on impact, and the rider suffered fatal injuries to his entire body. The police report lists 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as a contributing factor, pointing to a critical driver error by the truck operator during the lane change. The report does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor. The violence of the impact and the disregard for traffic control combined to end a young life on a highway built for speed, not safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
