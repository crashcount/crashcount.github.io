The dead include a 16-year-old girl crossing at an intersection, a cyclist crushed by a turning truck, an 8-year-old in the back seat, and a 75-year-old man who never made it home. The list grows.

She backed a bill for <strong>complete streets</strong>, demanding roads built for people, not just cars <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">A 1077</a>. She signed on to a bill for automated bike lane enforcement. These are steps. But the blood on the street is not washed away by bills waiting in committee. <strong>No law has passed.

The panel condemned the rollback of protections for immigrants and the firing of NLRB board member Gwynne A. Wilcox. Velázquez declared, 'We’ll see him in court,' after Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy revoked federal approval for congestion pricing. She pledged to fight budget cuts targeting vulnerable communities and criticized tax breaks for the wealthy. Julie Won joined the call for grassroots activism.

They walk, they bike, they take the bus.” State Assembly candidate Claire Valdez called the move “a slap in the face to millions who use public transit.” The MTA’s capital plan, including long-awaited elevator upgrades at 46 St-Bliss St and 33 St-Rawson, now hangs in the balance.
