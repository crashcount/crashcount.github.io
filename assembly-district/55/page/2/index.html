Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. Cars and SUVs did most of the harm, but trucks, bikes, and mopeds all left bodies broken. The dead are not numbers.

Most accept crashes and pollution as normal. The same harms spark outrage elsewhere. This double standard leaves pedestrians and cyclists in the crosshairs. The culture shields drivers, not victims.</p><p class=mb3>On January 19, 2023, researchers published a report in the Journal of Environment and Health, dissecting public attitudes toward driving dangers. The study, led by environmental psychologist Ian Walker, surveyed over 2,000 British adults. It found that 61 percent of respondents accepted driving risks as natural, while far fewer tolerated similar hazards at work or from smoking. The article, titled 'The Dangers of Driving Are Way More Normalized Than We Think,' highlights what Walker calls 'motonormativity'—a cultural blind spot that excuses harm from cars. Walker urges policy changes: 'Build a street where people can't speed... you won't have speeding.' The research shows that society’s deep-rooted car bias endangers vulnerable road users and blocks reforms that could save lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
