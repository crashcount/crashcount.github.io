Nine hundred thirty-eight were hurt. Eleven suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. The dead include the old and the young. The numbers do not flinch: in just the past year, <strong>crashes rose by 31%</strong> and injuries by nearly 37% (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p><strong>The horror is not abstract.</strong> On July 3rd, a 36-year-old man was crossing near Broadway and East New York Avenue.

His son, Larnce Vargas, stood at the scene and asked, &ldquo;There are so many cameras. So why is he still at large, if there&rsquo;s so many cameras?

She co-sponsored bills to require safer street designs for all users (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">File A 1077</a>). But she also voted to <a href=#citations>weaken bus rules</a>, a step that puts pedestrians and cyclists at greater risk. The work is not finished.

The vehicle struck a 28-year-old woman who was crossing the intersection with the signal. The report states her shoulder and upper arm were crushed beneath the moped’s center front end, causing significant injury. The pedestrian remained conscious at the scene. The police report cites 'Traffic Control Disregarded' and 'Driver Inexperience' as contributing factors to the crash. The woman’s actions—crossing with the signal—are noted in the report, but only after the driver’s failures.

Most accept crashes and pollution as normal. The same harms spark outrage elsewhere. This double standard leaves pedestrians and cyclists in the crosshairs. The culture shields drivers, not victims.</p><p class=mb3>On January 19, 2023, researchers published a report in the Journal of Environment and Health, dissecting public attitudes toward driving dangers. The study, led by environmental psychologist Ian Walker, surveyed over 2,000 British adults. It found that 61 percent of respondents accepted driving risks as natural, while far fewer tolerated similar hazards at work or from smoking. The article, titled 'The Dangers of Driving Are Way More Normalized Than We Think,' highlights what Walker calls 'motonormativity'—a cultural blind spot that excuses harm from cars. Walker urges policy changes: 'Build a street where people can't speed... you won't have speeding.' The research shows that society’s deep-rooted car bias endangers vulnerable road users and blocks reforms that could save lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
