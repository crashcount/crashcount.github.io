He never makes it. Larry Maxwell, 72, is struck and killed on Sutter Avenue by a driver fleeing another crash. The driver keeps going. Maxwell’s son, Larnce Vargas, stands at the scene, police and EMS between him and his father. “There are so many cameras. So why is he still at large, if there&rsquo;s so many cameras? Y&rsquo;all can find any and everybody else, but y&rsquo;all can&rsquo;t find him. That don&rsquo;t make sense.” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/15/brooklyn-hit-and-run-victim-72-killed-on-his-way-to-family-cookout-larry-maxwelll-brownsville/>asked Maxwell’s son</a>.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>three people have died</strong> in crashes in AD 55. <strong>Seven more suffered serious injuries.</strong> There have been <strong>723 injuries</strong> and <strong>1,254 crashes</strong>.

He runs a stop sign. He hits a school bus. He flees, leaving her to die in the front seat. Brooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez calls it what it is: “The tragic loss of Imani Vance was allegedly caused by the defendant&rsquo;s reckless decision to ignore a stop sign and drive at excessive speeds. His actions showed a shocking disregard for human life and safety, made worse by his attempt to flee the scene instead of helping the victim.” <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/driver-charged-east-new-york-hit-and-run/>said DA Gonzalez</a>.</p><p>The streets do not forgive. In AD 55, the most vulnerable—pedestrians, children, cyclists—pay the price. Cars and SUVs cause most injuries. Trucks, bikes, mopeds, and buses add to the toll. The violence is relentless.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-miles-to-go>Leadership: Steps Forward, Miles to Go</h2><p>Assembly Member Latrice Walker has <strong>co-sponsored bills</strong> to require safer street design for all users (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">A 1077</a>, <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1280&amp;term=2023">A 1280</a>). She voted yes to expand speed cameras near schools (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">A 7652</a>). These are steps. But the deaths keep coming. The bills sit.

The vehicle struck a 28-year-old woman who was crossing the intersection with the signal. The report states her shoulder and upper arm were crushed beneath the moped’s center front end, causing significant injury. The pedestrian remained conscious at the scene. The police report cites 'Traffic Control Disregarded' and 'Driver Inexperience' as contributing factors to the crash. The woman’s actions—crossing with the signal—are noted in the report, but only after the driver’s failures. The collision underscores the lethal consequences when drivers ignore traffic controls in Brooklyn’s crosswalks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
