In the past twelve months, four people died and 704 were injured in crashes here. Five suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. The dead do not speak. The living carry scars.</p><p>Just last week, a driver struck a 36-year-old man at Broadway and East New York Avenue. The driver kept going. The man died at Brookdale Hospital. Police are still looking for the killer. As one witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/04/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-man-36-in-brooklyn-crash/>asked</a>, “There are so many cameras. So why is he still at large?”</p><p>In May, Larry Maxwell, 72, was killed crossing Sutter Avenue. He was on his way to a family cookout. The driver who hit him had just fled another crash. Maxwell’s son <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/15/brooklyn-hit-and-run-victim-72-killed-on-his-way-to-family-cookout-larry-maxwelll-brownsville/>said</a>, “I was just on the phone with him. We just finished watching the Knicks game&mldr; He got struck right in front of the building.”</p><h2 id=patterns-of-harm-who-pays-the-price>Patterns of Harm: Who Pays the Price</h2><p>In AD 55, the most vulnerable pay first. Children and elders are not spared. In the last year, 68 people under 18 and 20 people over 75 were injured. Cars and SUVs cause most of the pain—408 pedestrian injuries and one death—but trucks, bikes, and mopeds also leave bodies broken. The numbers do not lie. The pattern does not change.</p><h2 id=leadership-what-has-been-done-what-must-be-done>Leadership: What Has Been Done, What Must Be Done</h2><p>Assembly Member Latrice Walker has <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored bills</a> to require safer street design for all users, <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1280&amp;term=2023">supported additional legislation</a>, and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">voted to expand school speed cameras</a>. These are steps, not solutions. The dead do not wait for committee hearings. The injured do not heal with promises.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-make-them-hear-you>Call to Action: Make Them Hear You</h2><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call Assembly Member Walker. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit, real street redesign, and enforcement that targets the drivers who do the most harm. Do not let another family plan a funeral because leaders moved too slow.</p><p>Act now. The next name could be yours.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report does not specify any additional driver errors or contributing factors beyond the driver’s license status. The pedestrian was not at an intersection and was crossing without a signal or crosswalk, but the police report does not list these as contributing factors—only as the location and action. The collision underscores the dangers faced by pedestrians on city streets, especially when drivers lack full licensure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
