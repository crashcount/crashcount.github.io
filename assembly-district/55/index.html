The crash involved a bus, a sedan with Georgia plates, and a parked box truck. The Open Data record lists the sedan’s driver as unlicensed. The woman was the front passenger. She didn’t make it. The case is in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city crash data</a> as CrashID 4795300.</p><h3 id=sutter-and-osborn-a-hitandrun-a-name>Sutter and Osborn: a hit‑and‑run, a name</h3><p>On May 10, Larry Maxwell, 72, was crossing with the signal at Sutter Avenue and Osborn Street. A driver fleeing a prior collision hit him and ran. Maxwell died at Brookdale. His son asked, “There are so many cameras. So why is he still at large?” The NYPD says no arrests. Read the family’s words in the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/15/brooklyn-hit-and-run-victim-72-killed-on-his-way-to-family-cookout-larry-maxwelll-brownsville/>Daily News</a>.</p><p>The same killing was first reported as a hit‑and‑run near the corner, the driver gone before anyone could catch a plate. That account is also in the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/14/elderly-man-mowed-down-by-driver-in-brooklyn-fleeing-another-collision/>Daily News</a>.</p><h3 id=broadway-and-east-new-york-ave-another-man-down-driver-flees>Broadway and East New York Ave: another man down, driver flees</h3><p>On July 3, a 36‑year‑old man was hit near Broadway and East New York Avenue. A gray Ford hit him and sped off. He died at Brookdale. Police said it was the second hit‑and‑run in 24 hours. That night is documented by <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a> (CrashID 4825128) and reported by the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/04/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-man-36-in-brooklyn-crash/>Daily News</a> and <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brownsville-crash-police-searching-driver-deadly-hit-run-collision-brooklyn-nyc/16949967/>ABC7</a>.</p><h3 id=pitkin-and-strauss-the-night-took-another-rider>Pitkin and Strauss: the night took another rider</h3><p>At 3:59 a.m. on August 5, a 29‑year‑old motorcyclist was killed at Pitkin Avenue and Strauss Street. The data shows a westbound motorcycle and a southbound Ford sedan turning left. The rider was ejected and died at the scene. It’s in city records as <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4833031</a>. Gothamist noted police were “still investigating exactly how the crash unfolded” on <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-investigating-separate-collisions-that-left-2-dead-teen-critical-early-tuesday>August 5</a>.</p><h3 id=where-it-keeps-happening>Where it keeps happening</h3><p>The map says Eastern Parkway and Broadway rack up injuries. Eastern Parkway shows 211 injuries along the corridor; another cluster shows 59 injuries on “EASTERN PKWY” and 69 on “BROADWAY.” Van Sinderen Avenue is where two people died. These are listed in the district’s top locations in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>The clock tells another story. Injuries stack up from the school trip home through the evening. Peaks hit 4 p.m. to 7 p.m., with deaths logged at 1 p.m., 6–8 a.m., 7 p.m., and 9 p.m. A body at 3 a.m. too. That hourly spread comes straight from the district roll‑up in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a>.</p><h3 id=who-gets-hit-and-by-what>Who gets hit, and by what</h3><p>In this district since 2022, pedestrians absorbed 531 reported injuries and two deaths. Cyclists logged 184 injuries. Motor vehicle occupants fill hospital beds by the thousands. Sedans are the leading strike vehicle for pedestrians, tied to two pedestrian deaths and 232 total pedestrian injuries; SUVs add another 124 pedestrian injuries. Trucks and buses account for dozens more. These counts come from the local mode split and vehicle roll‑up in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a>.</p><p>The causes line is blunt. “Other” swallows most cases, with 4 deaths and 914 injuries. Police tagged failure to yield and red‑light running in dozens more. Distraction shows up too. That’s the district’s contributing factor table in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=what-could-stop-the-next-one>What could stop the next one</h3><p>Fix the corners where people bleed. Daylight the crosswalks on Broadway and East New York Avenue. Harden the turns on Sutter and Osborn. Give leading pedestrian intervals on Van Sinderen and Blake, and keep trucks out of the crosswalk. Target repeat crash blocks for speed cameras where the data shows peaks.</p><p>Albany extended 24‑hour school‑zone cameras this June. Lawmakers passed S 8344 to keep those protections in place. That’s on <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Open States</a>. The city can go further. Lower speeds save lives. A citywide 20 mph default and speed limiters for the worst repeat offenders would match the harm to the tool.</p><p>One son put it in plain words after his father died on Sutter Avenue: “There are so many cameras. So why is he still at large?” His question stands in the street where he said it. The rest is paperwork and time.</p><h3 id=push-the-fixes-that-save-lives>Push the fixes that save lives</h3><ul><li>Lower the default speed limit citywide under Sammy’s Law. Demand it now. See our <a href=/take_action/>action guide</a>.</li><li>Require intelligent speed assistance for repeat speeders. Back the bills that force the worst drivers to slow down.</li><li>Focus redesigns and enforcement where the bodies fall: Broadway, Eastern Parkway, Van Sinderen.</li></ul></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
