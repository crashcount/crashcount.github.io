He never makes it across Sutter Avenue. Larry Maxwell, 72, is struck and left dying in the street. His son, Larnce Vargas, stands at the scene, police and EMS between him and his father. “There are so many cameras. So why is he still at large, if there&rsquo;s so many cameras? Y&rsquo;all can find any and everybody else, but y&rsquo;all can&rsquo;t find him. That don&rsquo;t make sense.” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/15/brooklyn-hit-and-run-victim-72-killed-on-his-way-to-family-cookout-larry-maxwelll-brownsville/>Vargas told the Daily News</a>.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>2 people have died and 6 have been seriously injured</strong> on the streets of Assembly District 55. There have been <strong>1,263 crashes</strong> and <strong>732 injuries</strong>. The numbers are blunt. The pain is not.</p><h2 id=the-young-the-old-the-unprotected>The Young, the Old, the Unprotected</h2><p>A 26-year-old woman, Imani Vance, dies in the front seat of a Mercedes on Van Sinderen Avenue. The driver, unlicensed, runs a stop sign, slams into a school bus, and flees. “The tragic loss of Imani Vance was allegedly caused by the defendant&rsquo;s reckless decision to ignore a stop sign and drive at excessive speeds,” <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/driver-charged-east-new-york-hit-and-run/>said Brooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez</a>. The bus driver survives. The family plans a funeral. The intersection waits for the next crash.</p><p>Pedestrians bleed on the sidewalk. Cyclists go down hard. Children are not spared. In the last year, <strong>65 people under 18 were injured</strong> in crashes here. Cars and trucks do most of the harm, but buses, bikes, and mopeds leave their mark too.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Assembly Member Latrice Walker has <strong>co-sponsored bills</strong> to bring safer street design to all users (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">A 1077</a>, <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1280&amp;term=2023">A 1280</a>). She voted yes to <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">expand school speed cameras in Schenectady</a>. These are steps. But the blood on the street says it is not enough. The cameras that catch speeders do not always catch killers. The laws that promise safety do not bring it fast enough.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>Every crash is preventable. Every death is a failure.</strong></p><p>Call Assembly Member Walker. Call the Mayor. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand more speed cameras, not just in Schenectady, but here, where the bodies fall. Join <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> or <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Stand with the families who have lost. Do not wait for the next siren.</p><p><strong>The street will not change itself.

Maxwell was heading to a family cookout when a driver, fleeing another crash, struck him and left the scene. The article quotes Maxwell’s son, Larnce Vargas: “There are so many cameras. So why is he still at large?” Despite surveillance in the area, the driver remains unidentified. The incident highlights gaps in enforcement and the persistent danger for pedestrians, even near their homes. The crash underscores the lethal risk posed by drivers who flee collisions and the limits of current city surveillance and response.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
