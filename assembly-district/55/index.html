A gray Ford hit him and kept going. He died at Brookdale Hospital. The driver vanished into the night. Police are still searching. As of that day, 55 pedestrians had been killed crossing city streets this year—eight fewer than last year, but the bodies keep coming. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/04/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-man-36-in-brooklyn-crash/>A hit-and-run driver struck and killed a 36-year-old man crossing a Brooklyn street, officials said Friday.</a></p><p>In May, Larry Maxwell, 72, was heading to a family cookout in Brownsville. A driver fleeing another crash struck him in front of his building. His son ran to the scene. Police and EMS blocked his way. Larry was alive, broken hip, bruised lung. He died soon after. The driver was never found. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/15/brooklyn-hit-and-run-victim-72-killed-on-his-way-to-family-cookout-larry-maxwelll-brownsville/>There are so many cameras. So why is he still at large?&mldr; That don&rsquo;t make sense.</a></p><p>In the last year, five people have died and 798 have been injured in crashes in AD 55. Nine suffered serious injuries. Most were walking or riding. The dead do not get second chances.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-blind-spots>Leadership: Progress and Blind Spots</h3><p>Assembly Member Latrice Walker has voted to extend and expand school speed cameras, and backed bills for safer street design. She co-sponsored measures to make streets safer for everyone, not just drivers. She voted yes to extend school speed zones, aiming to protect children. But she also voted to weaken bus rules, a move that puts pedestrians and cyclists at greater risk.</p><p>The numbers do not lie. Cars and SUVs caused the most harm—over 400 injuries, two deaths. Trucks and buses, motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes all played their part, but the weight of the carnage falls on four wheels.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-demand-more>The Next Step: Demand More</h3><p>The crisis is not fate. It is policy. It is enforcement. It is the will to act. Call Assembly Member Walker. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph citywide speed limit. Demand real protection for people on foot and bike.</p><p>Every day of delay is another day of blood on the street. The dead cannot speak.
