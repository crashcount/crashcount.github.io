Nine left with injuries so grave they may never walk the same.</strong> The names fade, but the numbers do not. In the past twelve months, 801 people have been hurt in 1,353 crashes.

A car hit him and kept going. He died at Brookdale Hospital. The driver vanished. Police are still looking.

The answer is silence.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-and-gaps>Leadership: Votes and Gaps</h3><p>Assembly Member Latrice Walker has voted to extend school speed zones and expand speed cameras, moves that help shield children and families. She co-sponsored bills to require safer street designs for all users. These are steps, not solutions. In June, Walker voted to weaken bus lane rules, a move that puts pedestrians and cyclists at greater risk.</p><p><strong>The dead keep coming. The policies move slow.</strong></p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Assembly Member Walker. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people outside cars. Join <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Stand with the living. Remember the dead. The street will not change itself.</p><p><strong>Act now.
