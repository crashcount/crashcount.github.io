It hit Kevin Cruickshank as he rode his bike. It hit May Kwok as she sat on a bench. Both died where they fell. The driver and her passenger tried to run. Police found guns and a bottle of liquor in the car. The city called it a tragedy. The city promised changes. But the dead stay dead.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;A stolen vehicle, allegedly driven at more than 100 miles per hour&mldr;crashed into them.&rdquo;<br>— <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/07/chinatown-deadly-crash-safety-upgrades-canal-street>NY1</a></p></blockquote><h2 id=the-toll-grows>The Toll Grows</h2><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>two people have died and 605 have been injured</strong> in crashes in AD 65. Twelve suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Cyclists, children, the old—no one is spared. Trucks, SUVs, sedans, bikes, mopeds: all have left bodies broken on these streets. The numbers do not stop. The pain does not fade.</p><h2 id=promises-and-votes>Promises and Votes</h2><p>Assembly Member Grace Lee has voted to keep school speed zones and expand speed cameras. She has co-sponsored bills for safer street design and bus lane enforcement. She has backed more stroller space on buses for parents and children. But she has also voted to <strong>weaken bus rules</strong>, making it easier for some to block the lanes that keep buses—and people—moving. She voted to <strong>exempt some employees from bus lane rules</strong>. Each vote has a cost. Each delay means another family left to mourn.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Canal Street is only as safe as its most dangerous block, and even after these changes, the vast majority of the corridor will remain deadly.&rdquo;<br>— <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Ben Furnas, via Gothamist</a></p></blockquote><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Assembly Member Grace Lee. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand bus lanes that work. Demand streets where benches are not death traps. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The fuselage, rotor, and tail tore loose. Loud bangs echoed. The craft plunged. No black box. No warning. Only fragments and silence left behind.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News reported on May 7, 2025, that federal officials released images showing a sightseeing helicopter breaking apart in midair before crashing into the Hudson River, killing six. The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
