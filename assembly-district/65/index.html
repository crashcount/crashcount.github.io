Twenty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> In three years, there have been 3,600 crashes. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, parents, children. A woman crushed on Canal Street. A cyclist thrown from his bike at Broome and Centre. Four pedestrians killed at once by a pickup on Jackson and Water. The youngest was eleven. The oldest was eighty-one. The street does not care about age.</p><h2 id=the-system-respondsor-doesnt>The System Responds—Or Doesn’t</h2><p><strong>Grace Lee, the district’s Assembly Member, has taken some steps.</strong> She co-sponsored bills to require safer street design for all users, not just drivers. She voted yes on a bill to expand school speed cameras, a move that targets speeding near children (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">voted yes on a bill to expand school speed cameras</a>). But the pace is slow. The streets stay dangerous. The city and state talk about Vision Zero, but the bodies keep coming. <strong>&ldquo;Every user deserves safe passage,&rdquo;</strong> the bill says (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">the bill says</a>), but sidewalks and crosswalks remain killing fields.</p><h2 id=blame-and-burden>Blame and Burden</h2><p>The NYPD has started issuing criminal summonses to cyclists and e-bike riders. Now, a ticket means a day in criminal court, not just a fine. <strong>&ldquo;Under the new policy, a person issued a criminal summons must turn up in person in criminal court,&rdquo;</strong> the paper <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/road-war-nypd-now-handing-out-criminal-summonses-to-bikers-for-traffic-violations-IE4565820>reports</a>. The city cracks down on the most vulnerable, while drivers keep killing. Trucks, SUVs, sedans—these are the weapons. <strong>Four killed by a pickup. One by an SUV turning right. One by a truck at dawn.</strong></p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> The blood on Delancey and Canal is not an accident. It is the cost of delay, of half-measures, of blaming the wrong people. <strong>Call Grace Lee. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real street redesign. Demand enforcement that targets danger, not the desperate.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another child’s name to be added to the list.

The fuselage, rotor, and tail tore loose. Loud bangs echoed. The craft plunged. No black box. No warning. Only fragments and silence left behind.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News reported on May 7, 2025, that federal officials released images showing a sightseeing helicopter breaking apart in midair before crashing into the Hudson River, killing six. The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
