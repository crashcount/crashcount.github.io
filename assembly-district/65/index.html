Two lives ended. May Kwok, 63, sat on a bench. Kevin Cruickshank, 55, rode his bike. The car jumped the curb. The driver ran. Police found an open bottle of tequila and two pistols in the wreck. The street was left stained and silent. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/22/chinatown-hit-run-crash-murder-autumn-donna-ascension-romero-kennedy-lecraft/>&ldquo;They then tried to flee the scene followed by multiple eyewitnesses who told them to stop and come back because they had just killed two people.&rdquo;</a></p><p>This was not the first time. It will not be the last. Canal Street is a funnel for speeding, chaos, and death. Advocates have begged for change. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/21/stuckatdot-canal-street-carnage-continues-as-fixes-flounder>&ldquo;City Hall knows that Canal Street is one of the most dangerous in our city, but they&rsquo;ve stalled any improvements over and over again. Spinelessly ignoring a public health emergency puts every New Yorker at risk.&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h3><p>In the last 12 months, 2 people died and 12 were seriously injured in crashes in AD 65. There were 594 injuries and 1,207 crashes. Most victims were walking or riding. Cars and trucks did the most harm, but bikes and motorcycles left scars too. The dead do not care about the vehicle type. They are just gone.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-and-silence>Leadership: Votes and Silence</h3><p>Assembly Member Grace Lee has voted to extend and expand school speed cameras, and co-sponsored bills for safer streets. She backed bus lane enforcement and &ldquo;complete streets&rdquo; design. But she also voted to weaken bus rules, making it easier for some to break the law. The blood on Canal Street is not just from one crash. It is from years of delay, half-measures, and compromise.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now</h3><p>No more vigils. No more empty words. Call Assembly Member Grace Lee. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes and pedestrian space on Canal. Demand action, not studies.

The change means accused riders must appear in criminal court, not just pay a fine. The move follows the death of Priscilla Loke, struck by an e-bike in 2023. Advocates like Transportation Alternatives call the new policy 'a dangerous escalation.' The NYC E-Vehicle Safety Alliance urges lawmakers to require license plates for e-bikes and scooters.

The shift highlights growing tension over enforcement and the push for stricter regulation after high-profile crashes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Only fragments and silence left behind.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News reported on May 7, 2025, that federal officials released images showing a sightseeing helicopter breaking apart in midair before crashing into the Hudson River, killing six. The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
