Just last week, a hit-and-run at a Canal Street intersection killed a pedestrian and a cyclist. The driver fled. The bodies stayed. The crash, said a reporter, is &ldquo;raising questions about a bigger safety problem at an intersection of Canal Street&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/vigil-held-for-pedestrian-cyclist-killed-in-chinatown-hit-and-run/>CBS New York</a>).</p><p>On the Manhattan Bridge, a speeding car ended two lives. Kevin Cruickshank set out on his yellow taxicab bike for a ride to Coney Island. He never made it. His sister spoke at the vigil: &ldquo;His trip was cut short at an intersection known to some to be very dangerous. It is time to make this known to all and time for the city to take action&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/manhattan-bridge-crash-driver-faces-murder-rap-marte-blasts-dot-for-neglect-KB4883851>West Side Spirit</a>).</p><h2 id=the-numbers-behind-the-blood>The Numbers Behind the Blood</h2><p><strong>Since 2022, twelve people have died and thirty have been seriously injured in 3,989 crashes in AD 65.</strong> Most victims are not in cars. They are on foot, on bikes, or waiting for a light. Cars and SUVs did the most harm—three deaths, nine serious injuries. Trucks and buses killed four. Bikes killed one. The numbers do not lie. The city’s most vulnerable pay the price for speed and neglect.</p><h2 id=what-has-grace-lee-done>What Has Grace Lee Done?</h2><p>Assembly Member Grace Lee has voted to extend and expand school speed cameras, co-sponsored bills for safer street design, and backed bus lane enforcement. She voted yes to extend school speed zones, a move meant to protect children and others near schools (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Open States</a>). She also supported expanding bus stroller access, making transit safer for families. But Lee has also voted to weaken some bus rules, risking more danger for those outside cars. The work is not done. The deaths keep coming.</p><h2 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next? No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> The dead cannot speak. The living must. <strong>Call Assembly Member Grace Lee. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph citywide speed limit. Demand real protection for people outside cars.</strong> The blood on the street is not an act of God. It is a choice. Change it.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
