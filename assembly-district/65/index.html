Twenty-nine left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 1,700 hurt since 2022. The dead do not speak, but the silence is heavy. A cyclist, age 44, killed at Centre and Broome. Three pedestrians crushed on Jackson Street. An 81-year-old man, struck crossing Delancey, never made it home. The youngest victim was eleven. The oldest, eighty-one. <strong>No one is spared.</strong></p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do most of the damage.</strong> SUVs and sedans alone took three lives and wounded hundreds. Trucks killed four. Bikes and mopeds, too, have left scars—one dead, dozens hurt. But the weight of steel and speed falls hardest on those outside the car. The streets are not safe for the old, the young, or anyone on foot or bike. The numbers are not just numbers. They are bodies, broken and gone.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-and-silence>Leadership: Votes and Silence</h3><p>Assembly Member Grace Lee has voted to <strong>extend and expand school speed cameras</strong>—&ldquo;boosting safety for children&rdquo; and &ldquo;improving child pedestrian safety&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>speed camera legislation</a>). She co-sponsored bills for safer street design and bus lane enforcement. But she also voted to <strong>weaken bus rules</strong>, a move that &ldquo;increases pedestrian and cyclist risk&rdquo;. The record is mixed. The work is not done.</p><h3 id=the-system-fails-again-and-again>The System Fails, Again and Again</h3><p>The NYPD has started issuing <strong>criminal summonses to cyclists</strong> for low-level violations. &ldquo;Under the new policy, a person issued a criminal summons must turn up in person in criminal court&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/road-war-nypd-now-handing-out-criminal-summonses-to-bikers-for-traffic-violations-IE4565820>NYPD summons policy</a>).

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
