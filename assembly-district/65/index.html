It hit Kevin Cruickshank as he rode his bike. It hit May Kwok as she sat on a bench. Both died where they fell. The driver and her passenger tried to run. Police found guns and a bottle of liquor in the car. The city called it a tragedy. The city promised changes.

She voted to <strong>exempt some employees from bus lane rules</strong>. Each vote has a cost.

Riders and pedestrians caught in the crossfire.</p><p class=mb3>West Side Spirit reported on May 13, 2025, that NYPD has begun issuing criminal summonses, not just traffic tickets, to cyclists and e-bike riders for violations like running red lights or riding on sidewalks. The change means accused riders must appear in criminal court, not just pay a fine. The move follows the death of Priscilla Loke, struck by an e-bike in 2023. Advocates like Transportation Alternatives call the new policy 'a dangerous escalation.' The NYC E-Vehicle Safety Alliance urges lawmakers to require license plates for e-bikes and scooters. The article notes, 'Under the new policy, a person issued a criminal summons must turn up in person in criminal court.' The shift highlights growing tension over enforcement and the push for stricter regulation after high-profile crashes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
