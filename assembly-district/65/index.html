Twenty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> In three years, there have been 3,600 crashes. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, parents, children. A woman crushed on Canal Street. A cyclist thrown from his bike at Broome and Centre. Four pedestrians killed at once by a pickup on Jackson and Water. The youngest was eleven. The oldest was eighty-one. The street does not care about age.</p><h2 id=the-system-respondsor-doesnt>The System Responds—Or Doesn’t</h2><p><strong>Grace Lee, the district’s Assembly Member, has taken some steps.</strong> She co-sponsored bills to require safer street design for all users, not just drivers. She voted yes on a bill to expand school speed cameras, a move that targets speeding near children (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">voted yes on a bill to expand school speed cameras</a>). But the pace is slow. The streets stay dangerous. The city and state talk about Vision Zero, but the bodies keep coming. <strong>&ldquo;Every user deserves safe passage,&rdquo;</strong> the bill says (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">the bill says</a>), but sidewalks and crosswalks remain killing fields.</p><h2 id=blame-and-burden>Blame and Burden</h2><p>The NYPD has started issuing criminal summonses to cyclists and e-bike riders. Now, a ticket means a day in criminal court, not just a fine. <strong>&ldquo;Under the new policy, a person issued a criminal summons must turn up in person in criminal court,&rdquo;</strong> the paper <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/road-war-nypd-now-handing-out-criminal-summonses-to-bikers-for-traffic-violations-IE4565820>reports</a>. The city cracks down on the most vulnerable, while drivers keep killing. Trucks, SUVs, sedans—these are the weapons. <strong>Four killed by a pickup. One by an SUV turning right. One by a truck at dawn.</strong></p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> The blood on Delancey and Canal is not an accident. It is the cost of delay, of half-measures, of blaming the wrong people. <strong>Call Grace Lee. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real street redesign. Demand enforcement that targets danger, not the desperate.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another child’s name to be added to the list. Act now. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
