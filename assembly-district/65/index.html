It hit Kevin Cruickshank as he rode his bike. It hit May Kwok as she sat on a bench. Both died where they fell. The driver and her passenger tried to run. Police found guns and a bottle of liquor in the car. The city called it a tragedy. The city promised changes.

She voted to <strong>exempt some employees from bus lane rules</strong>. Each vote has a cost.

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
