It hit Kevin Cruickshank as he rode his bike. It hit May Kwok as she sat on a bench. Both died where they fell. The driver and her passenger tried to run. Police found guns and a bottle of liquor in the car. The city called it a tragedy. The city promised changes.

She has co-sponsored bills for safer street design and bus lane enforcement. She has backed more stroller space on buses for parents and children. But she has also voted to <strong>weaken bus rules</strong>, making it easier for some to block the lanes that keep buses—and people—moving. She voted to <strong>exempt some employees from bus lane rules</strong>. Each vote has a cost.
