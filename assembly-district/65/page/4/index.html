It hit Kevin Cruickshank as he rode his bike. It hit May Kwok as she sat on a bench. Both died where they fell. The driver and her passenger tried to run. Police found guns and a bottle of liquor in the car. The city called it a tragedy. The city promised changes. But the dead stay dead.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;A stolen vehicle, allegedly driven at more than 100 miles per hour&mldr;crashed into them.&rdquo;<br>— <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/07/chinatown-deadly-crash-safety-upgrades-canal-street>NY1</a></p></blockquote><h2 id=the-toll-grows>The Toll Grows</h2><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>two people have died and 605 have been injured</strong> in crashes in AD 65. Twelve suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Cyclists, children, the old—no one is spared. Trucks, SUVs, sedans, bikes, mopeds: all have left bodies broken on these streets. The numbers do not stop. The pain does not fade.</p><h2 id=promises-and-votes>Promises and Votes</h2><p>Assembly Member Grace Lee has voted to keep school speed zones and expand speed cameras. She has co-sponsored bills for safer street design and bus lane enforcement. She has backed more stroller space on buses for parents and children. But she has also voted to <strong>weaken bus rules</strong>, making it easier for some to block the lanes that keep buses—and people—moving. She voted to <strong>exempt some employees from bus lane rules</strong>. Each vote has a cost. Each delay means another family left to mourn.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Canal Street is only as safe as its most dangerous block, and even after these changes, the vast majority of the corridor will remain deadly.&rdquo;<br>— <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Ben Furnas, via Gothamist</a></p></blockquote><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Assembly Member Grace Lee. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand bus lanes that work. Demand streets where benches are not death traps. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
