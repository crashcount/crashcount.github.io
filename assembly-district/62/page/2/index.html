According to the police report, 'A 17-year-old, unlicensed, drove fast. His sedan slammed parked cars. Steel folded. Airbags burst. His legs crushed.' The crash left the teen driver with severe leg injuries and a 15-year-old passenger with back pain. A 19-year-old driver in another sedan suffered neck injuries. The police report lists 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as contributing factors.
