He never made it to the other side. Two children never made it home. In the last twelve months alone, <strong>372 people were injured, three of them seriously</strong>. The numbers do not bleed, but the families do.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-young>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Young</h2><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most damage.</strong> In the last three years, they killed at least two pedestrians and left dozens more with broken bodies. No cyclist deaths. No mercy for the young: <strong>65 children were hurt in the past year</strong>. The old are not spared. One man, 75, died on a quiet street. The cause is always the same: speed, distraction, a moment’s inattention. The result is always the same: a body on the asphalt, a family changed forever.</p><h2 id=leadership-bills-votes-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Bills, Votes, and Missed Chances</h2><p>Assembly Member Mike Reilly had a choice. He voted <strong>no</strong> on a bill to expand school speed cameras in Schenectady, a measure meant to protect children where they walk and bike (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">A 7652</a>). He did sponsor a bill to change the color and placement of speed camera warning signs, but it does not slow a single car or save a single life (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A4147&amp;term=2025">A 4147</a>). The silence is loud. The danger remains.</p><h2 id=the-thin-blue-line-drinks-and-drives>The Thin Blue Line Drinks and Drives</h2><p>Even those sworn to protect are not immune. Last December, an NYPD officer crashed her car after a holiday party. She told police, &ldquo;I had three or four drinks. My life is over&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/12/16/nypd-officer-charged-with-dwi-three-placed-on-desk-duty-following-crash-after-staten-island-precinct-holiday-party/>told police</a>). Three fellow officers were in the car. All survived. The next family may not be so lucky.</p><h2 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day without lower speed limits, every vote against cameras, every delay is a choice. <strong>Call Assembly Member Mike Reilly. Demand real action: lower speed limits, more cameras, safer streets.</strong> Do not wait for the next siren.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Their votes keep streets exposed. Pedestrians and cyclists lose a shield. Reckless drivers win. The city’s most basic defense—rejected. The toll will be measured in blood, not words.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13 and June 17, 2025, the New York State Senate and Assembly voted on reauthorizing New York City's school zone speed camera program. The Senate passed the measure 38-21; three city senators—Stephen Chan, Andrew Lanza, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton—voted no. The Assembly passed it 110-31, with nine city lawmakers—Alec Brook-Krasny, Lester Chang, Simcha Eichenstein, Michael Novakhov, Stacey Pheffer Amato, Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Reilly, David Weprin, Kalman Yeger—opposing. The Streetsblog NYC article, 'Ye Shall Know Their Names! Meet the Dirty Dozen City Pols Who Voted Against Speed Camera Program,' quotes lawmakers dismissing speed cameras as revenue grabs or burdens. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action, so no direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists can be assessed.' Still, the votes signal disregard for proven tools that protect those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets paid.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News (2024-12-16) reports that NYPD Officer Diana Todaro was arrested for driving while intoxicated after crashing her car with three colleagues as passengers. The crash happened at Huguenot Ave. and Drumgoole Ave. West, Staten Island, after a precinct holiday party. Todaro admitted, "I had three or four drinks. My life is over." The impact triggered airbags and left her with a forehead gash. All three passengers, also officers, were placed on desk duty and may face charges for allowing Todaro to drive or being unfit for duty. The article notes this was one of three NYPD DWI arrests in four days, highlighting a pattern during holiday party season. The incident raises questions about internal discipline and the risks posed by impaired driving, even among law enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
