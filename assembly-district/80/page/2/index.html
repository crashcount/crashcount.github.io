Twenty-six left with serious injuries.</strong> In Assembly District 80, the streets do not forgive. From January 2022 to June 2025, 1,644 people were hurt in crashes. The dead include a 91-year-old man, a moped rider, a passenger in a taxi, and a child. Each one had a name. Each one is gone.</p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>A pedestrian was killed and the driver fled. Police are still searching.

No chance. Just another body on the asphalt.</p><p>At Pelham Parkway South and Williamsbridge Road, an ambulance and a box truck collided. Three people went to the hospital. The crash happened just after sunrise. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/ambulance-box-truck-collide-injuring-3-people-morris-park-bronx/16177097/>&ldquo;Three people were hurt: the box truck driver and two ambulance workers.&rdquo;</a> The cause is still under investigation.

These are steps in the right direction.</p><p>But Zaccaro also sponsored <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A116&amp;term=2025">A 116</a>, a bill that would force e-scooter riders to get licenses and insurance. It targets the most vulnerable, not the drivers of cars and trucks who do the killing. This is not safety. This is shifting blame.</p><h2 id=what-next-the-work-is-not-done>What Next? The Work Is Not Done</h2><p><strong>Speed and inattention still kill.</strong> Cars and trucks are the main weapons. In the last year, injuries are up 34%. Deaths are down, but only for now. The next crash is always coming.</p><p><strong>Call your Assembly Member. Call your Council Member. Demand safer streets.</strong> Demand real action—lower speed limits, more cameras, street redesigns that protect people, not cars. Do not let another name become a number.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
