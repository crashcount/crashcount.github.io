In the last twelve months, <strong>534 people were hurt</strong> in crashes. <strong>Twelve were seriously injured. One did not survive.</strong> Since 2022, the toll is heavier: <strong>seven dead, 1,625 injured</strong>. The victims are not just numbers. They are children, elders, workers, neighbors. A 91-year-old man was killed crossing at Radcliff and Rhinelander. He was working in the roadway. He never made it home. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h2 id=the-crashes-keep-coming>The Crashes Keep Coming</h2><p>The violence does not stop. In May, a driver struck and killed a pedestrian, then fled. Police are still searching. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/driver-sought-after-deadly-bronx-hit-and-run/>Police are searching for a driver who allegedly fled after striking and killing a pedestrian in the Bronx early Saturday morning</a>. In April, an ambulance and a box truck collided at Pelham Parkway South and Williamsbridge Road. Three people were hurt. Two were ambulance workers. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/ambulance-box-truck-collide-injuring-3-people-morris-park-bronx/16177097/>Three people were hurt: the box truck driver and two ambulance workers</a>.</p><h2 id=what-has-zaccaro-done>What Has Zaccaro Done?</h2><p>Assembly Member John Zaccaro has taken some steps. He <strong>co-sponsored a bill</strong> <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A116&amp;term=2025">to require safer street design for all users</a>. He <strong>voted yes</strong> <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">to expand school speed cameras</a>—tools proven to protect children. But Zaccaro also <strong>sponsored a bill</strong> <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">that would force e-scooter riders to get licenses and insurance</a>, adding barriers for the most vulnerable and shifting blame away from drivers. The streets are still dangerous. The bills are not enough. The deaths continue.</p><h2 id=what-next-demand-more>What Next? Demand More</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day without action is another day someone does not come home. Call Zaccaro. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets built for people, not cars. <strong>Do not wait for another name to become a number.</strong> <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
