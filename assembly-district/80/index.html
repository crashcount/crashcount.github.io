It 'permits the use of photo speed violation monitoring systems in New York City for the purposes of enforcement of license plate obstruction, concealment, and/or distortion; extends provisions permitting the use of speed cameras in certain school zones.'

Metal and flesh torn in the Bronx dusk.</p><p class=mb3>On Van Nest Avenue near 606 in the Bronx, a sedan collided with a box truck that was pulling from the curb. According to the police report, the sedan's driver, a 34-year-old woman, suffered crush injuries to her shoulder, while her 33-year-old male passenger was pinned and injured in the back. Both were conscious but sustained serious injuries. The report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor for both the driver and the passenger. The sedan's left front bumper struck the right side doors of the box truck, which sustained no damage. The box truck was starting from parking, while the sedan was going straight ahead. The focus remains on driver distraction as the systemic danger leading to this violent crash.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
