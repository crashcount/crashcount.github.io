Pedestrians were hit 306 times; cyclists in 104 crashes; e‑bikes and mopeds in 76; most harm fell on people inside cars.

See the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>contributing factors</a>.</p></li></ul><p>Left turns kill. So do speed and mass.</p><ul><li><p>On the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Bronx River Parkway</a>, a 30‑year‑old driver was ejected and died at 3:17 a.m.; police coded “unsafe speed.” Her passenger was badly hurt.</p></li><li><p>At <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Mosholu Parkway</a> and Bainbridge, a moped rider, 35, was killed just after midnight.

A sedan going straight. Center front damage.</p></li><li><p>Citywide, a rider named Nathaniel Martinez, 31, died when a Chevrolet Equinox turned left across him near the Bruckner ramps. “The Equinox driver stayed at the scene,” the paper wrote. That is from the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/29/motorcycle-rider-dies-crash-bronx-near-bruckner-expressway/>Daily News</a>.</p></li></ul><p>“Police are searching for a driver who allegedly fled after striking and killing a pedestrian in the Bronx,” reported <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/driver-sought-after-deadly-bronx-hit-and-run/>CBS New York</a>.

The family answered through advocates: Tisch’s decision “sends a clear and terrifying message.”</p></li></ul><p>Fix the places where bodies fall</p><ul><li><p>Daylight every corner on Southern, Mosholu, and East Gun Hill. Harden the turns. Give leading pedestrian intervals. Target left‑turn hotspots with protected phases.</p></li><li><p>Night is bloody here. Do targeted enforcement and speed control where the clock says it hurts: midnight, 3 a.m., 4–7 p.m., 10 p.m. The hour map is in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a>.</p></li><li><p>Trucks cut deep when they hit. Add turn‑calming and tighter geometry on truck routes.</p></li></ul><p>Turn the big levers</p><p>Albany renewed the city’s school‑zone camera program through 2030. Your Assembly Member voted yes on the Senate‑carried fix. See bill <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>S 8344</a>.</p><p>Now pull the next two:</p><ul><li><p>Lower speeds everywhere.
