She never makes it home. The driver who hit her does not stop. She is dragged, left on the street, her life ended and her family broken. Her husband <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/husband-mourns-pregnant-wife-run-over-by-hit-run-driver-in-brooklyn-fender-bender-clash/>says</a>, <strong>&ldquo;I lost my whole family tonight and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever be the same.&rdquo;</strong></p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>2 people died and 597 were injured</strong> in crashes in AD 56.

She <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">voted yes</a> on a bill to bring speed cameras to school zones, a move that saves lives. She has stood with others calling for safer, age-friendly streets.
