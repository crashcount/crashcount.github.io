Prosecutors say Pigford rear-ended Cifuni, then stopped two blocks away. When Cifuni approached, Pigford 'refused to roll down her window or speak,' then accelerated, striking and dragging Cifuni. The article quotes Assistant District Attorney Tara Kelly: 'The defendant floored the gas, instantly striking Tiffany, causing her body to become lodged beneath the vehicle.' Pigford then made an illegal turn and fled. The case highlights the lethal risk of hit-and-run driving and the dangers posed by unlicensed, reckless drivers operating stolen vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
