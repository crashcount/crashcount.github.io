The other driver hit the gas, struck her, dragged her, and fled the wrong way. Tiffany died at the hospital. She was 32, and pregnant. Prosecutors later said the defendant “floored the gas, instantly striking Tiffany.” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/18/brooklyn-hit-run-pregnant-woman-murder-tiffany-cifuni-arrest-chaquasia-pigford/>NY Daily News</a> | <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/18/us-news/driver-who-mowed-down-mom-to-be-on-way-home-from-beyonce-show-nabbed-in-nyc-officials/>New York Post</a> | <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/brooklyn-arrest-hit-and-run-death-woman-06182025/>The Brooklyn Paper</a></p><p>Her husband’s words were plain: “I lost my whole family tonight.” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/husband-mourns-pregnant-wife-run-over-by-hit-run-driver-in-brooklyn-fender-bender-clash/>NY Daily News</a></p><p>Across Assembly District 56, the toll grinds on.

The pattern is steady. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Broadway and Atlantic are the worst wounds. On Broadway, two deaths and 187 people hurt. On Atlantic, two more deaths and 159 hurt. These are not secrets.

Albany has a bill that would force the worst repeat speeders—people with 11 DMV points in 18 months or 16 camera tickets in a year—to use speed limiters that keep cars within 5 MPH of the limit. It is called the Stop Super Speeders Act. <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a></p><p>Finally, slow the whole city. Sammy’s Law lets New York lower the default to 20 MPH.
