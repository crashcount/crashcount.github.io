The other driver hit the gas, struck her, dragged her, and fled the wrong way. Tiffany died at the hospital. She was 32, and pregnant.

The pattern is steady. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>Broadway and Atlantic are the worst wounds. On Broadway, two deaths and 187 people hurt. On Atlantic, two more deaths and 159 hurt. These are not secrets.

Albany has a bill that would force the worst repeat speeders—people with 11 DMV points in 18 months or 16 camera tickets in a year—to use speed limiters that keep cars within 5 MPH of the limit. It is called the Stop Super Speeders Act. <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a></p><p>Finally, slow the whole city. Sammy’s Law lets New York lower the default to 20 MPH.
