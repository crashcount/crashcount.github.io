The proposal went before Community Boards 8 and 3, both in high-injury areas with little bike infrastructure. The DOT’s summary: 'upgrade the Bedford Avenue bike lane from a painted lane to a protected bike lane.' Council Member Chi Oss supports the project, though he did not attend the meeting. Former Assembly Member Tremaine Wright and Assembly Member Stefani Zinerman questioned the safety benefits, but DOT officials countered with data showing a 21% drop in pedestrian injuries where protected lanes exist. Community voices demanded safer streets.
