An SUV guns the engine. She is struck, dragged, and left dying in the street. Her name was Tiffany Cifuni. She was pregnant. Her husband said, &ldquo;I lost my whole family tonight and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever be the same&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/husband-mourns-pregnant-wife-run-over-by-hit-run-driver-in-brooklyn-fender-bender-clash/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>In the last twelve months, two people have died and 611 have been injured in crashes in Assembly District 56.

The proposal went before Community Boards 8 and 3, both in high-injury areas with little bike infrastructure. The DOT’s summary: 'upgrade the Bedford Avenue bike lane from a painted lane to a protected bike lane.' Council Member Chi Oss supports the project, though he did not attend the meeting. Former Assembly Member Tremaine Wright and Assembly Member Stefani Zinerman questioned the safety benefits, but DOT officials countered with data showing a 21% drop in pedestrian injuries where protected lanes exist. Community voices demanded safer streets. The city plans to install the new lane in the second half of 2023.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
