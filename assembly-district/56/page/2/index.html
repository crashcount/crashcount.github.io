The report states the impact was to the center front end of the moped, causing fatal head injuries to the driver, who died at the scene. The police explicitly list 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor in the crash. The narrative underscores that the victim’s skull took the brunt of the blow. No other vehicles or persons are reported involved. The report does not specify the use of any safety equipment by the victim, nor does it list any victim behavior as a contributing factor.

The report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the primary contributing factor. The sedan's point of impact was the left rear quarter panel, while the e-scooter was hit at the center front end. The rider was not wearing a helmet, but this detail is mentioned only after the driver’s error. The narrative describes the rider flying headfirst onto the pavement, blood pooling on the street, and the driver remaining silent. The incident underscores the deadly consequences of driver inattention for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
