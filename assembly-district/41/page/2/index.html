A bill in Albany would force repeat speeders to install intelligent speed assistance if they rack up violations. It targets the 1.5% who cause a fifth of pedestrian deaths, and the plate‑holders with long camera rap sheets.

Senator Andrew Gounardes carried the bill. Others opposed. On June 12 and June 17, Assembly Member Simcha Yeger voted no on S 8344. The bill still passed.
