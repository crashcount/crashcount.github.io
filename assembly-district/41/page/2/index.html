Twenty-three seriously injured.</strong> Over 2,000 hurt since 2022. The dead include a 77-year-old woman crushed by a truck at Avenue P, a 70-year-old man struck by an SUV on Kings Highway, a 35-year-old cyclist thrown from his bike at Nostrand and Avenue R. Children bleed on Avenue J. The old and the young, crossing, riding, walking—none are spared. The street does not care if you are careful.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-obstruction>Leadership: Action or Obstruction?</h3><p><strong>Assembly Member Kalman Yeger has stood in the way of proven safety measures.</strong> He opposed 24/7 speed cameras, voting against the expansion that lets the city catch speeders at all hours.<a href=https://nypost.com/2022/05/26/nyc-council-signs-off-on-24-7-speed-enforcement-cameras/>NYC Council signs off on 24/7 speed enforcement cameras</a> He fought protected bike lanes, demanding more police enforcement instead of safer streets. He has resisted congestion pricing, a policy shown to cut traffic and save lives. When the city moved to build a real bike network, Yeger said no, arguing for tickets over concrete. Yeger <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/06/19/dot-adding-badly-needed-upgrade-to-parkside-avenue-bike-lane-but-delays-other-life-saving-fixes>opposed all bike lanes in his district, arguing for enforcement before installation</a>.</p><p>He did support the city’s <a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/nyc-greenway-plan-bike-pedestrian-city-council/>greenway master plan</a>, but the plan is just that—a plan. The bodies are real. The pain is real. The delay is deadly.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h3><p><strong>Every day without action is another day of blood on the street.</strong> The numbers rise. The faces blur. The only thing that changes is the date. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has the tools to build protected lanes, to keep cameras running, to make drivers slow down. But the will is missing. The leadership is missing.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call Kalman Yeger. Call your council member. Demand 20 mph speed limits. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand 24/7 speed cameras.</strong> Join <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> or <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>.
