That keeps a proven tool alive. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Source</a>.</p><p>The city can go further. <strong>Lower speeds save lives.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law, giving NYC power to set lower limits. The city can set 20 mph on residential streets. Every mile per hour shaved means fewer funerals. <a href=../../take_action/>Act now</a>.</p><p>The worst drivers are a small slice, but they do oversized harm. A bill in Albany would force repeat speeders to install intelligent speed assistance if they rack up violations. It targets the 1.5% who cause a fifth of pedestrian deaths, and the plate‑holders with long camera rap sheets. The goal is simple: stop the car from breaking the limit by more than 5 mph. <a href=../../take_action/>Source</a>.</p><h3 id=accountability-has-names>Accountability has names</h3><p>School‑zone protections needed votes. Senator Andrew Gounardes carried the bill. Others opposed. On June 12 and June 17, Assembly Member Simcha Yeger voted no on S 8344. The bill still passed. The protections stand. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Source</a>.</p><p>This district includes <a href=/neighborhood/bk1502/>Madison</a>, <a href=/neighborhood/bk1503/>Sheepshead Bay–Manhattan Beach–Gerritsen Beach</a>, and <a href=/neighborhood/bk1801/>Flatlands</a>.
