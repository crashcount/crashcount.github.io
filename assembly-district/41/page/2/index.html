Twenty-five suffered wounds so grave they will never be the same. The dead include the old and the young. A 70-year-old man struck by an SUV on Kings Highway. A 77-year-old woman crushed by a truck at Avenue P. A cyclist, age 35, killed by an SUV at Nostrand and Avenue R. Each one gone. Each one preventable.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the harm.</strong> They killed two. They injured over 300 pedestrians. Trucks and buses killed two more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes are in the mix, but the numbers are clear: the bigger the machine, the greater the toll. The streets are not safe for the ones on foot, on two wheels, or growing old.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-against-safety>Leadership: Votes Against Safety</h3><p>While the bodies pile up, <strong>Assembly Member Kalman Yeger has <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted against safety</a> again and again</strong>. In June 2025, Yeger voted no on a bill to extend and fix school speed zones—<strong>opposing protections for children near schools</strong>. The bill passed anyway, but not with his help. He voted no on other bills to improve school zone safety. He voted yes to weaken bus rules, making it riskier for people walking and biking. The record is public. The silence is louder.</p><h3 id=the-call-that-cannot-wait>The Call That Cannot Wait</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. The machines keep rolling. The votes keep coming. The blood keeps flowing.</p><p><strong>Call Assembly Member Yeger. Demand action. Demand safer streets. Demand that the next name is not someone you love.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
