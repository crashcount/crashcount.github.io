Twenty-three seriously injured.</strong> Over 2,000 hurt since 2022. The dead include a 77-year-old woman crushed by a truck at Avenue P, a 70-year-old man struck by an SUV on Kings Highway, a 35-year-old cyclist thrown from his bike at Nostrand and Avenue R. Children bleed on Avenue J. The old and the young, crossing, riding, walking—none are spared. The street does not care if you are careful.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-obstruction>Leadership: Action or Obstruction?</h3><p><strong>Assembly Member Kalman Yeger has stood in the way of proven safety measures.</strong> He opposed 24/7 speed cameras, voting against the expansion that lets the city catch speeders at all hours.<a href=https://nypost.com/2022/05/26/nyc-council-signs-off-on-24-7-speed-enforcement-cameras/>NYC Council signs off on 24/7 speed enforcement cameras</a> He fought protected bike lanes, demanding more police enforcement instead of safer streets. He has resisted congestion pricing, a policy shown to cut traffic and save lives. When the city moved to build a real bike network, Yeger said no, arguing for tickets over concrete. Yeger <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/06/19/dot-adding-badly-needed-upgrade-to-parkside-avenue-bike-lane-but-delays-other-life-saving-fixes>opposed all bike lanes in his district, arguing for enforcement before installation</a>.</p><p>He did support the city’s <a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/nyc-greenway-plan-bike-pedestrian-city-council/>greenway master plan</a>, but the plan is just that—a plan. The bodies are real. The pain is real. The delay is deadly.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h3><p><strong>Every day without action is another day of blood on the street.</strong> The numbers rise. The faces blur. The only thing that changes is the date. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has the tools to build protected lanes, to keep cameras running, to make drivers slow down. But the will is missing. The leadership is missing.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call Kalman Yeger. Call your council member. Demand 20 mph speed limits. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand 24/7 speed cameras.</strong> Join <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> or <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>.

The Senate passed the measure 38-21; three city senators—Stephen Chan, Andrew Lanza, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton—voted no. The Assembly passed it 110-31, with nine city lawmakers—Alec Brook-Krasny, Lester Chang, Simcha Eichenstein, Michael Novakhov, Stacey Pheffer Amato, Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Reilly, David Weprin, Kalman Yeger—opposing. The Streetsblog NYC article, 'Ye Shall Know Their Names! Meet the Dirty Dozen City Pols Who Voted Against Speed Camera Program,' quotes lawmakers dismissing speed cameras as revenue grabs or burdens. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action, so no direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists can be assessed.' Still, the votes signal disregard for proven tools that protect those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The statement came at the funeral for Natasha Saada and her children, killed by a speeding driver on Ocean Parkway. Novakhov argued, 'six red-light or speed violations in one year [is] too little,' and claimed, 'any driver can get much more than six.' He also denounced speed cameras, saying, 'we have too many,' and that they punish regular drivers. The bill’s matter summary centers on requiring devices for vehicles with six violations in a year. Community members and advocates at the funeral demanded stronger accountability and cited the area’s deadly history. Other local politicians, including Kalman Yeger and Simcha Felder, have also opposed speed safety measures.

The project, managed by Lauren Martin, adds a mid-block crossing and concrete pedestrian islands after cyclist Kala Santiago was killed by a truck at a dangerous crossing. The DOT had installed a two-way protected lane in 2021 but left a key crossing unsafe. The new fix will remove parking spots to improve safety for cyclists and pedestrians. DOT also proposed painted bike lanes in Flatbush, Midwood, and Kensington, but not protected lanes, despite high crash rates. Community Board 14 members and advocates urged quick action. Council Member Kalman Yeger opposed all bike lanes in his district, arguing for enforcement before installation. DOT plans to finish the Parkside Avenue upgrade this summer and the wider bike network by next year.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
