That keeps a proven tool alive. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Source</a>.</p><p>The city can go further. <strong>Lower speeds save lives.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law, giving NYC power to set lower limits. The city can set 20 mph on residential streets. Every mile per hour shaved means fewer funerals. <a href=../../take_action/>Act now</a>.</p><p>The worst drivers are a small slice, but they do oversized harm. A bill in Albany would force repeat speeders to install intelligent speed assistance if they rack up violations. It targets the 1.5% who cause a fifth of pedestrian deaths, and the plate‑holders with long camera rap sheets. The goal is simple: stop the car from breaking the limit by more than 5 mph. <a href=../../take_action/>Source</a>.</p><h3 id=accountability-has-names>Accountability has names</h3><p>School‑zone protections needed votes. Senator Andrew Gounardes carried the bill. Others opposed. On June 12 and June 17, Assembly Member Simcha Yeger voted no on S 8344. The bill still passed. The protections stand. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Source</a>.</p><p>This district includes <a href=/neighborhood/bk1502/>Madison</a>, <a href=/neighborhood/bk1503/>Sheepshead Bay–Manhattan Beach–Gerritsen Beach</a>, and <a href=/neighborhood/bk1801/>Flatlands</a>.

The incident occurred as the man stepped into the street, not at an intersection and without a crossing signal, as detailed in the report: 'A 70-year-old man stepped into the street without a signal. An eastbound SUV struck him head-on. He died from head and internal wounds. The driver held a license. The bumper bore the mark where he fell.' The vehicle involved was a 2023 Acura SUV, traveling straight ahead with two occupants. The point of impact was the center front end, and the right front bumper showed damage. The police report lists 'Unspecified' as the contributing factors for both the driver and the pedestrian, and does not cite any specific driver error. The pedestrian’s action—crossing without a signal or crosswalk—is noted after the absence of identified driver errors. The report does not mention any additional contributing factors or behaviors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
