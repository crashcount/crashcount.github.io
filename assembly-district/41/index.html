Who’s Next?</h1><p class="byline f6 silver">Written June 4, 2025 <em>(Revised June 5, 2025 – Fixed link formatting, removed headline from body, deduped and cleaned citations.)</em></p></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>AD 41: Jan 1, 2022 - Jun 4, 2025</h2><h3 id=the-numbers-dont-lie>The Numbers Don’t Lie</h3><p><strong>Eight dead. Twenty-three left with serious injuries.</strong> In just over three years, Assembly District 41 has seen 2,924 crashes—nearly three a day. <strong>Over 2,000 people hurt.</strong> The dead include the old, the young, the ones who never saw it coming. A 77-year-old woman crushed by a truck at Avenue P and East 19th Street. A 35-year-old cyclist thrown from his bike at Nostrand and Avenue R. A 57-year-old passenger killed in a tangle of sedans and SUVs on the Belt Parkway. The numbers are cold. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> Cars and SUVs killed at least two people on foot, leaving dozens more broken. Trucks and buses killed two. Bikes and mopeds are not spared. The street is a gauntlet. The sidewalk is no refuge. Every day, another ambulance. Every week, another family changed forever.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-absence>Leadership: Action and Absence</h3><p>Assembly Member <strong>Kalman Yeger has stood in the way of proven safety measures.</strong> He opposed protected bike lanes, arguing for more enforcement before any new lanes are built. He voted against expanding 24/7 speed cameras, which have been shown to cut speeding and injuries (<a href=https://nypost.com/2022/05/26/nyc-council-signs-off-on-24-7-speed-enforcement-cameras/>speed cameras</a>). He has resisted congestion pricing, which would have reduced dangerous car traffic. When a cyclist was killed in Borough Park, Yeger and others called for more enforcement but not safer streets (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/05/07/truck-driver-gets-a-few-summonses-for-killing-borough-park-cyclist-as-mta-workers-continue-dangerous-parking>called for more enforcement</a>).</p><p><strong>The silence is loud.</strong> The delays are deadly. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has the tools to build real protection for people outside cars. But the will is missing.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Cameras will be 24/7 the whole year.&rdquo; — DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez (<a href=https://nypost.com/2022/05/26/nyc-council-signs-off-on-24-7-speed-enforcement-cameras/>DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>)</p></blockquote><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Residents can demand better. Call Yeger. Call the Mayor. Demand 20 mph limits. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand that every child, every elder, every walker and rider gets home alive. <strong>Don’t wait for another name to become a number.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The statement came at the funeral for Natasha Saada and her children, killed by a speeding driver on Ocean Parkway. Novakhov argued, 'six red-light or speed violations in one year [is] too little,' and claimed, 'any driver can get much more than six.' He also denounced speed cameras, saying, 'we have too many,' and that they punish regular drivers. The bill’s matter summary centers on requiring devices for vehicles with six violations in a year. Community members and advocates at the funeral demanded stronger accountability and cited the area’s deadly history. Other local politicians, including Kalman Yeger and Simcha Felder, have also opposed speed safety measures.

The project, managed by Lauren Martin, adds a mid-block crossing and concrete pedestrian islands after cyclist Kala Santiago was killed by a truck at a dangerous crossing. The DOT had installed a two-way protected lane in 2021 but left a key crossing unsafe. The new fix will remove parking spots to improve safety for cyclists and pedestrians. DOT also proposed painted bike lanes in Flatbush, Midwood, and Kensington, but not protected lanes, despite high crash rates. Community Board 14 members and advocates urged quick action. Council Member Kalman Yeger opposed all bike lanes in his district, arguing for enforcement before installation. DOT plans to finish the Parkside Avenue upgrade this summer and the wider bike network by next year.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
