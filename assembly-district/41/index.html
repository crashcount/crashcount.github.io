Twenty-three seriously injured.</strong> Over 2,000 hurt since 2022. The dead include a 77-year-old woman crushed by a truck at Avenue P, a 70-year-old man struck by an SUV on Kings Highway, a 35-year-old cyclist thrown from his bike at Nostrand and Avenue R.

The only thing that changes is the date. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has the tools to build protected lanes, to keep cameras running, to make drivers slow down. But the will is missing. The leadership is missing.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call Kalman Yeger. Call your council member. Demand 20 mph speed limits.

The toll will be measured in blood, not words.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13 and June 17, 2025, the New York State Senate and Assembly voted on reauthorizing New York City's school zone speed camera program. The Senate passed the measure 38-21; three city senators—Stephen Chan, Andrew Lanza, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton—voted no. The Assembly passed it 110-31, with nine city lawmakers—Alec Brook-Krasny, Lester Chang, Simcha Eichenstein, Michael Novakhov, Stacey Pheffer Amato, Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Reilly, David Weprin, Kalman Yeger—opposing. The Streetsblog NYC article, 'Ye Shall Know Their Names! Meet the Dirty Dozen City Pols Who Voted Against Speed Camera Program,' quotes lawmakers dismissing speed cameras as revenue grabs or burdens. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action, so no direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists can be assessed.' Still, the votes signal disregard for proven tools that protect those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states the boy was left unconscious on the pavement with severe head lacerations after the impact, which occurred at the vehicle’s left front bumper. The driver was operating a 2013 Ford SUV and remained at the scene. Police cite 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor in the crash. The report also notes the pedestrian was 'Riding/Walking Along Highway Against Traffic' and lists 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a secondary factor.

The street remains deadly.</p><p class=mb3>On March 31, 2025, Assembly Member Michael Novakhov publicly opposed a state bill requiring speed-limiting devices for cars owned by repeat speeders. The statement came at the funeral for Natasha Saada and her children, killed by a speeding driver on Ocean Parkway. Novakhov argued, 'six red-light or speed violations in one year [is] too little,' and claimed, 'any driver can get much more than six.' He also denounced speed cameras, saying, 'we have too many,' and that they punish regular drivers. The bill’s matter summary centers on requiring devices for vehicles with six violations in a year. Community members and advocates at the funeral demanded stronger accountability and cited the area’s deadly history. Other local politicians, including Kalman Yeger and Simcha Felder, have also opposed speed safety measures. The Department of Transportation has not recommended major changes to Ocean Parkway, despite ongoing danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Yeger opposes, citing parking and enforcement.</p><p class=mb3>On June 19, 2023, the Department of Transportation announced upgrades to the Parkside Avenue protected bike lane. The project, managed by Lauren Martin, adds a mid-block crossing and concrete pedestrian islands after cyclist Kala Santiago was killed by a truck at a dangerous crossing. The DOT had installed a two-way protected lane in 2021 but left a key crossing unsafe. The new fix will remove parking spots to improve safety for cyclists and pedestrians. DOT also proposed painted bike lanes in Flatbush, Midwood, and Kensington, but not protected lanes, despite high crash rates. Community Board 14 members and advocates urged quick action. Council Member Kalman Yeger opposed all bike lanes in his district, arguing for enforcement before installation. DOT plans to finish the Parkside Avenue upgrade this summer and the wider bike network by next year.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
