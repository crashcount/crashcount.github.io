Fourteen left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 1,400 hurt since 2022. The dead include elders, cyclists, pedestrians, and children. The living carry scars—broken bones, lost time, empty chairs at the table. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a> shows the carnage does not slow.</p><p><strong>Just last month, a man was killed crossing New Utrecht Avenue.</strong> His son watched the car hit him and speed away. “He didn’t stop. He just kept going,” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/06/hit-and-run-driver-kills-brooklyn-restaurant-worker-in-front-of-son/>said Henry Tziquin</a>. Eight days later, his father was dead. The street is unchanged. The risk remains.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> They killed two and injured over 280. Trucks and buses left more than a dozen hurt. Bikes and mopeds, too, have taken lives. But the weight of steel and speed falls hardest on those outside the car. In the last year, injuries rose by more than a quarter. Crashes are up. The only thing down is the number of people left to mourn.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-and-silence>Leadership: Votes and Silence</h3><p>Assembly Member Lester Chang has stood in the way of proven safety tools. <strong>He voted against reauthorizing speed cameras in school zones</strong>—a measure that saves children’s lives. He voted no on bills to improve school zone safety. He co-sponsored bills to repeal congestion pricing, a policy that cuts traffic and saves lives. Chang’s record is clear: when the choice is between safety and the status quo, he chooses the latter. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>See the votes</a>.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by leaders who refuse to act. Call Assembly Member Chang.

E-bike batteries sparked it. Council Member Gutiérrez called for a city taskforce and safe charging stations. Lawmakers want stricter rules. Lithium-ion fires have killed, maimed, and displaced hundreds. The danger grows.</p><p class=mb3>On April 26, 2023, the City Council Transportation Committee held a hearing on lithium-ion battery regulation and e-bike safety. Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez, District 34, proposed a taskforce to study citywide e-bike charging stations, saying, 'E-bikes are here to stay.' She urged the city to 'keep New Yorkers safe' with exclusive charging points for delivery riders. The matter, titled 'Fire at Sunset Park e-bike store displaces 2 families as pols fight to regulate lithium-ion batteries,' highlights a deadly pattern: over 400 fires, 300 injuries, and 12 deaths from e-bike batteries in four years. The bill has no set vote date. Federal lawmakers also introduced the Setting Consumer Standards for Lithium-Ion Batteries Act to regulate battery safety. The push aims to curb fires, protect homes, and shield vulnerable New Yorkers from battery explosions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
