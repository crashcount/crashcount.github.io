The SUV driver, a 66-year-old man, was also listed with alcohol involvement and failure to obey traffic signals. The report makes clear that driver errors—alcohol and ignoring traffic control—led to the crash. The cyclist was not ejected and was not wearing safety equipment, as noted after the driver’s actions.
