A 21-year-old, driving a Nissan Rogue without a license, struck him and fled. The cyclist suffered severe head trauma. Paramedics found him unconscious. The driver later told police he ran because he had no license. He now faces charges for leaving the scene and driving unlicensed, as <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/driver-arrested-after-hitting-65-year-old-e-biker-on-second-ave-XF4896347>reported by West Side Spirit</a>.</p><p>On the FDR Drive, a firefighter fell from his motorcycle. A car hit him and kept going. He died in the road.

Cyclists, pedestrians, children. The old and the young. Cars and SUVs did most of the damage, but trucks, buses, bikes, and motorcycles all left bodies behind. The street is a gauntlet. The numbers do not rest.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h2><p>Assembly Member Harvey Epstein has co-sponsored bills to require speed limiters for repeat speeders and to force safer street designs for all users. He has voted for more funding for safer streets and better driver education. But this June, he missed a key vote to extend school speed zone protections. He also voted to weaken bus rules, raising risk for people on foot and bike. The record is mixed. The danger is not.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>No one should die for crossing the street.</strong> Call Assembly Member Epstein. Demand he fight for a 20 mph citywide speed limit, real speed enforcement, and streets built for people, not cars.

No replacement for the lost $1 billion. Transit riders and street users face uncertainty. Lawmakers call the move reckless. The city waits. Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2024, the New York State legislative session ended without passing a replacement funding plan for the MTA after Governor Kathy Hochul paused congestion pricing. The matter, described as 'Albany pumps the brakes on MTA funding plan in rebuke of Hochul’s move to ditch congestion pricing,' left the MTA without the $1 billion annual revenue congestion pricing would have provided. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins announced the session’s close without a deal. Lawmakers including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris, State Sen. John Liu, Assemblyman Harvey Epstein, and Assemblyman Tony Simone criticized the governor’s decision and the proposed IOU bailout. Gounardes said, 'I cannot in good conscience ratify a decision that will eliminate a significant, dedicated revenue source for the MTA’s capital plan.' The pause leaves the city’s transit future—and the safety of those who rely on it—uncertain.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
