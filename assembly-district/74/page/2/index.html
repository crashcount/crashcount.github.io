A Nissan Rogue hit him. The driver fled. The man lay in the street with severe head trauma. Paramedics found him unconscious. They worked CPR and rushed him to Bellevue. The NYPD arrested the driver two hours later. He was unlicensed. The charge: leaving the scene, causing serious injury. The block shut down. The red light on the crumpled bike kept flashing. <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/driver-arrested-after-collision-with-e-biker-on-second-ave-XF4896347>The biker was rushed by EMS to Bellevue Hospital in critical condition.</a></p><p>A week before, a firefighter died on the FDR. He fell from his motorcycle. A car ran him over and kept going. No arrest. No name for the driver. The city lost a man who had pulled others from burning buildings. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-firefighter-dies-after-falling-off-motorcycle-being-struck-by-car>&ldquo;We lost a true hero this morning with the tragic passing of Firefighter Matthew Goicochea,&rdquo; said the Deputy Mayor.</a></p><h3 id=the-numbers-relentless-unforgiving>The Numbers: Relentless, Unforgiving</h3><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>3 people died</strong> on these streets. <strong>14 were seriously injured.</strong> <strong>588 hurt.</strong> The bodies are not numbers. They are neighbors, workers, children. Cars and SUVs did most of the damage. Buses killed too. The cycle repeats. The city counts the dead. The living limp home.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h3><p>Assembly Member Harvey Epstein has backed bills for safer streets. He co-sponsored the <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, pushing for speed limiters on repeat offenders. He signed on to <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A8423&amp;term=2023">complete streets bills</a> to force safer design. He voted for more funding for street redesigns. But when it came to a key vote to extend school speed zone protections, he was marked absent. The city needs more than good intentions. It needs action. It needs leaders present when it counts.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every delay is a choice. Call Assembly Member Epstein. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed limiters for repeat offenders. Demand streets that put people first. <strong>Do not wait for another siren.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2024, the New York State legislative session ended without passing a replacement funding plan for the MTA after Governor Kathy Hochul paused congestion pricing. The matter, described as 'Albany pumps the brakes on MTA funding plan in rebuke of Hochul’s move to ditch congestion pricing,' left the MTA without the $1 billion annual revenue congestion pricing would have provided. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins announced the session’s close without a deal. Lawmakers including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris, State Sen. John Liu, Assemblyman Harvey Epstein, and Assemblyman Tony Simone criticized the governor’s decision and the proposed IOU bailout. Gounardes said, 'I cannot in good conscience ratify a decision that will eliminate a significant, dedicated revenue source for the MTA’s capital plan.' The pause leaves the city’s transit future—and the safety of those who rely on it—uncertain.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
