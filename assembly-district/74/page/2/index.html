Nineteen left with serious injuries.</strong> Nearly 1,500 wounded since 2022. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, workers, children. A 23-year-old cyclist, struck and killed at Park Avenue South. A 67-year-old woman, crushed by a truck turning at Avenue C. A man, 45, dead under the wheels of a bus at Avenue D. Each loss leaves a hole in the street that never closes.</p><h3 id=the-faces-behind-the-numbers>The Faces Behind the Numbers</h3><p>The violence does not stop. <strong>Sedans, SUVs, trucks, buses, bikes—all have drawn blood.</strong> Cars and SUVs killed four. Trucks and buses killed two. Bikes left three with serious injuries. The pattern is clear. The most vulnerable—pedestrians and cyclists—pay the highest price. In June 2025, a Turkish immigrant was killed crossing Third Avenue. His family is &ldquo;devastated. They&rsquo;re still in disbelief&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/07/us-news/family-of-turkish-immigrant-killed-in-dwi-crash-sues-nyc-bars/>said their lawyer</a>. The pain does not fade. It multiplies.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Assembly Member <strong>Harvey Epstein has signed on to bills that could make streets safer</strong>. He <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1875&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored measures</a> to require complete street design, <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A324&amp;term=2025">automated bike lane enforcement</a>, and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">speed limiters</a>. He <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-transit-advocates-mta-funding-capital-02022025/>backed funding for transit</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>supported lowering speed limits</a> on Open Streets to five miles per hour. But when it came time to vote on a bill for school speed zone cameras, <strong>Epstein was excused</strong>—a missed chance to protect children. He also supported an electric vehicle discount that critics say could put heavier, deadlier vehicles on city streets. <strong>Progress is slow. The blood dries, but the danger remains.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day without action is another day of risk. Call Assembly Member Epstein. Call your council member. Demand lower speed limits, more automated enforcement, and streets built for people, not cars. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
