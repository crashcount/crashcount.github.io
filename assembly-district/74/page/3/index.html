Cyclists, pedestrians, children. The old and the young. Cars and SUVs did most of the damage, but trucks, buses, bikes, and motorcycles all left bodies behind. The street is a gauntlet. The numbers do not rest.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h2><p>Assembly Member Harvey Epstein has co-sponsored bills to require speed limiters for repeat speeders and to force safer street designs for all users. He has voted for more funding for safer streets and better driver education. But this June, he missed a key vote to extend school speed zone protections. He also voted to weaken bus rules, raising risk for people on foot and bike. The record is mixed. The danger is not.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>No one should die for crossing the street.</strong> Call Assembly Member Epstein. Demand he fight for a 20 mph citywide speed limit, real speed enforcement, and streets built for people, not cars.
