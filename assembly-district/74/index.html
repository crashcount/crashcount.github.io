A Nissan Rogue hit him. The driver fled. The man lay in the street with severe head trauma. Paramedics found him unconscious. They worked CPR and rushed him to Bellevue. The NYPD arrested the driver two hours later. He was unlicensed. The charge: leaving the scene, causing serious injury. The block shut down. The red light on the crumpled bike kept flashing. <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/driver-arrested-after-collision-with-e-biker-on-second-ave-XF4896347>The biker was rushed by EMS to Bellevue Hospital in critical condition.</a></p><p>A week before, a firefighter died on the FDR. He fell from his motorcycle. A car ran him over and kept going. No arrest. No name for the driver. The city lost a man who had pulled others from burning buildings. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-firefighter-dies-after-falling-off-motorcycle-being-struck-by-car>&ldquo;We lost a true hero this morning with the tragic passing of Firefighter Matthew Goicochea,&rdquo; said the Deputy Mayor.</a></p><h3 id=the-numbers-relentless-unforgiving>The Numbers: Relentless, Unforgiving</h3><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>3 people died</strong> on these streets. <strong>14 were seriously injured.</strong> <strong>588 hurt.</strong> The bodies are not numbers. They are neighbors, workers, children. Cars and SUVs did most of the damage. Buses killed too. The cycle repeats. The city counts the dead. The living limp home.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h3><p>Assembly Member Harvey Epstein has backed bills for safer streets. He co-sponsored the <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, pushing for speed limiters on repeat offenders. He signed on to <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A8423&amp;term=2023">complete streets bills</a> to force safer design. He voted for more funding for street redesigns. But when it came to a key vote to extend school speed zone protections, he was marked absent. The city needs more than good intentions. It needs action. It needs leaders present when it counts.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every delay is a choice. Call Assembly Member Epstein. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed limiters for repeat offenders. Demand streets that put people first. <strong>Do not wait for another siren.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, saw candidates who championed 'the importance of bike lanes, public transit, and open streets' win across the city. Council members Lincoln Restler, Shahana Hanif, Shekar Krishnan, Chi Oss, Crystal Hudson, and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams all prevailed on platforms supporting safer streets. Mark Levine, who called for bold highway changes, won the Comptroller race. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text is a vague statement of support for livable streets but does not describe a specific policy action or legislative change, so its direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists cannot be determined.' The victories signal a mandate for people-first streets, but concrete safety gains depend on future action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Prosecutors say Ali drank for nearly six hours at three Manhattan bars, reaching a blood alcohol content of .158, almost twice the legal limit. After hitting Esiyok, Ali continued, injuring a cyclist, two more pedestrians, and crashing into a van. The family’s lawsuit cites New York’s Dram Shop Act, which holds bars liable for serving visibly drunk patrons who later cause harm. The article quotes the family’s lawyer: “The family is devastated.

The rally targeted Governor Hochul’s $252 billion budget, which omits $33 billion needed for transit upgrades. The event, covered by amny.com, highlighted the matter: 'NYC transit advocates urge Hochul to fully fund MTA Capital Plan with guaranteed state budget revenue.' Hoylman-Sigal said, 'This is about the economic engine for the entire region.' Assembly Member Tony Simone and others demanded investment in transportation deserts and accessible stations. Advocates cited the MTA’s ADA settlement, noting only a quarter of stations are wheelchair-accessible, with the fewest in low-income areas. The rally underscored that without full funding, vulnerable riders—especially those with disabilities—face continued barriers and danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
