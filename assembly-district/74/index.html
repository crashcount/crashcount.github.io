A 21-year-old, driving a Nissan Rogue without a license, struck him and fled. The cyclist suffered severe head trauma. Paramedics found him unconscious. The driver later told police he ran because he had no license. He now faces charges for leaving the scene and driving unlicensed, as <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/driver-arrested-after-hitting-65-year-old-e-biker-on-second-ave-XF4896347>reported by West Side Spirit</a>.</p><p>On the FDR Drive, a firefighter fell from his motorcycle.

Cyclists, pedestrians, children. The old and the young. Cars and SUVs did most of the damage, but trucks, buses, bikes, and motorcycles all left bodies behind. The street is a gauntlet. The numbers do not rest.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h2><p>Assembly Member Harvey Epstein has co-sponsored bills to require speed limiters for repeat speeders and to force safer street designs for all users. He has voted for more funding for safer streets and better driver education. But this June, he missed a key vote to extend school speed zone protections. He also voted to weaken bus rules, raising risk for people on foot and bike. The record is mixed. The danger is not.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>No one should die for crossing the street.</strong> Call Assembly Member Epstein.

The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, saw candidates who championed 'the importance of bike lanes, public transit, and open streets' win across the city. Council members Lincoln Restler, Shahana Hanif, Shekar Krishnan, Chi Oss, Crystal Hudson, and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams all prevailed on platforms supporting safer streets. Mark Levine, who called for bold highway changes, won the Comptroller race. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text is a vague statement of support for livable streets but does not describe a specific policy action or legislative change, so its direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists cannot be determined.' The victories signal a mandate for people-first streets, but concrete safety gains depend on future action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Sponsored by Senator Andrew Gounardes, the bill passed Senate votes on June 12 and June 13, and cleared the Assembly on June 17. The measure extends and corrects school speed zone laws in New York City, repealing outdated provisions. Gounardes led the push, with strong support from most Senate Democrats and a split Assembly. The bill's technical fixes aim to keep protections in place for children and other vulnerable road users near schools.

The rally targeted Governor Hochul’s $252 billion budget, which omits $33 billion needed for transit upgrades. The event, covered by amny.com, highlighted the matter: 'NYC transit advocates urge Hochul to fully fund MTA Capital Plan with guaranteed state budget revenue.' Hoylman-Sigal said, 'This is about the economic engine for the entire region.' Assembly Member Tony Simone and others demanded investment in transportation deserts and accessible stations. Advocates cited the MTA’s ADA settlement, noting only a quarter of stations are wheelchair-accessible, with the fewest in low-income areas. The rally underscored that without full funding, vulnerable riders—especially those with disabilities—face continued barriers and danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
