Nineteen left with serious injuries.</strong> Nearly 1,500 wounded since 2022. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, workers, children. A 23-year-old cyclist, struck and killed at Park Avenue South. A 67-year-old woman, crushed by a truck turning at Avenue C. A man, 45, dead under the wheels of a bus at Avenue D. Each loss leaves a hole in the street that never closes.</p><h3 id=the-faces-behind-the-numbers>The Faces Behind the Numbers</h3><p>The violence does not stop. <strong>Sedans, SUVs, trucks, buses, bikes—all have drawn blood.</strong> Cars and SUVs killed four. Trucks and buses killed two. Bikes left three with serious injuries. The pattern is clear. The most vulnerable—pedestrians and cyclists—pay the highest price. In June 2025, a Turkish immigrant was killed crossing Third Avenue. His family is &ldquo;devastated. They&rsquo;re still in disbelief&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/07/us-news/family-of-turkish-immigrant-killed-in-dwi-crash-sues-nyc-bars/>said their lawyer</a>. The pain does not fade. It multiplies.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Assembly Member <strong>Harvey Epstein has signed on to bills that could make streets safer</strong>. He <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1875&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored measures</a> to require complete street design, <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A324&amp;term=2025">automated bike lane enforcement</a>, and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">speed limiters</a>. He <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-transit-advocates-mta-funding-capital-02022025/>backed funding for transit</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>supported lowering speed limits</a> on Open Streets to five miles per hour. But when it came time to vote on a bill for school speed zone cameras, <strong>Epstein was excused</strong>—a missed chance to protect children. He also supported an electric vehicle discount that critics say could put heavier, deadlier vehicles on city streets. <strong>Progress is slow. The blood dries, but the danger remains.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day without action is another day of risk. Call Assembly Member Epstein. Call your council member. Demand lower speed limits, more automated enforcement, and streets built for people, not cars. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, saw candidates who championed 'the importance of bike lanes, public transit, and open streets' win across the city. Council members Lincoln Restler, Shahana Hanif, Shekar Krishnan, Chi Oss, Crystal Hudson, and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams all prevailed on platforms supporting safer streets. Mark Levine, who called for bold highway changes, won the Comptroller race. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text is a vague statement of support for livable streets but does not describe a specific policy action or legislative change, so its direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists cannot be determined.' The victories signal a mandate for people-first streets, but concrete safety gains depend on future action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The rally targeted Governor Hochul’s $252 billion budget, which omits $33 billion needed for transit upgrades. The event, covered by amny.com, highlighted the matter: 'NYC transit advocates urge Hochul to fully fund MTA Capital Plan with guaranteed state budget revenue.' Hoylman-Sigal said, 'This is about the economic engine for the entire region.' Assembly Member Tony Simone and others demanded investment in transportation deserts and accessible stations. Advocates cited the MTA’s ADA settlement, noting only a quarter of stations are wheelchair-accessible, with the fewest in low-income areas. The rally underscored that without full funding, vulnerable riders—especially those with disabilities—face continued barriers and danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the cyclist was traveling north when he struck at high speed, his bike’s front end crushed.

The cyclist was ejected from the bike, landing face-first on the pavement, and was found semiconscious and bleeding. No helmet was worn, as noted in the police report, but the primary causes cited are the rider’s aggressive actions and unsafe velocity.

The matter, described as 'Albany pumps the brakes on MTA funding plan in rebuke of Hochul’s move to ditch congestion pricing,' left the MTA without the $1 billion annual revenue congestion pricing would have provided. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins announced the session’s close without a deal. Lawmakers including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris, State Sen. John Liu, Assemblyman Harvey Epstein, and Assemblyman Tony Simone criticized the governor’s decision and the proposed IOU bailout. Gounardes said, 'I cannot in good conscience ratify a decision that will eliminate a significant, dedicated revenue source for the MTA’s capital plan.' The pause leaves the city’s transit future—and the safety of those who rely on it—uncertain.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter title reads: 'authorize New York City to set a five mile per hour speed limit on streets participating in the Open Streets program.' Council Member Shahana K. Hanif led as primary sponsor, joined by Amanda Farías, Crystal Hudson, Julie Won, and Carlina Rivera. The committee approved the resolution with strong support. The bill targets streets where pedestrians and cyclists mix with traffic. Lower speeds mean fewer crashes and less severe injuries.
