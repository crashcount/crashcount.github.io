Nineteen left with serious injuries.</strong> Nearly 1,500 wounded since 2022. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, workers, children. A 23-year-old cyclist, struck and killed at Park Avenue South. A 67-year-old woman, crushed by a truck turning at Avenue C. A man, 45, dead under the wheels of a bus at Avenue D. Each loss leaves a hole in the street that never closes.</p><h3 id=the-faces-behind-the-numbers>The Faces Behind the Numbers</h3><p>The violence does not stop. <strong>Sedans, SUVs, trucks, buses, bikes—all have drawn blood.</strong> Cars and SUVs killed four. Trucks and buses killed two. Bikes left three with serious injuries. The pattern is clear. The most vulnerable—pedestrians and cyclists—pay the highest price. In June 2025, a Turkish immigrant was killed crossing Third Avenue. His family is &ldquo;devastated. They&rsquo;re still in disbelief&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/07/us-news/family-of-turkish-immigrant-killed-in-dwi-crash-sues-nyc-bars/>said their lawyer</a>. The pain does not fade. It multiplies.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Assembly Member <strong>Harvey Epstein has signed on to bills that could make streets safer</strong>. He <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1875&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored measures</a> to require complete street design, <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A324&amp;term=2025">automated bike lane enforcement</a>, and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">speed limiters</a>.

But when it came time to vote on a bill for school speed zone cameras, <strong>Epstein was excused</strong>—a missed chance to protect children. He also supported an electric vehicle discount that critics say could put heavier, deadlier vehicles on city streets. <strong>Progress is slow. The blood dries, but the danger remains.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day without action is another day of risk.

Vulnerable road users watch and wait.</p><p class=mb3>On June 25, 2025, New York City held local elections with major implications for street safety. The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, saw candidates who championed 'the importance of bike lanes, public transit, and open streets' win across the city. Council members Lincoln Restler, Shahana Hanif, Shekar Krishnan, Chi Oss, Crystal Hudson, and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams all prevailed on platforms supporting safer streets. Mark Levine, who called for bold highway changes, won the Comptroller race. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text is a vague statement of support for livable streets but does not describe a specific policy action or legislative change, so its direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists cannot be determined.' The victories signal a mandate for people-first streets, but concrete safety gains depend on future action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Prosecutors say Ali drank for nearly six hours at three Manhattan bars, reaching a blood alcohol content of .158, almost twice the legal limit. After hitting Esiyok, Ali continued, injuring a cyclist, two more pedestrians, and crashing into a van. The family’s lawsuit cites New York’s Dram Shop Act, which holds bars liable for serving visibly drunk patrons who later cause harm. The article quotes the family’s lawyer: “The family is devastated. They’re still in disbelief.” The case highlights failures in both driver responsibility and alcohol-serving oversight.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The impact was to the center front end of the motorcycle and the left side doors of the bus. The data does not specify which driver disregarded the signal, but the failure to obey traffic control devices stands out as the central cause. The motorcyclist was not wearing a helmet, which is noted in the report after the primary driver error.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the collision occurred far from any crosswalk, with the victim crossing the roadway. The report explicitly cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor in the crash. The woman suffered fatal head injuries and died at the scene. The narrative notes she was alone, in the dark, and not at an intersection. The data does not list any victim behavior as a contributing factor. The deadly impact and the cited driver inattention underscore the persistent systemic dangers faced by pedestrians on New York City’s high-speed corridors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

No replacement for the lost $1 billion. Transit riders and street users face uncertainty. Lawmakers call the move reckless. The city waits. Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2024, the New York State legislative session ended without passing a replacement funding plan for the MTA after Governor Kathy Hochul paused congestion pricing. The matter, described as 'Albany pumps the brakes on MTA funding plan in rebuke of Hochul’s move to ditch congestion pricing,' left the MTA without the $1 billion annual revenue congestion pricing would have provided. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins announced the session’s close without a deal. Lawmakers including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris, State Sen. John Liu, Assemblyman Harvey Epstein, and Assemblyman Tony Simone criticized the governor’s decision and the proposed IOU bailout. Gounardes said, 'I cannot in good conscience ratify a decision that will eliminate a significant, dedicated revenue source for the MTA’s capital plan.' The pause leaves the city’s transit future—and the safety of those who rely on it—uncertain.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move aims to slow cars where people walk, bike, and gather. Resolution passes. Streets may breathe easier.

The measure would let New York City set a five mile per hour speed limit on streets in the Open Streets program. The matter title reads: 'authorize New York City to set a five mile per hour speed limit on streets participating in the Open Streets program.' Council Member Shahana K. Hanif led as primary sponsor, joined by Amanda Farías, Crystal Hudson, Julie Won, and Carlina Rivera. The committee approved the resolution with strong support. The bill targets streets where pedestrians and cyclists mix with traffic. Lower speeds mean fewer crashes and less severe injuries. The council’s action puts pressure on Albany to give the city the power to protect people where they are most exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The pedestrian was at the intersection, engaged in 'other actions in roadway' as described in the report. The vehicle, a 2018 bus, was undamaged and driven by a licensed male driver. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified.' No driver errors are explicitly cited, but the narrative centers the lethal consequences of a turning bus and the vulnerability of those on foot.
