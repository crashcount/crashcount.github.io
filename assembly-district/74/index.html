Nineteen suffered serious injuries.</strong> In three and a half years, there have been <strong>2,564 crashes</strong>. The toll is steady, relentless. A 67-year-old woman struck by a truck turning left at Avenue C. A 23-year-old cyclist killed by a sedan on Park Avenue South. A 31-year-old woman, dead on the FDR, hit by an SUV. Each crash is a life ended or broken. Each is a family changed forever. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash data</a></p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the highest price.</strong> In the last year alone, 464 people were hurt, 12 seriously. Three did not survive. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, parents, children. The street does not forgive.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Assembly Member Harvey Epstein has put his name to bills that could make streets safer. He co-sponsored measures to require <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1875&amp;term=2025">complete street design</a> for all state and local projects—roads built for people, not just cars. He backed <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A324&amp;term=2025">bike lane enforcement</a> and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">speed limiters</a>. He stood with others to <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-transit-advocates-mta-funding-capital-02022025/>demand full funding for transit</a>, and <a href=https://nypost.com/2024/06/07/us-news/albany-pumps-the-brakes-on-mta-funding-plan-in-rebuke-of-hochuls-move-to-ditch-congestion-pricing/>opposed the pause on congestion pricing</a> that leaves the city’s future uncertain. But when a vote came to expand school speed cameras in Schenectady, Epstein was excused—<strong>missing a chance to boost safety for children</strong>.</p><p>Epstein has also <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-basement-apartments-death-traps-20220901-kjccufq5jzbvldu7rvdsdwlsiq-story.html#ed=rss_www.nydailynews.com/arcio/rss/category/opinion/">supported legalizing basement apartments</a> for tenant safety. But on street safety, the work is not done. <strong>Bills can sit. Streets stay dangerous.</strong></p><h3 id=the-path-forward>The Path Forward</h3><p><strong>The carnage will not end by itself.</strong> The city now has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has the tools to redesign intersections, harden bike lanes, and keep speed cameras running. But power unused is as good as no power at all.</p><p><strong>Call your leaders. Demand action.</strong> Tell Harvey Epstein and every official: <strong>Lower the speed. Build the lanes. Protect the children.</strong> Every day of delay is another day of blood on the street.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The rally targeted Governor Hochul’s $252 billion budget, which omits $33 billion needed for transit upgrades. The event, covered by amny.com, highlighted the matter: 'NYC transit advocates urge Hochul to fully fund MTA Capital Plan with guaranteed state budget revenue.' Hoylman-Sigal said, 'This is about the economic engine for the entire region.' Assembly Member Tony Simone and others demanded investment in transportation deserts and accessible stations. Advocates cited the MTA’s ADA settlement, noting only a quarter of stations are wheelchair-accessible, with the fewest in low-income areas. The rally underscored that without full funding, vulnerable riders—especially those with disabilities—face continued barriers and danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No replacement for the lost $1 billion. Transit riders and street users face uncertainty. Lawmakers call the move reckless. The city waits. Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2024, the New York State legislative session ended without passing a replacement funding plan for the MTA after Governor Kathy Hochul paused congestion pricing. The matter, described as 'Albany pumps the brakes on MTA funding plan in rebuke of Hochul’s move to ditch congestion pricing,' left the MTA without the $1 billion annual revenue congestion pricing would have provided. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins announced the session’s close without a deal. Lawmakers including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris, State Sen. John Liu, Assemblyman Harvey Epstein, and Assemblyman Tony Simone criticized the governor’s decision and the proposed IOU bailout. Gounardes said, 'I cannot in good conscience ratify a decision that will eliminate a significant, dedicated revenue source for the MTA’s capital plan.' The pause leaves the city’s transit future—and the safety of those who rely on it—uncertain.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move aims to slow cars where people walk, bike, and gather. Resolution passes. Streets may breathe easier. The city pushes Albany to let it set its own pace.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0079-2024, adopted June 6, 2024 by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, urges the State Legislature and Governor to pass S.315/A.1416. The measure would let New York City set a five mile per hour speed limit on streets in the Open Streets program. The matter title reads: 'authorize New York City to set a five mile per hour speed limit on streets participating in the Open Streets program.' Council Member Shahana K. Hanif led as primary sponsor, joined by Amanda Farías, Crystal Hudson, Julie Won, and Carlina Rivera. The committee approved the resolution with strong support. The bill targets streets where pedestrians and cyclists mix with traffic. Lower speeds mean fewer crashes and less severe injuries. The council’s action puts pressure on Albany to give the city the power to protect people where they are most exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
