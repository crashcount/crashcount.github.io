Nineteen left with serious injuries.</strong> Nearly 1,500 wounded since 2022. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, workers, children. A 23-year-old cyclist, struck and killed at Park Avenue South. A 67-year-old woman, crushed by a truck turning at Avenue C. A man, 45, dead under the wheels of a bus at Avenue D. Each loss leaves a hole in the street that never closes.</p><h3 id=the-faces-behind-the-numbers>The Faces Behind the Numbers</h3><p>The violence does not stop. <strong>Sedans, SUVs, trucks, buses, bikes—all have drawn blood.</strong> Cars and SUVs killed four. Trucks and buses killed two. Bikes left three with serious injuries. The pattern is clear. The most vulnerable—pedestrians and cyclists—pay the highest price. In June 2025, a Turkish immigrant was killed crossing Third Avenue. His family is &ldquo;devastated. They&rsquo;re still in disbelief&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/07/us-news/family-of-turkish-immigrant-killed-in-dwi-crash-sues-nyc-bars/>said their lawyer</a>. The pain does not fade. It multiplies.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Assembly Member <strong>Harvey Epstein has signed on to bills that could make streets safer</strong>. He <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1875&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored measures</a> to require complete street design, <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A324&amp;term=2025">automated bike lane enforcement</a>, and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">speed limiters</a>. He <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-transit-advocates-mta-funding-capital-02022025/>backed funding for transit</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>supported lowering speed limits</a> on Open Streets to five miles per hour. But when it came time to vote on a bill for school speed zone cameras, <strong>Epstein was excused</strong>—a missed chance to protect children. He also supported an electric vehicle discount that critics say could put heavier, deadlier vehicles on city streets. <strong>Progress is slow. The blood dries, but the danger remains.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day without action is another day of risk. Call Assembly Member Epstein. Call your council member. Demand lower speed limits, more automated enforcement, and streets built for people, not cars. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, saw candidates who championed 'the importance of bike lanes, public transit, and open streets' win across the city. Council members Lincoln Restler, Shahana Hanif, Shekar Krishnan, Chi Oss, Crystal Hudson, and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams all prevailed on platforms supporting safer streets. Mark Levine, who called for bold highway changes, won the Comptroller race. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text is a vague statement of support for livable streets but does not describe a specific policy action or legislative change, so its direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists cannot be determined.' The victories signal a mandate for people-first streets, but concrete safety gains depend on future action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Prosecutors say Ali drank for nearly six hours at three Manhattan bars, reaching a blood alcohol content of .158, almost twice the legal limit. After hitting Esiyok, Ali continued, injuring a cyclist, two more pedestrians, and crashing into a van. The family’s lawsuit cites New York’s Dram Shop Act, which holds bars liable for serving visibly drunk patrons who later cause harm. The article quotes the family’s lawyer: “The family is devastated.

Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2024, the New York State legislative session ended without passing a replacement funding plan for the MTA after Governor Kathy Hochul paused congestion pricing. The matter, described as 'Albany pumps the brakes on MTA funding plan in rebuke of Hochul’s move to ditch congestion pricing,' left the MTA without the $1 billion annual revenue congestion pricing would have provided. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins announced the session’s close without a deal. Lawmakers including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris, State Sen. John Liu, Assemblyman Harvey Epstein, and Assemblyman Tony Simone criticized the governor’s decision and the proposed IOU bailout. Gounardes said, 'I cannot in good conscience ratify a decision that will eliminate a significant, dedicated revenue source for the MTA’s capital plan.'

Hanif led as primary sponsor, joined by Amanda Farías, Crystal Hudson, Julie Won, and Carlina Rivera. The committee approved the resolution with strong support. The bill targets streets where pedestrians and cyclists mix with traffic. Lower speeds mean fewer crashes and less severe injuries.
