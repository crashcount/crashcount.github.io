He never comes home. <strong>In the last twelve months, 1 person died and 634 were injured in crashes in Assembly District 35.</strong> Eight suffered injuries so severe they may never recover. Children, teens, elders—no one is spared. The dead are not numbers. They are sons, daughters, neighbors. Justin Diaz was 23. He had just earned his degree in aeronautics. He was driving north on 107th Street, headed to his job at LaGuardia. He had the right of way. He did not survive the intersection. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/27/justin-diaz-queens-bmw-driver-michael-pena-drunk-speeding-mercedes-fdny-firefighter-crash/>&ldquo;He was only 23 with his entire life ahead of him,&rdquo;</a> said his brother.</p><h3 id=speed-impunity-and-the-cost-of-delay>Speed, Impunity, and the Cost of Delay</h3><p>The crash that killed Justin Diaz was not an accident. The man who hit him was an off-duty firefighter. He drove 83 miles per hour in a 25 zone. He ran a red light. He was drunk. He was high. He had 25 prior school zone speeding tickets. He posted bail and walked free. Justin will never walk again. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/deadly-queens-crash-michael-pena-justin-diaz/>&ldquo;Drunk, drugged and reckless driving are dire threats to everyone on our shared roadways,&rdquo;</a> said Queens DA Melinda Katz.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h3><p><strong>Assembly Member Larinda Hooks has not led on traffic violence.</strong> In public hearings, she supported more transit to LaGuardia but opposed removing parking or traffic lanes—even as children are killed crossing the street (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/mass-transit-nyc-airport-hochul-laguardia-connection>hearings coverage</a>). No record shows her fighting for lower speed limits, more cameras, or safer street design. The silence is loud. The blood is real.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day of delay means another family shattered. Call Assembly Member Hooks. Demand she back real change: lower speed limits, more enforcement, safer crossings. Join <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a> and <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a>. Do not wait for another name on the list. <strong>Act now.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Police said Peña drove 83 mph in a 25 mph zone and ran a red light, t-boning Justin Diaz near LaGuardia Airport. Peña had a history of 25 school-zone speeding tickets. The article quotes Diaz's brother: "We're sick, angry, disgusted." Peña was charged with vehicular manslaughter, DWI, and refusing a breath test.

Prosecutors revealed Pena had '25 tickets for speeding in school zones' in recent years. Surveillance showed both cars spinning out after the crash; Diaz died at Elmhurst Hospital. Pena tested positive for cocaine, marijuana, and had a blood-alcohol content of 0.156%. He faces 14 charges, including manslaughter and DWI. Diaz’s family called for stronger laws, with his mother stating, 'They need to look at the laws and see that people need to be charged accordingly.' Pena’s license was suspended and he was remanded to Rikers.
