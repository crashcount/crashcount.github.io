A Mercedes runs the red. The BMW is hit, thrown into a parked car. The roof is torn off. Justin Diaz, 23, is dead. He was driving to work at LaGuardia. The man who killed him was an off-duty firefighter, drunk, high, and driving 83 in a 25. He had 25 prior school zone speeding tickets. The DA called it plain: <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/deadly-queens-crash-michael-pena-justin-diaz/>“Drunk, drugged and reckless driving are dire threats to everyone on our shared roadways.”</a> Diaz’s brother <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/27/justin-diaz-queens-bmw-driver-michael-pena-drunk-speeding-mercedes-fdny-firefighter-crash/>said, “Pena will walk the streets for a $50,000 bail&mldr; Justin will never walk the streets again.”</a></p><h2 id=the-numbers-dont-lie>The Numbers Don’t Lie</h2><p><strong>Seven people have died on these streets since 2022.</strong> Nearly 2,000 have been hurt.

The dead are not numbers. They are sons, daughters, neighbors. They are gone.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h2><p>Assembly Member Larinda Hooks voted to extend and expand school speed cameras. She voted yes to keep children safer near schools. She also voted to weaken bus lane rules, making it easier for cars to block the way for buses, bikes, and people on foot. She has not led on lowering the speed limit or stopping repeat speeders. The silence is loud.</p><h2 id=what-next-the-cost-of-waiting>What Next? The Cost of Waiting</h2><p><strong>Every day without action is another day someone is seriously hurt or killed.</strong> Call Assembly Member Hooks. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit.
