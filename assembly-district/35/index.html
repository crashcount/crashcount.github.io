He never comes home. <strong>In the last twelve months, 1 person died and 634 were injured in crashes in Assembly District 35.</strong> Eight suffered injuries so severe they may never recover. Children, teens, elders—no one is spared. The dead are not numbers. They are sons, daughters, neighbors. Justin Diaz was 23. He had just earned his degree in aeronautics. He was driving north on 107th Street, headed to his job at LaGuardia. He had the right of way. He did not survive the intersection. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/27/justin-diaz-queens-bmw-driver-michael-pena-drunk-speeding-mercedes-fdny-firefighter-crash/>&ldquo;He was only 23 with his entire life ahead of him,&rdquo;</a> said his brother.</p><h3 id=speed-impunity-and-the-cost-of-delay>Speed, Impunity, and the Cost of Delay</h3><p>The crash that killed Justin Diaz was not an accident. The man who hit him was an off-duty firefighter. He drove 83 miles per hour in a 25 zone. He ran a red light. He was drunk. He was high. He had 25 prior school zone speeding tickets. He posted bail and walked free. Justin will never walk again. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/deadly-queens-crash-michael-pena-justin-diaz/>&ldquo;Drunk, drugged and reckless driving are dire threats to everyone on our shared roadways,&rdquo;</a> said Queens DA Melinda Katz.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h3><p><strong>Assembly Member Larinda Hooks has not led on traffic violence.</strong> In public hearings, she supported more transit to LaGuardia but opposed removing parking or traffic lanes—even as children are killed crossing the street (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/mass-transit-nyc-airport-hochul-laguardia-connection>hearings coverage</a>). No record shows her fighting for lower speed limits, more cameras, or safer street design. The silence is loud. The blood is real.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day of delay means another family shattered. Call Assembly Member Hooks. Demand she back real change: lower speed limits, more enforcement, safer crossings. Join <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a> and <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a>. Do not wait for another name on the list. <strong>Act now.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

He struck Justin Diaz’s car at 83 mph. Diaz died a block from home. The driver was drunk, high, and unregistered. The court revoked his bail. Diaz’s family mourns.</p><p class=mb3>ABC7 reported on April 17, 2025, that ex-FDNY firefighter Michael Peña faces manslaughter and DWI charges after a deadly crash in Queens. Prosecutors allege Peña was drunk, high, and speeding at 83 mph—three times the limit—when he ran a red light and T-boned 23-year-old Justin Diaz’s car. Surveillance and body camera footage show Peña admitting to running the light. Five hours after the crash, tests confirmed intoxication by alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine. Peña’s record includes prior arrests and 25 school zone speeding tickets. He also drove an unregistered vehicle with an obstructed plate and tinted windshield. The victim, Diaz, was headed to work and had just graduated college. The case highlights repeated driver violations and systemic failures in enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
