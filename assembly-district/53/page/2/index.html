Thirty-six left with injuries that will not heal.</strong> Since 2022, the streets of <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-hit-run-32-year-old-man-struck-car-bushwick-shares-survival-story/16486736/>Bushwick</a>, <a href=/neighborhood/bk0104/>East Williamsburg</a>, and beyond have become a gauntlet for anyone not behind a windshield. These are not just numbers. They are broken bodies, empty beds, and families waiting for a call that never comes.</p><p>Just this spring, a 32-year-old man was thrown &ldquo;maybe 10 to 15 feet right into the middle of the intersection, and just left there&rdquo; after a hit-and-run in Bushwick. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-hit-run-32-year-old-man-struck-car-bushwick-shares-survival-story/16486736/>His friend said</a>, &ldquo;For you to be so reckless that you could&rsquo;ve ended his life.

The danger remains.</p><h3 id=trucks-cars-and-the-cost-of-delay>Trucks, Cars, and the Cost of Delay</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs have injured 340 people and killed at least one. Trucks and buses have killed three.</strong> Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll. The violence is not random. It is the result of choices—by drivers, by planners, by those who hold power and do not use it fast enough.</p><p>On June 13, a garbage truck turned and killed a moped rider on Flushing Avenue. The driver was not a city worker. No arrests were made. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/13/garbage-truck-mta-bus-oil-truck-accidents-claim-lives-nyc/>The crash was one of three deaths that day</a>.

She voted to extend school speed cameras. But when it counted, she missed the vote to fix and extend school speed zone protections (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>see vote record</a>). She voted yes to weaken bus lane rules, making streets riskier for those on foot and bike.</p><p><strong>Every delay costs lives. Every missed vote is another mother waiting for her child to come home.</strong></p><h3 id=the-call-no-more-waiting>The Call: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Call Maritza Davila. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real street redesign. Demand action—not words, not studies, not excuses.</strong></p><p>The blood on the street is not an accident.
