Thirty seriously hurt. Over 2,000 injured.</strong> These are not just numbers. They are people—pedestrians, cyclists, children—struck down on the streets of Bushwick and East Williamsburg since 2022. A man thrown ten feet in a Bushwick crosswalk, left broken in the intersection. His friend <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-hit-run-32-year-old-man-struck-car-bushwick-shares-survival-story/16486736/>described the crash</a>: &ldquo;He gets absolutely launched, maybe 10 to 15 feet right into the middle of the intersection, and just left there.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>The violence does not stop.</strong> In the last year alone, five killed, ten left with life-changing injuries. The dead include a pedestrian crushed by a turning truck, a cyclist killed by a van, a motorcyclist thrown from his bike. The streets do not forgive. The city does not fix them fast enough.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-not-taken>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Not Taken</h2><p>Assembly Member Maritza Davila has taken some steps. She co-sponsored bills to force speed limiters on repeat offenders and to require streets to be built for people, not just cars. She voted yes on school speed cameras to protect children. These are real actions. But the crisis is not over. <strong>Every week, another crash. Every week, another family changed forever.</strong></p><p>The city only closed a deadly intersection after a man died. As one neighbor <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/28/city-to-fix-dangerous-bushwick-intersection-where-driver-killed-motorcyclist>put it</a>: &ldquo;Unfortunately, somebody has to die before something gets done.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Speed kills. Delay kills.</strong> The law now allows New York City to lower speed limits to 20 mph. The city can act. Davila can push harder. Residents can demand more. <strong>Contact your council member, the mayor, and Assembly Member Davila. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand more speed cameras. Demand streets built for people, not cars.</strong></p><p>The bodies in the road are not an act of God. They are the result of choices. Make your voice count. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
