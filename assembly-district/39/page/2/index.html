But they do not lie. <strong>Twelve people have died on these streets since 2022.</strong> Over 1,250 have been injured. Ten were hurt so badly they may never walk the same. The dead include a 70-year-old man crushed by a bus on Woodhaven Boulevard last month, a cyclist killed by an SUV on Roosevelt Avenue, and a 4-year-old girl struck in a crosswalk by a driver who ran a red light and fled. The girls were taken to Elmhurst Hospital. Their shoes were left behind. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/two-little-girls-4-and-8-struck-by-driver-who-blew-red-light-in-queens/>The SUV driver fled after the collision and remains on the loose, police said.</a></p><h2 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-young>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Young</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the damage.</strong> They are behind the majority of pedestrian injuries and deaths. Trucks and buses kill too. Motorcycles and mopeds add to the toll. Children are not spared. In the last year alone, 43 people under 18 were injured in crashes here. Two suffered injuries so severe the numbers do not capture the pain.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h2><p>Assembly Member Catalina Cruz has voted to extend school speed zones and back safer street designs. She co-sponsored bills to require streets built for people, not just cars. She voted to keep speed cameras running near schools. But she also voted to weaken bus rules, a move that puts pedestrians and cyclists at greater risk. The work is not finished. The streets are not safe.</p><h2 id=the-call-demand-more-than-words>The Call: Demand More Than Words</h2><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a policy failure. Call Assembly Member Cruz. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for children and seniors. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p><p><strong>Act now.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The initiative, called 'Trick-or-Streets,' will close 100 streets—across all boroughs except Staten Island—from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. The DOT will extend hours on 40 existing open streets and keep another 60 car-free through the evening, partnering with the Street Activity Permit Office for more pedestrian zones. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'I am incredibly excited to build on the triumph of our thriving Open Streets program ... this Halloween, providing greater access to safer, shared community spaces.' Assembly Member Catalina Cruz and Council Member Shekar Krishnan backed the move, stressing the deadly risk cars pose to children. DOT data shows a 42% drop in pedestrian injury crashes on 34th Avenue since it went car-free. The city cites national spikes in child pedestrian deaths on Halloween.

Albany debates, but time runs out. Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On May 13, 2022, Mayor Adams traveled to Albany to press lawmakers on his legislative priorities. The push included extending mayoral control of New York City’s public schools and, crucially, allowing speed cameras to operate 24/7. The matter summary states: 'Topping the list for Adams is extending mayoral control of the city’s public schools and allowing speed cameras on city streets to operate 24/7.' State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie were key figures in these talks. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez also lobbied for expanded speed camera authority. Despite Adams’s efforts, lawmakers showed little appetite for granting 'home rule'—the power for the city to control camera placement and hours. Advocates warn that restricting camera hours to weekdays, 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., leaves streets deadly at night. The legislative session neared its end with no breakthrough, leaving vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
