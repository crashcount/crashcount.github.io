An SUV driver went around another car, ran the red, and hit them. The driver fled. The girls were taken to Elmhurst Hospital. Their injuries were called minor. The fear will last longer. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/two-little-girls-4-and-8-struck-by-driver-who-blew-red-light-in-queens/>Police said</a> the driver is still out there.</p><p>This is not rare. In the last twelve months, three people died and 358 were injured in crashes in Assembly District 39. Four were seriously hurt. Children under 18 made up 45 of the injured, with two suffering serious injuries. The old and the young are not spared.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>Cars and SUVs did the most harm. In the last three years, they caused 44 pedestrian injuries, three of them serious. Trucks and buses killed once and injured six more. Motorcycles and mopeds took one life and left four others hurt. Even bikes, meant for freedom, left three injured. The street does not forgive.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn’t</h3><p>Assembly Member Catalina Cruz has taken some steps. She co-sponsored bills to make streets safer for all users, pushing for &ldquo;complete streets&rdquo; that protect the most vulnerable. She voted yes to expand speed cameras near schools, a proven way to slow drivers and save lives. But the carnage continues. The bills sit in committee. The cameras catch only what the law allows. Children still bleed in the crosswalk.</p><p>Cruz backed car-free streets for Halloween, saying cars are a deadly risk to children. The city’s own data shows a 42% drop in pedestrian injury crashes on 34th Avenue since it went car-free. But one night a year is not enough. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/10/24/no-trick-all-treat-city-to-ban-cars-on-some-streets-for-halloween>DOT Commissioner Rodriguez, with Cruz’s support, said</a>, &ldquo;I am incredibly excited to build on the triumph of our thriving Open Streets program &mldr; this Halloween, providing greater access to safer, shared community spaces.&rdquo; The rest of the year, the cars return.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p>This is a slow disaster. It will not stop until you make it stop. Call Assembly Member Cruz. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand more car-free streets, not just for holidays. Demand action, not words. Every day you wait, another family waits for the sirens.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Officials say car-free streets mean fewer dead children.</p><p class=mb3>On October 24, 2022, the NYC Department of Transportation announced a major expansion of car-free streets for Halloween. The initiative, called 'Trick-or-Streets,' will close 100 streets—across all boroughs except Staten Island—from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. The DOT will extend hours on 40 existing open streets and keep another 60 car-free through the evening, partnering with the Street Activity Permit Office for more pedestrian zones. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'I am incredibly excited to build on the triumph of our thriving Open Streets program ... this Halloween, providing greater access to safer, shared community spaces.' Assembly Member Catalina Cruz and Council Member Shekar Krishnan backed the move, stressing the deadly risk cars pose to children. DOT data shows a 42% drop in pedestrian injury crashes on 34th Avenue since it went car-free. The city cites national spikes in child pedestrian deaths on Halloween. The message is clear: car-free streets save lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
