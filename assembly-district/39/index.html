He hit an SUV, flew from his bike, and was run over by another driver who did not stop. Police said, &ldquo;Kahyl Pena was riding a 2019 Kawasaki west on the expressway when he veered to his right, using the shoulder to pass a vehicle near 97th St. in Corona about 3:45 p.m. last Thursday, cops said.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/28/kahyl-pena-queens-motorcyclist-24-dies-crash-long-island-expressway-lie-involving-2-drivers/>NY Daily News</a></p><p>In May, two little girls—ages four and eight—were crossing 37th Avenue in the crosswalk.
