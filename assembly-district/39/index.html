But they do not lie. <strong>Twelve people have died on these streets since 2022.</strong> Over 1,250 have been injured. Ten were hurt so badly they may never walk the same. The dead include a 70-year-old man crushed by a bus on Woodhaven Boulevard last month, a cyclist killed by an SUV on Roosevelt Avenue, and a 4-year-old girl struck in a crosswalk by a driver who ran a red light and fled. The girls were taken to Elmhurst Hospital. Their shoes were left behind. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/two-little-girls-4-and-8-struck-by-driver-who-blew-red-light-in-queens/>The SUV driver fled after the collision and remains on the loose, police said.</a></p><h2 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-young>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Young</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the damage.</strong> They are behind the majority of pedestrian injuries and deaths. Trucks and buses kill too. Motorcycles and mopeds add to the toll. Children are not spared. In the last year alone, 43 people under 18 were injured in crashes here. Two suffered injuries so severe the numbers do not capture the pain.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h2><p>Assembly Member Catalina Cruz has voted to extend school speed zones and back safer street designs. She co-sponsored bills to require streets built for people, not just cars. She voted to keep speed cameras running near schools. But she also voted to weaken bus rules, a move that puts pedestrians and cyclists at greater risk. The work is not finished. The streets are not safe.</p><h2 id=the-call-demand-more-than-words>The Call: Demand More Than Words</h2><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a policy failure. Call Assembly Member Cruz. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for children and seniors. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p><p><strong>Act now.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
