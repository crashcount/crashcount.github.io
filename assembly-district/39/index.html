The district saw the highest counts around <strong>3–4 AM</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Police repeatedly log inattention and failure to yield by drivers in pedestrian crashes here, including at signalized crossings (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=where-the-street-bleeds>Where the street bleeds</h3><p>The Long Island Expressway slices through this district.

Repeat hotspots on Woodhaven Boulevard and the LIE frontage need design that forces down speed and tightens lanes. Night hours need focused enforcement where deaths spike. These are standard tools; the map tells you where to put them (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Citywide, the path is plain: lower speeds and stop the worst repeat offenders.

The Council and DOT can now use that foundation and move on speed. Our city can go slower, block by block, and save lives.</p><p>Call it what it is: a choice. The next right turn at a corner like 84th and 35th does not have to end with a man on the pavement.
