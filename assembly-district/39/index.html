An SUV swung wide, ran the red, and hit them. The driver did not stop. The girls went to Elmhurst Hospital. Their injuries were called minor. The fear will last longer. The driver is still out there. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/two-little-girls-4-and-8-struck-by-driver-who-blew-red-light-in-queens/>Police said</a> nothing more.</p><p><strong>In the last twelve months, 3 people died and 358 were injured on the roads of Assembly District 39. Four suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong> Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians—no one is spared. The numbers are not just numbers. They are families waiting in hospital halls. They are shoes left on the asphalt.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs, sedans, trucks, motorcycles, mopeds, bikes—every kind of vehicle has drawn blood here.</strong> In three years, 11 people have died. Over 1,200 have been hurt. Ten were marked as serious injuries. Most were hit by cars and trucks, but motorcycles and mopeds have killed too. Even bikes have left scars.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Assembly Member Catalina Cruz has taken some steps. She co-sponsored <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">A 1077</a> and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1280&amp;term=2023">A 1280</a>, bills that demand streets be built for people, not just cars. She voted yes on <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">A 7652</a>, bringing speed cameras to school zones. She backed car-free streets for Halloween, saying cars are a deadly risk to children. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/10/24/no-trick-all-treat-city-to-ban-cars-on-some-streets-for-halloween>DOT data</a> shows a 42% drop in injuries on 34th Avenue since it went car-free. But the carnage has not stopped.</p><p><strong>There is no record of Cruz blocking safety bills. But there is also no record of a fight to lower speed limits or force the city to redesign every deadly intersection.</strong> The bills are good. The pace is slow. The streets are not safe.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-relentless-change>Call to Action: Demand Relentless Change</h3><p><strong>Every day, someone else is hit. Every week, another family waits for news.</strong> Call Assembly Member Cruz. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand action, not words. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice. Make them choose safety.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Officials say car-free streets mean fewer dead children.</p><p class=mb3>On October 24, 2022, the NYC Department of Transportation announced a major expansion of car-free streets for Halloween. The initiative, called 'Trick-or-Streets,' will close 100 streets—across all boroughs except Staten Island—from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. The DOT will extend hours on 40 existing open streets and keep another 60 car-free through the evening, partnering with the Street Activity Permit Office for more pedestrian zones. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'I am incredibly excited to build on the triumph of our thriving Open Streets program ... this Halloween, providing greater access to safer, shared community spaces.' Assembly Member Catalina Cruz and Council Member Shekar Krishnan backed the move, stressing the deadly risk cars pose to children. DOT data shows a 42% drop in pedestrian injury crashes on 34th Avenue since it went car-free. The city cites national spikes in child pedestrian deaths on Halloween. The message is clear: car-free streets save lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
