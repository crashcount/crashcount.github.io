The SUV turned into a driveway on West 174th Street and rolled over her. The driver did not stop. A neighbor saw it happen: <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/07/suv-driver-turning-into-driveway-of-bronx-apartment-building-fatally-strikes-woman/>&ldquo;he just rolled over that woman and killed her.&rdquo;</a> The woman was pronounced dead at St. Barnabas Hospital. No arrest. No justice. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/woman-killed-in-bronx-hit-and-run/>CBS New York called it plain: &ldquo;A Bronx woman is dead after a hit-and-run in Morris Heights.&rdquo;</a></p><p>This is not rare. In the last twelve months, 789 people have been injured and 1 killed in 1,109 crashes in AD 86. Seven suffered serious injuries. The numbers do not stop. They do not slow down.</p><h2 id=the-most-vulnerable-pay-the-price>The Most Vulnerable Pay the Price</h2><p>Children, elders, and those on foot or bike take the brunt. In three and a half years, at least four people have died and 2,364 have been injured on these streets. Cars and SUVs are the main weapons—responsible for 389 pedestrian injuries, including 10 serious. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll. The violence is steady. The victims are often at the margins: a woman sleeping near a curb, a child on a scooter, a man waiting for help on the Deegan.</p><h2 id=what-has-assembly-member-tapia-done>What Has Assembly Member Tapia Done?</h2><p>Assembly Member Yudelka Tapia has voted to extend school speed zones and co-sponsored bills for speed limiters and automated enforcement. She backed <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/06/07/hunger-strike-day-2-gov-hochul-is-sympathetic-but-wont-pressure-heastie-on-sammys-law>Sammy’s Law</a>, which lets NYC lower speed limits. She also supported <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A9415&amp;term=2023">congestion pricing</a> and bike lane enforcement. But Tapia has also voted to weaken bus lane rules, risking more danger for people outside cars. She stood silent as ambitious Fordham Road safety upgrades were gutted. The work is not finished. The blood on the street says so.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-no-more-waiting>Call to Action: No More Waiting</h2><p>Every week, another life is shattered. Call Assembly Member Tapia. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people walking, biking, and waiting for the bus.

Adriano Espaillat quietly lobbied Bronx officials against proposed Fordham Road bus lane upgrades. The project, under city review since 2022, aimed to speed up buses for 85,000 daily riders by installing dedicated busways or offset lanes. According to Streetsblog, Espaillat leaned on younger electeds to align with Council Member Oswald Feliz, a vocal critic. 'He defers to the local elected officials, and all of them seem to be in agreement,' said Espaillat’s chief of staff, Aneiry Batista. Lawmakers who once supported the upgrades grew silent or opposed them after Espaillat’s intervention. The Department of Transportation, MTA, and governor’s office met with Espaillat to discuss the project, but delays persisted. The opposition from Feliz and business groups led DOT to scrap the most ambitious safety options. Riders, many without cars, remain exposed to slow, hazardous conditions as cars block bus lanes and traffic crawls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lawmakers stall. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>Sammy’s Law, stalled in the New York State Assembly, would let New York City set speed limits below 25 mph. On June 7, 2023, Governor Hochul expressed sympathy for hunger-striking mothers but refused to pressure Speaker Carl Heastie, who blocks the bill from a vote. The bill passed the Senate and has City Council and mayoral support. The matter summary: 'Hochul has previously expressed support for Sammy's Law, which would allow New York City to set its speed limits below 25 miles per hour.' Amy Cohen, a mother and advocate, demanded action, showing Heastie photos of victims. Seven new Assembly members, including Yudelka Tapia, Al Taylor, Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn, and Brian Cunningham, now back the bill, giving it majority support among NYC Assembly members. Still, the Speaker’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed to speeding drivers and systemic danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
