His car is dead. He calls friends for help. A Mercedes slams into him from behind. The driver runs. The man, Darryl Mathis Jr., dies at St. Barnabas Hospital. His friends arrive too late. &ldquo;He called to get a jump, and after that, he got hit from behind, a hit-and-run,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/24/beloved-club-promoter-darryl-mathis-jr-killed-by-hit-run-bronx-mercedes-driver/>said Cornelius &lsquo;Big Grim&rsquo; Whitaker</a>. The Mercedes driver is gone. No one is held to account.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>AD 86 saw 1 death, 3 serious injuries, and 605 people hurt</strong> in crashes. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a> shows the toll: 899 crashes, each one a life changed or ended.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h2><p>Assembly Member <strong>Yudelka Tapia</strong> has signed her name to bills that could slow the carnage. She co-sponsored a measure to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting tech in their cars—no more warnings, just hard stops for the worst offenders. She backed bills to hold car owners liable when their vehicles run red lights, and voted yes on expanding speed cameras near schools. These are steps. But the blood still runs.</p><p>When the city won the right to lower speed limits, it was not because leaders acted alone. It was because mothers starved themselves outside the Capitol. It was because survivors would not let the Speaker rest. The city has the power now. Will it use it?</p><h2 id=the-next-fight-no-more-waiting>The Next Fight: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Speed kills. Delay kills.</strong> Every day the city waits to lower speed limits, another family risks losing someone. Every time a camera goes dark, a driver gets away. The numbers are not just numbers. They are the sound of sirens at 3 a.m. They are the silence after.</p><p><strong>Call your Assembly Member. Call your Council Member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never blink. Demand streets where a man can wait for help and live to see the sun.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

On June 7, 2023, Governor Hochul expressed sympathy for hunger-striking mothers but refused to pressure Speaker Carl Heastie, who blocks the bill from a vote. The bill passed the Senate and has City Council and mayoral support. The matter summary: 'Hochul has previously expressed support for Sammy's Law, which would allow New York City to set its speed limits below 25 miles per hour.' Amy Cohen, a mother and advocate, demanded action, showing Heastie photos of victims. Seven new Assembly members, including Yudelka Tapia, Al Taylor, Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn, and Brian Cunningham, now back the bill, giving it majority support among NYC Assembly members. Still, the Speaker’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed to speeding drivers and systemic danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
