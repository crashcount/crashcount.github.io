His car is dead. He calls friends for help. A Mercedes slams into him from behind. The driver runs. The man, Darryl Mathis Jr., dies at St. Barnabas Hospital. His friends arrive too late. &ldquo;He called to get a jump, and after that, he got hit from behind, a hit-and-run,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/24/beloved-club-promoter-darryl-mathis-jr-killed-by-hit-run-bronx-mercedes-driver/>said Cornelius &lsquo;Big Grim&rsquo; Whitaker</a>.

She backed bills to hold car owners liable when their vehicles run red lights, and voted yes on expanding speed cameras near schools. These are steps. But the blood still runs.</p><p>When the city won the right to lower speed limits, it was not because leaders acted alone. It was because mothers starved themselves outside the Capitol.

They are the sound of sirens at 3 a.m. They are the silence after.</p><p><strong>Call your Assembly Member. Call your Council Member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never blink. Demand streets where a man can wait for help and live to see the sun.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The 18-year-old cyclist, traveling straight, was struck by a Jeep making a left turn. According to the police report, 'Unsafe Speed' was listed as a contributing factor. The cyclist suffered severe lacerations to his arm and was partially ejected from his bike but remained conscious. The report notes the cyclist was not wearing safety equipment, but this is mentioned only after the primary driver error. The crash highlights the danger when drivers turn across the path of vulnerable road users at unsafe speeds.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Adriano Espaillat quietly lobbied Bronx officials against proposed Fordham Road bus lane upgrades. The project, under city review since 2022, aimed to speed up buses for 85,000 daily riders by installing dedicated busways or offset lanes. According to Streetsblog, Espaillat leaned on younger electeds to align with Council Member Oswald Feliz, a vocal critic. 'He defers to the local elected officials, and all of them seem to be in agreement,' said Espaillat’s chief of staff, Aneiry Batista. Lawmakers who once supported the upgrades grew silent or opposed them after Espaillat’s intervention. The Department of Transportation, MTA, and governor’s office met with Espaillat to discuss the project, but delays persisted. The opposition from Feliz and business groups led DOT to scrap the most ambitious safety options. Riders, many without cars, remain exposed to slow, hazardous conditions as cars block bus lanes and traffic crawls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
