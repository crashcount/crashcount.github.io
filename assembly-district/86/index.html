The SUV was stationary and unoccupied at the time, while the e-bike was traveling straight ahead before the collision. The cyclist suffered severe lacerations to the head but remained conscious at the scene. No mention is made of helmet use or other cyclist behavior as a contributing factor. The report underscores the role of inattention and improper lane usage in this violent impact.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
