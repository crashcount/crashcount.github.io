His car is dead. He calls friends for help. A Mercedes slams into him from behind. The driver runs. The man, Darryl Mathis Jr., dies at St. Barnabas Hospital. His friends arrive too late. &ldquo;He called to get a jump, and after that, he got hit from behind, a hit-and-run,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/24/beloved-club-promoter-darryl-mathis-jr-killed-by-hit-run-bronx-mercedes-driver/>said Cornelius &lsquo;Big Grim&rsquo; Whitaker</a>. The Mercedes driver is gone. No one is held to account.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>AD 86 saw 1 death, 3 serious injuries, and 605 people hurt</strong> in crashes. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a> shows the toll: 899 crashes, each one a life changed or ended.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h2><p>Assembly Member <strong>Yudelka Tapia</strong> has signed her name to bills that could slow the carnage. She co-sponsored a measure to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting tech in their cars—no more warnings, just hard stops for the worst offenders. She backed bills to hold car owners liable when their vehicles run red lights, and voted yes on expanding speed cameras near schools. These are steps. But the blood still runs.</p><p>When the city won the right to lower speed limits, it was not because leaders acted alone. It was because mothers starved themselves outside the Capitol. It was because survivors would not let the Speaker rest. The city has the power now. Will it use it?</p><h2 id=the-next-fight-no-more-waiting>The Next Fight: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Speed kills. Delay kills.</strong> Every day the city waits to lower speed limits, another family risks losing someone. Every time a camera goes dark, a driver gets away. The numbers are not just numbers. They are the sound of sirens at 3 a.m. They are the silence after.</p><p><strong>Call your Assembly Member. Call your Council Member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never blink. Demand streets where a man can wait for help and live to see the sun.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill sits in the Assembly, awaiting committee action. Its summary reads: 'Requires the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices if a driver accumulates eleven or more points on their driving record during an eighteen month period, or receives 6 speed camera or red light camera tickets during a twelve month period.' The primary sponsor is Emily Gallagher (District 50), joined by co-sponsors Rebecca Seawright, Andrew Hevesi, Tony Simone, Jo Anne Simon, Patricia Fahy, Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, MaryJane Shimsky, Yudelka Tapia, Steven Raga, Anna Kelles, Robert C. Carroll, and Sarahana Shrestha. The bill cracks down on repeat offenders, forcing them to install technology that blocks speeding. No safety analyst note is available, but the bill’s intent is clear: rein in drivers who endanger others again and again.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Adriano Espaillat quietly lobbied Bronx officials against proposed Fordham Road bus lane upgrades. The project, under city review since 2022, aimed to speed up buses for 85,000 daily riders by installing dedicated busways or offset lanes. According to Streetsblog, Espaillat leaned on younger electeds to align with Council Member Oswald Feliz, a vocal critic. 'He defers to the local elected officials, and all of them seem to be in agreement,' said Espaillat’s chief of staff, Aneiry Batista. Lawmakers who once supported the upgrades grew silent or opposed them after Espaillat’s intervention. The Department of Transportation, MTA, and governor’s office met with Espaillat to discuss the project, but delays persisted. The opposition from Feliz and business groups led DOT to scrap the most ambitious safety options. Riders, many without cars, remain exposed to slow, hazardous conditions as cars block bus lanes and traffic crawls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
