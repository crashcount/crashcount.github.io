The SUV turned into a driveway on West 174th Street and rolled over her. The driver did not stop. A neighbor saw it happen: <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/07/suv-driver-turning-into-driveway-of-bronx-apartment-building-fatally-strikes-woman/>&ldquo;he just rolled over that woman and killed her.&rdquo;</a> The woman was pronounced dead at St. Barnabas Hospital. No arrest. No justice. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/woman-killed-in-bronx-hit-and-run/>CBS New York called it plain: &ldquo;A Bronx woman is dead after a hit-and-run in Morris Heights.&rdquo;</a></p><p>This is not rare. In the last twelve months, 789 people have been injured and 1 killed in 1,109 crashes in AD 86. Seven suffered serious injuries. The numbers do not stop. They do not slow down.</p><h2 id=the-most-vulnerable-pay-the-price>The Most Vulnerable Pay the Price</h2><p>Children, elders, and those on foot or bike take the brunt. In three and a half years, at least four people have died and 2,364 have been injured on these streets. Cars and SUVs are the main weapons—responsible for 389 pedestrian injuries, including 10 serious. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll. The violence is steady. The victims are often at the margins: a woman sleeping near a curb, a child on a scooter, a man waiting for help on the Deegan.</p><h2 id=what-has-assembly-member-tapia-done>What Has Assembly Member Tapia Done?</h2><p>Assembly Member Yudelka Tapia has voted to extend school speed zones and co-sponsored bills for speed limiters and automated enforcement. She backed <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/06/07/hunger-strike-day-2-gov-hochul-is-sympathetic-but-wont-pressure-heastie-on-sammys-law>Sammy’s Law</a>, which lets NYC lower speed limits. She also supported <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A9415&amp;term=2023">congestion pricing</a> and bike lane enforcement. But Tapia has also voted to weaken bus lane rules, risking more danger for people outside cars. She stood silent as ambitious Fordham Road safety upgrades were gutted. The work is not finished. The blood on the street says so.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-no-more-waiting>Call to Action: No More Waiting</h2><p>Every week, another life is shattered. Call Assembly Member Tapia. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people walking, biking, and waiting for the bus. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
