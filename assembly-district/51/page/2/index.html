Fourteen people have died since 2022. Two were children. Twenty-three suffered serious injuries. The numbers do not flinch. In the last twelve months alone, three more lives ended, seven more bodies broken beyond repair. Pedestrians, cyclists, the old and the young—no one is spared. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=the-shape-of-harm>The Shape of Harm</h3><p>Cars and SUVs kill and maim the most. Trucks crush. Motorcycles and mopeds add to the toll. Bikes, too, sometimes wound. The deadliest places: crossings, corners, and the long, straight stretches where speed rules. The most vulnerable—those on foot, those on two wheels—pay the highest price.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Assembly Member Marcela Mitaynes has moved. She co-sponsored a bill to <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A5440&amp;term=2025">hold car owners liable</a> when their vehicles run red lights, closing a loophole that lets dangerous drivers walk away. She backed a bill to <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">force speed limiters on repeat offenders</a>. She voted yes on <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">school speed cameras</a>. She has called for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/17/seven-brooklyn-electeds-join-growing-calls-for-universal-daylighting>daylighting every corner</a>, for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/02/14/v-day-special-bigger-cargo-bikes-and-last-mile-warehouse-regulation-is-a-match-made-in-heaven>cleaner deliveries</a>, and for <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/brooklyn/pols-equalized-tolling-all-crossings-manhattan-under-congestion-pricing/>equal tolls to keep trucks out of working-class streets</a>.</p><p>But the pace is slow. The carnage continues. Laws pile up in Albany while bodies pile up on 4th Avenue and 60th Street. Every delay means another family left with a hole at the table.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. These are not accidents. Every death is a policy failure. Every injury is a choice made by those in power. The tools exist: lower speed limits, more cameras, real daylighting, protected crossings, and enforcement that targets drivers, not victims.</p><p>Call your Assembly Member. Demand faster action. Demand that every street in AD 51 put people first. Do not wait for another name to be carved into stone. The blood on the asphalt is not yet dry.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Their letter to the Traffic Mobility Review Board states: 'No one community should disproportionately bear the burden of the cars and trucks passing through their neighborhood.' Hanif, along with Lincoln Restler, Alexa Avilés, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Crystal Hudson, joined borough, state, and federal colleagues in this push. They propose a credit system to balance costs between DOT bridges and MTA tunnels, aiming to protect neighborhoods like the Brooklyn waterfront and the BQE corridor from traffic surges. The MTA declined comment. The Board will soon set final toll rates and rules. The federal government has approved the congestion pricing plan, with tolls for cars expected between $9 and $23.

The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens. Jabari Brisport, Julia Salazar, Kristen Gonzalez, Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Members Bobby Carroll, Maritza Davila, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Emily Gallagher, Jo Anne Simon, Marcela Mitaynes, and Council Members Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Lincoln Restler. Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint. Without state action, only city-owned segments see attention. The city’s efforts are limited.
