Gounardes sponsored the bill and Assembly Member Mitaynes voted yes (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Open States S 8344</a>). Another lever is on the table: Assembly bill <strong>A 2299</strong>, co‑sponsored by Mitaynes, would require speed‑limiting devices for drivers who rack up 11+ DMV points in 24 months or 6 camera tickets in a year (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">Open States A 2299</a>).

According to the police report, the crash involved a 2015 Infiniti sedan going straight and a 2017 Nissan sedan making a left turn. The report cites 'Unsafe Speed' as a contributing factor. The impact crushed the left front of both vehicles. A 32-year-old woman, driving the Nissan without a valid license, was ejected from her car. According to the police report, she landed face-first on the roadway, suffering severe injuries and was found semiconscious. The report describes the aftermath: 'Her face struck asphalt. Semiconscious. Broken. The road held her still as steel cooled and sirens rose.' Driver error—specifically unsafe speed—stands at the center of this crash. No evidence in the report attributes any contributing factor to the victim’s behavior.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Warehouses choke streets. Black and Latino residents breathe the fumes and dodge danger. Lawmakers push the Clean Deliveries Act to curb the chaos. The burden falls hard. The fight is on.</p><p class=mb3>The Clean Deliveries Act, now under consideration in Albany, aims to regulate last-mile warehouse traffic and emissions across New York State. The bill responds to a new report showing Sunset Park and Red Hook face the city's highest truck volumes—over 9,000 daily trips—linked to sprawling Amazon, FedEx, and UPS facilities. The report states, 'a quarter of residents across the Empire State live within half a mile of a distribution center that’s at least 50,000 square feet, disproportionately harming Black and Latino communities.' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, representing the affected Brooklyn neighborhoods, calls for urgent action 'for the sake of our climate and the safety of our streets.' Assembly Member Marcela Mitaynes, whose district sees the most daily truck traffic, urges colleagues to pass the Act. Advocates like Kevin Garcia say the bill is 'key legislation to protect frontline communities from increased vehicular traffic and tailpipe emissions.' The Act would require emissions reviews, pollution minimization, and studies of low-emission zones in hotspots.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They called for 'universal daylighting with hardened materials such as boulders, planters, and bike corrals' at intersections. The officials cited recent fatal crashes and urged the city to opt into a state law banning parking within 20 feet of corners. They want federal funds used for these changes.

Lawmakers, including State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez (District 59), call for strict regulation of emissions from last-mile e-commerce warehouses. The bill would require environmental reviews for warehouses over 50,000 square feet, mandate plans to cut air pollution, and push for zero-emission delivery vehicles. Gonzalez said, 'The unchecked growth of large warehouses in neighborhoods across NYC has worsened air quality, noise pollution, and traffic safety for everyday New Yorkers.' Assembly Member Marcela Mitaynes, a co-sponsor, highlighted the link between warehouse traffic, pollution, and traffic violence. The Red Hook Business Alliance and community advocates back the bill, citing heavy truck traffic, poor air, and threats to safety in working-class neighborhoods.
