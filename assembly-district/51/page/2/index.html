The car did not slow. It hit Kex Un Chen, 80, and Faqiu Lin, 59, as they crossed the street. Both died on the pavement. The driver sped away. Police found him later, car parts left behind. He told them, <em>&ldquo;I had a six pack of Modelos and two drinks. I was driving the car by myself last night. It&rsquo;s my fault. After I hit them, I came home&rdquo;</em> (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/12/hit-and-run-bmw-driver-who-killed-2-in-brooklyn-had-downed-beers-body-matter-found-on-car-da/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p><strong>This is not rare.</strong> In the last twelve months, 4 people have died and 876 have been injured in crashes in AD 51. Seven were seriously hurt. Most victims are on foot, on bikes, or just trying to cross the street. The numbers do not stop. The pain does not stop.</p><h2 id=the-slow-disaster>The Slow Disaster</h2><p><strong>The streets here are not safe.</strong> In three years, 15 people have died. Over 2,600 have been injured. Cars and trucks do most of the killing—<strong>SUVs and sedans alone have taken 3 lives and hurt 249 people</strong>. Trucks and buses killed at least one more. Motorcycles, mopeds, bikes—they all add to the toll, but the weight of death is on the biggest machines (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p><strong>The dead are old and young.</strong> A 70-year-old woman killed crossing with the signal. A 30-year-old man crushed by a truck. An 82-year-old struck by a motorcycle. Names become numbers. Families become statistics.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Assembly Member Marcela Mitaynes has taken some steps. She voted to extend and expand speed cameras near schools, co-sponsored bills to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting tech (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">File A 2299</a>), and pushed for owner liability when cars run red lights (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A5440&amp;term=2025">File A 5440</a>). She joined calls for daylighting every corner with real barriers, not just paint (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/17/seven-brooklyn-electeds-join-growing-calls-for-universal-daylighting>Seven Brooklyn Electeds Join Growing Calls For Universal Daylighting</a>). But the streets are still deadly. The laws are slow. The change is slower.</p><p><strong>The horror is not abstract.</strong> As one witness <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/11/us-news/hit-and-run-driver-kills-two-pedestrians-on-nyc-street-before-zooming-off-cops/>described</a>, <em>&ldquo;I saw, you know, the bodies&mldr; The head was completely in half&rdquo;</em>.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Assembly Member Mitaynes. Call the Council. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real barriers at every corner. Demand that repeat speeders lose their keys. <strong>Do not wait for another body in the crosswalk.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The fight is on.</p><p class=mb3>The Clean Deliveries Act, now under consideration in Albany, aims to regulate last-mile warehouse traffic and emissions across New York State. The bill responds to a new report showing Sunset Park and Red Hook face the city's highest truck volumes—over 9,000 daily trips—linked to sprawling Amazon, FedEx, and UPS facilities. The report states, 'a quarter of residents across the Empire State live within half a mile of a distribution center that’s at least 50,000 square feet, disproportionately harming Black and Latino communities.' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, representing the affected Brooklyn neighborhoods, calls for urgent action 'for the sake of our climate and the safety of our streets.' Assembly Member Marcela Mitaynes, whose district sees the most daily truck traffic, urges colleagues to pass the Act. Advocates like Kevin Garcia say the bill is 'key legislation to protect frontline communities from increased vehicular traffic and tailpipe emissions.' The Act would require emissions reviews, pollution minimization, and studies of low-emission zones in hotspots.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They called for 'universal daylighting with hardened materials such as boulders, planters, and bike corrals' at intersections. The officials cited recent fatal crashes and urged the city to opt into a state law banning parking within 20 feet of corners. They want federal funds used for these changes.

Lawmakers, including State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez (District 59), call for strict regulation of emissions from last-mile e-commerce warehouses. The bill would require environmental reviews for warehouses over 50,000 square feet, mandate plans to cut air pollution, and push for zero-emission delivery vehicles. Gonzalez said, 'The unchecked growth of large warehouses in neighborhoods across NYC has worsened air quality, noise pollution, and traffic safety for everyday New Yorkers.' Assembly Member Marcela Mitaynes, a co-sponsor, highlighted the link between warehouse traffic, pollution, and traffic violence. The Red Hook Business Alliance and community advocates back the bill, citing heavy truck traffic, poor air, and threats to safety in working-class neighborhoods.

They reject piecemeal fixes. They call out decades of harm. The state’s refusal leaves neighborhoods exposed. The city’s hands are tied. The highway’s danger remains. Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On February 10, 2023, eighteen Brooklyn lawmakers issued a joint letter demanding New York State Department of Transportation (DOT) participate in comprehensive planning for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens. Jabari Brisport, Julia Salazar, Kristen Gonzalez, Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Members Bobby Carroll, Maritza Davila, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Emily Gallagher, Jo Anne Simon, Marcela Mitaynes, and Council Members Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Lincoln Restler. Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint. Without state action, only city-owned segments see attention. The city’s efforts are limited. The state’s inaction leaves systemic danger unaddressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
