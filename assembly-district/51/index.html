Same ending.</p><p>At 4:22 a.m. on July 11, a 2011 BMW sedan going south on Third Avenue ran the red at 52nd Street and hit two men in the crosswalk. Both were crossing with the signal. Both died. The driver sped off. Police later charged Juventino Anastacio Florentino with manslaughter and leaving the scene, among other counts, after debris and video led them to him, according to <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/brooklyn/pedestrians-hit-and-run-brooklyn/>amNY</a> and the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/12/hit-and-run-bmw-driver-who-killed-2-in-brooklyn-had-downed-beers-body-matter-found-on-car-da/>Daily News</a>. City records say the crash factors were “Traffic Control Disregarded” and “Unsafe Speed” and confirm both victims were pedestrians, killed at the intersection, crossing with the signal (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>“It’s my fault,” Florentino told prosecutors, per the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/12/hit-and-run-bmw-driver-who-killed-2-in-brooklyn-had-downed-beers-body-matter-found-on-car-da/>Daily News</a>.</p><p>Residents and officials have begged for fixes on this two‑mile stretch. Since 2018, drivers have killed or seriously injured 80 people here, Gothamist reported after the crash (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/sunset-park-residents-call-for-improvements-on-a-deadly-stretch-of-third-avenue>Gothamist</a>).</p><h3 id=the-corner-is-known-the-danger-is-old>The corner is known. The danger is old.</h3><p>The death map is not subtle. DOT’s own data show repeated harm along Third and Fourth avenues. Five deaths and 259 injuries stack on <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>4th Avenue</a>. Three deaths and 64 injuries on <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>3rd Ave</a>. Two deaths and 384 injuries along the Gowanus Expressway frontage. The crashes cluster day and night, with heavy injury counts late night and at the afternoon peak. Deaths spike at 4 a.m., 9 a.m., 11 a.m., 12 p.m., and 3–4 p.m., according to the district’s hourly profile (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The bodies are people walking, biking, riding mopeds. Eight pedestrian deaths. Two bicyclist deaths. Two on “Other Motorized” devices. Trucks and SUVs figure in many pedestrian injuries; sedans kill most, per the local roll‑up (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The chief culprits in the dataset are simple: “other/unsafe operation,” failure to yield, inattention, and running lights. Speed threads through it.</p><h3 id=officials-know-what-works--do-they>Officials know what works — do they?</h3><p>The city promised a redesign with protection. Then paused. After the double killing, officials stood on the avenue and asked why the plan still isn’t built. “We started talking about a plan in 2014 and it’s now 2025. What is going on?” Assemblymember Marcela Mitaynes said (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>CBS New York</a>). State Sen. Andrew Gounardes said the city’s response was a sign that says, “be careful” (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/sunset-park-residents-call-for-improvements-on-a-deadly-stretch-of-third-avenue>Gothamist</a>).</p><p>Advocates and local leaders demanded the stalled safety work be fast‑tracked on Third Avenue (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/advocates-slam-third-avenue-safety-delay/>Brooklyn Paper</a>; <a href=https://www.bkreader.com/policy-government/sunset-park-urges-city-to-fast-track-third-avenue-street-fixes-10986450>BKReader</a>).</p><h3 id=three-corners-one-fix>Three corners. One fix.</h3><p>Pick the worst blocks and pour concrete. Daylight every corner. Harden turns. Protect the crossings on Third and Fourth. Add leading pedestrian intervals and steel where the highway spits cars onto local streets. Target the late‑night hours flagged in the city’s own data. Focus truck routes. The local numbers point to where to start: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>4th Avenue</a>. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>3rd Ave</a>. The Gowanus frontage. The deaths are already marked.</p><h3 id=stop-the-repeat-story>Stop the repeat story</h3><p>Albany extended 24‑hour school‑zone speed cameras to 2030 this summer (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>S 8344</a>). That keeps one tool on. It’s not enough. The worst drivers do the worst harm. Citywide, the fix is blunt and proven: slower speeds and stopping repeat offenders. Advocates are pushing a <strong>default 20 mph</strong> limit under Sammy’s Law and mandatory speed limiters for drivers who rack up violations. The case is laid out here: <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>.</p><p>“Safer streets are not a privilege, they are a right,” Assemblymember Mitaynes said at the rally (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/advocates-slam-third-avenue-safety-delay/>Brooklyn Paper</a>).</p><p>Two men died in the walk to a food line and a morning shift. The light was with them. The car was not. The rest is paperwork and grief.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
