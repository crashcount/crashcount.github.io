But they do not lie. Fourteen people killed. Twenty-three left with injuries so grave they may never walk the same. In three and a half years, there have been 4,416 crashes. The dead include the old and the young. A 30-year-old man crushed by a truck on 60th Street. An 82-year-old struck by a motorcycle while crossing 5th Avenue. A 66-year-old woman thrown from her moped, dead on 39th Street. The details are spare, the pain is not. See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Most of the blood is on the hands of cars and trucks. SUVs and sedans killed three pedestrians. Trucks and motorcycles each killed one. The rest are numbers, but each number is a life. Each crash is a family changed forever.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-silence>Leadership: Action and Silence</h3><p>Assembly Member Marcela Mitaynes has not been silent. She has backed bills to hold reckless drivers to account. She co-sponsored a law to make vehicle owners liable when their cars run red lights, closing loopholes that let dangerous drivers walk away (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A5440&amp;term=2025">A 5440</a>). She pushed for speed limiters on repeat offenders (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">A 2299</a>). She voted yes to bring speed cameras to school zones, protecting children where they walk (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">A 7652</a>).</p><p>Mitaynes has also called for universal daylighting—removing parked cars from corners and using hard barriers to keep sightlines clear. She joined other Brooklyn officials demanding the city stop relying on paint and start using boulders, planters, and bike corrals. &ldquo;We want federal funds used for these changes,&rdquo; the group <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/17/seven-brooklyn-electeds-join-growing-calls-for-universal-daylighting>wrote</a>. They called out the city’s slow pace and demanded real protection for people on foot and bike.</p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The trucks keep rolling. The corners stay blind.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. The law can change. The streets can change. But only if you demand it.</p><p>Call your Assembly Member. Call your Council Member. Demand daylighting. Demand speed cameras. Demand that every street put people before cars.</p><p>Do not wait for the next siren. Do not wait for the next name to become a number. Act now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report states the e-bike rider was 'thrown' and 'crushed,' dying at the scene. Both the pickup truck and the e-bike were cited for 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as contributing factors. The pickup, a 2007 Chevrolet, was making a left turn when it collided with the e-bike, which was traveling straight. The police report describes the aftermath: 'The bike lay twisted. The truck bore blood and silence.' The e-bike rider was ejected and suffered crush injuries to the entire body. The data does not specify helmet use or other victim behaviors as contributing factors. The crash underscores the lethal consequences when drivers fail to yield to vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The report states, "His SUV struck seven cars. Metal tore. Glass scattered. Airbags bloomed." The driver died at the scene, "strapped in his seat, still and silent, as traffic crawled past the wreckage." The sole contributing factor cited is "Lost Consciousness." The collision involved multiple vehicles traveling straight ahead, with impacts to center back ends, side doors, and quarter panels. Several occupants suffered neck injuries consistent with whiplash. The report does not list any driver errors or contributing factors for the other drivers.

The fight is on.</p><p class=mb3>The Clean Deliveries Act, now under consideration in Albany, aims to regulate last-mile warehouse traffic and emissions across New York State. The bill responds to a new report showing Sunset Park and Red Hook face the city's highest truck volumes—over 9,000 daily trips—linked to sprawling Amazon, FedEx, and UPS facilities. The report states, 'a quarter of residents across the Empire State live within half a mile of a distribution center that’s at least 50,000 square feet, disproportionately harming Black and Latino communities.' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, representing the affected Brooklyn neighborhoods, calls for urgent action 'for the sake of our climate and the safety of our streets.' Assembly Member Marcela Mitaynes, whose district sees the most daily truck traffic, urges colleagues to pass the Act. Advocates like Kevin Garcia say the bill is 'key legislation to protect frontline communities from increased vehicular traffic and tailpipe emissions.' The Act would require emissions reviews, pollution minimization, and studies of low-emission zones in hotspots.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They called for 'universal daylighting with hardened materials such as boulders, planters, and bike corrals' at intersections. The officials cited recent fatal crashes and urged the city to opt into a state law banning parking within 20 feet of corners. They want federal funds used for these changes. The group opposes DOT’s slow pace and reliance on paint, demanding physical barriers. Community board leaders and advocates support the move.

Lawmakers, including State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez (District 59), call for strict regulation of emissions from last-mile e-commerce warehouses. The bill would require environmental reviews for warehouses over 50,000 square feet, mandate plans to cut air pollution, and push for zero-emission delivery vehicles. Gonzalez said, 'The unchecked growth of large warehouses in neighborhoods across NYC has worsened air quality, noise pollution, and traffic safety for everyday New Yorkers.' Assembly Member Marcela Mitaynes, a co-sponsor, highlighted the link between warehouse traffic, pollution, and traffic violence. The Red Hook Business Alliance and community advocates back the bill, citing heavy truck traffic, poor air, and threats to safety in working-class neighborhoods. The legislation aims to hold warehouse operators accountable and protect residents from the mounting toll of delivery-driven pollution and danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
