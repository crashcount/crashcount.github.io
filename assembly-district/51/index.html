Police later charged a 23‑year‑old with manslaughter after video showed the car “speeding southbound” with no brake before impact (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/sunset-park-deadly-hit-run-driver-charged-fatal-collision-2-men-brooklyn-nyc-arraigned-court/17083850/>ABC7</a>; <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/brooklyn/pedestrians-hit-and-run-brooklyn/>amNY</a>).</p><p>They were two of <strong>19 people killed</strong> on these district streets since Jan 1, 2022; <strong>2,919</strong> more were hurt in <strong>4,973 crashes</strong> over that span (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>—</p><p>Third Avenue, then silence</p><p>“We should all be offended. Angry. Insulted. That the response… is a sign that says: ‘be careful,’” State Sen. Andrew Gounardes said at the site days later (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/sunset-park-residents-call-for-improvements-on-a-deadly-stretch-of-third-avenue>Gothamist</a>). A planned redesign with protected lanes was approved and then stalled (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/sunset-park-residents-call-for-improvements-on-a-deadly-stretch-of-third-avenue>Gothamist</a>). “We started talking about a plan in 2014 and it’s now 2025,” Assembly Member Marcela Mitaynes said. “There’s been no conversation, no updates” (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>CBS New York</a>).</p><p>The corners tell the rest. Since 2022, the worst toll is on 4th Avenue (5 deaths), with more deaths on 3rd Avenue (3) (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>—</p><p>What the clock shows</p><p>The deaths cluster in dark hours.

Build the Third Avenue redesign that was approved, with real protection, not paint (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/sunset-park-residents-call-for-improvements-on-a-deadly-stretch-of-third-avenue>Gothamist</a>). Target early‑hour speed with enforcement where the deaths stack up (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Albany moved one lever: the legislature extended and corrected school‑zone speed protections in June 2025; Sen. Gounardes sponsored the bill and Assembly Member Mitaynes voted yes (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Open States S 8344</a>). Another lever is on the table: Assembly bill <strong>A 2299</strong>, co‑sponsored by Mitaynes, would require speed‑limiting devices for drivers who rack up 11+ DMV points in 24 months or 6 camera tickets in a year (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">Open States A 2299</a>). She also backs <strong>A 5440</strong> to hold vehicle owners liable for red‑light and speed‑camera violations by their cars (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A5440&amp;term=2025">Open States A 5440</a>).</p><p>—</p><p>No more corners like 52nd and Third</p><p>The record is clear. The bodies, the hours, the corners. The redesign is stalled. The bills exist. The votes are on paper.</p><p>Act so two men in a crosswalk do not become a line in a ledger. Start here.

A driver sped through a red light, fled. Eighty hurt or dead since 2018. Residents rally. Promised fixes stalled. Danger remains. Children cross nine lanes to reach school.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist (2025-07-23) reports Sunset Park residents and officials demand safety upgrades on Third Avenue after a hit-and-run killed two men. Police say the driver "sped through a red light" and fled. Since 2018, drivers have killed or seriously injured 80 people on this two-mile stretch. A redesign with protected bike lanes was approved but stalled. State Sen. Gounardes criticized the city's response: "We should all be offended... the response... is a sign that says: 'be careful.'" The article highlights the need for enforcement and infrastructure, noting children must cross nine lanes daily.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident occurred at 9:49 a.m. The narrative states, 'A 65-year-old man lay still in the road. A southbound box truck passed. No screech, no crash, no damage. Just the crack of bone.

The pedestrian was found in the roadway with fatal head trauma and crush injuries. The report notes, 'No skid marks. No damage to the truck.' The police narrative describes the aftermath: 'Only silence where a life had been.' The vehicle, a 2020 INTL-TRUCK/BUS registered in Indiana, showed no visible damage. The driver was licensed in Pennsylvania. The report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified' for both the driver and the pedestrian. The police report does not cite any pedestrian actions as contributing to the crash. The absence of skid marks and damage underscores the brutal efficiency of the impact. The systemic danger remains: a human body, no match for a truck rolling through city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The sole occupant, a 23-year-old male driver, suffered severe facial lacerations and was found conscious at the scene. The report lists 'Aggressive Driving/Road Rage' as the primary contributing factor. The narrative details that 'road rage left its mark where calm should have been,' and describes blood on glass after the impact. The driver was not wearing a seatbelt, but the report does not cite this as a contributing factor to the crash itself. No other vehicles or people were involved. The collision’s violence and injury stemmed directly from the driver’s aggressive actions behind the wheel, as documented by police.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
