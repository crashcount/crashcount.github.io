A BMW ran the red. The car did not slow. The men, Faqiu Lin, 59, and Kex Un Chen, 80, died in the street. The driver left them behind and drove home. He told police, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/12/hit-and-run-bmw-driver-who-killed-2-in-brooklyn-had-downed-beers-body-matter-found-on-car-da/>&ldquo;I had a six pack of Modelos and two drinks. I was driving the car by myself last night. It&rsquo;s my fault. After I hit them, I came home.&rdquo;</a></p><p>The men may have been on their way to a food pantry. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/sunset-park-deadly-hit-run-driver-charged-fatal-collision-2-men-brooklyn-nyc-arraigned-court/17083850/>&ldquo;We understand they may have been on their way to our Mobile Market simply trying to access food like so many New Yorkers in need,&rdquo;</a> said City Harvest. The street was not safe for them. It is not safe for anyone.</p><p><strong>In the last twelve months, four people have died and 873 have been injured on these streets.</strong> Seven suffered serious injuries. The dead are old and young. The numbers do not stop. The pain does not stop.</p><h2 id=the-toll-grows-the-danger-remains>The Toll Grows, The Danger Remains</h2><p>The carnage is not new. In the past three years, 15 people have died in Assembly District 51. More than 2,600 have been injured. Cars and trucks did most of the killing—<strong>257 crashes involving cars and SUVs led to 3 deaths and 5 serious injuries</strong>. Trucks and buses killed at least one. Motorcycles and mopeds killed another. Bikes injured dozens, but did not kill.</p><p>The intersection where Lin and Chen died is not an outlier. In five years, a three-block stretch around the crash saw 59 collisions and 80 injuries. The city calls these &ldquo;accidents.&rdquo; They are not accidents. They are the result of speed, red lights ignored, and streets built for cars, not people.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Assembly Member Marcela Mitaynes has backed bills to curb repeat speeders and hold vehicle owners liable for violations. She voted to extend school speed zones, <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>improving child pedestrian safety</a>. She co-sponsored the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force the worst repeat offenders to install speed limiters. She has called for cleaner, safer deliveries and more daylight at corners. But the deaths keep coming. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-demand-action-now>Call to Action: Demand Action Now</h2><p><strong>No more waiting. No more deaths.</strong> Call Assembly Member Mitaynes. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people walking and biking. The blood on the street is not washed away by words. Only action will save the next life.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Last week, a speeding driver ran a red light, killing two pedestrians. The article quotes Adams, who once called Third Avenue 'extremely intimidating' and said it 'must be at the top of our list.' Despite this, his administration 'put the brakes on a potentially life-saving road redesign,' favoring business interests. Attorney Peter Beadle notes, 'they had a plan ready to go and then it was pulled back.' The city could face legal action for failing to act despite knowing the risks, echoing a 2017 state court ruling on municipal liability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
