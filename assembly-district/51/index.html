Kex Un Chen, 80, and Faqiu Lin, 59, were crossing with the signal. The car did not stop. Both men died in the street. The driver fled. Police <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/suspect-in-2-brooklyn-hit-and-run-homicides-facing-arraignment-saturday>arrested him later that day</a>. The charges: manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, reckless driving.</p><p><strong>This was not the first time. It will not be the last.</strong> Since 2018, drivers have killed or seriously injured 80 people on this two-mile stretch of Third Avenue. The city’s answer? A sign that says: “be careful.” State Senator Andrew Gounardes <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/sunset-park-residents-call-for-improvements-on-a-deadly-stretch-of-third-avenue>said</a>, “We should all be offended. Angry. Insulted. That the response from our city to two deaths blocks away from here is a sign that says: &lsquo;be careful.&rsquo;”</p><h2 id=the-toll-in-numbers>The Toll in Numbers</h2><p>In the past 12 months, <strong>seven people have died</strong> and <strong>997 have been injured</strong> in Assembly District 51. Children, elders, men, women. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Pedestrians crossing with the light</a>. Cyclists in the bike lane. Most are hit by cars and trucks. Some by motorcycles, mopeds, or bikes. The numbers do not tell you about the shoes left behind, the groceries scattered on the curb. But they do not lie.</p><h2 id=promises-delays-and-demands>Promises, Delays, and Demands</h2><p>The city promised a redesign for Third Avenue. Community Board 7 approved it in 2023. The plan stalled. Assembly Member Marcela Mitaynes <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>said</a>, “We started talking about a plan in 2014 and it&rsquo;s now 2025. What is going on? We got word last fall that there was a pause, but an indefinite pause and I don&rsquo;t know what that means. There&rsquo;s been no conversation, no updates.” She stood with families and <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/advocates-slam-third-avenue-safety-delay/>called for action</a>: “Safer streets are not a privilege, they are a right.”</p><p>Mitaynes has backed bills to extend school speed zones, require speed limiters for repeat offenders, and hold vehicle owners liable for camera violations. She has called for daylighting corners and regulating truck traffic. But the deaths keep coming. <strong>Words and votes are not enough.</strong></p><h2 id=what-now>What Now?</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call Assembly Member Mitaynes. Demand the city finish the Third Avenue redesign. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed limiters for repeat offenders.</strong></p><p>No more signs.

Council Member Alexa Avilés called for real investment. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives called the delay 'unconscionable.' State Sen Andrew Gounardes and Assembly Member Marcela Mitaynes demanded urgent redesign. The rally's matter: 'demanding the Adams administration implement traffic safety measures on Third Avenue.'
