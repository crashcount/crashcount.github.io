Two men, Kex Un Chen, 80, and Faqiu Lin, 59, were crossing the street. The car did not slow. Both men died where they fell, walking to a food pantry. The driver sped off, leaving bodies in the crosswalk. Police later arrested him and charged him with manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/11/us-news/hit-and-run-driver-kills-two-pedestrians-on-nyc-street-before-zooming-off-cops/>&ldquo;I saw, you know, the bodies&mldr; The head was completely in half,&rdquo;</a> a witness said, his voice flat with shock.</p><p>This was not the first time. It will not be the last. In the past year, <strong>four people have died and 881 have been injured</strong> in crashes in Assembly District 51. Seven suffered serious injuries. The dead include elders, workers, children. The living carry scars.</p><h3 id=a-corridor-of-broken-promises>A Corridor of Broken Promises</h3><p>Third Avenue is a known danger. The city planned a redesign. The mayor paused it after business pushback.

She co-sponsored a measure to force speed limiters on drivers who rack up violations, and another to hold car owners liable for red-light running. She has called for universal daylighting—removing parked cars from corners to give children and elders a fighting chance to be seen. But the deaths keep coming. The pace of change is slow. Paint and promises do not stop cars.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Every death is preventable.</strong> The bodies in the street are not an act of God. They are the cost of delay, of compromise, of leaders who wait for consensus while people die. Call Assembly Member Mitaynes. Call the mayor. Demand a default 20 mph speed limit. Demand the city finish the job on Third Avenue. Demand more than words. <strong>Do not wait for another body in the crosswalk.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The man was crossing the street when a northbound motorcycle, operated by an unlicensed rider, struck him head-on. The report states the impact was to the 'center front end' of the motorcycle, resulting in fatal head injuries to the pedestrian. The police report specifically notes the driver's license status as 'unlicensed,' highlighting a critical driver error. The narrative confirms the rider 'hit him square,' and the man died at the scene. While the report mentions the pedestrian was 'crossing without a signal,' it does not list this as a contributing factor, instead marking both contributing factors as 'unspecified.' The focus remains on the unlicensed operation of the motorcycle and the lethal consequences for a vulnerable road user.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The pickup, a 2007 Chevrolet, was making a left turn when it collided with the e-bike, which was traveling straight. The police report describes the aftermath: 'The bike lay twisted. The truck bore blood and silence.' The e-bike rider was ejected and suffered crush injuries to the entire body. The data does not specify helmet use or other victim behaviors as contributing factors.

The fight is on.</p><p class=mb3>The Clean Deliveries Act, now under consideration in Albany, aims to regulate last-mile warehouse traffic and emissions across New York State. The bill responds to a new report showing Sunset Park and Red Hook face the city's highest truck volumes—over 9,000 daily trips—linked to sprawling Amazon, FedEx, and UPS facilities. The report states, 'a quarter of residents across the Empire State live within half a mile of a distribution center that’s at least 50,000 square feet, disproportionately harming Black and Latino communities.' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, representing the affected Brooklyn neighborhoods, calls for urgent action 'for the sake of our climate and the safety of our streets.' Assembly Member Marcela Mitaynes, whose district sees the most daily truck traffic, urges colleagues to pass the Act. Advocates like Kevin Garcia say the bill is 'key legislation to protect frontline communities from increased vehicular traffic and tailpipe emissions.' The Act would require emissions reviews, pollution minimization, and studies of low-emission zones in hotspots.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Gonzalez said, 'The unchecked growth of large warehouses in neighborhoods across NYC has worsened air quality, noise pollution, and traffic safety for everyday New Yorkers.' Assembly Member Marcela Mitaynes, a co-sponsor, highlighted the link between warehouse traffic, pollution, and traffic violence. The Red Hook Business Alliance and community advocates back the bill, citing heavy truck traffic, poor air, and threats to safety in working-class neighborhoods.
