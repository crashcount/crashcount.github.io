She was sitting on the curb when her boyfriend lost control of his car while doing donuts. The car struck her, and she died at the hospital. Police charged him with criminally negligent homicide, reckless endangerment, and reckless driving. Days later, the tire marks were still there. As police reported, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>&ldquo;He lost control when he was doing donuts with the vehicle.&rdquo;</a></p><p>This is not rare. In the last 12 months, <strong>five people have died</strong> and <strong>over 1,100 have been injured</strong> in crashes in this district. Fourteen suffered injuries so severe they may never recover. The dead include pedestrians, drivers, and children. The numbers do not stop. They climb.</p><h3 id=patterns-of-harm-who-pays-the-price>Patterns of Harm: Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> In the last three years, they were involved in eight deaths and hundreds of injuries. Trucks and buses injured dozens more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll. Children are not spared. In the past year, <strong>120 people under 18 were hurt</strong>. One child lost a leg in June. The pain is not abstract. It is a mother’s scream, a child’s empty bed.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-silence-and-the-road-ahead>Leadership: Votes, Silence, and the Road Ahead</h3><p>Assembly Member Nikki Lucas has voted to extend and expand school speed cameras, and to require safer street designs. She voted to keep protections in place for children near schools. According to the official record, <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Lucas votes yes to extend school speed zones, improving child pedestrian safety.</a> But she also voted to weaken bus rules, a move that puts pedestrians and cyclists at greater risk. The work is not done. The streets are not safe.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every death is preventable.</strong> Every injury is a failure of policy and will. Call Assembly Member Lucas. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat reckless drivers. Join with others. Do not let another family grieve alone. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
