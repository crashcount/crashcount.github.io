Few crossings. Highway speeds next to homes. The city now says it will redesign it after “more than 40 serious injuries and five deaths” in five years, and is asking residents to weigh in at workshops. “Residents deserve a Conduit Boulevard that … [doesn’t] put pedestrians and drivers at risk,” the DOT commissioner said (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-dot-launches-redesign-of-dangerous-conduit-corridor-in-brooklyn-queens>Gothamist</a>).</p><h3 id=fix-the-turns-slow-the-lanes-force-repeat-offenders-to-stop>Fix the turns. Slow the lanes. Force repeat offenders to stop.</h3><p>Start with the corners. Harden left turns at Pennsylvania and Blake. Daylight the corners on Linden. Add leading pedestrian intervals where people actually cross. Put real speed control on the Belt’s service roads and the long, open runs.</p><p>The state moved one piece this summer, extending and fixing school speed-zone rules (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>S 8344</a>). Cameras stay on. It isn’t enough.</p><p>The worst drivers do outsized harm. Research shows that the smallest sliver of motorists cause a fifth of pedestrian deaths; racks of camera tickets track the risk. A bill in Albany—the Stop Super Speeders Act—would force chronic violators to use speed limiters after enough points or camera tickets. That is the right target (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/20/the-1-5-percent-of-drivers-who-cause-21-percent-of-pedestrian-deaths>Streetsblog analysis</a>).</p><h3 id=make-the-default-speed-human>Make the default speed human</h3><p>Lower speeds save lives. The city can lower residential limits and should make 20 MPH the floor. Fewer broken bones. Fewer funerals. Push your lawmakers to act.
