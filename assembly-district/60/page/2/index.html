The report lists both vehicles as 'Going Straight Ahead' before impact. Parked cars, including a pick-up truck and another sedan, were struck in the aftermath. No specific driver errors are cited in the contributing factors, which are marked as 'Unspecified.'

The report states the vehicle "ran the signal" and struck a 57-year-old man who was in the roadway. The pedestrian suffered fatal crush injuries to his entire body and was pronounced dead at the scene. The police report explicitly cites 'Traffic Control Disregarded' and 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' as contributing factors on the part of the driver. No evidence in the report suggests any contributing behavior by the victim. The impact occurred away from an intersection, with the SUV's center front end colliding with the pedestrian.
