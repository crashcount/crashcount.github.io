He lost control. The car hit <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/14/woman-fatally-struck-by-genesis-g80-driver-doing-donuts-in-brooklyn-plaza-parking-lot/>Madisyn Ruiz, 21</a>. Police charged him with criminally negligent homicide, reckless endangerment, and reckless driving. He stayed at the scene, according to the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/14/woman-fatally-struck-by-genesis-g80-driver-doing-donuts-in-brooklyn-plaza-parking-lot/>Daily News</a>. A relative called it “just a freak accident… He loved her dearly,” in a follow‑up piece (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>Daily News</a>). The <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/16/us-news/driver-doing-donuts-in-nyc-parking-lot-fatally-strikes-girlfriend-is-arrested-for-negligent-homicide/>Post</a> reported the sedan’s front was badly dented.</p></li><li><p>The city’s crash file for that time and place lists a 21‑year‑old woman killed off‑street at 395 Gateway Dr. Contributing factors include driver distraction and unsafe speed (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash record</a>).</p></li></ul><p>Crosswalk, left turn, no yield</p><ul><li><p>Morning rush, Jan. 24. A 57‑year‑old woman crossed with the signal at Blake and Pennsylvania. A 2024 Nissan SUV turned left and hit her. She died. Listed factors: failure to yield and driver distraction (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash record</a>).</p></li><li><p>Another pedestrian death on Pennsylvania came months earlier, at 570 Pennsylvania Ave. Police records show a strike outside the intersection, victim 58, by a 2023 Toyota SUV going straight (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash record</a>).</p></li></ul><p>Speed on the Belt, bodies on the blacktop</p><ul><li><p>Feb. 16, 4:14 a.m. A 2024 BMW SUV on the Belt Parkway. Unsafe speed. Slippery pavement. The driver was ejected and killed (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash record</a>). The Belt is a top hotspot here, with two deaths and 293 injuries since 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>district rollup</a>).</p></li><li><p>Pennsylvania Avenue is another line of grief: two deaths, 158 injuries in this span (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>district rollup</a>). Linden Boulevard logs 326 injuries. New Lots Avenue, 79 injuries. These are not outliers. They are the map.</p></li></ul><p>When it hurts most</p><ul><li><p>Deaths stack up after dark. From midnight to 5 a.m., seven people died in this district. The 4 a.m. hour alone saw two deaths. Evenings do harm too: fatalities hit at 4 p.m., 5 p.m., 8 p.m., 9 p.m., and 11 p.m. (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hourly summary</a>).</p></li><li><p>Pedestrians take the brunt: eight killed, 497 injured since 2022. SUVs and sedans lead the toll on people walking, with sedans tied to four pedestrian deaths and SUVs to three in this period (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>mode split and pedestrian causes</a>).</p></li></ul><p>What we keep seeing</p><ul><li><p>The most common listed factor in deadly and injurious crashes here is “other,” but the ledger still names the basics: inattention, failure to yield, and unsafe speed. “Unsafe speed” is written next to death on the Belt. “Failure to yield” is written next to death at Blake and Pennsylvania. Distraction is scrawled across both (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>factor rollup, records above</a>).</p></li><li><p>Citywide, the Conduit corridor next door is finally under study after “more than 40 serious injuries and five deaths” in five years. DOT says, “Brooklyn and Queens Residents deserve a Conduit Boulevard that improves daily life, not a roadway that puts pedestrians and drivers at risk,” and is holding workshops now (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-dot-launches-redesign-of-dangerous-conduit-corridor-in-brooklyn-queens>Gothamist</a>).</p></li></ul><p>Stop the hot spots before they make more names</p><ul><li>Fix the lines that kill: harden turns and add leading pedestrian intervals on Pennsylvania and Blake. Daylight corners on Linden. Build refuge islands and raised crossings on New Lots. On the Belt frontage, close slip lanes that feed highway speed into local streets. Target late‑night enforcement at the hours when bodies drop. These are standard tools. They are not new. They are missing here.</li></ul><p>Slow every street, catch the worst drivers</p><ul><li><p><strong>Lowering the default speed limit saves lives.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law to let NYC set safer speeds. The city can make 20 mph the floor on residential streets. The work has started in pieces, but not enough. Call for a citywide 20 now (<a href=/take_action/>CrashCount: Take Action</a>).</p></li><li><p><strong>Stop super speeders.</strong> A small share of drivers cause outsize harm. The Stop Super Speeders Act would force repeat offenders to use intelligent speed assistance after they rack up violations. Tell your legislators to pass it (<a href=/take_action/>CrashCount: Take Action</a>).</p></li></ul></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
