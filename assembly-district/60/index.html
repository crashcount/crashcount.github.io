A car spins out of control and strikes her. She dies at the hospital. This was just days ago at Gateway Center. Her name was Madisyn Ruiz. She was 21. Her nephews watched. The driver, her boyfriend, stayed at the scene. Police charged him with criminally negligent homicide, reckless endangerment, and reckless driving. &ldquo;He lost control when he was doing donuts with the vehicle,&rdquo; he told police (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>In the last twelve months, four people have died on the roads of Assembly District 60. Nearly a thousand have been hurt. Twelve suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Children are not spared—108 injured, one seriously, in just a year (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>SUVs and cars do most of the damage. In three and a half years, they killed seven, injured 320, and left 95 with moderate wounds. Trucks and buses add to the toll. Bikes and mopeds are not blameless, but their numbers are small. The harm is not spread evenly. The biggest vehicles cause the deepest wounds.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Assembly Member Nikki Lucas has <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted to extend and expand school speed cameras</a>, a move that protects children near schools. She has backed funding for safer street designs and better driver education. But she also voted to weaken bus lane rules, a change that puts pedestrians and cyclists at greater risk.</p><p>The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has not used it everywhere. Cameras catch speeders, but the worst repeat offenders keep driving. &ldquo;Brooklyn and Queens Residents deserve a Conduit Boulevard that improves daily life, not a roadway that puts pedestrians and drivers at risk,&rdquo; said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-dot-launches-redesign-of-dangerous-conduit-corridor-in-brooklyn-queens>Gothamist</a>).</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day without action is a day someone else bleeds. Call Assembly Member Lucas. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real penalties for repeat speeders. Demand streets that put people before cars. Do not wait for another name to add to the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
