The body count says day never ends. In the last 12 months, this district logged <strong>5 deaths and 1,193 injuries across 1,716 crashes</strong>—up from 913 crashes the prior year. Serious injuries more than tripled. That is not a blip. That is a pattern (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=pennsylvania-linden-belt-the-long-wounds>Pennsylvania, Linden, Belt: the long wounds</h3><p>Two dead on <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Pennsylvania Avenue</a>. Hundreds hurt on <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Linden Boulevard</a>. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Belt Parkway</a> keeps breaking people—296 injuries and four serious injuries tied to it in this period. One driver, 41, was ejected and killed on the Belt at about 4 AM; unsafe speed and a slick road are listed as factors (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash 4793436</a>).</p><p>A 57-year-old woman, crossing with the signal at Pennsylvania and Blake, was struck and killed by a turning SUV. The record names failure to yield and distraction (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash 4788343</a>). At 570 Pennsylvania, just before dusk, another woman was killed off-intersection by an SUV going straight. The form lists no cause (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash 4772871</a>).</p><h3 id=the-hours-that-hurt-most>The hours that hurt most</h3><p>Pain piles up in the rush and the dark. Injuries crest from 2 PM to 6 PM, with peaks around 3–5 PM and again at 5–6 PM. Deaths spike in the small hours—1–5 AM—and return near the evening commute, with fatalities noted at 8 PM, 9 PM, and 10 PM. The midnight hour is not safe here (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=pedestrians-carry-the-burden>Pedestrians carry the burden</h3><p>Eight pedestrians dead since 2022. More than 500 pedestrians injured. SUVs and sedans do most of the damage to people on foot: sedans are tied to four pedestrian deaths and 193 pedestrian injuries; SUVs to three pedestrian deaths and 154 injuries. Trucks and buses add weight to the toll (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>At 395 Gateway Drive, about 12:30 AM on Jul 13, 2025, a 21-year-old woman was killed in the Gateway Center lot. Police charged the driver, 24, after he told them he “lost control” while “doing donuts.” Two boys were hurt. “She was a nice and kind girl, always smiling,” a relative said (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>Daily News</a>; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/16/us-news/driver-doing-donuts-in-nyc-parking-lot-fatally-strikes-girlfriend-is-arrested-for-negligent-homicide/>NY Post</a>).</p><h3 id=what-breaks-people-here>What breaks people here</h3><p>“Other” is the catch-all that hides the truth. It leads the ledger with 13 deaths and 879 injuries since 2022. But the listed killers are plain: <strong>unsafe speed</strong>, <strong>failure to yield</strong>, and <strong>distraction</strong>. Speed shows up again and again—in ejections on the Belt, in late-night crashes, in the blood-red hours (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Vehicles/bm4k-52h4>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>On Seaview at Pennsylvania, around 8 PM on Apr 29, 2025, a 28-year-old man driving a Porsche SUV with Pennsylvania plates struck a pickup. The driver died. Records list the Porsche driver as unlicensed (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash 4816372</a>).</p><h3 id=the-corridor-that-teaches-bad-habits>The corridor that teaches bad habits</h3><p>Conduit Boulevard is built like a border. Few crossings. Highway speeds next to homes. The city now says it will redesign it after “more than 40 serious injuries and five deaths” in five years, and is asking residents to weigh in at workshops. “Residents deserve a Conduit Boulevard that … [doesn’t] put pedestrians and drivers at risk,” the DOT commissioner said (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-dot-launches-redesign-of-dangerous-conduit-corridor-in-brooklyn-queens>Gothamist</a>).</p><h3 id=fix-the-turns-slow-the-lanes-force-repeat-offenders-to-stop>Fix the turns. Slow the lanes. Force repeat offenders to stop.</h3><p>Start with the corners. Harden left turns at Pennsylvania and Blake. Daylight the corners on Linden. Add leading pedestrian intervals where people actually cross. Put real speed control on the Belt’s service roads and the long, open runs.</p><p>The state moved one piece this summer, extending and fixing school speed-zone rules (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>S 8344</a>). Cameras stay on. It isn’t enough.</p><p>The worst drivers do outsized harm. Research shows that the smallest sliver of motorists cause a fifth of pedestrian deaths; racks of camera tickets track the risk. A bill in Albany—the Stop Super Speeders Act—would force chronic violators to use speed limiters after enough points or camera tickets. That is the right target (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/20/the-1-5-percent-of-drivers-who-cause-21-percent-of-pedestrian-deaths>Streetsblog analysis</a>).</p><h3 id=make-the-default-speed-human>Make the default speed human</h3><p>Lower speeds save lives. The city can lower residential limits and should make 20 MPH the floor. Fewer broken bones. Fewer funerals. Push your lawmakers to act. The clock is already running (<a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>).</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
