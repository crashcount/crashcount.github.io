Seventeen left with serious injuries.</strong> In three and a half years, there have been <strong>3,681 crashes</strong>. The dead include a 31-year-old woman struck on 120th Street, a 20-year-old cyclist on 164th, a 47-year-old man crossing with the signal on 101st Avenue. Each one a life ended. Each one a family changed forever.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the highest price.</strong> Cars, SUVs, and trucks are the main weapons. In the last year alone, <strong>695 people were hurt</strong>—children, elders, workers, neighbors. Not one death in the past twelve months, but the injuries keep coming. The disaster does not stop. It only slows.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-inaction>Leadership: Action and Inaction</h3><p>Assembly Member <strong>David Weprin</strong> has stood on both sides of the line. He co-sponsored bills to make streets safer for all users—bills that <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">demand sidewalks, bike lanes, and crossings</a> that protect the vulnerable. But when it came time to <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1280&amp;term=2023">vote for a bill that would put speed cameras near schools in Schenectady</a>, he voted no. <strong>He opposed a tool proven to slow drivers and save lives.</strong></p><p>Weprin also joined the chorus <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/05/22/straw-men-the-fight-over-congestion-pricing-comes-down-to-just-5200-nyc-drivers/>against congestion pricing</a>, calling it unfair, even as most New Yorkers do not drive into Manhattan and the plan would fund safer streets and better transit. He stood with those who want to <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/17/queens-pols-have-lots-of-claims-about-the-evils-of-scooter-share-but-few-facts>ban e-scooter share</a>, despite city data showing no deaths or serious injuries from the program and tens of thousands of safe rides. The voices of fear are loud. The facts are quiet.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h3><p><strong>Every day without change is another day of risk.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits. Albany can <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">renew and expand speed cameras</a>. Lawmakers can build streets for people, not cars. But too often, the bills stall, the votes go the wrong way, and the bodies keep coming.</p><p>As one police report put it after a car jumped the curb and hurt nine people in South Richmond Hill, <strong>&ldquo;Police stated that none of the victims suffered life-threatening injuries.&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-pedestrians-struck-several-people-injured-being-hit-south-richmond-hill/16124727/>ABC7</a>. This time. Next time, who knows?</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call David Weprin. Call your council member. Demand safer streets.</strong> Tell them to back speed cameras, lower speed limits, and fund real street redesigns. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill faces opposition from Council Members David Weprin, Joann Ariola, and Ari Kagan, who argue it will hurt small businesses and outer-borough residents. On May 22, 2023, Ari Kagan said, 'Congestion Pricing will hurt countless New Yorkers, small businesses, residents of so-called outer-boroughs & will create huge lines of parked cars right outside of Manhattan.' Yet, the MTA’s assessment shows only 5,200 city drivers commute by car from areas far from fast transit—just 1.2% of that population. Advocates like Felicia Park-Rogers counter, 'this policy has the potential to be utterly transformational for our city.' The plan includes exemptions for disabled and low-income drivers. Most New Yorkers stand to gain safer, better-funded transit and less congestion.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'Straw Men: The Fight Over Congestion Pricing Comes Down to Just 5,200 NYC Drivers,' highlights that only 1.2% of residents far from fast transit drive into the congestion zone. Ariola, along with other council members, voiced concerns about impacts on small businesses and residents. The debate draws on MTA data showing most New Yorkers rely on public transit, not cars. Exemptions and discounts for disabled and low-income drivers are included in the policy. Advocates argue congestion pricing will reduce traffic, fund transit, and transform city streets for vulnerable road users. The council's discussion reflects a sharp divide between data and political narrative.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
