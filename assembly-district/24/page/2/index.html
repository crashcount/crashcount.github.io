He died there. The police log shows the sedan’s front end took the impact; the man was crossing outside a signal or crosswalk. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Source</a>.</p><h3 id=the-math-of-loss-on-these-streets>The math of loss on these streets</h3><p>Since 2022 in Assembly District 24, <strong>16 people have been killed</strong> in crashes: 8 people walking, 2 people on bikes, and 6 vehicle occupants. Injuries total 3,104, with 29 listed as serious. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Source</a>.</p><p>Danger piles up in familiar places.

Deaths appear in the hourly roll at 2 AM, 5 PM, 8 PM, 10 PM, and late at night.

Slow the turns. Cut the speed.</h3><p>Start where people get hit. Daylight corners on Union Turnpike and 101 Avenue to clear sightlines. Add leading pedestrian intervals and hardened turn treatments where drivers turn across people in crosswalks. On freight routes and near bus stops, use concrete to keep cars out of pedestrian space; set clear truck paths off neighborhood streets. These are standard tools. They are overdue.</p><p>Then use the citywide levers. Lower speed saves lives. Holding repeat speeders to the limit saves lives. You can push for both now. <a href=/take_action/>Act here</a>.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The case, filed in Manhattan, challenges the environmental review process and seeks to block the $15 daily toll for cars entering Manhattan below 60th Street. The lawsuit claims, 'the city, state, and federal government did not do the proper review to protect citizens.' Council Member Bob Holden called the charge 'insane.' The MTA defends its review and says delays threaten $15 billion in transit upgrades. Transit advocates say the lawsuit is frivolous and congestion pricing’s benefits are clear. The case puts the program’s timeline—and safer streets for vulnerable road users—at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city’s future hangs in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>The congestion pricing debate centers on a policy to toll drivers entering Manhattan’s core. The bill faces opposition from Council Members David Weprin, Joann Ariola, and Ari Kagan, who argue it will hurt small businesses and outer-borough residents. On May 22, 2023, Ari Kagan said, 'Congestion Pricing will hurt countless New Yorkers, small businesses, residents of so-called outer-boroughs & will create huge lines of parked cars right outside of Manhattan.' Yet, the MTA’s assessment shows only 5,200 city drivers commute by car from areas far from fast transit—just 1.2% of that population. Advocates like Felicia Park-Rogers counter, 'this policy has the potential to be utterly transformational for our city.' The plan includes exemptions for disabled and low-income drivers. Most New Yorkers stand to gain safer, better-funded transit and less congestion.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city stands at a crossroads.</p><p class=mb3>On May 22, 2023, Council Member Joann Ariola (District 32) was mentioned in a public debate over New York City's congestion pricing policy. The matter, titled 'Straw Men: The Fight Over Congestion Pricing Comes Down to Just 5,200 NYC Drivers,' highlights that only 1.2% of residents far from fast transit drive into the congestion zone. Ariola, along with other council members, voiced concerns about impacts on small businesses and residents. The debate draws on MTA data showing most New Yorkers rely on public transit, not cars. Exemptions and discounts for disabled and low-income drivers are included in the policy. Advocates argue congestion pricing will reduce traffic, fund transit, and transform city streets for vulnerable road users. The council's discussion reflects a sharp divide between data and political narrative.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
