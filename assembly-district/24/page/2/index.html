Seventeen left with serious injuries.</strong> In three and a half years, there have been <strong>3,681 crashes</strong>. The dead include a 31-year-old woman struck on 120th Street, a 20-year-old cyclist on 164th, a 47-year-old man crossing with the signal on 101st Avenue. Each one a life ended. Each one a family changed forever.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the highest price.</strong> Cars, SUVs, and trucks are the main weapons. In the last year alone, <strong>695 people were hurt</strong>—children, elders, workers, neighbors. Not one death in the past twelve months, but the injuries keep coming. The disaster does not stop. It only slows.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-inaction>Leadership: Action and Inaction</h3><p>Assembly Member <strong>David Weprin</strong> has stood on both sides of the line. He co-sponsored bills to make streets safer for all users—bills that <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">demand sidewalks, bike lanes, and crossings</a> that protect the vulnerable. But when it came time to <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1280&amp;term=2023">vote for a bill that would put speed cameras near schools in Schenectady</a>, he voted no. <strong>He opposed a tool proven to slow drivers and save lives.</strong></p><p>Weprin also joined the chorus <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/05/22/straw-men-the-fight-over-congestion-pricing-comes-down-to-just-5200-nyc-drivers/>against congestion pricing</a>, calling it unfair, even as most New Yorkers do not drive into Manhattan and the plan would fund safer streets and better transit. He stood with those who want to <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/17/queens-pols-have-lots-of-claims-about-the-evils-of-scooter-share-but-few-facts>ban e-scooter share</a>, despite city data showing no deaths or serious injuries from the program and tens of thousands of safe rides. The voices of fear are loud. The facts are quiet.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h3><p><strong>Every day without change is another day of risk.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits. Albany can <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">renew and expand speed cameras</a>. Lawmakers can build streets for people, not cars. But too often, the bills stall, the votes go the wrong way, and the bodies keep coming.</p><p>As one police report put it after a car jumped the curb and hurt nine people in South Richmond Hill, <strong>&ldquo;Police stated that none of the victims suffered life-threatening injuries.&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-pedestrians-struck-several-people-injured-being-hit-south-richmond-hill/16124727/>ABC7</a>. This time. Next time, who knows?</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call David Weprin. Call your council member. Demand safer streets.</strong> Tell them to back speed cameras, lower speed limits, and fund real street redesigns. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
