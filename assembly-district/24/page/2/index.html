Twenty seriously hurt. Over 2,200 injured.</strong> That is the toll in Assembly District 24 since 2022. The dead do not speak. The wounded limp, or do not walk at all. These numbers are not just statistics. They are mothers, sons, neighbors. They are the man struck crossing 101st Avenue. The woman killed at Liberty and 114th.

In April, a car jumped the curb in South Richmond Hill. Nine people were hurt. Four were waiting for the bus. Two were riding the bus. Three were inside the car.

Bikes are blamed, but the numbers are clear: cars and trucks do the most harm.</p><p>Assembly Member David Weprin has voted <strong>against speed cameras in school zones</strong>. He voted no on a bill to bring speed cameras to Schenectady schools. He voted no on New York City&rsquo;s own speed camera program (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>voted no</a>).

Demand he support speed cameras and a 20 mph citywide speed limit. Demand action, not excuses. The dead cannot wait. The living should not have to.</p><p><strong>Contact your leaders.

The fight delays safer, quieter streets.</p><p class=mb3>On January 18, 2024, Assemblymember David Weprin and the City Council’s Common Sense Caucus filed a federal lawsuit against the MTA’s congestion pricing plan. The case, filed in Manhattan, challenges the environmental review process and seeks to block the $15 daily toll for cars entering Manhattan below 60th Street. The lawsuit claims, 'the city, state, and federal government did not do the proper review to protect citizens.' Council Member Bob Holden called the charge 'insane.' The MTA defends its review and says delays threaten $15 billion in transit upgrades. Transit advocates say the lawsuit is frivolous and congestion pricing’s benefits are clear. The case puts the program’s timeline—and safer streets for vulnerable road users—at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill faces opposition from Council Members David Weprin, Joann Ariola, and Ari Kagan, who argue it will hurt small businesses and outer-borough residents. On May 22, 2023, Ari Kagan said, 'Congestion Pricing will hurt countless New Yorkers, small businesses, residents of so-called outer-boroughs & will create huge lines of parked cars right outside of Manhattan.' Yet, the MTA’s assessment shows only 5,200 city drivers commute by car from areas far from fast transit—just 1.2% of that population. Advocates like Felicia Park-Rogers counter, 'this policy has the potential to be utterly transformational for our city.' The plan includes exemptions for disabled and low-income drivers.

The debate centers on just 5,200 drivers. Most New Yorkers use transit. Opponents claim harm to businesses and residents. Data shows broad benefit. The city stands at a crossroads.</p><p class=mb3>On May 22, 2023, Council Member Joann Ariola (District 32) was mentioned in a public debate over New York City's congestion pricing policy. The matter, titled 'Straw Men: The Fight Over Congestion Pricing Comes Down to Just 5,200 NYC Drivers,' highlights that only 1.2% of residents far from fast transit drive into the congestion zone. Ariola, along with other council members, voiced concerns about impacts on small businesses and residents. The debate draws on MTA data showing most New Yorkers rely on public transit, not cars. Exemptions and discounts for disabled and low-income drivers are included in the policy. Advocates argue congestion pricing will reduce traffic, fund transit, and transform city streets for vulnerable road users. The council's discussion reflects a sharp divide between data and political narrative.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
