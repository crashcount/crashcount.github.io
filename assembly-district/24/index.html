Twenty seriously hurt. Over 2,200 injured.</strong> That is the toll in Assembly District 24 since 2022. The dead do not speak. The wounded limp, or do not walk at all. These numbers are not just statistics. They are mothers, sons, neighbors. They are the man struck crossing 101st Avenue. The woman killed at Liberty and 114th.

In April, a car jumped the curb in South Richmond Hill. Nine people were hurt. Four were waiting for the bus. Two were riding the bus. Three were inside the car.

He voted no on a bill to bring speed cameras to Schenectady schools. He voted no on New York City&rsquo;s own speed camera program (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>voted no</a>).

Demand he support speed cameras and a 20 mph citywide speed limit. Demand action, not excuses. The dead cannot wait. The living should not have to.</p><p><strong>Contact your leaders.

The Senate passed the measure 38-21; three city senators—Stephen Chan, Andrew Lanza, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton—voted no. The Assembly passed it 110-31, with nine city lawmakers—Alec Brook-Krasny, Lester Chang, Simcha Eichenstein, Michael Novakhov, Stacey Pheffer Amato, Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Reilly, David Weprin, Kalman Yeger—opposing. The Streetsblog NYC article, 'Ye Shall Know Their Names! Meet the Dirty Dozen City Pols Who Voted Against Speed Camera Program,' quotes lawmakers dismissing speed cameras as revenue grabs or burdens. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action, so no direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists can be assessed.' Still, the votes signal disregard for proven tools that protect those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Sponsored by Senator Andrew Gounardes, the bill passed Senate votes on June 12 and June 13, and cleared the Assembly on June 17. The measure extends and corrects school speed zone laws in New York City, repealing outdated provisions. Gounardes led the push, with strong support from most Senate Democrats and a split Assembly. The bill's technical fixes aim to keep protections in place for children and other vulnerable road users near schools.

The bill moves forward despite evidence of harm to vulnerable road users.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Bill 590, sponsored by Amy Paulin (D-Westchester), advanced in a Transportation Committee hearing on May 7, 2025. The bill would require 16- and 17-year-olds riding Class 1 or 2 e-bikes, including Citi Bikes, to wear helmets. Committee Chair William Magnarelli (D-Syracuse) defended the bill, stating, "My only concern is the safety of the people riding the bike." The bill summary notes, 'studies have shown [helmet mandates] can dramatically reduce ridership of the city’s bike share system.' Experts warn such laws lead to fewer cyclists and open the door to discriminatory enforcement, especially against youth of color. Seattle dropped its helmet law in 2022 for these reasons. Despite evidence that helmet laws hurt vulnerable road users, the committee advanced the bill without addressing these harms.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal would raise the payroll mobility tax, already increased last year, to fund the MTA. Rep.

Two cars, one crash, danger unchecked.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a sedan struck the back of a sport utility vehicle on 107th Avenue near 111th Street in Queens at 1:06 a.m. The report notes 'Alcohol Involvement' as a contributing factor in the crash. The sedan’s front end collided with the SUV’s rear, crumpling metal and causing severe bleeding to a 32-year-old male driver, who remained conscious. The narrative describes the scene: 'Metal crumpled. Blood ran down a 32-year-old man’s arm. He stayed conscious. The night smelled of alcohol.' Both vehicles were traveling straight ahead at the time of impact. The data does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor. The focus remains on the presence of alcohol and the violent impact that left one driver injured.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
