Seventeen left with serious injuries.</strong> In three and a half years, there have been <strong>3,681 crashes</strong>. The dead include a 31-year-old woman struck on 120th Street, a 20-year-old cyclist on 164th, a 47-year-old man crossing with the signal on 101st Avenue. Each one a life ended. Each one a family changed forever.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the highest price.</strong> Cars, SUVs, and trucks are the main weapons. In the last year alone, <strong>695 people were hurt</strong>—children, elders, workers, neighbors. Not one death in the past twelve months, but the injuries keep coming. The disaster does not stop. It only slows.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-inaction>Leadership: Action and Inaction</h3><p>Assembly Member <strong>David Weprin</strong> has stood on both sides of the line. He co-sponsored bills to make streets safer for all users—bills that <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">demand sidewalks, bike lanes, and crossings</a> that protect the vulnerable. But when it came time to <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1280&amp;term=2023">vote for a bill that would put speed cameras near schools in Schenectady</a>, he voted no. <strong>He opposed a tool proven to slow drivers and save lives.</strong></p><p>Weprin also joined the chorus <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/05/22/straw-men-the-fight-over-congestion-pricing-comes-down-to-just-5200-nyc-drivers/>against congestion pricing</a>, calling it unfair, even as most New Yorkers do not drive into Manhattan and the plan would fund safer streets and better transit.

The Assembly passed it 110-31, with nine city lawmakers—Alec Brook-Krasny, Lester Chang, Simcha Eichenstein, Michael Novakhov, Stacey Pheffer Amato, Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Reilly, David Weprin, Kalman Yeger—opposing. The Streetsblog NYC article, 'Ye Shall Know Their Names! Meet the Dirty Dozen City Pols Who Voted Against Speed Camera Program,' quotes lawmakers dismissing speed cameras as revenue grabs or burdens. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action, so no direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists can be assessed.'

The bill would require 16- and 17-year-olds riding Class 1 or 2 e-bikes, including Citi Bikes, to wear helmets. Committee Chair William Magnarelli (D-Syracuse) defended the bill, stating, "My only concern is the safety of the people riding the bike." The bill summary notes, 'studies have shown [helmet mandates] can dramatically reduce ridership of the city’s bike share system.' Experts warn such laws lead to fewer cyclists and open the door to discriminatory enforcement, especially against youth of color. Seattle dropped its helmet law in 2022 for these reasons. Despite evidence that helmet laws hurt vulnerable road users, the committee advanced the bill without addressing these harms.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Gennaro said, "The program, as designed, leads to chaos." Ung called her bill a last resort. Assembly Members Sam Berger and David Weprin, and Community Board 8 Chair Martha Taylor, joined the opposition, citing sidewalk clutter and lack of outreach. However, DOT data contradicts their claims: since the program's June launch, 37,000 riders have taken 290,000 trips with no reported serious injuries or deaths. DOT says it held 35 briefings and implemented parking corrals in dense areas.

The plan, set to start June 30, would have charged drivers $15 to enter below 60th Street, raising $1 billion yearly for transit. Hochul proposed a payroll tax hike instead, but State Senator Liz Krueger opposed it, saying, "I do not think we have an appetite for that in the Senate." The bill’s fate is uncertain as the legislative session ends. The MTA board, city officials, and business groups all voiced concern. Projects like the Second Avenue Subway, subway accessibility, and zero-emission buses now face cancellation. No alternative funding plan exists.

Liz Krueger (District 28) and other lawmakers responded to a proposed New York City tax hike meant to replace the indefinitely postponed $15 congestion pricing tolls. The measure, debated as Bill 28, has not advanced in committee and faces strong opposition. The matter, described as 'a last-minute funding move that drew fierce opposition,' has Krueger stating, 'I think it does not have support.' Assemblyman Brian Cunningham echoed, 'No new taxes.' The proposal would raise the payroll mobility tax, already increased last year, to fund the MTA. Rep. Jerry Nadler and business groups argue the tax unfairly targets NYC, while congestion pricing would have spread costs regionally. With the legislative session ending, MTA projects remain at risk. No safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
