Streets choke with blocked bike lanes and chaos. Manual enforcement fails. DOT backs automation. Some lawmakers resist, call for cops. Vulnerable road users left dodging danger as debate drags.</p><p class=mb3>On March 3, 2025, a legislative proposal surfaced to deploy automated parking enforcement cameras across New York City. Assemblymember Steven Raga leads the push for a $35 million pilot, aiming to install 150 cameras targeting double parking and illegal stops. The bill, not yet assigned a committee or number, seeks to automate enforcement where manual efforts fall short. Raga writes, 'manual enforcement has not been able to meet the demand to combat double parking and illegal parking.' State Senator Simcha Felder of District 44 opposes the measure, arguing for traditional police summonses instead. The Department of Transportation supports the expansion, stating, 'Automated enforcement has proven to change driver behavior and make our streets safer for everyone.' The debate centers on whether automation or police presence best protects pedestrians and cyclists from blocked lanes and traffic hazards.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The federal action canceled the $9 toll meant to fund the MTA’s capital plan, threatening $16 billion for transit upgrades. The matter drew sharp words: Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie said, 'The president and the Republican members of New York's congressional delegation ... just blew a $16-billion hole in the most important transit system in the nation.' Subway riders at Canal Street called the move 'insane' and accused Trump of ignoring New Yorkers. Advocates and everyday riders warned that ending congestion pricing would slow commutes, worsen traffic, and put vulnerable road users at greater risk.

Vulnerable New Yorkers lose again.</p><p class=mb3>This report covers the ongoing 2025 state legislative budget negotiations over the MTA’s 2025-29 capital plan and congestion pricing. The article, published January 13, 2025, highlights how Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, and Governor Hochul have failed to deliver needed funding. The matter summary states: 'Starving the MTA will not actually improve service and will not actually improve safety, will not actually improve reliability.' Lawmakers consider exemptions or repeals to congestion pricing, undermining the MTA’s financial foundation. Andrew Rein, a key voice, warns that withholding funds is 'a recipe for disaster and an abdication of responsibility.' The legislature’s inaction threatens subway modernization, safety, and reliability. Without proper investment, vulnerable riders—those who rely on transit—face greater risk and hardship.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the crash occurred at 1:09 a.m. and involved a 2008 Acura sedan and a 2013 Nissan sedan, both traveling straight ahead. The report details that 'Unsafe Speed' was a contributing factor, with one driver also flagged for 'Alcohol Involvement.' The narrative describes airbags bursting and metal folding, leaving four occupants—two drivers and two passengers—injured. Victims suffered crush injuries, with one semiconscious, two incoherent, and one in shock. The force of the collision sent vehicles into parked cars, compounding the destruction. The police report makes clear: unsafe speed and driver recklessness shattered the quiet, leaving bodies broken and a street scarred.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The plan, described as funding 'crucial state-of-good-repair track work,' now hangs in limbo. MTA CEO Janno Lieber called the move a 'Catch-22' that could cause cascading failures and delay urgent repairs. The Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the MTA urged lawmakers to withdraw their objection, warning of long-term delays and higher costs. Stewart-Cousins’s spokesperson, Mike Murphy, dismissed the urgency, pointing to unfinished projects from the last plan.

The action came via a Christmas Eve letter to MTA CEO Janno Leiber, rejecting the plan and stalling critical transit improvements. The plan, as described, funds 'essential work'—new trains, accessibility, power, and station repairs. Riders Alliance called on Albany to 'fix the subway.' Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance warned, 'the least-visible projects are the most vulnerable to cuts – but also often the most essential, like new signals and upgrades to power systems and structures.' Neither Heastie nor Stewart-Cousins responded to requests for comment. The rejection delays contract awards for new electric rail cars and locomotives, leaving millions of riders—and vulnerable road users—at risk from crumbling infrastructure and unreliable transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan now awaits review by the Capital Plan Review Board, which has 90 days to approve or reject it. The matter centers on whether the governor will force cuts to desperately needed repairs and upgrades. Advocates like Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance demand Hochul fund 'the reliable, accessible, resilient service we've long been denied but that we need and deserve.' Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany calls out Hochul’s record, urging her to cut her own Interborough Express project first if reductions come. The MTA declined comment.

In his op-ed, Cooney wrote, 'the time for debating the merits of congestion pricing has passed,' urging the governor to convene finance, labor, and passenger representatives to find a solution.

Other Albany leaders, including Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and Senate President Andrea Stewart-Cousins, have offered little response. Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger called Hochul’s move illegal.
