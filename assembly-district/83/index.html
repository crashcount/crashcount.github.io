An SUV hit her. She died at Jacobi. The driver stayed. No charges. The street stayed the same. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/25/woman-78-fatally-struck-by-bronx-suv-driver/>The news told it straight</a>: “The victim was crossing White Plains Road at E. 216th St. in Williamsbridge when a 56-year-old woman driving north in a 2024 Toyota RAV4 hit her at about 10:20 p.m. Saturday, cops said.”</p><p>A coach stood outside his home. A BMW, a pickup, a chain of parked cars. Metal and glass. He was gone. His mother <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/08/bronx-bmw-driver-arrested-for-manslaughter-in-crash-that-killed-beloved-coach/>said, “These arrests cannot bring back my child.

They do not care.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h2><p><strong>Assembly Member Carl Heastie holds the gavel.</strong> He has power. He has blocked and delayed bills that could have saved lives. In 2023, he ended the session without a vote on Sammy’s Law, which would have let the city lower speed limits. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/mother-of-crash-victim-on-failure-of-nyc-speed-limit-bill-albany-backroom-politics-at-its-worst>A mother called it &ldquo;Albany backroom politics at its worst.&rdquo;</a> Heastie said, “I am only one vote.” But he is the Speaker.

He signed on to a <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/05/15/new-york-pols-push-bill-to-cut-vehicle-miles-by-20>bill to cut car miles</a>. But the slow pace and the silence after each crash are louder than any press release.</p><h2 id=what-next-the-blood-is-still-fresh>What Next? The Blood Is Still Fresh</h2><p><strong>Every delay is another risk.</strong> Call Heastie. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement.

The bill passed both the Senate and Assembly and awaits Governor Hochul’s signature. The measure, described as 'possibly the most important street safety law on the books,' covers 750 school zones. Sen. Andrew Gounardes praised the program, saying, 'speed cameras save lives and make our streets safer for everyone.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez credited advocates and lawmakers for the renewal. Amy Sohn supported the move. Safety analysts note that speed cameras reduce vehicle speeds and crashes, improving safety for pedestrians and cyclists without burdening them.

The bill, not yet assigned a committee or number, seeks to automate enforcement where manual efforts fall short. Raga writes, 'manual enforcement has not been able to meet the demand to combat double parking and illegal parking.' State Senator Simcha Felder of District 44 opposes the measure, arguing for traditional police summonses instead.

Advocates warn: delay means risk for millions.</p><p class=mb3>On December 26, 2024, Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins blocked the MTA’s 2025-2029 capital plan, worth $68 billion. The action came via a Christmas Eve letter to MTA CEO Janno Leiber, rejecting the plan and stalling critical transit improvements. The plan, as described, funds 'essential work'—new trains, accessibility, power, and station repairs. Riders Alliance called on Albany to 'fix the subway.' Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance warned, 'the least-visible projects are the most vulnerable to cuts – but also often the most essential, like new signals and upgrades to power systems and structures.' Neither Heastie nor Stewart-Cousins responded to requests for comment. The rejection delays contract awards for new electric rail cars and locomotives, leaving millions of riders—and vulnerable road users—at risk from crumbling infrastructure and unreliable transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the crash occurred just after midnight, and the street was dark. The report states the driver was inattentive or distracted at the time of the collision. The impact was so forceful that parked cars were damaged. The pedestrian was not in a crosswalk when struck, but the police report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor. The driver’s permit status is noted in the narrative, underscoring a lack of full licensure. The report does not cite any pedestrian actions as contributing factors. The focus remains on the driver’s distraction and permit status, which led to fatal consequences for the man in the roadway.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The plan now awaits review by the Capital Plan Review Board, which has 90 days to approve or reject it. The matter centers on whether the governor will force cuts to desperately needed repairs and upgrades. Advocates like Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance demand Hochul fund 'the reliable, accessible, resilient service we've long been denied but that we need and deserve.' Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany calls out Hochul’s record, urging her to cut her own Interborough Express project first if reductions come. The MTA declined comment. The fate of New York’s transit—and the safety of millions who rely on it—rests on this decision.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The police report lists 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' as a contributing factor, highlighting a critical driver error. The Nissan was parked at the time of the collision, and no other injuries were reported.

In his op-ed, Cooney wrote, 'the time for debating the merits of congestion pricing has passed,' urging the governor to convene finance, labor, and passenger representatives to find a solution. Cooney’s push comes as the MTA faces threats to station accessibility, signal upgrades, and new trains and buses. Other Albany leaders, including Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and Senate President Andrea Stewart-Cousins, have offered little response. Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger called Hochul’s move illegal. The bill or action is not numbered, but the committee involved is the Senate Transportation Committee.

The program, set to charge drivers $15 to enter Manhattan’s core, was expected to raise $15 billion for the MTA’s $55-billion capital plan. DiNapoli’s report, titled 'Loss of Congestion Pricing Revenue Leaves MTA With No Good Options,' warns that the MTA 'will be forced to put off badly needed investment in expansion and improvements to the system.' He stressed, 'Those choices will directly affect riders ... for years to come.' NYC Comptroller Brad Lander echoed support for congestion pricing, urging the governor to reconsider price points if it means moving forward. Activists plan to pressure the MTA board to resist the governor’s decision, citing the need to avoid transit cuts and deliver 'major traffic safety, air quality, and cost of living improvements for all New Yorkers.' The loss of funding threatens basic maintenance, reliability, and frequency, with no clear replacement in sight.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Heastie said, 'If you want me to attack the Governor for making a call, I’m sorry I’m not going to do that. I want to get the MTA funded.' Schumer, pressed by a constituent, affirmed his support but refused to publicly pressure Hochul, claiming she 'doesn’t react well to public pressure.'
