An SUV hit her. She died at Jacobi. The driver stayed. No charges. The street stayed the same. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/25/woman-78-fatally-struck-by-bronx-suv-driver/>The news told it straight</a>: “The victim was crossing White Plains Road at E. 216th St. in Williamsbridge when a 56-year-old woman driving north in a 2024 Toyota RAV4 hit her at about 10:20 p.m. Saturday, cops said.”</p><p>A coach stood outside his home. A BMW, a pickup, a chain of parked cars. Metal and glass. He was gone. His mother <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/08/bronx-bmw-driver-arrested-for-manslaughter-in-crash-that-killed-beloved-coach/>said, “These arrests cannot bring back my child.

They do not care.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h2><p><strong>Assembly Member Carl Heastie holds the gavel.</strong> He has power. He has blocked and delayed bills that could have saved lives. In 2023, he ended the session without a vote on Sammy’s Law, which would have let the city lower speed limits. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/mother-of-crash-victim-on-failure-of-nyc-speed-limit-bill-albany-backroom-politics-at-its-worst>A mother called it &ldquo;Albany backroom politics at its worst.&rdquo;</a> Heastie said, “I am only one vote.” But he is the Speaker.

But the slow pace and the silence after each crash are louder than any press release.</p><h2 id=what-next-the-blood-is-still-fresh>What Next? The Blood Is Still Fresh</h2><p><strong>Every delay is another risk.</strong> Call Heastie. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement.

No new transit money. No tougher penalties. Riders left waiting. Drivers keep blocking. The city’s slowest buses stay slow. Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On March 15, 2022, the New York State Assembly and Senate released one-house budget proposals. Both left out Governor Hochul’s measures to increase fines for blocking bus lanes, raise penalties for toll evasion and defaced plates, and boost transit funding. The matter: 'State legislators used their budget proposals to prioritize drivers blocking bus lanes and evading tolls, omitting Gov. Hochul's proposals to raise fines for blocking bus lanes and increase penalties for toll evasion and defaced license plates.' Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie defended stripping policy from the budget. Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein slammed the move: 'No increase in subway or bus service for millions of riders, no enhanced enforcement in the city with the slowest buses in the country.' The Senate promised to revisit bus lane enforcement later. Advocates doubted action would follow. The legislature’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed, with no relief from blocked bus lanes or reckless drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
