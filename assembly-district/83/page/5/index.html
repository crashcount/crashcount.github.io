No new transit money. No tougher penalties. Riders left waiting. Drivers keep blocking. The city’s slowest buses stay slow. Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On March 15, 2022, the New York State Assembly and Senate released one-house budget proposals. Both left out Governor Hochul’s measures to increase fines for blocking bus lanes, raise penalties for toll evasion and defaced plates, and boost transit funding. The matter: 'State legislators used their budget proposals to prioritize drivers blocking bus lanes and evading tolls, omitting Gov. Hochul's proposals to raise fines for blocking bus lanes and increase penalties for toll evasion and defaced license plates.' Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie defended stripping policy from the budget. Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein slammed the move: 'No increase in subway or bus service for millions of riders, no enhanced enforcement in the city with the slowest buses in the country.' The Senate promised to revisit bus lane enforcement later. Advocates doubted action would follow. The legislature’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed, with no relief from blocked bus lanes or reckless drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
