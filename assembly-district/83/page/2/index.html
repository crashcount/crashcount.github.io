The future of safe, reliable transit hangs in the balance. The buck stops with her.</p><p class=mb3>On September 30, 2024, Governor Kathy Hochul announced she might not fill a $33-billion gap in the proposed 2025-2029 MTA capital plan, threatening to shrink the $68.4-billion package approved by the MTA Board. The plan now awaits review by the Capital Plan Review Board, which has 90 days to approve or reject it. The matter centers on whether the governor will force cuts to desperately needed repairs and upgrades. Advocates like Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance demand Hochul fund 'the reliable, accessible, resilient service we've long been denied but that we need and deserve.' Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany calls out Hochul’s record, urging her to cut her own Interborough Express project first if reductions come. The MTA declined comment. The fate of New York’s transit—and the safety of millions who rely on it—rests on this decision.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crash occurred as the truck was making a left turn. The report states, 'A flatbed truck turned left. A 64-year-old man crossed with the light. The front end struck him. His body crushed beneath steel.' The pedestrian was crossing with the signal at the intersection, as explicitly noted in the police data. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified,' but the narrative and vehicle data confirm the truck's left turn and the pedestrian's lawful crossing. The man suffered fatal crush injuries to his entire body. No driver errors beyond the left turn are specified, but the sequence underscores the lethal risk posed by turning vehicles to people in crosswalks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The report states the impact folded steel and left a 37-year-old male driver with crush injuries to his back. He remained conscious at the scene. The police report lists 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' as a contributing factor, highlighting a critical driver error. The Nissan was parked at the time of the collision, and no other injuries were reported. The evidence in the report underscores the consequences of improper lane usage, as the SUV’s movement directly led to the severe injury of the sedan’s occupant. No victim actions are cited as contributing factors.

Jeremy Cooney, new chair of the Senate Transportation Committee, issued a public demand for Governor Hochul to deliver a '100-day plan' to replace the $16.5 billion MTA funding shortfall caused by her cancellation of congestion pricing. In his op-ed, Cooney wrote, 'the time for debating the merits of congestion pricing has passed,' urging the governor to convene finance, labor, and passenger representatives to find a solution. Cooney’s push comes as the MTA faces threats to station accessibility, signal upgrades, and new trains and buses. Other Albany leaders, including Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and Senate President Andrea Stewart-Cousins, have offered little response. Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger called Hochul’s move illegal. The bill or action is not numbered, but the committee involved is the Senate Transportation Committee. No direct safety analyst note was provided, but the loss of funding jeopardizes projects vital to vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Safety and air suffer.</p><p class=mb3>On June 25, 2024, State Comptroller Tom DiNapoli issued a report blasting Governor Hochul’s indefinite pause on congestion pricing. The program, set to charge drivers $15 to enter Manhattan’s core, was expected to raise $15 billion for the MTA’s $55-billion capital plan. DiNapoli’s report, titled 'Loss of Congestion Pricing Revenue Leaves MTA With No Good Options,' warns that the MTA 'will be forced to put off badly needed investment in expansion and improvements to the system.' He stressed, 'Those choices will directly affect riders ... for years to come.' NYC Comptroller Brad Lander echoed support for congestion pricing, urging the governor to reconsider price points if it means moving forward. Activists plan to pressure the MTA board to resist the governor’s decision, citing the need to avoid transit cuts and deliver 'major traffic safety, air quality, and cost of living improvements for all New Yorkers.' The loss of funding threatens basic maintenance, reliability, and frequency, with no clear replacement in sight.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Heastie said, 'If you want me to attack the Governor for making a call, I’m sorry I’m not going to do that. I want to get the MTA funded.' Schumer, pressed by a constituent, affirmed his support but refused to publicly pressure Hochul, claiming she 'doesn’t react well to public pressure.'

The editorial, titled 'Cleaning up after congestion pricing is messy — but worth it,' praised Stewart-Cousins and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie for rejecting both congestion tolls and a metro-area mobility tax hike. The piece argued, 'the congestion toll was a ridiculous kludge that Hochul was right to kill.' Instead, it supported a $1 billion one-year state reserve for the MTA. Stewart-Cousins' stance blocks new funding streams that could have paid for safer streets, electric buses, and accessible stations. The editorial criticized MTA spending but ignored the danger and delay this decision brings to vulnerable road users.

The law requires community board notification and comment, but their input is only advisory. Families of road violence victims and street safety advocates celebrated the win. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, Transportation Chair, conditioned her support on street redesigns in underserved neighborhoods.
