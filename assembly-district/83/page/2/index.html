Twenty-three left with serious injuries.</strong> In just the last twelve months, four deaths and seven more lives changed forever. The dead are not numbers. They are elders crossing White Plains Road, a 76-year-old woman struck by an SUV. They are a 60-year-old man crushed on Givan Avenue, a 64-year-old killed at an intersection, a 44-year-old thrown from his moped. The street does not care about age or reason. The street only takes.</p><h2 id=the-vehicles-that-kill-and-maim>The Vehicles That Kill and Maim</h2><p><strong>SUVs, sedans, trucks, mopeds.</strong> In AD 83, SUVs and cars are the main weapons: five deaths, seventy moderate injuries, five serious injuries. Trucks and buses add four more serious or moderate injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds, two more. Even bikes and buses are not blameless. The pattern is clear. The bigger the vehicle, the greater the harm.</p><h2 id=what-has-carl-heastie-done>What Has Carl Heastie Done?</h2><p>Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie holds the gavel. He has the power to move bills, or to bury them. In 2023, he let Sammy’s Law—a bill to let New York City set its own speed limits—die without a vote. Amy Cohen, whose son was killed by a driver, called it <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/mother-of-crash-victim-on-failure-of-nyc-speed-limit-bill-albany-backroom-politics-at-its-worst>&ldquo;Albany backroom politics at its worst&rdquo;</a>. Heastie told her, <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/mother-of-crash-victim-on-failure-of-nyc-speed-limit-bill-albany-backroom-politics-at-its-worst>&ldquo;I am only one vote&rdquo;</a>. The bill had broad support. It never reached the floor.</p><p>Heastie did back the expansion of red light cameras, pushing them from 150 to 600 intersections. Assemblymember Dinowitz said, <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/more-red-light-cameras-coming-to-nyc-intersections-under-newly-passed-legislation>&ldquo;People shouldn’t run red lights&mldr; when they do that they endanger other people’s lives, and people have died,&rdquo;</a> and Heastie controlled the vote. The cameras passed. But the speed limit bill—the one that could have saved the most lives—stalled.</p><h2 id=what-next-the-fight-is-not-over>What Next? The Fight Is Not Over</h2><p><strong>The dead cannot call for change. The living must.</strong> Call Carl Heastie. Demand he move every bill that puts people before cars. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras, more enforcement, more street redesigns. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

They want New York City to set its own speed limits. Last year, Speaker Heastie blocked a vote. Mothers starved in protest. Lawmakers stalled. Now, survivors and families demand action. Data shows lower speeds save lives.</p><p class=mb3>On January 23, 2024, advocates launched a renewed push for Sammy’s Law in Albany. The bill, which would let New York City control its own speed limits, stalled last year when Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie refused to allow a vote, despite majority support. Brooklyn Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, a strong supporter, noted, 'Even [lawmakers] who had City Council members from their districts supporting the bill were still not interested.' Queens Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas, recently injured by a driver, said, 'Had the car been going faster ... I might not be here.' Amy Cohen of Families for Safe Streets highlighted broad support: 'We have organizations from across the city supporting Sammy’s Law.' City data shows a 36% drop in pedestrian deaths after the 2014 speed limit reduction. The bill remains in limbo, but advocates are not backing down.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure stalled last year when Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie blocked a vote, despite support from Governor Hochul, the state Senate, Mayor Adams, and the City Council. Assembly Member Linda Rosenthal, who sponsors the bill, rallied outside Heastie’s office, saying, 'Last year, 257 people were killed on New York City streets by reckless and speeding drivers. Each of these deaths was preventable.' Amy Cohen, whose son Sammy was killed in 2013, called for urgent action: 'We can’t wait any longer. People like Sammy, and so many others are dying on our streets.' Advocates point to a 36-percent drop in pedestrian deaths after the city lowered speed limits in 2014. The bill would not set new limits automatically, but would give the city the power to act.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The fight for safer streets continues.</p><p class=mb3>This report details the outcome of New York City's 24/7 speed camera enforcement, launched August 1, 2022. The Department of Transportation (DOT) announced a 30 percent drop in violations on enforced corridors. The matter summary states, 'Success: Drivers are Slowing Down on Streets with 24/7 Speed Cameras.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called the expanded enforcement 'a highly effective tool to keep New Yorkers safe.' Key corridors saw dramatic reductions: 96 percent on Houston Street, 74 percent on North Conduit Boulevard, 68 percent on Bruckner Boulevard. Injuries fell at high-crash sites—45 percent on Tremont Avenue, 33 percent on Kings Highway, 16 percent on Queens Boulevard, 19 percent on Hylan Boulevard. Automated cameras issued over 3.7 million tickets, dwarfing police efforts. Despite progress, cyclist injuries are on pace for a record high, and advocates now push for city control over speed limits.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
