The report states the impact folded steel and left a 37-year-old male driver with crush injuries to his back. He remained conscious at the scene. The police report lists 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' as a contributing factor, highlighting a critical driver error. The Nissan was parked at the time of the collision, and no other injuries were reported. The evidence in the report underscores the consequences of improper lane usage, as the SUV’s movement directly led to the severe injury of the sedan’s occupant. No victim actions are cited as contributing factors. The crash stands as another instance of systemic road danger in the Bronx.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Projects for safer, more accessible transit hang in the balance. Albany leaders mostly stay silent.</p><p class=mb3>On July 24, 2024, State Sen. Jeremy Cooney, new chair of the Senate Transportation Committee, issued a public demand for Governor Hochul to deliver a '100-day plan' to replace the $16.5 billion MTA funding shortfall caused by her cancellation of congestion pricing. In his op-ed, Cooney wrote, 'the time for debating the merits of congestion pricing has passed,' urging the governor to convene finance, labor, and passenger representatives to find a solution. Cooney’s push comes as the MTA faces threats to station accessibility, signal upgrades, and new trains and buses. Other Albany leaders, including Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and Senate President Andrea Stewart-Cousins, have offered little response. Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger called Hochul’s move illegal. The bill or action is not numbered, but the committee involved is the Senate Transportation Committee. No direct safety analyst note was provided, but the loss of funding jeopardizes projects vital to vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The collision left two seventeen-year-old girls—one driving, one riding—ejected from the scooter, both suffering severe head lacerations. The narrative states: 'Two 17-year-old girls flew, heads split, blood on the asphalt. Both conscious. Both ejected. The scooter crumpled. The SUV rolled on, unmarked.' The SUV sustained no damage, while the e-scooter was crushed at the center front end.

The program, set to charge drivers $15 to enter Manhattan’s core, was expected to raise $15 billion for the MTA’s $55-billion capital plan. DiNapoli’s report, titled 'Loss of Congestion Pricing Revenue Leaves MTA With No Good Options,' warns that the MTA 'will be forced to put off badly needed investment in expansion and improvements to the system.' He stressed, 'Those choices will directly affect riders ... for years to come.' NYC Comptroller Brad Lander echoed support for congestion pricing, urging the governor to reconsider price points if it means moving forward. Activists plan to pressure the MTA board to resist the governor’s decision, citing the need to avoid transit cuts and deliver 'major traffic safety, air quality, and cost of living improvements for all New Yorkers.'

The measure is championed by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and backed by a coalition of local officials. On May 15, 2024, a letter to Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins called for swift passage before the session ends in June. The letter states, 'The state Legislature should pass the law before the end of this session in June, which could pivot transportation funding toward more beneficial uses like mass transit and biking and walking infrastructure.' Stewart-Cousins is mentioned as a key recipient. The bill would force agencies to prioritize projects for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit riders over highway expansion. Advocates argue this shift will save lives, cut pollution, and undo harms from car-centric planning.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city can now set lower speed limits. Lawmakers carved out wide roads, leaving many deadly corridors untouched. Advocates fought for years. Families of crash victims cheered. The fight for safer streets is not over.</p><p class=mb3>Sammy’s Law, passed on April 22, 2024, as part of New York’s $273-billion state budget, grants New York City the authority to set its own speed limits on most roads. The bill, long blocked by Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, finally moved forward under Governor Kathy Hochul’s push. The measure, described as 'a significant legislative achievement,' excludes roads outside Manhattan with three or more travel lanes in one direction—a concession to car-centric lawmakers. The law requires community board notification and comment, but their input is only advisory. Families of road violence victims and street safety advocates celebrated the win. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, Transportation Chair, conditioned her support on street redesigns in underserved neighborhoods. The law’s carve-out leaves many of the city’s deadliest roads unchanged, withholding proven safety benefits from major thoroughfares.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report cites 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as a contributing factor. The moped’s unlicensed rider continued straight, and the impact ejected a 22-year-old male passenger from the moped. The passenger struck the street and suffered a severe head injury, described as 'severe bleeding,' and was found conscious at the scene. The police report notes the passenger was not wearing a helmet, but this is mentioned after the primary driver error. The crash underscores the danger when drivers fail to yield, as documented in the official report.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The measure was left out of the Assembly’s budget, despite support from the State Senate, Governor Hochul, Mayor Adams, and the City Council. The bill’s sponsor, Assemblymember Linda Rosenthal, did not comment. The Assembly’s move angered advocates and families, including Amy Cohen of Families for Safe Streets, who said, 'We are very disappointed that the Assembly didn’t follow suit.' Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives called the decision a failure to join 'more than 130 unions, hospitals, business leaders, and community-led organizations that recognize the urgent need for this common-sense legislation.' The Assembly’s inaction keeps city streets dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists. A rally is planned to push for the bill’s passage.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cars win.</p><p class=mb3>On February 23, 2024, sixteen advocacy groups sent a letter to Governor Hochul, Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie. They condemned the use of Outer Borough Transit Account (OBTA) funds for toll rebates instead of transit improvements. The OBTA, created in 2018 from a surcharge on Manhattan taxi and for-hire rides, was meant to boost transit service or lower fares outside Manhattan. Yet, $22.2 million has gone to toll rebates for drivers in the Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island. Only one transit project—the Far Rockaway City Ticket—has seen funding. Riders Alliance Director Danny Pearlstein said, “The Outer Borough Transit Account should clearly also help the millions of people outside Manhattan who don't have cars and who depend on public transit.” Lawmakers have not responded. Vulnerable road users—bus riders, train passengers, pedestrians—remain sidelined as car subsidies persist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
