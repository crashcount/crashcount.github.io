A Mercedes changed lanes, hit a Volkswagen, then struck the riders. The driver, Mauricio Neyra Yuyes, was charged with vehicular manslaughter and driving while intoxicated. The NYPD said, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/bronx-river-parkway-accident-east-gun-hill-road/>&ldquo;The men were ejected from their scooters and fatally injured in the collision.&rdquo;</a> Seven vehicles tangled.

The dead are old and young: a 19-year-old, a 75-year-old, a 55-year-old, and more. Most never make the news.

The report states the impact folded steel and left a 37-year-old male driver with crush injuries to his back. He remained conscious at the scene. The police report lists 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' as a contributing factor, highlighting a critical driver error. The Nissan was parked at the time of the collision, and no other injuries were reported. The evidence in the report underscores the consequences of improper lane usage, as the SUV’s movement directly led to the severe injury of the sedan’s occupant. No victim actions are cited as contributing factors.

Jeremy Cooney, new chair of the Senate Transportation Committee, issued a public demand for Governor Hochul to deliver a '100-day plan' to replace the $16.5 billion MTA funding shortfall caused by her cancellation of congestion pricing. In his op-ed, Cooney wrote, 'the time for debating the merits of congestion pricing has passed,' urging the governor to convene finance, labor, and passenger representatives to find a solution. Cooney’s push comes as the MTA faces threats to station accessibility, signal upgrades, and new trains and buses. Other Albany leaders, including Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and Senate President Andrea Stewart-Cousins, have offered little response. Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger called Hochul’s move illegal. The bill or action is not numbered, but the committee involved is the Senate Transportation Committee. No direct safety analyst note was provided, but the loss of funding jeopardizes projects vital to vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The program, set to charge drivers $15 to enter Manhattan’s core, was expected to raise $15 billion for the MTA’s $55-billion capital plan. DiNapoli’s report, titled 'Loss of Congestion Pricing Revenue Leaves MTA With No Good Options,' warns that the MTA 'will be forced to put off badly needed investment in expansion and improvements to the system.' He stressed, 'Those choices will directly affect riders ... for years to come.' NYC Comptroller Brad Lander echoed support for congestion pricing, urging the governor to reconsider price points if it means moving forward. Activists plan to pressure the MTA board to resist the governor’s decision, citing the need to avoid transit cuts and deliver 'major traffic safety, air quality, and cost of living improvements for all New Yorkers.'

The street bore the brunt.</p><p class=mb3>At the intersection of East 233rd Street and Boston Road in the Bronx, two sport utility vehicles slammed into each other head-on, according to the police report. The report states both vehicles were involved in 'Turning Improperly.' One SUV, traveling east, was going straight ahead, while the other, traveling southwest, was making a left turn. The impact crushed the front ends of both vehicles. A 44-year-old male driver suffered severe lacerations to his lower arm and hand but remained conscious, as detailed in the police narrative: 'A 44-year-old man clutched the wheel, blood streaming from his arm. He did not lose consciousness.' The police report explicitly lists 'Turning Improperly' as the contributing factor for both drivers, underscoring driver error as the cause of the crash. No mention is made of any victim behavior contributing to the collision. The crash highlights the ongoing danger at intersections where driver actions can have immediate, violent consequences.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

On May 15, 2024, more than a dozen local officials sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, urging passage before session’s end in June. The letter, organized by Local Progress, states: 'This means projects that expanded cycling infrastructure, pedestrian walkways, and public transit were prioritized over outdated highway expansions and lane widening.' State Senator Andrew Gounardes sponsors the bill. Alex Marion, Syracuse city auditor, signed on, saying, 'If we can reduce the vehicle miles traveled, we can look at the space of streets differently.' The bill would force planners to consider car miles in every project, shifting focus from car movement to safer, people-first streets. The policy could help undo decades of harm from highways that split communities and reinforce segregation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

On May 15, 2024, a letter to Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins called for swift passage before the session ends in June. The letter states, 'The state Legislature should pass the law before the end of this session in June, which could pivot transportation funding toward more beneficial uses like mass transit and biking and walking infrastructure.' Stewart-Cousins is mentioned as a key recipient. The bill would force agencies to prioritize projects for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit riders over highway expansion.

The bill, long blocked by Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, finally moved forward under Governor Kathy Hochul’s push. The measure, described as 'a significant legislative achievement,' excludes roads outside Manhattan with three or more travel lanes in one direction—a concession to car-centric lawmakers. The law requires community board notification and comment, but their input is only advisory. Families of road violence victims and street safety advocates celebrated the win. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, Transportation Chair, conditioned her support on street redesigns in underserved neighborhoods. The law’s carve-out leaves many of the city’s deadliest roads unchanged, withholding proven safety benefits from major thoroughfares.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives called the decision a failure to join 'more than 130 unions, hospitals, business leaders, and community-led organizations that recognize the urgent need for this common-sense legislation.' The Assembly’s inaction keeps city streets dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists.

The OBTA, created in 2018 from a surcharge on Manhattan taxi and for-hire rides, was meant to boost transit service or lower fares outside Manhattan. Yet, $22.2 million has gone to toll rebates for drivers in the Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island. Only one transit project—the Far Rockaway City Ticket—has seen funding. Riders Alliance Director Danny Pearlstein said, “The Outer Borough Transit Account should clearly also help the millions of people outside Manhattan who don't have cars and who depend on public transit.” Lawmakers have not responded.
