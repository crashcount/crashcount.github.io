An SUV hit her. She died at Jacobi. The driver stayed. No charges. The street stayed the same. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/25/woman-78-fatally-struck-by-bronx-suv-driver/>The news told it straight</a>: “The victim was crossing White Plains Road at E. 216th St. in Williamsbridge when a 56-year-old woman driving north in a 2024 Toyota RAV4 hit her at about 10:20 p.m. Saturday, cops said.”</p><p>A coach stood outside his home. A BMW, a pickup, a chain of parked cars. Metal and glass. He was gone. His mother <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/08/bronx-bmw-driver-arrested-for-manslaughter-in-crash-that-killed-beloved-coach/>said, “These arrests cannot bring back my child.

Seven were left with injuries that change a life. Most were walking. Some were old, some young. Most were hit by cars or SUVs. The numbers do not stop. They do not care.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h2><p><strong>Assembly Member Carl Heastie holds the gavel.</strong> He has power. He has blocked and delayed bills that could have saved lives. In 2023, he ended the session without a vote on Sammy’s Law, which would have let the city lower speed limits. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/mother-of-crash-victim-on-failure-of-nyc-speed-limit-bill-albany-backroom-politics-at-its-worst>A mother called it &ldquo;Albany backroom politics at its worst.&rdquo;</a> Heastie said, “I am only one vote.” But he is the Speaker.

He signed on to a <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/05/15/new-york-pols-push-bill-to-cut-vehicle-miles-by-20>bill to cut car miles</a>. But the slow pace and the silence after each crash are louder than any press release.</p><h2 id=what-next-the-blood-is-still-fresh>What Next? The Blood Is Still Fresh</h2><p><strong>Every delay is another risk.</strong> Call Heastie. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement.

The law requires community board notification and comment, but their input is only advisory. Families of road violence victims and street safety advocates celebrated the win.

They condemned the use of Outer Borough Transit Account (OBTA) funds for toll rebates instead of transit improvements. The OBTA, created in 2018 from a surcharge on Manhattan taxi and for-hire rides, was meant to boost transit service or lower fares outside Manhattan. Yet, $22.2 million has gone to toll rebates for drivers in the Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island. Only one transit project—the Far Rockaway City Ticket—has seen funding. Riders Alliance Director Danny Pearlstein said, “The Outer Borough Transit Account should clearly also help the millions of people outside Manhattan who don't have cars and who depend on public transit.” Lawmakers have not responded. Vulnerable road users—bus riders, train passengers, pedestrians—remain sidelined as car subsidies persist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Committee: State legislature, with final approval by the Capital Program Review Board. The OBTA, created in 2018, collects a taxi surcharge as 'Phase I' of congestion pricing. The first $300 million funded subway repairs; the next $50 million now goes to projects chosen by state legislators and the governor. The bill summary notes, 'A special fund created in 2018 to pay for transportation 'carrots' intended to counteract the supposed stick of congestion pricing finally has a balance of tens of millions of dollars.' Assembly Member Nily Rozic (D-Queens) secured restored Q46 bus service. Lisa Daglian of the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the MTA called for a weekly City Ticket. Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance demanded better bus service, saying, 'The most important thing is better bus service.' The fund will shape how New Yorkers travel as congestion pricing nears.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, which would let New York City control its own speed limits, stalled last year when Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie refused to allow a vote, despite majority support. Brooklyn Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, a strong supporter, noted, 'Even [lawmakers] who had City Council members from their districts supporting the bill were still not interested.' Queens Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas, recently injured by a driver, said, 'Had the car been going faster ... I might not be here.' Amy Cohen of Families for Safe Streets highlighted broad support: 'We have organizations from across the city supporting Sammy’s Law.' City data shows a 36% drop in pedestrian deaths after the 2014 speed limit reduction.
