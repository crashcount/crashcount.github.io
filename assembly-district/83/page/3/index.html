An SUV hit her. She died at Jacobi. The driver stayed. No charges. The street stayed the same. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/25/woman-78-fatally-struck-by-bronx-suv-driver/>The news told it straight</a>: “The victim was crossing White Plains Road at E. 216th St. in Williamsbridge when a 56-year-old woman driving north in a 2024 Toyota RAV4 hit her at about 10:20 p.m. Saturday, cops said.”</p><p>A coach stood outside his home. A BMW, a pickup, a chain of parked cars. Metal and glass. He was gone. His mother <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/08/bronx-bmw-driver-arrested-for-manslaughter-in-crash-that-killed-beloved-coach/>said, “These arrests cannot bring back my child.

They do not care.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h2><p><strong>Assembly Member Carl Heastie holds the gavel.</strong> He has power. He has blocked and delayed bills that could have saved lives. In 2023, he ended the session without a vote on Sammy’s Law, which would have let the city lower speed limits. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/mother-of-crash-victim-on-failure-of-nyc-speed-limit-bill-albany-backroom-politics-at-its-worst>A mother called it &ldquo;Albany backroom politics at its worst.&rdquo;</a> Heastie said, “I am only one vote.” But he is the Speaker.

But the slow pace and the silence after each crash are louder than any press release.</p><h2 id=what-next-the-blood-is-still-fresh>What Next? The Blood Is Still Fresh</h2><p><strong>Every delay is another risk.</strong> Call Heastie. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement.

The Department of Transportation reports a 30 percent drop in violations since cameras began operating around the clock on August 1, 2022. The report states, 'Success: Drivers are Slowing Down on Streets with 24/7 Speed Cameras.' Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie is mentioned for opposing city control over speed limits, a move sought by Families for Safe Streets after continued traffic deaths and injuries. Key corridors saw sharp drops in speeding and injuries, but cyclist injuries remain high. The expanded camera program replaced limited weekday enforcement, shifting the burden from NYPD to automated systems. The data shows cameras work, but the fight for safer streets—especially for cyclists—remains unfinished.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, supported by Gov. Hochul, Mayor Adams, and the City Council, had already passed the Senate 55-7. Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie refused to bring it to a vote, despite majority support in the Assembly. Amy Cohen, co-founder of Families for Safe Streets, condemned Heastie, saying, 'There’s only one roadblock: Speaker Carl Heastie refusing to call a vote on a popular, life-saving bill.' Activists warned that more preventable deaths will follow if the Assembly does not act. The Assembly is expected to reconvene later in the month to address unfinished business, possibly including Sammy's Law.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Speaker Carl Heastie (District 83) has not called a floor vote as of June 9, 2023, despite the bill passing the State Senate. The bill, championed by advocates, would let New York City set 20-mile-per-hour speed limits on some streets. The matter summary states, 'Heastie has not called a floor vote on Sammy’s Law, which would allow New York City to set a 20-mile-per-hour speed limit on some streets.' Heastie’s state vehicle was caught speeding 12 times in school zones. He claims staffers were driving. Transportation Chair Bill Magnarelli suggested the bill’s fate might have changed if the City Council had acted sooner, a claim the Council disputes. Heastie’s spokesman said, 'He reminded them that the reason we passed the speed-camera legislation was to ensure the safety of students and the public, and that these violations are unacceptable.' No formal safety analyst note was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Assembly Member Bobby Carroll invited the mothers, but they were told to stay outside. Cohen said, 'It’s outrageous that we couldn't be recognized.' Mendieta-Cuapio called the hunger strike necessary.

Council Member Jen Gutierrez carried the resolution; Selvena Brooks-Powers later signed on. The bill targets corridors like Bushwick Avenue, Laurelton Parkway, and East Gun Hill Road—sites of hundreds of crashes and dozens killed or maimed since 2019. The matter summary states: 'Because people are dying and being maimed on New York's most-dangerous 25-mile-per-hour streets.' Supporters, including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, cite the science: lower speeds mean less force, fewer deaths. Research shows 20 mph zones cut crashes by 60 percent. The bill does not mandate, but allows, lower limits where carnage is highest. The council’s action centers the lives of pedestrians and cyclists, demanding the city act before more are lost.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Amy Cohen, a mother and advocate, demanded action, showing Heastie photos of victims. Seven new Assembly members, including Yudelka Tapia, Al Taylor, Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn, and Brian Cunningham, now back the bill, giving it majority support among NYC Assembly members.
