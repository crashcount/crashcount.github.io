The Department of Transportation (DOT) announced a 30 percent drop in violations on enforced corridors. The matter summary states, 'Success: Drivers are Slowing Down on Streets with 24/7 Speed Cameras.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called the expanded enforcement 'a highly effective tool to keep New Yorkers safe.' Key corridors saw dramatic reductions: 96 percent on Houston Street, 74 percent on North Conduit Boulevard, 68 percent on Bruckner Boulevard. Injuries fell at high-crash sites—45 percent on Tremont Avenue, 33 percent on Kings Highway, 16 percent on Queens Boulevard, 19 percent on Hylan Boulevard. Automated cameras issued over 3.7 million tickets, dwarfing police efforts. Despite progress, cyclist injuries are on pace for a record high, and advocates now push for city control over speed limits.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Senate passed it, but Speaker Carl Heastie did not bring it to a vote in the Assembly, despite 60 co-sponsors and strong support from city lawmakers, Governor Hochul, and Mayor Adams. The bill, named for 12-year-old Sammy Cohen Eckstein, killed by a speeding driver, would have allowed the city to lower most speed limits from 25 to 20 mph. Heastie cited concerns over e-bikes and speed bumps, saying, 'I'm not a dictator.' Advocates, including Sammy's mother Amy Cohen, condemned the move as 'Albany backroom politics at its worst.' The Department of Transportation called the bill vital for targeted street safety.

Andrew Gounardes, cite the science: lower speeds mean less force, fewer deaths. Research shows 20 mph zones cut crashes by 60 percent.

Their children killed by reckless drivers. They demand lawmakers let New York City set its own speed limits. The Assembly stalls. Grief and anger fill the halls. No more excuses. They want action. Now.</p><p class=mb3>On June 6, 2023, two mothers began a hunger strike at the State Capitol, demanding action on Sammy’s Law. The bill, first introduced in 2020 by State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal and carried in the Assembly by Linda Rosenthal, would let New York City set speed limits below 25 mph. The City Council backed the measure with a 'home rule' message last month. But Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie has not brought it to a vote. The matter title: 'Sammy’s Law.' Amy Cohen, whose son Sammy was killed in 2013, and Fabiola Mendieta-Cuapio, whose son Bryan was killed in 2006, lead the protest. Mendieta-Cuapio says, 'We need to pass Sammy's Law today, no more excuses.' Lawmakers hide behind closed doors. The mothers refuse to let their children’s deaths be ignored.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
