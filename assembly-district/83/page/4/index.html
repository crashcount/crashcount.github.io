A Mercedes changed lanes, hit a Volkswagen, then struck the riders. The driver, Mauricio Neyra Yuyes, was charged with vehicular manslaughter and driving while intoxicated. The NYPD said, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/bronx-river-parkway-accident-east-gun-hill-road/>&ldquo;The men were ejected from their scooters and fatally injured in the collision.&rdquo;</a> Seven vehicles tangled.

The dead are old and young: a 19-year-old, a 75-year-old, a 55-year-old, and more. Most never make the news.

The piece, referencing Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie (District 83), states: 'With no reliable standard, pot-impaired drivers a growing road hazard.' Lawmakers created a 'substantially impaired' threshold for DUI-cannabis, making lesser impairment only a traffic infraction. Drug recognition expert training has not kept pace with the rise in stoned drivers. Speaker Heastie cautioned against legislative 'overreach,' but the editorial argues leaders have failed to act. No committee or bill number is cited; this is a public statement, not legislation.

Albany debates, but time runs out. Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On May 13, 2022, Mayor Adams traveled to Albany to press lawmakers on his legislative priorities. The push included extending mayoral control of New York City’s public schools and, crucially, allowing speed cameras to operate 24/7. The matter summary states: 'Topping the list for Adams is extending mayoral control of the city’s public schools and allowing speed cameras on city streets to operate 24/7.' State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie were key figures in these talks. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez also lobbied for expanded speed camera authority. Despite Adams’s efforts, lawmakers showed little appetite for granting 'home rule'—the power for the city to control camera placement and hours. Advocates warn that restricting camera hours to weekdays, 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., leaves streets deadly at night. The legislative session neared its end with no breakthrough, leaving vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No new transit money. No tougher penalties. Riders left waiting. Drivers keep blocking. The city’s slowest buses stay slow. Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On March 15, 2022, the New York State Assembly and Senate released one-house budget proposals. Both left out Governor Hochul’s measures to increase fines for blocking bus lanes, raise penalties for toll evasion and defaced plates, and boost transit funding. The matter: 'State legislators used their budget proposals to prioritize drivers blocking bus lanes and evading tolls, omitting Gov. Hochul's proposals to raise fines for blocking bus lanes and increase penalties for toll evasion and defaced license plates.' Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie defended stripping policy from the budget. Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein slammed the move: 'No increase in subway or bus service for millions of riders, no enhanced enforcement in the city with the slowest buses in the country.' The Senate promised to revisit bus lane enforcement later. Advocates doubted action would follow. The legislature’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed, with no relief from blocked bus lanes or reckless drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
