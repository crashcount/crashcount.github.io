Twenty-three left with serious injuries.</strong> More than 1,700 hurt since 2022. The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross the road. A 78-year-old woman was struck by an SUV on White Plains Road. She died at Jacobi. The driver stayed. No charges. The street stayed the same. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/25/woman-78-fatally-struck-by-bronx-suv-driver/>reporting</a></p><p>A coach, Dwight Downer, stood outside his home. A BMW, a chain-reaction, parked cars, and then him. His mother <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/08/bronx-bmw-driver-arrested-for-manslaughter-in-crash-that-killed-beloved-coach/>said</a>, <strong>&ldquo;These arrests cannot bring back my child. Still, something has to be done.&rdquo;</strong></p><h2 id=the-numbers-that-dont-lie>The Numbers That Don’t Lie</h2><p><strong>Four deaths in the last year.</strong> Over 500 injured. Serious injuries doubled. The dead are mostly older. The killers are mostly cars and SUVs. In three years, SUVs alone killed five and left dozens bleeding. Trucks, sedans, mopeds—they all take their share. The numbers are not just numbers. They are mothers, fathers, children, neighbors.</p><h2 id=carl-heastie-power-delay-and-the-fight-for-change>Carl Heastie: Power, Delay, and the Fight for Change</h2><p>Carl Heastie holds the gavel in Albany. For years, he blocked the bill that would let New York City lower its own speed limits. He told a grieving mother, <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/mother-of-crash-victim-on-failure-of-nyc-speed-limit-bill-albany-backroom-politics-at-its-worst>&ldquo;I am only one vote.&rdquo;</a> The bill died. The bodies piled up. Only in 2024 did the Assembly move, passing laws to expand red light cameras and finally giving the city speed control. But the delay cost lives. The cameras are coming, but the streets are not yet safe.</p><p>Heastie has backed bills to cut driving and expand enforcement. But he has also let safety bills stall. The work is not done. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>Call Carl Heastie. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that do not kill.</strong> The street will not change itself. The dead cannot speak.

Lawmakers set a high bar for prosecution. Training lags. Speaker Carl Heastie warns against overreach. Meanwhile, vulnerable road users face rising risk from unchecked stoned drivers.</p><p class=mb3>On April 24, 2023, an editorial criticized New York’s lack of a reliable standard for cannabis-impaired driving. The piece, referencing Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie (District 83), states: 'With no reliable standard, pot-impaired drivers a growing road hazard.' Lawmakers created a 'substantially impaired' threshold for DUI-cannabis, making lesser impairment only a traffic infraction. Drug recognition expert training has not kept pace with the rise in stoned drivers. Speaker Heastie cautioned against legislative 'overreach,' but the editorial argues leaders have failed to act. No committee or bill number is cited; this is a public statement, not legislation. The absence of clear enforcement standards leaves pedestrians, cyclists, and passengers exposed to drivers whose impairment goes unchecked.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, named for Sammy Cohen Eckstein, killed by a reckless driver in 2013, has stalled in Albany despite mounting pressure. Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez introduced a resolution urging passage, co-sponsored by Shahana Hanif and Lincoln Restler. Adams, however, said, 'We’re going to let the state do what the state does in response to Sammy’s Law,' and focused on other budget priorities. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, chair of the Transportation Committee, called for pairing lower speed limits with street redesigns in neglected neighborhoods. As children and cyclists die in record numbers, the council’s inaction leaves vulnerable New Yorkers at risk. The law would not lower limits automatically, but grant the city authority to act.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Transit advocates and MTA officials argued that expanded enforcement would benefit riders and make buses more attractive. Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance criticized the Assembly, saying, 'If the state budget ignores the financial impact of slow buses on riders and our families... the people's house will have failed actual people.'

The push included extending mayoral control of New York City’s public schools and, crucially, allowing speed cameras to operate 24/7. The matter summary states: 'Topping the list for Adams is extending mayoral control of the city’s public schools and allowing speed cameras on city streets to operate 24/7.' State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie were key figures in these talks. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez also lobbied for expanded speed camera authority. Despite Adams’s efforts, lawmakers showed little appetite for granting 'home rule'—the power for the city to control camera placement and hours. Advocates warn that restricting camera hours to weekdays, 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., leaves streets deadly at night. The legislative session neared its end with no breakthrough, leaving vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
