An SUV hit her. She died at Jacobi. The driver stayed. No charges. The street stayed the same. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/25/woman-78-fatally-struck-by-bronx-suv-driver/>The news told it straight</a>: “The victim was crossing White Plains Road at E. 216th St. in Williamsbridge when a 56-year-old woman driving north in a 2024 Toyota RAV4 hit her at about 10:20 p.m. Saturday, cops said.”</p><p>A coach stood outside his home. A BMW, a pickup, a chain of parked cars. Metal and glass. He was gone. His mother <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/08/bronx-bmw-driver-arrested-for-manslaughter-in-crash-that-killed-beloved-coach/>said, “These arrests cannot bring back my child.

They do not care.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h2><p><strong>Assembly Member Carl Heastie holds the gavel.</strong> He has power. He has blocked and delayed bills that could have saved lives. In 2023, he ended the session without a vote on Sammy’s Law, which would have let the city lower speed limits. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/mother-of-crash-victim-on-failure-of-nyc-speed-limit-bill-albany-backroom-politics-at-its-worst>A mother called it &ldquo;Albany backroom politics at its worst.&rdquo;</a> Heastie said, “I am only one vote.” But he is the Speaker.

But the slow pace and the silence after each crash are louder than any press release.</p><h2 id=what-next-the-blood-is-still-fresh>What Next? The Blood Is Still Fresh</h2><p><strong>Every delay is another risk.</strong> Call Heastie. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement.

The piece, referencing Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie (District 83), states: 'With no reliable standard, pot-impaired drivers a growing road hazard.' Lawmakers created a 'substantially impaired' threshold for DUI-cannabis, making lesser impairment only a traffic infraction. Drug recognition expert training has not kept pace with the rise in stoned drivers. Speaker Heastie cautioned against legislative 'overreach,' but the editorial argues leaders have failed to act. No committee or bill number is cited; this is a public statement, not legislation. The absence of clear enforcement standards leaves pedestrians, cyclists, and passengers exposed to drivers whose impairment goes unchecked.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, named for Sammy Cohen Eckstein, killed by a reckless driver in 2013, has stalled in Albany despite mounting pressure. Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez introduced a resolution urging passage, co-sponsored by Shahana Hanif and Lincoln Restler. Adams, however, said, 'We’re going to let the state do what the state does in response to Sammy’s Law,' and focused on other budget priorities. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, chair of the Transportation Committee, called for pairing lower speed limits with street redesigns in neglected neighborhoods. As children and cyclists die in record numbers, the council’s inaction leaves vulnerable New Yorkers at risk. The law would not lower limits automatically, but grant the city authority to act.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Heastie's spokesman, Mike Whyland, said, 'We generally did not include policy in our proposal.' Transit advocates and MTA officials argued that expanded enforcement would benefit riders and make buses more attractive. Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance criticized the Assembly, saying, 'If the state budget ignores the financial impact of slow buses on riders and our families... the people's house will have failed actual people.'

The impact left him semiconscious and bleeding, with injuries across his entire body. The police report lists 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Aggressive Driving/Road Rage' as contributing factors. The driver’s actions—speeding and aggression—created the danger.

He pushes for round-the-clock speed cameras and mayoral control of schools. Lawmakers stall. Streets stay dangerous at night. Advocates say limited camera hours fuel reckless driving. Albany debates, but time runs out. Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On May 13, 2022, Mayor Adams traveled to Albany to press lawmakers on his legislative priorities. The push included extending mayoral control of New York City’s public schools and, crucially, allowing speed cameras to operate 24/7. The matter summary states: 'Topping the list for Adams is extending mayoral control of the city’s public schools and allowing speed cameras on city streets to operate 24/7.' State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie were key figures in these talks. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez also lobbied for expanded speed camera authority. Despite Adams’s efforts, lawmakers showed little appetite for granting 'home rule'—the power for the city to control camera placement and hours. Advocates warn that restricting camera hours to weekdays, 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., leaves streets deadly at night. The legislative session neared its end with no breakthrough, leaving vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, she was in a marked crosswalk when a westbound SUV turned left and struck her head with its front bumper. She suffered internal injuries and died at the scene. The report lists 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as the contributing factor. The driver, a 32-year-old man, was licensed and uninjured. No other injuries were reported. The woman was crossing with no signal present, but the police report centers the driver's failure to yield as the cause of the crash.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

No new transit money. No tougher penalties. Riders left waiting. Drivers keep blocking. The city’s slowest buses stay slow. Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On March 15, 2022, the New York State Assembly and Senate released one-house budget proposals. Both left out Governor Hochul’s measures to increase fines for blocking bus lanes, raise penalties for toll evasion and defaced plates, and boost transit funding. The matter: 'State legislators used their budget proposals to prioritize drivers blocking bus lanes and evading tolls, omitting Gov. Hochul's proposals to raise fines for blocking bus lanes and increase penalties for toll evasion and defaced license plates.' Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie defended stripping policy from the budget. Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein slammed the move: 'No increase in subway or bus service for millions of riders, no enhanced enforcement in the city with the slowest buses in the country.' The Senate promised to revisit bus lane enforcement later. Advocates doubted action would follow. The legislature’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed, with no relief from blocked bus lanes or reckless drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
