Since 2022, eight people have died and 2,448 have been injured in crashes. Twelve were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The dead include elders, workers, and those just trying to cross the street. Just this April, a 62-year-old man was killed crossing Linden Boulevard near his home. A driver hit him and fled. A second car struck him again. His family said, <em>&ldquo;Today is a sad day. We lost a brother, father, son, uncle, and cousin. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/30/man-62-killed-in-front-of-his-queens-home-by-hit-and-run-driver-second-motorist/>He has been snuffed from us by a hit and runner driver.</a>&rdquo;</em></p><h2 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt</h2><p>The numbers are cold. SUVs and cars caused the most harm—three deaths, 298 minor injuries, 85 moderate, two serious. Trucks and buses added more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left their own scars. The pain is not spread evenly. Children, elders, and people on foot pay the highest price. A pedestrian hit at 30 mph is five times more likely to die than at 20.</p><h2 id=leadership-progress-and-pitfalls>Leadership: Progress and Pitfalls</h2><p>Assembly Member Vivian Cook has voted to extend and expand school speed cameras, a step that protects children and those walking near schools (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>supported speed cameras</a>). Cook also backed funding for safer street designs and driver education. But not every vote has favored the most vulnerable. Cook voted to weaken bus rules, increasing risk for people on foot and bike.</p><p>The work is not done. &ldquo;He was just crossing the street to get home,&rdquo; a relative <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/30/man-62-killed-in-front-of-his-queens-home-by-hit-and-run-driver-second-motorist/>said of the man killed on Linden Boulevard</a>. The street did not forgive him for being slow, or for needing a cane.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p>Every crash is preventable. Every death is a policy choice. The city now has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. Cameras can catch speeders, but only if the law is enforced. Advocates must demand more: call Assembly Member Cook, demand a 20 mph limit, and push for laws that protect people, not just cars. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a warning.</p><p>Act now. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
