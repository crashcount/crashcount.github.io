He never made it home. One driver hit him and fled. Another struck him again. His family said, &ldquo;Today is a sad day. We lost a brother, father, son, uncle, and cousin. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/30/man-62-killed-in-front-of-his-queens-home-by-hit-and-run-driver-second-motorist/>He has been snuffed from us by a hit and runner driver</a>.&rdquo;</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>three people died and 711 were injured</strong> in crashes across Assembly District 32. Five suffered serious injuries. Children were not spared: <strong>76 kids were hurt</strong>. The numbers do not slow. In the first five months of this year, <strong>two more people died</strong> and 319 were injured. The disaster moves block by block, day by day.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>Mamadou Barry drove nights to care for his children by day. He died when his SUV crashed into a garage on 90th Avenue. His cousin said, &ldquo;That is a big loss for us. He was a caregiver. That&rsquo;s very, very tough for us&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/01/22/uber-driver-died-queens-crash-worked-nights-spend-days-kids/>according to the NY Daily News</a>.</p><p>The dead are not numbers. They are fathers, mothers, children. The street does not care. SUVs, sedans, trucks—they strike and move on. In the past three years, <strong>SUVs and cars killed two pedestrians and seriously injured two more</strong>. Trucks and buses added to the toll. No bike killed anyone.</p><h3 id=leadership-what-has-vivian-cook-done>Leadership: What Has Vivian Cook Done?</h3><p>Assembly Member Vivian Cook voted <strong>yes</strong> on a bill to bring speed cameras to school zones in Schenectady, a step for safety—but not for her own district <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">according to Open States</a>. There is no record of Cook leading or speaking out for more speed cameras, lower speed limits, or street redesigns in AD 32. The silence is loud. The streets remain dangerous.</p><h3 id=what-next-demand-action>What Next? Demand Action</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> Call Assembly Member Cook. Demand speed cameras for Queens, not just Schenectady. Demand lower speed limits. Demand streets built for people, not just cars. The dead cannot speak.
