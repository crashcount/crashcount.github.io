The street is quiet, then it isn’t. Eight people have died on these roads since 2022. More than 2,600 have been hurt. Fourteen were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. These numbers are not just statistics. They are fathers, daughters, neighbors.</p><p>Just this spring, a man with a cane tried to cross Linden Boulevard. He never made it home. A driver hit him and kept going. Another car struck him again. His family said, &ldquo;Today is a sad day. We lost a brother, father, son, uncle, and cousin. [He] has been snuffed from us by a hit and runner driver.&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/30/man-62-killed-in-front-of-his-queens-home-by-hit-and-run-driver-second-motorist/>NY Daily News</a>). The street swallowed him. The city moved on.</p><p>A year before, a 14-year-old girl named Fortune Williams died in a BMW going over 100 mph. The driver was a teenager with no license. His parents gave him the keys. &ldquo;I wish they would never have given him that car&mldr; because if they didn&rsquo;t give him that car, my daughter would still be here right now,&rdquo; her mother <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/queens-teen-sentenced-to-up-to-4-years-for-fatal-crash-with-14-year-old-girl>said</a>.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-speed-inattention-and-no-consequences>The Pattern: Speed, Inattention, and No Consequences</h3><p>SUVs and cars do most of the harm. They killed three people and hurt more than 400 since 2022. Trucks and buses injured dozens more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll. The streets are not safe for anyone on foot or on two wheels.</p><p>The pattern is clear. Speed. Inattention. Drivers who do not stop. Victims who do not get up. The city’s most vulnerable—children, elders, people just crossing the street—pay the price.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-for-cameras-but-loopholes-remain>Leadership: Votes for Cameras, But Loopholes Remain</h3><p>Assembly Member Vivian Cook has <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted to extend and expand school speed cameras</a>. She backed funding for safer street designs and better driver education. But she also voted to weaken bus lane rules, making it easier for some to break the law and put others at risk.</p><p>Cameras catch speeders, but the law still lets repeat offenders drive. The most dangerous drivers rack up tickets and keep their keys. The streets stay deadly. The cycle repeats.</p><h3 id=the-call-demand-more-than-words>The Call: Demand More Than Words</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call Assembly Member Cook. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real penalties for repeat speeders. Demand streets built for people, not just cars. Do not wait for another family to grieve.</p><p>Act now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Sponsored by Senator Andrew Gounardes, the bill passed Senate votes on June 12 and June 13, and cleared the Assembly on June 17. The measure extends and corrects school speed zone laws in New York City, repealing outdated provisions. Gounardes led the push, with strong support from most Senate Democrats and a split Assembly.
