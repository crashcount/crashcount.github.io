Thirty-six left with injuries so grave they are called serious.</strong> More than 3,000 hurt since 2022. The dead include children, elders, and those just trying to cross the street. The living carry scars.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a motorcyclist was killed at Flatbush Avenue and Avenue U. The FDNY called it an &ldquo;incident under investigation,&rdquo; as <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/motorcyclist-killed-crash-fire-truck-marine-park-brooklyn/16551852/>reported by ABC7</a>. The pain is not abstract. It is a body on the road, a family waiting at the hospital.</p><p>Cyclists are not spared. On the Marine Parkway Bridge, riders keep running into a string stretched across the path. One cyclist <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/bicyclists-keep-getting-hurt-riding-into-mystery-string-on-marine-parkway-bridge>described the pain</a>: &ldquo;I felt pain, but I didn&rsquo;t know what it was and there was nobody around me.&rdquo; Another <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/incredible-amount-of-blood-but-nypd-finds-no-crime-after-string-slices-bicyclists-on-bridge>recalled</a> &ldquo;an incredible amount of blood&rdquo; and the unforgettable look of someone who &ldquo;just had their throat cut.&rdquo; The NYPD has found no crime. The danger remains.</p><h3 id=the-record-of-leadership>The Record of Leadership</h3><p>Assembly Member Jaime Williams has <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted to extend school speed zones and expand speed cameras</a>. She <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored bills to require safer street designs</a>. She has also voted to weaken bus rules, a move that puts pedestrians and cyclists at greater risk. When the city needed more speed cameras, she <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=S5602&amp;term=2021">voted no</a>.</p><p>Williams <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/bk-pols-rally-revival-congestion-pricing/>stood with other Brooklyn politicians to condemn congestion pricing</a>, calling it unfair to transit deserts. But the cars keep coming. The bodies keep falling.</p><h3 id=the-next-steps>The Next Steps</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day the speed limit stays high, every day enforcement is weak, another family waits for a call that never should come.</p><p><strong>Call Assembly Member Jaime Williams. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real street redesigns. Demand action, not excuses.</strong></p><p>The dead cannot speak.
