Thirty-two left with serious injuries.</strong> In three years, nearly 4,000 crashes tore through these Brooklyn streets. The dead include children, elders, riders, walkers. A baby struck in a crosswalk. An old man crushed at the curb. A motorcyclist’s helmet left behind at Flatbush and Avenue U. The city records the names, then moves on. The street stays the same.</p><h2 id=the-leaders-and-their-record>The Leaders and Their Record</h2><p>Assembly Member Jaime Williams has signed on to bills that promise safer streets. Twice, she co-sponsored measures to require <strong>complete street design</strong>—sidewalks, bike lanes, crossings for all users. The bills sit in Albany, waiting for a vote. The language is clear: &ldquo;every user deserves safe passage.&rdquo; <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">File A 1077</a> But the streets do not change. The blood dries. The next crash comes.</p><p>When it came time to vote on a bill for <strong>school speed cameras</strong>—the kind proven to catch drivers who speed past children—Williams voted no. The bill passed anyway. The summary is blunt: &ldquo;Establishes a school speed zone camera demonstration program in the city of Schenectady.&rdquo; <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">File A 7652</a></p><p>Williams has also stood with those who call congestion pricing unfair, but has not offered a plan to protect the children and elders who walk and bike in her district. <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/bk-pols-rally-revival-congestion-pricing/>rallied against congestion pricing</a></p><h2 id=the-call-for-action>The Call for Action</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by those in power. The city has the tools—lower speed limits, speed cameras, street redesigns. The Assembly can pass laws that force the city to act. But action does not come without pressure.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t pursue the vehicle, we strategically radioed ahead to shut down traffic&mldr;&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-nypd-shooting-ny-attorney-general-investigating-man-killed-during-attempt-stop-suspected-stolen-car/16298053/>said NYPD Chief John Chell</a>.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The FDNY says the &lsquo;incident is under investigation.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/motorcyclist-killed-crash-fire-truck-marine-park-brooklyn/16551852/>reported ABC7</a>.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Call your Assembly Member. Call your Council Member. Demand lower speed limits, more cameras, and streets built for people, not just cars.</strong> The dead cannot speak.
