The turning bus struck the parked vehicle with its right front bumper, colliding with the left rear of the other bus. The report cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor. A 70-year-old woman, seated in the rear of one bus, suffered head trauma and crush injuries. She was not wearing a seat belt, but the police report attributes the crash to driver inattention, not passenger behavior. The narrative describes metal shrieking and blood marking the seat as silence filled the aisle. The sequence of events underscores the danger when drivers lose focus behind the wheel, especially in vehicles carrying vulnerable passengers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
