Thirty-five left with injuries so severe they change a life.</strong> In just the last year, five more dead, twelve more seriously hurt. The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie.</p><p>A child, struck and killed crossing Avenue L in January. A 66-year-old man, dead at Rockaway Parkway and Seaview Avenue. A motorcyclist, thirty years old, collides with a fire truck at Flatbush and Avenue U. The FDNY says the <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/motorcyclist-killed-crash-fire-truck-marine-park-brooklyn/16551852/>&ldquo;incident is under investigation&rdquo;</a>. The street is quiet again.

She backed the extension of school speed zones, a move to protect children and the vulnerable. She co-sponsored bills to require <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">complete street designs</a>. She voted to expand speed cameras near schools. These are steps in the right direction.</p><p>But Williams also voted to weaken bus rules, a change that puts pedestrians and cyclists at greater risk. She voted against expanding speed camera hours in 2022. She stood with those who called congestion pricing unfair, even as the toll of traffic violence rose. The record is mixed. The need is not.</p><h3 id=the-road-ahead-what-you-can-do>The Road Ahead: What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call Assembly Member Williams. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat speeders. Join <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Stand with those who have lost. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p><p><strong>The street remembers.
