NYPD coded the crash as a failure to yield.

The impact left a 51-year-old woman, riding as a front passenger, bleeding from the head with crush injuries. A 46-year-old woman, driving one of the vehicles, suffered crush injuries to her leg and was pinned in the wreck. Both victims remained conscious at the scene. The report lists 'Other Vehicular' as the contributing factor for all vehicles involved, calling attention to unspecified driver actions or systemic vehicular failures. No evidence in the report points to any error or contributing behavior by the injured women. The crash unfolded in darkness, and the violence of the impact left both victims wounded and trapped, underscoring the persistent dangers facing vehicle occupants on New York City streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
