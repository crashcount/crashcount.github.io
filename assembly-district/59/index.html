NYPD coded the crash as a failure to yield. She died at the scene (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>She is one of <strong>17 people</strong> killed on these streets since 2022. At least <strong>10 were pedestrians</strong>.

The body count climbs after dark and does not stop.</p><p>The danger clusters. The <strong>Belt Parkway</strong> is a slaughter line: <strong>5 deaths and 529 injuries</strong> tied to that corridor. <strong>Avenue L</strong> also stands out, with a death and dozens hurt (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>—</p><h3 id=speed-and-turning-the-pattern-repeats>Speed and turning.

On Avenue L, NYPD logged the deadly strike as a <strong>left‑turn failure to yield</strong>. Different corners. Same result.</p><p>Cyclists have been cut down by hazards that never should have been there. On the Marine Parkway Bridge path, riders hit invisible string stretched across the way. “It’s absolutely dangerous and unacceptable,” said community leader Danny Mundy (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/incredible-amount-of-blood-but-nypd-finds-no-crime-after-string-slices-bicyclists-on-bridge>Gothamist</a>).</p><p>—</p><h3 id=the-record-shows-who-acts--and-who-stalls>The record shows who acts — and who stalls</h3><p>Assembly Member <strong>Jaime Williams</strong> co‑sponsored complete‑streets bills <strong><a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">A 1077</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1280&amp;term=2023">A 1280</a></strong>.

Target evening hours. Protect the bridge path where riders keep getting hurt.</p><p>Citywide, two steps will save lives on every block: lower default speeds and force repeat speeders’ cars to obey the limit. The path to those fights starts here.</p><p>One woman died crossing Avenue L. That is the whole story. It repeats until someone stops it.</p><p>Take one step now. Tell City Hall and Albany to slow our streets and rein in repeat speeders.
