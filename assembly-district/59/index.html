Thirty-five left with injuries so severe they change a life.</strong> In just the last year, five more dead, twelve more seriously hurt. The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie.</p><p>A child, struck and killed crossing Avenue L in January. A 66-year-old man, dead at Rockaway Parkway and Seaview Avenue. A motorcyclist, thirty years old, collides with a fire truck at Flatbush and Avenue U. The FDNY says the <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/motorcyclist-killed-crash-fire-truck-marine-park-brooklyn/16551852/>&ldquo;incident is under investigation&rdquo;</a>. The street is quiet again.

She backed the extension of school speed zones, a move to protect children and the vulnerable. She co-sponsored bills to require <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">complete street designs</a>. She voted to expand speed cameras near schools. These are steps in the right direction.</p><p>But Williams also voted to weaken bus rules, a change that puts pedestrians and cyclists at greater risk. She voted against expanding speed camera hours in 2022. She stood with those who called congestion pricing unfair, even as the toll of traffic violence rose. The record is mixed. The need is not.</p><h3 id=the-road-ahead-what-you-can-do>The Road Ahead: What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call Assembly Member Williams. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat speeders. Join <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Stand with those who have lost. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p><p><strong>The street remembers.

The collision occurred at 7:35 p.m. and left the boy with crush injuries to his legs. The report states, 'A 14-year-old boy on an e-scooter, no helmet, struck by a speeding sedan. The car’s right bumper crushed his legs. He stayed awake. Blood pooled on the street where his ride ended.' The police report explicitly cites 'Unsafe Speed' as the contributing factor in the crash. The sedan’s right front bumper was the point of impact, matching the boy’s lower leg injuries. The report notes the boy was not wearing a helmet, but this is listed after the driver’s error of unsafe speed. The focus remains on the driver’s excessive speed, which led directly to the severe injuries suffered by the vulnerable e-scooter rider.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Metal shrieked. A 19-year-old passenger flew from the bike, head smashing the pavement. Blood pooled. The car’s nose crumpled. The bike twisted, broken. Streets bear the mark of impact.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a sedan traveling west on Avenue M collided broadside with an e-bike heading south. The crash occurred at 15:27. The report states the sedan failed to yield the right-of-way, resulting in the impact. A 19-year-old male passenger on the e-bike was ejected, suffering a head injury and severe bleeding after striking the pavement. The narrative describes blood pooling on the asphalt, the car’s front end crumpled, and the e-bike’s rear twisted and broken. The police report lists 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as the primary contributing factor. The injured passenger was not wearing a helmet, as noted in the report, but this detail follows the driver’s error. The collision underscores the lethal consequences when drivers disregard right-of-way, leaving vulnerable road users exposed to devastating harm.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
