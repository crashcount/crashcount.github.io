An old man, 66, struck crossing Rockaway Parkway. A motorcyclist, 30, dead after colliding with a fire truck at Flatbush and Avenue U. In the last twelve months, five people died and thirteen suffered serious injuries in Assembly District 59. Nine hundred twenty-one were hurt. The numbers do not flinch.

But when it came time to vote for a bill to <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">put speed cameras near schools</a>, Williams voted no. The bill passed anyway.

This is policy. Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call Jaime Williams. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras in every school zone.
