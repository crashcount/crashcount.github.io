Twenty-two seriously injured. Over 2,500 hurt since 2022.</strong> Each number is a name, a family, a life cut short or changed forever. The streets of Jamaica, South Jamaica, St. Albans, Hollis, Laurelton, and Rosedale have become a gauntlet for the old and the young alike.</p><p><strong>Just weeks ago, two people on a moped collided with a BMW in Jamaica.</strong> The NYPD said, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-injured-in-moped-accident-in-jamaica-queens/>&ldquo;two people were riding the moped when it collided with a BMW.&rdquo;</a> No word on charges.
