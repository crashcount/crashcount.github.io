Death clusters after dark. <strong>Two at 2 a.m.</strong> <strong>Two at 3 a.m.</strong> Another at 8 p.m., and <strong>two at 9 p.m.</strong> Injuries peak after school hours and into evening: 3 p.m. shows 200 injuries; 4 p.m. shows 199.

Distraction adds bruises and broken bones.</p><p>Heavy vehicles matter, but the main force is everyday driving. Cars and SUVs account for the bulk of pedestrian harm here: 455 pedestrian crashes with 3 deaths and 14 serious injuries tied to passenger vehicles. Trucks and buses show 29, with 1 death and 1 serious injury.</p><h3 id=the-hours-we-lose-them>The hours we lose them</h3><p>Look at noon: 2 deaths and 108 injuries. Look at 9 p.m.: 151 injuries and a death. The late night spikes are worse: 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. hold four deaths together. That is when families wake to knocks on doors.</p><h3 id=fix-the-streets-that-kill>Fix the streets that kill</h3><p>Start where the numbers scream. Daylight the corners and harden turns on <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Hillside Avenue</a>. Add leading pedestrian intervals and raised crossings on the Hillside spine and at Linden Boulevard and 166th Street. Put speed control and median barriers along <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Laurelton Parkway</a> where people keep dying.</p><p>Target the peak hours.

Assembly Member Alicia Hyndman voted yes. The bill “extends provisions and makes technical corrections to school speed zones in NYC,” keeping protections for children near schools <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>in place</a>.</p><p>The city has the power to set lower speeds. It can use it. A citywide 20 mph default, coupled with 24/7 enforcement, would cut the force of every crash. The worst repeat speeders need brakes they cannot ignore. The proposed Stop Super Speeders law would make drivers with extreme ticket records use intelligent speed assistance. These steps are laid out in our <a href=/take_action/>Take Action page</a>.</p><h3 id=what-now>What now</h3><p>The deaths are not random. They are mapped, dated, and named. <strong>AD 29: 10 dead. 2,764 injured.</strong> Start on Hillside. Start on Laurelton. Do the simple things. Slow the cars. Save the next person.</p><p>Take one step today. Tell City Hall to slow the streets and back the state bill to rein in repeat speeders.
