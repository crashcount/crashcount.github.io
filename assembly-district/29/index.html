Twenty-two seriously injured. Over 2,500 hurt since 2022.</strong> Each number is a name, a family, a life cut short or changed forever. The streets of Jamaica, South Jamaica, St. Albans, Hollis, Laurelton, and Rosedale have become a gauntlet for the old and the young alike.</p><p><strong>Just weeks ago, two people on a moped collided with a BMW in Jamaica.</strong> The NYPD said, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-injured-in-moped-accident-in-jamaica-queens/>&ldquo;two people were riding the moped when it collided with a BMW.&rdquo;</a> No word on charges.

The white Toyota sedan hit an underpass near 225th Street around 3:50 a.m. Both occupants were found outside the wreck when police arrived. Investigators are unsure who was driving at the time of impact: 'Since both occupants were out of the car at the time of the crash, investigators haven't figured out who was driving, police said.' The woman died at Long Island Jewish Hospital-Valley Stream; the man was expected to survive. The article highlights ongoing uncertainty about driver identity and underscores the persistent risks on city highways, especially where loss of vehicle control leads to deadly outcomes.
