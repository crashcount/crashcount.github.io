A 21‑year‑old driver died there on <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Dec. 25, 2024</a>; the record lists unsafe speed.</p><p>On <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Hillside Avenue at 171st Street on May 31, 2024</a>, a 56‑year‑old man was killed while crossing without a signal. The SUV was “going straight ahead.” He never made it across.</p><h3 id=nights-and-arterials>Nights and arterials</h3><p>The clock tells its own tale. Death clusters after dark. <strong>Two at 2 a.m.</strong> <strong>Two at 3 a.m.</strong> Another at 8 p.m., and <strong>two at 9 p.m.</strong> Injuries peak after school hours and into evening: 3 p.m. shows 200 injuries; 4 p.m. shows 199. These are the hours when speed and size win.</p><p>Pedestrians pay most. Since 2022, pedestrians account for <strong>4 of the 10 deaths</strong> and 492 injuries. Cars and SUVs are the chief source of harm to people on foot: sedans alone are tied to 220 pedestrian injuries with 1 death; SUVs to 163 with 2 deaths. Trucks are smaller in number but still took a life.</p><h3 id=a-moped-a-bus-a-teenager>A moped, a bus, a teenager</h3><p>On <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Aug. 7, 2023, at 168th Street and 89th Avenue</a>, an 18‑year‑old on a moped hit a bus and died. The record notes ejection and severe bleeding. No helmet listed. No charges listed. Just a time, a place, and a body.</p><p>Two riders on a moped were hurt in Jamaica on June 29, 2025. The NYPD said, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-injured-in-moped-accident-in-jamaica-queens/>“two people were riding the moped when it collided with a BMW.”</a> No cause given. The riders went to the hospital.</p><h3 id=linden-boulevard-hit-flee-then-run-over>Linden Boulevard: hit, flee, then run over</h3><p>At Linden Boulevard and 166th Street, a 62‑year‑old man was struck by an eastbound black vehicle that fled, then run over by a Ford Edge. He died the next day. Police said they are <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/queens/man-killed-after-hit-run-crash-queens-police-say>“still searching for the first driver who fled the scene.”</a> The second driver stayed.</p><h3 id=what-drives-the-harm>What drives the harm</h3><p>The district’s roll‑up points to the same culprits. “Other” driver behavior sits atop the chart: 4 deaths, 825 injuries, 27 serious. Vulnerable road user error is tied to 2 deaths and 73 injuries. Disregarded traffic control shows 1 death and 21 injuries. Alcohol shows another death. Failure to yield injures and maims. Distraction adds bruises and broken bones.</p><p>Heavy vehicles matter, but the main force is everyday driving. Cars and SUVs account for the bulk of pedestrian harm here: 455 pedestrian crashes with 3 deaths and 14 serious injuries tied to passenger vehicles. Trucks and buses show 29, with 1 death and 1 serious injury.</p><h3 id=the-hours-we-lose-them>The hours we lose them</h3><p>Look at noon: 2 deaths and 108 injuries. Look at 9 p.m.: 151 injuries and a death. The late night spikes are worse: 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. hold four deaths together. That is when families wake to knocks on doors.</p><h3 id=fix-the-streets-that-kill>Fix the streets that kill</h3><p>Start where the numbers scream. Daylight the corners and harden turns on <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Hillside Avenue</a>. Add leading pedestrian intervals and raised crossings on the Hillside spine and at Linden Boulevard and 166th Street. Put speed control and median barriers along <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Laurelton Parkway</a> where people keep dying.</p><p>Target the peak hours. Evening operations where the injuries pile up: 3 p.m. to 9 p.m. Night patrols at 2 and 3 a.m., when the deaths hit.</p><h3 id=citywide-tools-that-would-save-lives-here>Citywide tools that would save lives here</h3><p>Albany extended school speed‑zone protections this June. Assembly Member Alicia Hyndman voted yes. The bill “extends provisions and makes technical corrections to school speed zones in NYC,” keeping protections for children near schools <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>in place</a>.</p><p>The city has the power to set lower speeds. It can use it. A citywide 20 mph default, coupled with 24/7 enforcement, would cut the force of every crash. The worst repeat speeders need brakes they cannot ignore. The proposed Stop Super Speeders law would make drivers with extreme ticket records use intelligent speed assistance. These steps are laid out in our <a href=/take_action/>Take Action page</a>.</p><h3 id=what-now>What now</h3><p>The deaths are not random. They are mapped, dated, and named. <strong>AD 29: 10 dead. 2,764 injured.</strong> Start on Hillside. Start on Laurelton. Do the simple things. Slow the cars. Save the next person.</p><p>Take one step today. Tell City Hall to slow the streets and back the state bill to rein in repeat speeders. Start here: <a href=/take_action/>take action</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
