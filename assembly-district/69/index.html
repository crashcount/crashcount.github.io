A child at Cathedral Parkway. Both struck by SUVs. Both dead. In the last twelve months, two people killed and four left with life-changing injuries in Assembly District 69. One was a child. One was old enough to be her grandmother. There is no pattern except the bodies left behind.</p><p>The numbers do not flinch: 442 crashes, 192 injuries, 4 serious injuries, 2 deaths in a single year, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. The street does not care if you are young or old. It does not care if you have the light. It does not care if you are careful.</p><h2 id=the-system-fails-the-vulnerable>The System Fails the Vulnerable</h2><p>The dead are not just numbers. Miriam Reinharth, 69, was crossing with the signal when an ambulance turned left and killed her. The police told her husband, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/29/ambulance-driver-arrested-months-after-fatally-hitting-woman-in-manhattan/>&ldquo;The police officer said the accident was not Miriam&rsquo;s fault at all&rdquo;</a>. A 13-year-old girl was hit by an SUV at Cathedral Parkway. She never made it home.</p><p>The city writes tickets. Sometimes, months later, it charges a driver. But the street stays the same. The cars stay fast. The crosswalks stay wide. The risk stays with the walker, the child, the old woman, the cyclist.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h2><p>Assembly Member Micah Lasher has taken a step. He co-sponsored a bill to force speed limiters on repeat dangerous drivers—those who rack up tickets or points (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">A2299</a>). The bill sits in committee. No vote. No law. The streets wait.</p><p>Lasher has called for regional MTA funding, but the capital plan stalls. The clock ticks. The city’s arteries keep bleeding (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/03/26/capitol-dispatch-albany-has-no-plan-the-feds-are-fuming-and-transit-riders-are-facing-a-true-shithole-if-mta-cash-isnt-raised>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p>Every day of delay is another risk. Call Lasher. Call the council. Demand safer speeds. Demand action on speed limiters. Demand streets that do not kill. The dead cannot speak. You can. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
