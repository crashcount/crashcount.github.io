Sixteen left with serious injuries. In the last twelve months, 478 crashes tore through Assembly District 69. The dead include a child, a teenager, and an older woman. The numbers do not flinch. They do not grieve. They only rise.</p><p>Just last month, a 43-year-old cyclist died after colliding with a pedestrian in Central Park. The news was blunt: <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/cyclist-43-dies-after-colliding-with-pedestrian-in-central-park-nypd-says>A 43-year-old cyclist died after colliding with a pedestrian in Central Park, according to the NYPD.</a> No details on the pedestrian. No comfort for the families. Only the silence that follows sirens.</p><p>A 72-year-old woman was hit twice by cyclists on Central Park sidewalks. She suffered kidney damage. The police never came. <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/she-was-hit-twice-by-bikes-in-central-park-and-says-nypd-never-followed-up-IH4810802>&ldquo;Ninety percent of their crashes have no police report and in 90 percent of these crashes over 90 percent the rider flees the scene,&rdquo;</a> said Janet Schroeder. The city’s own numbers are shadows. The pain is real.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt. SUVs and cars did the most harm: 3 deaths, 3 serious injuries, and 112 more hurt. Trucks and buses left another dozen injured or worse. Bikes and mopeds, too, left scars—one serious injury, 23 more hurt. The street does not care who you are. It only takes.</p><h3 id=what-has-lasher-done>What Has Lasher Done?</h3><p>Assembly Member Micah Lasher voted to extend and expand school speed cameras, a move that keeps children safer near schools. He co-sponsored a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting tech. He voted yes on measures to protect kids, but also voted to weaken bus lane rules—putting pedestrians and cyclists at risk. The record is mixed. The danger is not.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-no-more-waiting>The Next Step: No More Waiting</h3><p>Every day without action is another day of blood on the street. Call Assembly Member Lasher. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for the most vulnerable. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The boards argue the crackdown will not make streets safer and targets vulnerable workers. Ken Coughlin of CB7 said, “This resolution is simply saying, 'This is not the way.'” Jesse Greenwald of CB4 warned of the risks to immigrant delivery workers, stating, “We know that ICE agents are looking for any opportunity to detain and deport our immigrant workers.” The boards’ votes follow similar action by Midtown’s CB6. The article notes the NYPD has not provided evidence for the claimed surge in complaints that prompted the policy.
