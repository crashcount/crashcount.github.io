A child at Cathedral Parkway. Both struck by SUVs. Both dead. In the last twelve months, two people killed and four left with life-changing injuries in Assembly District 69. One was a child. One was old enough to be her grandmother. There is no pattern except the bodies left behind.</p><p>The numbers do not flinch: 442 crashes, 192 injuries, 4 serious injuries, 2 deaths in a single year, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.

Miriam Reinharth, 69, was crossing with the signal when an ambulance turned left and killed her.

He co-sponsored a bill to force speed limiters on repeat dangerous drivers—those who rack up tickets or points (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">A2299</a>). The bill sits in committee. No vote. No law. The streets wait.</p><p>Lasher has called for regional MTA funding, but the capital plan stalls. The clock ticks.
