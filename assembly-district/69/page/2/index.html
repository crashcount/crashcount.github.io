Twenty-one left with serious injuries.</strong> Since 2022, there have been 1,941 crashes. The dead include a 13-year-old girl struck by an SUV at Cathedral Parkway and Manhattan Avenue. A 69-year-old woman killed by a turning SUV at 96th and Amsterdam. A cyclist, age 43, died after colliding with a pedestrian in Central Park just this June, as reported by <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/cyclist-43-dies-after-colliding-with-pedestrian-in-central-park-nypd-says>Gothamist</a>. The list goes on. The street forgets no one.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;Ninety percent of their crashes have no police report and in 90 percent of these crashes over 90 percent the rider flees the scene,&rdquo;</strong> said Janet Schroeder after being hit twice by cyclists in Central Park. She was left with kidney damage and no follow-up from police. <strong>&ldquo;It is so much worse than the DOT stats show,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/she-was-hit-twice-by-bikes-in-central-park-and-says-nypd-never-followed-up-IH4810802>she said</a>. &ldquo;They do have correct stats on those killed but completely skewed stats on those injured.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=the-policy-response-progress-and-gaps>The Policy Response: Progress and Gaps</h3><p>Assembly Member <strong>Micah Lasher</strong> has taken steps. He voted to extend and expand school speed cameras, aiming to protect children at crossings. He co-sponsored a bill to require speed-limiting devices for repeat dangerous drivers, as shown in <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>File S 8344</a>. But he also voted to weaken bus lane rules, a move that puts more pedestrians and cyclists at risk, according to <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/03/26/capitol-dispatch-albany-has-no-plan-the-feds-are-fuming-and-transit-riders-are-facing-a-true-shithole-if-mta-cash-isnt-raised>Streetsblog NYC</a>. The work is not done. The carnage continues.</p><h3 id=the-relentless-math>The Relentless Math</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars are the main killers.</strong> They caused 3 deaths and 4 serious injuries to pedestrians. Bikes, mopeds, and trucks also left their mark, but the steel and speed of cars do the most harm. The numbers are not just numbers. They are mothers, children, neighbors. They are the cost of delay.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day the city delays lowering speed limits, every time enforcement misses the mark, another family pays. Call Assembly Member Lasher. Demand he fight for a 20 mph citywide speed limit and real accountability for repeat offenders. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
