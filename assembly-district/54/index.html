The clock keeps ticking.</h1></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>AD 54: Jan 1, 2022 - Sep 6, 2025</h2><p>Just after 4 PM on Sep 1, a man and a woman on a motorcycle hit an SUV at Atlantic Ave and Elton St. Both were 42. Both died, police records show (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>This Week</p><ul><li>Aug 19, Ridgewood Ave at Pine St: an 18-year-old passenger was badly hurt in a three‑SUV crash (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>Aug 12, near 356 Arlington Ave: a 33-year-old driver was ejected and injured (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>Aug 11, Liberty Ave at Crescent St: a 17-year-old on a motorized device was cut and injured after a collision with a sedan (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li></ul><p>Two of eight. That is the toll in Assembly District 54 since Jan 1, 2022 — <strong>8 people killed</strong>, with 2 pedestrians among them, and thousands hurt (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The count is steady. The bodies change.</p><p>Crashes are rising. By this point in the year, AD 54 has logged <strong>901 crashes</strong>, <strong>531 injuries</strong>, and <strong>12 serious injuries</strong>, up from <strong>802</strong>, <strong>457</strong>, and <strong>5</strong> at the same time last year — jumps of <strong>12.3%</strong>, <strong>16.2%</strong>, and <strong>140.0%</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Deaths are flat at three each year to date. The suffering is not.</p><p>Night falls, and risk swells. The city’s records place multiple deaths in the evening hours — 6 PM, 8 PM, 10 PM — with injuries piling up through the late day (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Where the street fails, people pay. Atlantic Avenue is a top injury corridor in this district. So is Bushwick Avenue (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Police reports in AD 54 list driver inattention, failure to yield, running the light, alcohol, and tailgating among recorded causes of injuries here (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>A man crossing Fulton at Washington in Cypress Hills never made it home. “Investigators say a burgundy Ford Explorer with Pennsylvania license plates struck and killed the 55‑year‑old man… The vehicle did not remain on the scene,” <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-fatal-hit-run-police-searching-driver-55-year-old-man-fatally-struck-car-cypress-hills/16447158/>ABC7 reported</a>.</p><p>Fix the corners. Cut the speed. Harden turns, add daylighting, and give leading walk time at the district’s worst spots — Atlantic Ave, Bushwick Ave, Crescent St — with targeted night enforcement where deaths cluster (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Who moves first? In Albany, Assembly Member <a href=/council-district/37/>Erik Dilan</a> voted yes this June to extend and clean up school‑zone speed laws in S 8344 (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Open States</a>). That keeps cameras watching near schools. Citywide, the next steps are on the table: a lower default speed limit and speed limiters for repeat offenders. The Stop Super Speeders Act would require intelligent speed assistance for drivers who rack up violations; New Yorkers are already pushing for it and a slower city on our <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a> page.</p><p>Atlantic and Elton will not be the last. The number is eight. It does not have to climb. Start with the speed. Start now. See the steps <a href=/take_action/>here</a>.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The driver, helmetless, flew headfirst and bled. The passenger, helmeted, struck hard and bled from the face. Both ejected. Both broken. Night swallowed their cries.</p><p class=mb3>Two people suffered serious injuries when a moped crashed on Bushwick Ave near Halsey St, according to the police report. The report states both the driver, a 30-year-old man, and the passenger, a 25-year-old woman, were ejected from the moped. The driver, who wore no helmet, sustained severe head lacerations. The passenger, who wore a helmet, suffered severe bleeding from facial injuries. According to the police report, 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' was cited as the primary contributing factor for both individuals. The narrative notes, 'Distraction rode with them through the dark.' No other vehicles were involved, and no victim behaviors were listed as contributing factors beyond the mention of helmet use after driver distraction. The crash underscores the danger when attention lapses on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The impact was severe: 'A Jeep slammed into a northbound moped. The 65-year-old rider flew from the seat, struck the pavement headfirst. Blood pooled in the street. The SUV’s front end folded. He died there.' The moped rider, a 65-year-old man, was killed instantly, suffering fatal head injuries after being ejected from his vehicle. The police report notes the SUV driver was unlicensed, with a license from Georgia that was not valid in New York. No driver errors beyond 'unspecified' are listed, but the unlicensed status is a critical systemic failure. Helmet use is mentioned only to note its absence, after the primary driver error. The crash underscores the lethal consequences when unlicensed drivers operate vehicles on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The impact occurred at the center back end of the taxi and the center front end of the sedan, crumpling metal severely. A 25-year-old woman, seated in the left rear passenger seat of the taxi and wearing a lap belt, sustained crushing injuries to her entire body and remained still, held by shock. The report lists no specific driver errors but the collision’s nature—a sedan hitting a stopped vehicle from behind—indicates a failure to prevent rear-end collisions. Both vehicles were traveling east, with the taxi stopped and the sedan moving straight ahead. No contributing factors were specified for either driver.
