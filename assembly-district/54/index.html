The street fell silent, the impact echoing in the late morning air.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a Chevy SUV was making a left turn on Logan Street near Atlantic Avenue when its left front quarter panel struck a 61-year-old man who was crossing in a marked crosswalk. The report states the pedestrian was hit in the chest by the bumper and suffered crush injuries. The incident occurred in late morning. Police data lists 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as a contributing factor on the part of the driver. The pedestrian was crossing with no signal present, as noted in the report, but the primary driver error cited is failure to yield. The narrative describes no warning, no sound, and a sudden, violent impact. The focus remains on the driver’s actions and the systemic danger present at the intersection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
