Since 2022, five people are dead. Thirty-four more are left with serious injuries. The numbers do not tell you how it feels to see a man struck in the crosswalk, or a cyclist thrown from his bike. But the numbers do not lie. In the last year alone, there were 1,120 crashes, 631 injuries, and 15 serious injuries. The dead do not speak. The wounded limp on.</p><p>Just last month, a grocery delivery worker pulled over on Lincoln Avenue. A driver clipped his open door. Words were exchanged. The driver opened his hatchback, pulled out a pipe, and beat the worker in the head and body. &ldquo;A 36-year-old man delivering groceries was hospitalized after he was viciously beaten with a pipe during a road rage-fueled attack on a Brooklyn street, police said&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/12/man-delivering-groceries-beaten-with-pipe-in-brooklyn-road-rage-attack/>NY Daily News</a>). The attacker fled. The worker went to Jamaica Hospital.</p><p>A month before, a man tried to cross Fulton Street in Cypress Hills. A burgundy Ford Explorer hit him. The driver did not stop. &ldquo;Investigators say a burgundy Ford Explorer with Pennsylvania license plates struck and killed the 55-year-old man&mldr; The vehicle did not remain on the scene&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-fatal-hit-run-police-searching-driver-55-year-old-man-fatally-struck-car-cypress-hills/16447158/>ABC7</a>).</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p>The old and the young are not spared. In the last twelve months, one person aged 65–74 died. Forty-seven children under 18 were injured. Most of the wounds come from cars and SUVs. Trucks, vans, motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes all play their part, but the steel and speed of cars do the most harm.</p><h3 id=what-has-dilan-done>What Has Dilan Done?</h3><p>Assembly Member Erik Dilan has voted to extend and expand school speed zones and speed cameras (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Open States</a>). He co-sponsored bills to require safer street designs for all users. But he also voted to weaken bus lane rules, putting pedestrians and cyclists at greater risk. He voted no on expanding speed camera hours in 2022. The record is mixed. The blood on the street is not.</p><h3 id=what-next>What Next?</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call Dilan. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people on foot and on bikes. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p><p>The street is not safe until the most vulnerable are safe.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Brooklyn pavement took another life.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a northbound Mazda sedan struck a 71-year-old woman as she crossed Eldert Street near Knickerbocker Avenue in a marked crosswalk. She suffered fatal crush wounds and never regained consciousness. A second pedestrian, age 44, was also hit and sustained chest contusions but remained conscious. The report states the Mazda driver was unlicensed and disregarded traffic control. 'Traffic Control Disregarded' and 'Unsafe Speed' are listed as contributing factors. The victims were crossing without a signal but within a marked crosswalk, as documented in the report. The crash underscores the danger when drivers ignore basic rules and operate vehicles without a license.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
