Both died, police records show (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>This Week</p><ul><li>Aug 19, Ridgewood Ave at Pine St: an 18-year-old passenger was badly hurt in a three‑SUV crash (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>Aug 12, near 356 Arlington Ave: a 33-year-old driver was ejected and injured (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>Aug 11, Liberty Ave at Crescent St: a 17-year-old on a motorized device was cut and injured after a collision with a sedan (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li></ul><p>Two of eight. That is the toll in Assembly District 54 since Jan 1, 2022 — <strong>8 people killed</strong>, with 2 pedestrians among them, and thousands hurt (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The count is steady. The bodies change.</p><p>Crashes are rising. By this point in the year, AD 54 has logged <strong>901 crashes</strong>, <strong>531 injuries</strong>, and <strong>12 serious injuries</strong>, up from <strong>802</strong>, <strong>457</strong>, and <strong>5</strong> at the same time last year — jumps of <strong>12.3%</strong>, <strong>16.2%</strong>, and <strong>140.0%</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Deaths are flat at three each year to date. The suffering is not.</p><p>Night falls, and risk swells. The city’s records place multiple deaths in the evening hours — 6 PM, 8 PM, 10 PM — with injuries piling up through the late day (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Where the street fails, people pay. Atlantic Avenue is a top injury corridor in this district. So is Bushwick Avenue (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Police reports in AD 54 list driver inattention, failure to yield, running the light, alcohol, and tailgating among recorded causes of injuries here (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>A man crossing Fulton at Washington in Cypress Hills never made it home. “Investigators say a burgundy Ford Explorer with Pennsylvania license plates struck and killed the 55‑year‑old man… The vehicle did not remain on the scene,” <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-fatal-hit-run-police-searching-driver-55-year-old-man-fatally-struck-car-cypress-hills/16447158/>ABC7 reported</a>.</p><p>Fix the corners. Cut the speed. Harden turns, add daylighting, and give leading walk time at the district’s worst spots — Atlantic Ave, Bushwick Ave, Crescent St — with targeted night enforcement where deaths cluster (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Who moves first? In Albany, Assembly Member <a href=/council-district/37/>Erik Dilan</a> voted yes this June to extend and clean up school‑zone speed laws in S 8344 (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Open States</a>). That keeps cameras watching near schools. Citywide, the next steps are on the table: a lower default speed limit and speed limiters for repeat offenders. The Stop Super Speeders Act would require intelligent speed assistance for drivers who rack up violations; New Yorkers are already pushing for it and a slower city on our <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a> page.</p><p>Atlantic and Elton will not be the last. The number is eight. It does not have to climb. Start with the speed. Start now. See the steps <a href=/take_action/>here</a>.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
