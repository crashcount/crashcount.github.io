On Aug. 11, two young men on mopeds crashed on the Bronx River Parkway. Both were ejected and died. Records list them as 19 and 21. Two sedans were involved; both mopeds were unlicensed, the city file shows (the data <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>show</a>).</p><p>A year that keeps taking
In the last 12 months, 4 people were killed in AD 81, with hundreds hurt, across <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>1,058 crashes</a>. Year to date, crashes are up 13%, and deaths <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>doubled</a> from 1 to 2 compared to last year. Since 2022, the district has <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>logged</a> 3,641 crashes, 13 deaths, and 28 serious injuries.</p><p>Last winter, on Dec. 1, a 24-year-old bicyclist was <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>killed</a> at Webster Ave and E 233rd St. On July 6, 2024, a driver died in a four-vehicle <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>pileup</a> by the Major Deegan. On Aug. 28, 2023, an 83-year-old driver was killed at West 230th and Broadway; the report <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>lists</a> unsafe speed and disregard of traffic control.</p><p>Crashes and pedestrian injuries in AD 81 are rising. Vision Zero demands stronger design — and accountability from Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz.</p><p>What leaders did — and didn’t
Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted yes</a> in June to extend and fix school speed-zone laws. He has <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/more-red-light-cameras-coming-to-nyc-intersections-under-newly-passed-legislation>backed</a> expanding red-light cameras citywide.</p><p>But in Riverdale, he opposed a DOT <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/04/01/riverdale-rumble-bronx-panel-rejects-dot-road-diet-plan-for-super-wide-avenue>road diet</a> for a super-wide avenue in 2022, and the community board followed his lead. This year, he also voted yes on bills creating exemptions to bus-lane rules (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S6815>S 6815</a> and <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S7785>S 7785</a>), carving holes in enforcement.</p><p>Who pays when rules are ignored
After a Bronx overpass scare in January, Dinowitz <a href=#citations>said</a>, “We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it.” Council Member Eric Dinowitz <a href=#citations>added</a>, “That’s a very big bus&mldr; it speaks to the importance of enforcing our parking rules.”</p><p>What must happen now
• Back proven street redesigns on Riverdale Ave and every deadly corridor. No carve-outs.
• Keep cameras growing and running. Make it harder to speed, not easier.
• <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Track</a> every crash, every death, and fix the site. Street by street.</p><p>Call Assembly Member Dinowitz. Demand designs that slow cars and protect people. Demand he oppose any new exemptions that weaken bus and safety rules. Do it now, before the next siren.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Dinowitz stated, 'I'm not against the plan, because I don't know what it is,' but demanded better outreach. Christian Amato, another local politician, voiced strong support, referencing positive results from Morris Park Avenue.
