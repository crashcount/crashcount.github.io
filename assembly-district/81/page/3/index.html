Nine left with injuries so grave they may never walk the same. In Assembly District 81, the numbers do not lie: <strong>887 crashes, 571 injuries, 3 deaths in just twelve months</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The youngest lost was 24. The oldest, 83. A cyclist crushed by an SUV on E 233rd Street. A pedestrian struck crossing with the signal at Corlear Avenue. A driver killed on the Deegan. The street does not care who you are.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage.</strong> In the last three years, SUVs and cars killed four, left 64 with moderate injuries, and 11 with serious wounds. Trucks and buses killed two more. Motorcycles and mopeds, one moderate injury. Not a single fatality from a bike (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h2 id=dinowitz-votes-words-and-missed-chances>Dinowitz: Votes, Words, and Missed Chances</h2><p>Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz has backed some safety measures. He voted to expand red light cameras, saying, <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/more-red-light-cameras-coming-to-nyc-intersections-under-newly-passed-legislation>&ldquo;People shouldn’t run red lights&mldr; when they do that they endanger other people’s lives, and people have died.&rdquo;</a> He called for cameras at every intersection, pushing for stronger automated enforcement (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/03/20/report-red-light-running-on-the-rise-post-pandemic>red light running</a>). He co-sponsored <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">bills for safer street design</a> and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1280&amp;term=2023">street safety improvements</a>.</p><p>But when the city tried to narrow Riverdale Avenue—a street where seniors and children are at risk—Dinowitz stood with the local board to <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/04/01/riverdale-rumble-bronx-panel-rejects-dot-road-diet-plan-for-super-wide-avenue>block the plan</a>. The avenue stayed wide. The danger stayed with it.</p><p>When a bus nearly plunged off a Bronx overpass, Dinowitz pointed to the double-parked car that forced the driver to swerve. <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/public-safety/2025/01/17/mta-bus-rescued-after-partially-driving-off-bronx-overpass->&ldquo;We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it.&rdquo;</a> No one died that day. But the wall broke. Next time, it could be a child.</p><h2 id=what-now-the-fight-is-not-over>What Now: The Fight Is Not Over</h2><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every delay is a choice. Call Assembly Member Dinowitz. Call your council member. Demand safer street design, more cameras, and a citywide 20 mph speed limit. <strong>Do not wait for another body in the road.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The plan, described as a '.75-mile-long road diet,' aimed to reduce lanes, add traffic calming, and install bike lanes. Council Member Eric Dinowitz and Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz opposed the DOT's turning bays, pushing instead for left-turn signals at two intersections. The committee echoed their stance, citing concerns about traffic and parking. The matter title: 'Riverdale Rumble: Bronx Panel Rejects DOT Road Diet Plan for Super-Wide Avenue.' DOT officials stressed the area's high rate of crashes, especially harming seniors and children, but the board's advisory vote leaves the avenue wide and perilous for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'Riverdale Avenue Rumble: Bronx Pol Dinowitz Objects to DOT’s Move on ‘Road Diet’,' centers on a traffic-calming redesign to address frequent crashes. Dinowitz stated, 'I'm not against the plan, because I don't know what it is,' but demanded better outreach. Christian Amato, another local politician, voiced strong support, referencing positive results from Morris Park Avenue. The DOT confirmed the proposal includes a bike lane and seeks community feedback. No formal council vote has occurred.

The plan, aimed at a crash-prone Bronx corridor, was criticized by Dinowitz for a lack of transparency: 'A city agency should not be run this way.' He insisted he is not against the plan itself, but objects to DOT’s process, which bypassed him and Community Board 8. Dinowitz’s stance echoes his past opposition to bus lanes that reduce parking, though he supports bike lanes that do not remove vehicle lanes. The proposal, which includes a bike lane, remains under review.
