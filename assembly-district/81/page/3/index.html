Twenty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Nearly two thousand hurt since 2022. Each number is a name, a family, a future cut short. The dead include a 24-year-old cyclist crushed at E 233rd and Webster, a pedestrian struck in the crosswalk at W 230th and Corlear, and an 83-year-old driver killed at Broadway and 230th. The streets do not forgive. The pain lingers.</p><h3 id=the-usual-weapons-cars-suvs-and-indifference>The Usual Weapons: Cars, SUVs, and Indifference</h3><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the killing.</strong> They account for the majority of deaths and injuries. Trucks, buses, motorcycles, and even bikes have left their mark, but the heaviest toll comes from the largest machines. The violence is not random. It is routine. It is preventable.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h3><p>Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz has backed some safety measures. He voted to extend school speed zones, a move to protect children near schools (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Open States</a>). He has pushed for more red-light cameras, saying, <strong>&ldquo;People shouldn’t run red lights&mldr; when they do that they endanger other people’s lives, and people have died&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/more-red-light-cameras-coming-to-nyc-intersections-under-newly-passed-legislation>Gothamist</a>). He called for cameras at every intersection (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/03/20/report-red-light-running-on-the-rise-post-pandemic>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>But when the city tried to build a protected bike lane on Bailey Avenue, Dinowitz pushed back, defending parking over safety. <strong>&ldquo;We did raise serious concerns about the removal of a large number of parking spots in an area that&rsquo;s already starved for parking&mldr; We can have bike lanes and at the same time not have to remove so many parking spots&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/08/anti-car-crusade-dinowitzes-slam-bronx-harlem-river-greenway-bike-lane-touted-by-mayor>Streetsblog NYC</a>). The city’s own data shows protected lanes save lives. The fight drags on.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-demand-relentless-action>The Next Step: Demand Relentless Action</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every delay, every watered-down plan, every excuse for inaction means another family will grieve. Call Assembly Member Dinowitz. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes, not just promises. Demand action for the living, not memorials for the dead.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter, titled 'Riverdale Avenue Rumble: Bronx Pol Dinowitz Objects to DOT’s Move on ‘Road Diet’,' centers on a traffic-calming redesign to address frequent crashes. Dinowitz stated, 'I'm not against the plan, because I don't know what it is,' but demanded better outreach. Christian Amato, another local politician, voiced strong support, referencing positive results from Morris Park Avenue.

He insisted he is not against the plan itself, but objects to DOT’s process, which bypassed him and Community Board 8. Dinowitz’s stance echoes his past opposition to bus lanes that reduce parking, though he supports bike lanes that do not remove vehicle lanes. The proposal, which includes a bike lane, remains under review.
