A pedestrian, also 24, struck dead by a turning SUV at Corlear Avenue and West 230th. A driver, 34, killed in a tangle of SUVs and sedans on the Major Deegan. In the last twelve months, two people have died and nine have been seriously injured in Assembly District 81. Over 500 have been hurt (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash records</a>). The numbers do not rest. They do not heal.</p><h2 id=the-usual-suspects>The Usual Suspects</h2><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage. Cars and trucks killed four, seriously injured eleven, and left hundreds more with broken bodies (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash records</a>). Bikes and mopeds are in the mix, but the carnage comes on four wheels. The street is a gauntlet. The young, the old, the ones just trying to cross—they pay the price.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h2><p>Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz has backed bills to expand red-light cameras and lower speed limits. He said, <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/more-red-light-cameras-coming-to-nyc-intersections-under-newly-passed-legislation>&ldquo;People shouldn’t run red lights&mldr; when they do that they endanger other people’s lives, and people have died.&rdquo;</a> He has called for cameras at every intersection. He supported Sammy’s Law, giving the city power to set safer speeds. But when the city tried to build a protected bike lane, Dinowitz pushed back, saying, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/08/anti-car-crusade-dinowitzes-slam-bronx-harlem-river-greenway-bike-lane-touted-by-mayor>&ldquo;We did raise serious concerns about the removal of a large number of parking spots in an area that&rsquo;s already starved for parking&mldr; We can have bike lanes and at the same time not have to remove so many parking spots.&rdquo;</a></p><h2 id=the-road-ahead>The Road Ahead</h2><p>The deaths are not fate. They are the result of choices. Choices about speed, about space, about who gets to feel safe. Dinowitz has shown he will listen when the pressure is loud. He has also shown he will defend parking when the pressure is louder. If you want safer streets, make your voice impossible to ignore.</p><p>Call Dinowitz. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes, even if it means fewer parking spots. Demand action, not excuses.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, which would grant New York City local control over its speed limits, remains stalled in the Assembly.

Fabiola Mendieta-Cuapio, a leading advocate, criticized the lack of transparency: 'We are demanding that the Speaker bring this to a vote.' Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz voiced strong support, but others, like Chantel Jackson, hesitated, citing constituent feedback. The bill’s matter summary states it would not mandate lower limits but allow the city to decide. The legislative process left families of crash victims frustrated and angry.

The move answers NJ’s threat to block data sharing. Without cooperation, speeders dodge camera tickets. Streets stay dangerous. Lawmakers trade barbs. Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>Bill number not specified. On September 28, 2022, Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz introduced a proposal in the New York State Legislature. The bill, now in committee, would impose a $50 fee on vehicles registered in states—like New Jersey—that refuse to share driver data for traffic enforcement. The measure responds to a New Jersey Senate bill blocking DMV data sharing, which could undermine New York City’s automated speed camera program. Dinowitz said, 'There's going to have to be a price to pay if my bill passes.' Safe streets advocates and NYC DOT warn that blocking data sharing lets speeders escape penalties, fueling traffic violence. The bill’s text states it 'authorizes the imposition of a $50 fee on vehicles entering NYC which are registered in states which do not cooperate with New York in the enforcement of traffic infractions through the use of photo-monitoring devices or signal monitoring systems.' The fight leaves vulnerable road users at risk, as enforcement gaps let reckless drivers go unpunished.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The debate, covered by gothamist.com, highlighted concerns from truckers, ride-share drivers, and advocates. The matter summary reads: 'Debate over NYC congestion pricing picks up as more effects of the plan emerge.' Critics, including Rep. Ritchie Torres, warned the plan could push more diesel trucks onto the Cross Bronx Expressway, raising public health and equity concerns.
