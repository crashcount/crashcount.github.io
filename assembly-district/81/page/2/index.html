Twenty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Nearly two thousand hurt since 2022. Each number is a name, a family, a future cut short. The dead include a 24-year-old cyclist crushed at E 233rd and Webster, a pedestrian struck in the crosswalk at W 230th and Corlear, and an 83-year-old driver killed at Broadway and 230th. The streets do not forgive. The pain lingers.</p><h3 id=the-usual-weapons-cars-suvs-and-indifference>The Usual Weapons: Cars, SUVs, and Indifference</h3><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the killing.</strong> They account for the majority of deaths and injuries. Trucks, buses, motorcycles, and even bikes have left their mark, but the heaviest toll comes from the largest machines. The violence is not random. It is routine. It is preventable.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h3><p>Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz has backed some safety measures. He voted to extend school speed zones, a move to protect children near schools (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Open States</a>). He has pushed for more red-light cameras, saying, <strong>&ldquo;People shouldn’t run red lights&mldr; when they do that they endanger other people’s lives, and people have died&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/more-red-light-cameras-coming-to-nyc-intersections-under-newly-passed-legislation>Gothamist</a>). He called for cameras at every intersection (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/03/20/report-red-light-running-on-the-rise-post-pandemic>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>But when the city tried to build a protected bike lane on Bailey Avenue, Dinowitz pushed back, defending parking over safety. <strong>&ldquo;We did raise serious concerns about the removal of a large number of parking spots in an area that&rsquo;s already starved for parking&mldr; We can have bike lanes and at the same time not have to remove so many parking spots&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/08/anti-car-crusade-dinowitzes-slam-bronx-harlem-river-greenway-bike-lane-touted-by-mayor>Streetsblog NYC</a>). The city’s own data shows protected lanes save lives. The fight drags on.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-demand-relentless-action>The Next Step: Demand Relentless Action</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every delay, every watered-down plan, every excuse for inaction means another family will grieve. Call Assembly Member Dinowitz. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes, not just promises. Demand action for the living, not memorials for the dead.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Twenty-nine dead last year. Highest ever. Reckless drivers surge post-pandemic. City report demands more cameras—jump from 150 to 1,325 intersections. Officials back the bill. Victims’ families demand action. Cameras cut crashes. But the most dangerous drivers remain loose.</p><p class=mb3>On March 20, 2024, the Department of Transportation released a report urging passage of a bill to expand New York City’s red-light camera program. The bill, supported by DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and sponsored by State Senator Andrew Goundardes, would boost camera coverage from 150 to 1,325 intersections—about 10% of the city’s 13,700 signals. The report states: “Expanding the number of intersections with red light cameras... could substantially enhance the deterrent effect of the program and return New York City to the consistently downward trend of red light-running behavior we had seen prior to the pandemic.” Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz also supports expansion, calling for cameras at every intersection. The DOT notes that cameras have slashed T-bone crashes by 65% and rear-end collisions by 49% at monitored sites, but the statutory cap blocks broader safety gains. Relatives of crash victims joined the call, demanding the city confront driver negligence and protect the community.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Assembly Member Dinowitz and Senator Gounardes push for more cameras. DOT data shows fewer violations and crashes. Advocates demand action. The cap leaves neighborhoods exposed. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>Bills A5259 and S2812 face debate in the New York State legislature. If lawmakers fail to act, the city’s red-light cameras—now capped at 150 intersections—will shut off December 1, 2024. The matter, described as 'reauthorize and expand the city's red-light camera program,' is championed by Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz and Senate co-sponsor Andrew Gounardes. Dinowitz, the sponsor, urges expansion, stating, 'We should have red-light cameras on every intersection.' Gounardes expects a review and expansion. DOT data backs them: violations and rear-end crashes have dropped at camera sites. Residents like Amy Bettys call the cap dangerous. Advocacy groups support the bills, though they are not a top priority. Dinowitz stresses automated enforcement is vital with limited police. The bills await committee action. Vulnerable road users face risk if the program lapses.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, which would grant New York City local control over its speed limits, remains stalled in the Assembly. The rally, led by Families for Safe Streets, called out lawmakers for refusing to bring the measure to a vote. Fabiola Mendieta-Cuapio, a leading advocate, criticized the lack of transparency: 'We are demanding that the Speaker bring this to a vote.' Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz voiced strong support, but others, like Chantel Jackson, hesitated, citing constituent feedback. The bill’s matter summary states it would not mandate lower limits but allow the city to decide. The legislative process left families of crash victims frustrated and angry.

The move answers NJ’s threat to block data sharing. Without cooperation, speeders dodge camera tickets. Streets stay dangerous. Lawmakers trade barbs. Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>Bill number not specified. On September 28, 2022, Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz introduced a proposal in the New York State Legislature. The bill, now in committee, would impose a $50 fee on vehicles registered in states—like New Jersey—that refuse to share driver data for traffic enforcement. The measure responds to a New Jersey Senate bill blocking DMV data sharing, which could undermine New York City’s automated speed camera program. Dinowitz said, 'There's going to have to be a price to pay if my bill passes.' Safe streets advocates and NYC DOT warn that blocking data sharing lets speeders escape penalties, fueling traffic violence. The bill’s text states it 'authorizes the imposition of a $50 fee on vehicles entering NYC which are registered in states which do not cooperate with New York in the enforcement of traffic infractions through the use of photo-monitoring devices or signal monitoring systems.' The fight leaves vulnerable road users at risk, as enforcement gaps let reckless drivers go unpunished.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She took the blow to the head. Blood pooled. She lay unconscious. One driver distracted. Metal bent. The street stayed quiet. The system failed her.</p><p class=mb3>A 65-year-old woman was struck by two SUVs while crossing West Gun Hill Road. She suffered a severe head injury and was found unconscious and bleeding. According to the police report, one driver was distracted at the time of the crash. The report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor. The impact crumpled both vehicles at the front. The pedestrian was not at an intersection and crossed without a signal, but the report does not cite this as a contributing factor. No helmet or signal use is mentioned as a cause. The crash left the woman gravely hurt, while a 33-year-old male driver also reported head pain. The quiet street bore witness to another preventable tragedy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
