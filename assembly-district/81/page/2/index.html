On Aug. 11, two young men on mopeds crashed on the Bronx River Parkway. Both were ejected and died. Records list them as 19 and 21. Two sedans were involved; both mopeds were unlicensed, the city file shows (the data <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>show</a>).</p><p>A year that keeps taking
In the last 12 months, 4 people were killed in AD 81, with hundreds hurt, across <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>1,058 crashes</a>. Year to date, crashes are up 13%, and deaths <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>doubled</a> from 1 to 2 compared to last year. Since 2022, the district has <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>logged</a> 3,641 crashes, 13 deaths, and 28 serious injuries.</p><p>Last winter, on Dec. 1, a 24-year-old bicyclist was <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>killed</a> at Webster Ave and E 233rd St. On July 6, 2024, a driver died in a four-vehicle <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>pileup</a> by the Major Deegan. On Aug. 28, 2023, an 83-year-old driver was killed at West 230th and Broadway; the report <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>lists</a> unsafe speed and disregard of traffic control.</p><p>Crashes and pedestrian injuries in AD 81 are rising. Vision Zero demands stronger design — and accountability from Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz.</p><p>What leaders did — and didn’t
Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted yes</a> in June to extend and fix school speed-zone laws. He has <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/more-red-light-cameras-coming-to-nyc-intersections-under-newly-passed-legislation>backed</a> expanding red-light cameras citywide.</p><p>But in Riverdale, he opposed a DOT <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/04/01/riverdale-rumble-bronx-panel-rejects-dot-road-diet-plan-for-super-wide-avenue>road diet</a> for a super-wide avenue in 2022, and the community board followed his lead. This year, he also voted yes on bills creating exemptions to bus-lane rules (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S6815>S 6815</a> and <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S7785>S 7785</a>), carving holes in enforcement.</p><p>Who pays when rules are ignored
After a Bronx overpass scare in January, Dinowitz <a href=#citations>said</a>, “We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it.” Council Member Eric Dinowitz <a href=#citations>added</a>, “That’s a very big bus&mldr; it speaks to the importance of enforcing our parking rules.”</p><p>What must happen now
• Back proven street redesigns on Riverdale Ave and every deadly corridor. No carve-outs.
• Keep cameras growing and running. Make it harder to speed, not easier.
• <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Track</a> every crash, every death, and fix the site. Street by street.</p><p>Call Assembly Member Dinowitz. Demand designs that slow cars and protect people. Demand he oppose any new exemptions that weaken bus and safety rules. Do it now, before the next siren.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Twenty-nine dead last year. Highest ever. Reckless drivers surge post-pandemic. City report demands more cameras—jump from 150 to 1,325 intersections. Officials back the bill. Victims’ families demand action. Cameras cut crashes. But the most dangerous drivers remain loose.</p><p class=mb3>On March 20, 2024, the Department of Transportation released a report urging passage of a bill to expand New York City’s red-light camera program. The bill, supported by DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and sponsored by State Senator Andrew Goundardes, would boost camera coverage from 150 to 1,325 intersections—about 10% of the city’s 13,700 signals. The report states: “Expanding the number of intersections with red light cameras... could substantially enhance the deterrent effect of the program and return New York City to the consistently downward trend of red light-running behavior we had seen prior to the pandemic.” Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz also supports expansion, calling for cameras at every intersection. The DOT notes that cameras have slashed T-bone crashes by 65% and rear-end collisions by 49% at monitored sites, but the statutory cap blocks broader safety gains. Relatives of crash victims joined the call, demanding the city confront driver negligence and protect the community.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Assembly Member Dinowitz and Senator Gounardes push for more cameras. DOT data shows fewer violations and crashes. Advocates demand action. The cap leaves neighborhoods exposed. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>Bills A5259 and S2812 face debate in the New York State legislature. If lawmakers fail to act, the city’s red-light cameras—now capped at 150 intersections—will shut off December 1, 2024. The matter, described as 'reauthorize and expand the city's red-light camera program,' is championed by Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz and Senate co-sponsor Andrew Gounardes. Dinowitz, the sponsor, urges expansion, stating, 'We should have red-light cameras on every intersection.' Gounardes expects a review and expansion. DOT data backs them: violations and rear-end crashes have dropped at camera sites. Residents like Amy Bettys call the cap dangerous. Advocacy groups support the bills, though they are not a top priority. Dinowitz stresses automated enforcement is vital with limited police. The bills await committee action. Vulnerable road users face risk if the program lapses.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The rally, led by Families for Safe Streets, called out lawmakers for refusing to bring the measure to a vote. Fabiola Mendieta-Cuapio, a leading advocate, criticized the lack of transparency: 'We are demanding that the Speaker bring this to a vote.' Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz voiced strong support, but others, like Chantel Jackson, hesitated, citing constituent feedback. The bill’s matter summary states it would not mandate lower limits but allow the city to decide. The legislative process left families of crash victims frustrated and angry. The Assembly’s inaction keeps city streets dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move answers NJ’s threat to block data sharing. Without cooperation, speeders dodge camera tickets. Streets stay dangerous. Lawmakers trade barbs. Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>Bill number not specified. On September 28, 2022, Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz introduced a proposal in the New York State Legislature. The bill, now in committee, would impose a $50 fee on vehicles registered in states—like New Jersey—that refuse to share driver data for traffic enforcement. The measure responds to a New Jersey Senate bill blocking DMV data sharing, which could undermine New York City’s automated speed camera program. Dinowitz said, 'There's going to have to be a price to pay if my bill passes.' Safe streets advocates and NYC DOT warn that blocking data sharing lets speeders escape penalties, fueling traffic violence. The bill’s text states it 'authorizes the imposition of a $50 fee on vehicles entering NYC which are registered in states which do not cooperate with New York in the enforcement of traffic infractions through the use of photo-monitoring devices or signal monitoring systems.' The fight leaves vulnerable road users at risk, as enforcement gaps let reckless drivers go unpunished.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
