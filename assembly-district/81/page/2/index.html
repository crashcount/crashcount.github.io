The youngest lost was 24. The oldest, 83. A cyclist crushed by an SUV on E 233rd Street. A pedestrian struck crossing with the signal at Corlear Avenue. A driver killed on the Deegan. The street does not care who you are.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage.</strong> In the last three years, SUVs and cars killed four, left 64 with moderate injuries, and 11 with serious wounds. Trucks and buses killed two more. Motorcycles and mopeds, one moderate injury.

He voted to expand red light cameras, saying, <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/more-red-light-cameras-coming-to-nyc-intersections-under-newly-passed-legislation>&ldquo;People shouldn’t run red lights&mldr; when they do that they endanger other people’s lives, and people have died.&rdquo;</a> He called for cameras at every intersection, pushing for stronger automated enforcement (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/03/20/report-red-light-running-on-the-rise-post-pandemic>red light running</a>). He co-sponsored <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">bills for safer street design</a> and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1280&amp;term=2023">street safety improvements</a>.</p><p>But when the city tried to narrow Riverdale Avenue—a street where seniors and children are at risk—Dinowitz stood with the local board to <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/04/01/riverdale-rumble-bronx-panel-rejects-dot-road-diet-plan-for-super-wide-avenue>block the plan</a>. The avenue stayed wide. The danger stayed with it.</p><p>When a bus nearly plunged off a Bronx overpass, Dinowitz pointed to the double-parked car that forced the driver to swerve. <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/public-safety/2025/01/17/mta-bus-rescued-after-partially-driving-off-bronx-overpass->&ldquo;We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it.&rdquo;</a> No one died that day. But the wall broke. Next time, it could be a child.</p><h2 id=what-now-the-fight-is-not-over>What Now: The Fight Is Not Over</h2><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every delay is a choice. Call Assembly Member Dinowitz. Call your council member.

The move answers NJ’s threat to block data sharing. Without cooperation, speeders dodge camera tickets. Streets stay dangerous. Lawmakers trade barbs. Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>Bill number not specified. On September 28, 2022, Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz introduced a proposal in the New York State Legislature. The bill, now in committee, would impose a $50 fee on vehicles registered in states—like New Jersey—that refuse to share driver data for traffic enforcement. The measure responds to a New Jersey Senate bill blocking DMV data sharing, which could undermine New York City’s automated speed camera program. Dinowitz said, 'There's going to have to be a price to pay if my bill passes.' Safe streets advocates and NYC DOT warn that blocking data sharing lets speeders escape penalties, fueling traffic violence. The bill’s text states it 'authorizes the imposition of a $50 fee on vehicles entering NYC which are registered in states which do not cooperate with New York in the enforcement of traffic infractions through the use of photo-monitoring devices or signal monitoring systems.' The fight leaves vulnerable road users at risk, as enforcement gaps let reckless drivers go unpunished.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal would charge drivers up to $23 to enter Manhattan below 60th Street. Dinowitz opposed credits for New Jersey drivers, calling them unfair. The debate, covered by gothamist.com, highlighted concerns from truckers, ride-share drivers, and advocates. The matter summary reads: 'Debate over NYC congestion pricing picks up as more effects of the plan emerge.' Critics, including Rep. Ritchie Torres, warned the plan could push more diesel trucks onto the Cross Bronx Expressway, raising public health and equity concerns. The council has not yet assessed the plan’s direct impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
