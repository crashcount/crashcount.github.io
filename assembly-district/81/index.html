Twenty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Nearly two thousand hurt since 2022. Each number is a name, a family, a future cut short. The dead include a 24-year-old cyclist crushed at E 233rd and Webster, a pedestrian struck in the crosswalk at W 230th and Corlear, and an 83-year-old driver killed at Broadway and 230th. The streets do not forgive. The pain lingers.</p><h3 id=the-usual-weapons-cars-suvs-and-indifference>The Usual Weapons: Cars, SUVs, and Indifference</h3><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the killing.</strong> They account for the majority of deaths and injuries. Trucks, buses, motorcycles, and even bikes have left their mark, but the heaviest toll comes from the largest machines. The violence is not random. It is routine. It is preventable.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h3><p>Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz has backed some safety measures. He voted to extend school speed zones, a move to protect children near schools (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Open States</a>). He has pushed for more red-light cameras, saying, <strong>&ldquo;People shouldn’t run red lights&mldr; when they do that they endanger other people’s lives, and people have died&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/more-red-light-cameras-coming-to-nyc-intersections-under-newly-passed-legislation>Gothamist</a>). He called for cameras at every intersection (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/03/20/report-red-light-running-on-the-rise-post-pandemic>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>But when the city tried to build a protected bike lane on Bailey Avenue, Dinowitz pushed back, defending parking over safety. <strong>&ldquo;We did raise serious concerns about the removal of a large number of parking spots in an area that&rsquo;s already starved for parking&mldr; We can have bike lanes and at the same time not have to remove so many parking spots&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/08/anti-car-crusade-dinowitzes-slam-bronx-harlem-river-greenway-bike-lane-touted-by-mayor>Streetsblog NYC</a>). The city’s own data shows protected lanes save lives. The fight drags on.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-demand-relentless-action>The Next Step: Demand Relentless Action</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every delay, every watered-down plan, every excuse for inaction means another family will grieve. Call Assembly Member Dinowitz. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes, not just promises. Demand action for the living, not memorials for the dead.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter, described as an 'anti-car crusade,' centers on the removal of 46 parking spots. The Dinowitzes claim the redesign ignores community voices. DOT and local advocates argue the project will cut injuries and deaths, citing crash data. A safety analyst notes the Greenway will create safe, separated space for pedestrians and cyclists, reducing harm and boosting active travel. The Dinowitzes support bike lanes in principle but resist changes that reduce parking.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the MTA, crews will completely rebuild Williams Bridge and Woodlawn, installing four new elevators—two at each station—to ensure full accessibility. The matter summary states: 'comprehensive renovation and accessibility project at three Metro-North Railroad Harlem Line stations in the Bronx.' Christian Murray reported the announcement. No council bill number or committee applies, as this is an agency initiative, not legislation. The upgrades promise to open transit to riders long shut out by stairs and barriers. Improving station accessibility encourages more walking and cycling to transit, supports mode shift away from driving, and benefits vulnerable users by making the built environment more inclusive and safer.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Their request, sent to the Department of Transportation before the crash, was denied due to low car volumes and insufficient crash history. The lawmakers, at a press conference, supported speed humps and stop signs but opposed road diets and universal daylighting. Eric Dinowitz argued, 'If you walked down any of these streets, they are far too narrow to narrow any more.' He also rejected citywide daylighting, insisting, 'Daylighting has to be done corner by corner.' The council member has criticized DOT’s safety efforts before, framing the agency as unresponsive.

The bus crashed into the wall, breaking through and leaving debris below. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz said, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." No injuries were reported, but the crash caused structural damage. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz noted, "That’s a very big bus, so even going very slowly, it can do a lot of damage," highlighting the risk of lax parking enforcement. The incident underscores systemic issues: double-parking and weak infrastructure can combine to threaten lives, even when no one is hurt.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Assemblymember Jeffrey Dinowitz said, 'People shouldn’t run red lights... when they do that they endanger other people’s lives, and people have died.' Heastie controlled the vote. A separate bill to ticket cars blocking street sweepers failed to reach the floor. Advocates pushed for both measures, but only the camera expansion passed.
