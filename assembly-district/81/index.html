Nine left with injuries so grave they may never walk the same. In Assembly District 81, the numbers do not lie: <strong>887 crashes, 571 injuries, 3 deaths in just twelve months</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The youngest lost was 24. The oldest, 83. A cyclist crushed by an SUV on E 233rd Street. A pedestrian struck crossing with the signal at Corlear Avenue. A driver killed on the Deegan. The street does not care who you are.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage.</strong> In the last three years, SUVs and cars killed four, left 64 with moderate injuries, and 11 with serious wounds. Trucks and buses killed two more. Motorcycles and mopeds, one moderate injury. Not a single fatality from a bike (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h2 id=dinowitz-votes-words-and-missed-chances>Dinowitz: Votes, Words, and Missed Chances</h2><p>Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz has backed some safety measures. He voted to expand red light cameras, saying, <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/more-red-light-cameras-coming-to-nyc-intersections-under-newly-passed-legislation>&ldquo;People shouldn’t run red lights&mldr; when they do that they endanger other people’s lives, and people have died.&rdquo;</a> He called for cameras at every intersection, pushing for stronger automated enforcement (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/03/20/report-red-light-running-on-the-rise-post-pandemic>red light running</a>). He co-sponsored <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">bills for safer street design</a> and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1280&amp;term=2023">street safety improvements</a>.</p><p>But when the city tried to narrow Riverdale Avenue—a street where seniors and children are at risk—Dinowitz stood with the local board to <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/04/01/riverdale-rumble-bronx-panel-rejects-dot-road-diet-plan-for-super-wide-avenue>block the plan</a>. The avenue stayed wide. The danger stayed with it.</p><p>When a bus nearly plunged off a Bronx overpass, Dinowitz pointed to the double-parked car that forced the driver to swerve. <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/public-safety/2025/01/17/mta-bus-rescued-after-partially-driving-off-bronx-overpass->&ldquo;We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it.&rdquo;</a> No one died that day. But the wall broke. Next time, it could be a child.</p><h2 id=what-now-the-fight-is-not-over>What Now: The Fight Is Not Over</h2><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every delay is a choice. Call Assembly Member Dinowitz. Call your council member. Demand safer street design, more cameras, and a citywide 20 mph speed limit. <strong>Do not wait for another body in the road.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Their request, sent to the Department of Transportation before the crash, was denied due to low car volumes and insufficient crash history. The lawmakers, at a press conference, supported speed humps and stop signs but opposed road diets and universal daylighting. Eric Dinowitz argued, 'If you walked down any of these streets, they are far too narrow to narrow any more.' He also rejected citywide daylighting, insisting, 'Daylighting has to be done corner by corner.' The council member has criticized DOT’s safety efforts before, framing the agency as unresponsive.

Twenty-nine dead last year. Highest ever. Reckless drivers surge post-pandemic. City report demands more cameras—jump from 150 to 1,325 intersections. Officials back the bill. Victims’ families demand action. Cameras cut crashes. But the most dangerous drivers remain loose.</p><p class=mb3>On March 20, 2024, the Department of Transportation released a report urging passage of a bill to expand New York City’s red-light camera program. The bill, supported by DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and sponsored by State Senator Andrew Goundardes, would boost camera coverage from 150 to 1,325 intersections—about 10% of the city’s 13,700 signals. The report states: “Expanding the number of intersections with red light cameras... could substantially enhance the deterrent effect of the program and return New York City to the consistently downward trend of red light-running behavior we had seen prior to the pandemic.” Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz also supports expansion, calling for cameras at every intersection. The DOT notes that cameras have slashed T-bone crashes by 65% and rear-end collisions by 49% at monitored sites, but the statutory cap blocks broader safety gains. Relatives of crash victims joined the call, demanding the city confront driver negligence and protect the community.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

If lawmakers fail to act, the city’s red-light cameras—now capped at 150 intersections—will shut off December 1, 2024. The matter, described as 'reauthorize and expand the city's red-light camera program,' is championed by Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz and Senate co-sponsor Andrew Gounardes. Dinowitz, the sponsor, urges expansion, stating, 'We should have red-light cameras on every intersection.' Gounardes expects a review and expansion. DOT data backs them: violations and rear-end crashes have dropped at camera sites. Residents like Amy Bettys call the cap dangerous. Advocacy groups support the bills, though they are not a top priority. Dinowitz stresses automated enforcement is vital with limited police. The bills await committee action. Vulnerable road users face risk if the program lapses.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
