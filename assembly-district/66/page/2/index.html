The incident occurred at 8:50 a.m. in Manhattan. The cyclist suffered severe facial lacerations, with blood running down his face as described in the narrative. The report explicitly lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'View Obstructed/Limited' as contributing factors. The BMW driver, licensed in New Jersey, was present and reportedly looked away at the moment of impact. The cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but helmet use is not cited as a contributing factor in the police report.

He urged her to vote no on revenue alternatives to congestion pricing, especially a proposed Payroll Mobility Tax (PMT) increase. Komanoff wrote, 'what motivates me...to demand congestion pricing is its power to act as a counterweight to cars and trucks and driving and traffic.' He called the PMT hike regressive, unlike congestion pricing, and warned it would undermine safer, fairer streets. The advocacy statement, published by Streetsblog NYC, highlights Komanoff’s decades of work driven by the deaths of pedestrians and cyclists. He pressed Glick to keep congestion pricing viable, framing it as the effective, equitable path for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
