Twenty-one have suffered serious injuries.</strong> In the past year alone, 458 have been hurt in crashes—cyclists, walkers, children, elders. The street is a wound that never closes.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a cyclist was left broken in the West Village. &ldquo;All my body was blood and the sweater,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/man-arrested-hit-run-52-year-old-bicyclist-west-village-last-month/16705843/>said Myung Jin Chung</a>, after a driver ran a red light, struck him, and fled. He woke up in an ambulance, memory gone. The pain lingers. The driver was arrested, but the damage is done.</p><p>A 76-year-old woman was killed crossing with the signal at Greenwich Avenue and West 10th. The car turned left. She did not make it home. The street does not forgive mistakes, but it punishes only the vulnerable.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>Cars and trucks do the killing.</strong> Of the deaths and injuries to pedestrians here, most come from sedans, SUVs, taxis, and trucks. Bikes and mopeds hurt too, but the steel machines do the worst. The numbers are plain: cars and SUVs caused four deaths, trucks and buses another. Bikes, none. The old, the young, the careful, the hurried—none are safe.</p><h2 id=what-has-glick-done>What Has Glick Done?</h2><p>Assembly Member Deborah Glick has backed speed cameras, school slow zones, and higher fines for repeat offenders. She sponsored the law that renewed New York City’s speed camera program through 2030. She called it &ldquo;an extra boost&rdquo; for safety, saying the data proves cameras cut speeds and save lives, as <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>reported by AMNY</a>. She also co-sponsored bills to raise fines for repeat speeders and to keep bike lanes clear.</p><p>But the crisis is not over. The streets are still dangerous. The laws help, but they do not heal. &ldquo;A heartbroken family is demanding accountability,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/video-allegedly-shows-nypd-officers-driving-away-from-deadly-car-crash/>reported CBS New York</a>, after police were seen leaving the scene of a fatal crash. The system protects itself. The people bleed.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call Deborah Glick. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for every person who walks or rides. <strong>Do not wait for another body in the road.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

He called the PMT hike regressive, unlike congestion pricing, and warned it would undermine safer, fairer streets.

He wants a two-way protected bike lane. The Greenway is packed. Delivery workers need space. Local boards and lawmakers back the move.</p><p class=mb3>On August 1, 2022, Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine demanded the state Department of Transportation repurpose a lane on the West Side Highway for a two-way protected bike lane. Levine wrote, 'The Hudson River Greenway is one of the most heavily used bike paths in the country... congestion has worsened significantly.' He sent his letter to state DOT Commissioner Therese Dominguez and city DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. Local elected officials and Community Board 1, which voted 41-3 in May 2020 to support the change, also back the plan. State senators, assembly members, and council members signed a letter urging the same. Levine and supporters argue the new lane would ease crowding and give e-bike delivery workers—many of them immigrants—a safe, legal route. The state DOT has resisted, citing car congestion. Advocates say more space for cyclists is overdue.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
