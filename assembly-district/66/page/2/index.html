The L train is silent for three hours. Her name is not in the news. Only her age: 24.</p><p>In the West Village, a cyclist is struck by a driver who runs a red light. The man is thrown.

One person died.</strong> Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—no one is spared. Cars and trucks did most of the damage. Taxis, SUVs, and sedans left bodies broken.

The street does not care who you are.</p><h3 id=what-has-deborah-glick-done>What Has Deborah Glick Done?</h3><p>Assembly Member Deborah Glick has moved on some fronts. She <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1236&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored a bill</a> to raise fines for drivers who block bike lanes. She <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/06/24/hochul-signs-speed-camera-bill-citing-streetsblogs-coverage-of-unsafe-school-streets>backed speed cameras</a> in school zones, pushing for 24/7 enforcement. She has signed on to bills for safer street design and speed limiters. But the pace is slow. Cameras catch speeders, but loopholes remain. Fines rise, but the dead stay dead.</p><p>Some bills shift the focus to plate covers and enforcement gadgets, not the drivers who kill. Others call for more studies, more pilots, more waiting. <strong>Every delay means another family waits for news that will break them.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by the city, the state, and the people in charge. The street can be made safe. The tools exist. The laws can change. But only if you demand it.</p><p><strong>Call Deborah Glick. Call your council member. Tell them: Enough. Lower the speed limit. Build real protection for people, not cars. End the waiting.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

He urged her to vote no on revenue alternatives to congestion pricing, especially a proposed Payroll Mobility Tax (PMT) increase. Komanoff wrote, 'what motivates me...to demand congestion pricing is its power to act as a counterweight to cars and trucks and driving and traffic.' He called the PMT hike regressive, unlike congestion pricing, and warned it would undermine safer, fairer streets. The advocacy statement, published by Streetsblog NYC, highlights Komanoff’s decades of work driven by the deaths of pedestrians and cyclists. He pressed Glick to keep congestion pricing viable, framing it as the effective, equitable path for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the truck’s wheels crushed the pedestrian’s skull, causing fatal injuries at the scene. The report explicitly lists 'Backing Unsafely' as the contributing factor for the crash. The victim was not at an intersection and was described as performing 'Other Actions in Roadway,' but the report does not cite any pedestrian behavior as a cause. The focus remains on the driver’s action: reversing a large refuse vehicle without adequate care, as documented by police.

He wants a two-way protected bike lane. The Greenway is packed. Delivery workers need space. Local boards and lawmakers back the move.</p><p class=mb3>On August 1, 2022, Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine demanded the state Department of Transportation repurpose a lane on the West Side Highway for a two-way protected bike lane. Levine wrote, 'The Hudson River Greenway is one of the most heavily used bike paths in the country... congestion has worsened significantly.' He sent his letter to state DOT Commissioner Therese Dominguez and city DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. Local elected officials and Community Board 1, which voted 41-3 in May 2020 to support the change, also back the plan. State senators, assembly members, and council members signed a letter urging the same. Levine and supporters argue the new lane would ease crowding and give e-bike delivery workers—many of them immigrants—a safe, legal route. The state DOT has resisted, citing car congestion. Advocates say more space for cyclists is overdue.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
