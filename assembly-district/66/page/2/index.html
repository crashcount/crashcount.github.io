Since 2022, eight people have died in crashes here. One was a 76-year-old woman, struck while crossing with the signal at Greenwich Avenue and West 10th. She bled out on the street. The driver failed to yield. She never made it home. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>In the last year, 455 people have been hurt in crashes. Ten were seriously injured. No one under 18 died, but eighteen children were hurt. The numbers do not stop. They only grow.</p><h3 id=the-vehicles-that-kill>The Vehicles That Kill</h3><p>Cars and SUVs did the most harm. Four deaths, 140 minor injuries, 119 moderate, six serious. Trucks and buses killed one, left sixteen with minor wounds, fourteen with worse. Bikes and e-bikes hurt fifty-three. No one is safe. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-gaps>Leadership: Progress and Gaps</h3><p>Assembly Member Deborah Glick has backed speed cameras and higher fines for repeat offenders. She co-sponsored bills to keep bike lanes clear and to require safer street design. She voted yes on more speed cameras near schools. She sponsored a bill to crack down on drivers who hide their plates from cameras. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>But Albany failed to pass the bills that matter most. &ldquo;Our elected officials in Albany have failed the livable streets movement again,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/25/d-minus-the-annual-albany-report-card-for-2025>wrote Streetsblog NYC</a>. The only big win was speed camera renewal. The rest died in committee. The status quo remains. The dead stay dead.</p><h3 id=the-call-demand-more>The Call: Demand More</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by leaders who delay, water down, or ignore the laws that save lives. Call Assembly Member Glick. Call your council member. Tell them: <strong>No more waiting. No more deaths. Pass the bills. Build the lanes. Lower the speed.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The 46-year-old man suffered severe facial lacerations and remained conscious at the scene. No mention is made of any pedestrian error or behavior contributing to the crash. The bus sustained no damage, and the driver continued without stopping, underscoring the lethal consequences of driver distraction in New York City’s dense streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The taxi’s center front end bore the impact, its nose crumpled from the force. The pedestrian was described as 'crossing against the signal,' but this detail appears only after the driver’s error is cited. The scene was marked by blood on hot concrete and the persistent hum of engines, underscoring the relentless danger faced by those on foot.

He urged her to vote no on revenue alternatives to congestion pricing, especially a proposed Payroll Mobility Tax (PMT) increase. Komanoff wrote, 'what motivates me...to demand congestion pricing is its power to act as a counterweight to cars and trucks and driving and traffic.' He called the PMT hike regressive, unlike congestion pricing, and warned it would undermine safer, fairer streets. The advocacy statement, published by Streetsblog NYC, highlights Komanoff’s decades of work driven by the deaths of pedestrians and cyclists. He pressed Glick to keep congestion pricing viable, framing it as the effective, equitable path for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The narrative describes the car’s rear end bearing the mark of the collision, with blood pooling on the crosswalk. The police report explicitly lists 'Backing Unsafely' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as contributing factors. The pedestrian was located at the intersection and was crossing with the signal, as documented in the report.

The resolution urges the New York State Legislature and Governor to pass A.5001-A/S.2515-B, which would require scramble crosswalks at intersections near schools during student arrival and dismissal. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, A.5001-A/S.2515-B, in relation to establishing scramble crosswalks leading to and from school buildings during times of student arrival and dismissal.' Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary), Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, Lincoln Restler, and Kevin C. Riley sponsored the measure. The bill responds to persistent crashes near schools and the loss of hundreds of crossing guards. Scramble crosswalks, also called Barnes Dances, stop all traffic so pedestrians cross in every direction. The council’s action highlights the ongoing danger children face on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
