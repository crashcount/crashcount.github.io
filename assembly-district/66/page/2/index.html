She cannot climb back. The train does not stop. She dies there, under the city, as <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/nyc-woman-struck-killed-train-subway-union-square-station-manhattan/16771362/>witnesses watch</a>. The L train is silent for three hours. Her name is not in the news. Only her age: 24.</p><p>In the West Village, a cyclist is struck by a driver who runs a red light. The man is thrown. His bike goes one way, his body another. &ldquo;All my body was blood and the sweater,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/man-arrested-hit-run-52-year-old-bicyclist-west-village-last-month/16705843/>he says</a>. He wakes up in an ambulance. He cannot remember the crash. The driver flees. The city keeps moving.</p><p><strong>In the last twelve months, AD 66 saw 967 crashes, 475 injuries, and 10 serious injuries. One person died.</strong> Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—no one is spared. Cars and trucks did most of the damage. Taxis, SUVs, and sedans left bodies broken. Bikes and mopeds hurt too, but the numbers are smaller. The street does not care who you are.</p><h3 id=what-has-deborah-glick-done>What Has Deborah Glick Done?</h3><p>Assembly Member Deborah Glick has moved on some fronts. She <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1236&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored a bill</a> to raise fines for drivers who block bike lanes. She <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/06/24/hochul-signs-speed-camera-bill-citing-streetsblogs-coverage-of-unsafe-school-streets>backed speed cameras</a> in school zones, pushing for 24/7 enforcement. She has signed on to bills for safer street design and speed limiters. But the pace is slow. Cameras catch speeders, but loopholes remain. Fines rise, but the dead stay dead.</p><p>Some bills shift the focus to plate covers and enforcement gadgets, not the drivers who kill. Others call for more studies, more pilots, more waiting. <strong>Every delay means another family waits for news that will break them.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by the city, the state, and the people in charge. The street can be made safe. The tools exist. The laws can change. But only if you demand it.</p><p><strong>Call Deborah Glick. Call your council member. Tell them: Enough. Lower the speed limit. Build real protection for people, not cars. End the waiting.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

He urged her to vote no on revenue alternatives to congestion pricing, especially a proposed Payroll Mobility Tax (PMT) increase. Komanoff wrote, 'what motivates me...to demand congestion pricing is its power to act as a counterweight to cars and trucks and driving and traffic.' He called the PMT hike regressive, unlike congestion pricing, and warned it would undermine safer, fairer streets. The advocacy statement, published by Streetsblog NYC, highlights Komanoff’s decades of work driven by the deaths of pedestrians and cyclists. He pressed Glick to keep congestion pricing viable, framing it as the effective, equitable path for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move aims to cut deadly conflict between cars and kids. Filed at session’s end, the resolution targets peak arrival and dismissal. Sponsors push Albany to act. Streets remain risky.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0792-2023 was filed by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on September 28, 2023, and closed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. The resolution urges the New York State Legislature and Governor to pass A.5001-A/S.2515-B, which would require scramble crosswalks at intersections near schools during student arrival and dismissal. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, A.5001-A/S.2515-B, in relation to establishing scramble crosswalks leading to and from school buildings during times of student arrival and dismissal.' Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary), Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, Lincoln Restler, and Kevin C. Riley sponsored the measure. The bill responds to persistent crashes near schools and the loss of hundreds of crossing guards. Scramble crosswalks, also called Barnes Dances, stop all traffic so pedestrians cross in every direction. The council’s action highlights the ongoing danger children face on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Levine wrote, 'The Hudson River Greenway is one of the most heavily used bike paths in the country... congestion has worsened significantly.' He sent his letter to state DOT Commissioner Therese Dominguez and city DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. Local elected officials and Community Board 1, which voted 41-3 in May 2020 to support the change, also back the plan. State senators, assembly members, and council members signed a letter urging the same. Levine and supporters argue the new lane would ease crowding and give e-bike delivery workers—many of them immigrants—a safe, legal route. The state DOT has resisted, citing car congestion. Advocates say more space for cyclists is overdue.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
