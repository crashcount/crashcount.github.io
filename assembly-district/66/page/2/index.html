Twenty-four left with injuries so grave they may never walk the same.</strong> In just the last twelve months, <strong>one person died and twelve suffered serious injuries</strong> on these streets (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).

Trucks and buses killed one, left dozens hurt. Bikes, mopeds, and motorcycles injured many, but did not kill (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The pattern is clear. The larger the vehicle, the greater the harm. The street does not forgive.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Assembly Member Deborah Glick has acted. She sponsored and voted to extend the city’s school speed camera program through 2030, a move praised as an <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>&ldquo;extra boost&rdquo; for automated enforcement</a>. She pushed for <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">bills to expand camera enforcement</a> and keep speeders from dodging the law. When the city’s cameras went 24/7, Glick <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-speed-cameras-can-now-operate-247>dismissed critics</a>: &ldquo;The city isn&rsquo;t in the car with you&mldr; If you don&rsquo;t want to get a ticket, don&rsquo;t speed.&rdquo; But loopholes remain. The worst repeat offenders still slip through. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not. The blood dries, but the danger stays.</p><h3 id=the-next-fight>The Next Fight</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong> The law now lets New York set safer speeds. The cameras are watching, but the cars keep coming. <strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat speeders.</strong> The dead cannot speak. The living must.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

According to the police report, the collision occurred at 13:37 and resulted in a fatal head wound. The report states the driver’s actions included 'Traffic Control Disregarded,' highlighting a failure to obey traffic signals. The taxi’s center front end bore the impact, its nose crumpled from the force. The pedestrian was described as 'crossing against the signal,' but this detail appears only after the driver’s error is cited. The scene was marked by blood on hot concrete and the persistent hum of engines, underscoring the relentless danger faced by those on foot. No other contributing factors were listed for the driver.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

He urged her to vote no on revenue alternatives to congestion pricing, especially a proposed Payroll Mobility Tax (PMT) increase. Komanoff wrote, 'what motivates me...to demand congestion pricing is its power to act as a counterweight to cars and trucks and driving and traffic.' He called the PMT hike regressive, unlike congestion pricing, and warned it would undermine safer, fairer streets. The advocacy statement, published by Streetsblog NYC, highlights Komanoff’s decades of work driven by the deaths of pedestrians and cyclists. He pressed Glick to keep congestion pricing viable, framing it as the effective, equitable path for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The victim was not at an intersection and was described as performing 'Other Actions in Roadway,' but the report does not cite any pedestrian behavior as a cause.

The report states the 19-year-old rider was ejected, landing hard on the asphalt, bleeding severely from his eye but remaining conscious. The police report lists 'Following Too Closely' as the contributing factor in the collision.

According to the police report, 'Blood poured from his leg. The lane was narrow. The metal did not yield. He stayed conscious.' The cyclist suffered a serious leg injury with severe bleeding. The crash involved improper passing or lane usage and passing too closely, as listed under contributing factors. The ambulance, a Ford truck, was traveling straight ahead. The cyclist was not wearing a helmet, as noted in the report, but helmet use was not listed as a contributing factor. No injuries were reported among the ambulance occupants. The impact highlights the danger of narrow lanes and improper lane usage for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
