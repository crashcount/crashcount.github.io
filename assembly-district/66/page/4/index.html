In 2022, the city won 24/7 school‑zone enforcement, and Assembly Member <a href=https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Deborah-J-Glick>Deborah Glick</a> backed it. “The city isn’t in the car with you… If you don’t want to get a ticket, don’t speed,” she said (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-speed-cameras-can-now-operate-247>Gothamist</a>).

Assembly Member <a href=https://nyassembly.gov/mem/Deborah-J-Glick>Deborah Glick</a> is listed here as a co‑sponsor on the Assembly side (<a href=#>CrashCount timeline</a>). The proposal would force habitual speeders onto intelligent speed assistance, cutting their cars off at the limit (<a href=/take_action/>/take_action/</a>).</p><p>Council District 2’s <a href=/council-district/2/>Carlina Rivera</a> and State Senator <a href=/senate-district/27/>Brian Kavanagh</a> represent large parts of this area.

The fight against traffic violence continues.</p><p class=mb3>Bill to extend and expand New York City's automated speed camera program advanced on May 20, 2022. Assemblywoman Deborah Glick, representing District 66, cosponsors the legislation. The bill awaits City Council approval. The measure allows cameras to operate 24/7, instead of limited weekday hours. The matter summary states: 'State lawmakers have reached a deal to extend and expand a New York City traffic camera program that has ticketed reckless drivers in school zones since 2013.' Glick said, 'Speeding, as we all know, has become more prolific during the pandemic.' State Senator Andrew Gounardes, Senate sponsor, said, 'Speed cameras save lives.' Mayor Adams called the bill a 'major victory for New Yorkers.' City data shows speeding dropped 72% during camera hours. The extension aims to curb rising traffic violence and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
