The city logs 3,868 crashes, 1,649 injuries, and 25 serious injuries in this district’s span of years we track. SUVs and sedans do most of the harm to people on foot.

They are the pattern.</p><h3 id=where-the-street-bites>Where the street bites</h3><p>The police files say when and where people get hurt. Injuries peak at lunch and the late afternoon into the evening. From noon to 8 p.m., the injuries mount hour by hour. Deaths show up at 10 a.m., 1 p.m., 4 p.m., 7 p.m., 8 p.m., 11 p.m., and even 5 a.m. The pain does not keep regular hours. <a href=#sources>District curve</a>.</p><p>The worst corridors include Lafayette Street, Avenue of the Americas, Hudson Street, and West Houston. Lafayette logs 27 injuries and three serious injuries. Sixth Avenue sees 72 injuries. Hudson has 27. West Houston, 23. These are not numbers on a page. They are places you walk. <a href=#sources>Hotspots</a>.</p><p>The city blames “other” most often. After that come failure to yield, inattention, and unsafe speed. But when a driver turns left into a person with the light, the code reads the same: failure to yield. <a href=#sources>Contributing factors</a>.</p><h3 id=turn-strike-repeat>Turn, strike, repeat</h3><p>Left turns keep killing. The fatal files here read like a loop: left‑turning sedan at Greenwich and W 10th; left‑turning SUV at Spring and Crosby. Center‑front impacts. People in the crosswalk with the signal. The driver’s bumper meets a human body. Then the paperwork. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>4667744</a>. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>4767502</a>.</p><p>Large vehicles kill when they back up. The Cornelia Street death is a line in a spreadsheet: “Garbage or Refuse,” “Backing,” “Crush Injuries.” It is also a body in an alley. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>4725065</a>.</p><p>Inside cars, people die too. A December 2023 crash at Sixth Ave and Bleecker lists a 40‑year‑old driver dead after an SUV hit a parked taxi. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>4688160</a>.</p><h3 id=the-fixes-are-known>The fixes are known</h3><p>This district bleeds at left‑turns and tight lanes.

Pull back parking so people can see and be seen.</li><li>Ban or tightly manage backing movements on narrow blocks like Cornelia during peak hours.

The street still waits.</h3><p>Albany renewed 24/7 school‑zone speed cameras through 2030. Assembly Member Deborah Glick sponsored and backed the bill. <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>AMNY</a> reports, and the Senate file confirms the extension. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>S 8344</a>. Glick also sponsored the Assembly version. <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A8787&amp;term=2025">A 8787</a>. Cameras slow some streets. Children walk with a bit more cover.</p><p>But the killing keeps its pace outside school zones and outside camera sights. We know who pays: pedestrians most of all, then cyclists, then the rest. The city’s own rollup shows it. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a>.</p><p>Two more tools stand ready. A lower default speed limit across the city. And speed limiters for the drivers who rack up violation after violation. The case is laid out by state bills and advocates. One proposal would force repeat speeders to install intelligent speed control. Survivors and families say it will save lives.

The measure, sponsored by Assemblymember Deborah Glick (District 66) and Senator Andrew Gounardes, allows speed cameras to operate 24/7 in up to 750 school zones. The bill was set to expire but now runs through July 1, 2025. The matter summary states: 'New York City is now able to operate its speed cameras 24 hours a day.' Glick, who sponsored the bill, dismissed criticism that cameras are a cash grab, saying, 'The city isn't in the car with you... If you don't want to get a ticket, don't speed.' Mayor Eric Adams called the cameras a deterrent, not a punishment. Advocates say the law will slow cars and protect pedestrians, especially children. The bill passed just before the legislative session ended, closing a deadly loophole in city enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Assembly Member Deborah Glick and State Senator Andrew Gounardes, was passed after statistics showed rising crashes and injuries near schools. The matter summary: 'The city's school zone speed cameras will now operate 24/7 year-round.' Hochul cited student deaths and the need for constant protection. Mayor Adams called the program a national model, noting, '72 percent of fatalities have been happening when the cameras were off.' The bill was weakened from its original form, dropping escalating fines and stricter penalties for repeat offenders due to City Council concerns. Glick and Gounardes pledged to push for stronger measures. A separate bill to expand red light cameras failed. The new law closes deadly loopholes but leaves enforcement gaps for repeat offenders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The statement, titled 'New York Must Stop Subsidizing Car Usage,' highlights a 44 percent rise in traffic fatalities and criticizes the city’s car-centric policies. Kessler, a candidate for Assembly District 66, calls out incumbent Deborah Glick for supporting speed-camera renewal but failing to reduce car dominance. He states, 'To get cars off the streets, we have to stop subsidizing their usage.' Kessler pledges to expand protected bike and bus lanes, end free curbside parking, and push for weight-based vehicle fees. He argues that current subsidies—free parking, gas-tax holidays, and slow-walked congestion pricing—endanger New Yorkers, especially those outside cars.

Vulnerable road users remain exposed to reckless drivers.</p><p class=mb3>On May 23, 2022, the New York State legislature passed a bill allowing New York City to operate speed cameras 24/7. The bill, sponsored by Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assembly Member Deborah Glick, originally included tougher measures: escalating fines, registration suspensions, and insurance reporting for repeat speeders. These provisions were stripped during negotiations, leaving only the round-the-clock camera operation. Assembly Member Glick said, 'keeping the cameras on 24/7 was that hill.' Mayor Eric Adams called it 'a major victory for New Yorkers that will save lives.' Advocacy groups and lawmakers voiced frustration at Albany’s reluctance to adopt stronger safety tools. The final law removes blackout periods for cameras, but leaves dangerous drivers with fewer consequences. The bill passed despite disappointment over its dilution, exposing the limits of legislative action for street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Andrew Gounardes introduced the measure on May 19, 2022. The bill allows cameras in up to 750 school zones to run around the clock until July 1, 2025. Assemblymember Deborah Glick, District 66, is expected to sponsor the bill in the Assembly. The bill summary states it will 'allow New York City to extend its soon-to-expire speed camera program and keep the devices running 24 hours a day.' Mayor Eric Adams called the deal 'a major victory for New Yorkers that will save lives and help stem the tide of traffic violence.' The bill dropped harsher penalties for repeat offenders, focusing on the extension and expanded hours. The City Council must approve a home rule message before the state Legislature votes.
