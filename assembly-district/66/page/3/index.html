Twenty-four left with injuries so grave they may never walk the same.</strong> In just the last twelve months, <strong>one person died and twelve suffered serious injuries</strong> on these streets (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).

Trucks and buses killed one, left dozens hurt. Bikes, mopeds, and motorcycles injured many, but did not kill (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The pattern is clear. The larger the vehicle, the greater the harm. The street does not forgive.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Assembly Member Deborah Glick has acted. She sponsored and voted to extend the city’s school speed camera program through 2030, a move praised as an <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>&ldquo;extra boost&rdquo; for automated enforcement</a>. She pushed for <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">bills to expand camera enforcement</a> and keep speeders from dodging the law. When the city’s cameras went 24/7, Glick <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-speed-cameras-can-now-operate-247>dismissed critics</a>: &ldquo;The city isn&rsquo;t in the car with you&mldr; If you don&rsquo;t want to get a ticket, don&rsquo;t speed.&rdquo; But loopholes remain. The worst repeat offenders still slip through. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not. The blood dries, but the danger stays.</p><h3 id=the-next-fight>The Next Fight</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong> The law now lets New York set safer speeds. The cameras are watching, but the cars keep coming. <strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat speeders.</strong> The dead cannot speak. The living must.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The law aims to slow cars, protect people, and keep streets safer for everyone.</p><p class=mb3>On June 24, 2022, Governor Kathy Hochul signed a bill extending and expanding New York City's speed camera program. The measure, sponsored by Assemblymember Deborah Glick (District 66) and Senator Andrew Gounardes, allows speed cameras to operate 24/7 in up to 750 school zones. The bill was set to expire but now runs through July 1, 2025. The matter summary states: 'New York City is now able to operate its speed cameras 24 hours a day.' Glick, who sponsored the bill, dismissed criticism that cameras are a cash grab, saying, 'The city isn't in the car with you... If you don't want to get a ticket, don't speed.' Mayor Eric Adams called the cameras a deterrent, not a punishment. Advocates say the law will slow cars and protect pedestrians, especially children. The bill passed just before the legislative session ended, closing a deadly loophole in city enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Assembly Member Deborah Glick and State Senator Andrew Gounardes, was passed after statistics showed rising crashes and injuries near schools. The matter summary: 'The city's school zone speed cameras will now operate 24/7 year-round.' Hochul cited student deaths and the need for constant protection. Mayor Adams called the program a national model, noting, '72 percent of fatalities have been happening when the cameras were off.' The bill was weakened from its original form, dropping escalating fines and stricter penalties for repeat offenders due to City Council concerns. Glick and Gounardes pledged to push for stronger measures. A separate bill to expand red light cameras failed. The new law closes deadly loopholes but leaves enforcement gaps for repeat offenders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Fifty-nine killed by cars in three months. Streets favor SUVs over people. Full-time speed cameras help, but car subsidies fuel the carnage. Ryder Kessler calls for bold action: end giveaways, reclaim space, protect the vulnerable.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2022, Ryder Kessler published an opinion piece urging New York to stop subsidizing car usage. The statement, titled 'New York Must Stop Subsidizing Car Usage,' highlights a 44 percent rise in traffic fatalities and criticizes the city’s car-centric policies. Kessler, a candidate for Assembly District 66, calls out incumbent Deborah Glick for supporting speed-camera renewal but failing to reduce car dominance. He states, 'To get cars off the streets, we have to stop subsidizing their usage.' Kessler pledges to expand protected bike and bus lanes, end free curbside parking, and push for weight-based vehicle fees. He argues that current subsidies—free parking, gas-tax holidays, and slow-walked congestion pricing—endanger New Yorkers, especially those outside cars. The piece demands systemic change to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assembly Member Deborah Glick, originally included tougher measures: escalating fines, registration suspensions, and insurance reporting for repeat speeders. These provisions were stripped during negotiations, leaving only the round-the-clock camera operation. Assembly Member Glick said, 'keeping the cameras on 24/7 was that hill.' Mayor Eric Adams called it 'a major victory for New Yorkers that will save lives.' Advocacy groups and lawmakers voiced frustration at Albany’s reluctance to adopt stronger safety tools. The final law removes blackout periods for cameras, but leaves dangerous drivers with fewer consequences. The bill passed despite disappointment over its dilution, exposing the limits of legislative action for street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Mayor Eric Adams called the deal 'a major victory for New Yorkers that will save lives and help stem the tide of traffic violence.' The bill dropped harsher penalties for repeat offenders, focusing on the extension and expanded hours. The City Council must approve a home rule message before the state Legislature votes.
