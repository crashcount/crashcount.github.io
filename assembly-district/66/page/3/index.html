Since 2022, eight people have died in crashes here. One was a 76-year-old woman, struck while crossing with the signal at Greenwich Avenue and West 10th. She bled out on the street. The driver failed to yield. She never made it home. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>In the last year, 455 people have been hurt in crashes. Ten were seriously injured. No one under 18 died, but eighteen children were hurt. The numbers do not stop. They only grow.</p><h3 id=the-vehicles-that-kill>The Vehicles That Kill</h3><p>Cars and SUVs did the most harm. Four deaths, 140 minor injuries, 119 moderate, six serious. Trucks and buses killed one, left sixteen with minor wounds, fourteen with worse. Bikes and e-bikes hurt fifty-three. No one is safe. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-gaps>Leadership: Progress and Gaps</h3><p>Assembly Member Deborah Glick has backed speed cameras and higher fines for repeat offenders. She co-sponsored bills to keep bike lanes clear and to require safer street design. She voted yes on more speed cameras near schools. She sponsored a bill to crack down on drivers who hide their plates from cameras. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>But Albany failed to pass the bills that matter most. &ldquo;Our elected officials in Albany have failed the livable streets movement again,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/25/d-minus-the-annual-albany-report-card-for-2025>wrote Streetsblog NYC</a>. The only big win was speed camera renewal. The rest died in committee. The status quo remains. The dead stay dead.</p><h3 id=the-call-demand-more>The Call: Demand More</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by leaders who delay, water down, or ignore the laws that save lives. Call Assembly Member Glick. Call your council member. Tell them: <strong>No more waiting. No more deaths. Pass the bills. Build the lanes. Lower the speed.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The measure, sponsored by Assemblymember Deborah Glick (District 66) and Senator Andrew Gounardes, allows speed cameras to operate 24/7 in up to 750 school zones. The bill was set to expire but now runs through July 1, 2025. The matter summary states: 'New York City is now able to operate its speed cameras 24 hours a day.' Glick, who sponsored the bill, dismissed criticism that cameras are a cash grab, saying, 'The city isn't in the car with you... If you don't want to get a ticket, don't speed.' Mayor Eric Adams called the cameras a deterrent, not a punishment. Advocates say the law will slow cars and protect pedestrians, especially children.

The matter summary: 'The city's school zone speed cameras will now operate 24/7 year-round.' Hochul cited student deaths and the need for constant protection. Mayor Adams called the program a national model, noting, '72 percent of fatalities have been happening when the cameras were off.' The bill was weakened from its original form, dropping escalating fines and stricter penalties for repeat offenders due to City Council concerns. Glick and Gounardes pledged to push for stronger measures. A separate bill to expand red light cameras failed.

The statement, titled 'New York Must Stop Subsidizing Car Usage,' highlights a 44 percent rise in traffic fatalities and criticizes the city’s car-centric policies. Kessler, a candidate for Assembly District 66, calls out incumbent Deborah Glick for supporting speed-camera renewal but failing to reduce car dominance. He states, 'To get cars off the streets, we have to stop subsidizing their usage.' Kessler pledges to expand protected bike and bus lanes, end free curbside parking, and push for weight-based vehicle fees. He argues that current subsidies—free parking, gas-tax holidays, and slow-walked congestion pricing—endanger New Yorkers, especially those outside cars.

Mayor Eric Adams called it 'a major victory for New Yorkers that will save lives.' Advocacy groups and lawmakers voiced frustration at Albany’s reluctance to adopt stronger safety tools. The final law removes blackout periods for cameras, but leaves dangerous drivers with fewer consequences.
