She died. The police report lists “Failure to Yield Right‑of‑Way.” The impact was front‑center. The turn was left. The date was Oct. 3, 2023. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City data names it all</a>.</p><p>At Spring and Crosby, a Jeep SUV turned left and struck a 54‑year‑old woman in the crosswalk. She was crossing with the signal. She died. The vehicle was a 2015 SUV, New Jersey plates. The point of impact was the right front bumper. The cause again: failure to yield. The date was Oct. 28, 2024. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The city’s crash file says so</a>.</p><p>On Cornelia Street, a garbage truck backed up and crushed a 35‑year‑old man. He died in the roadway. The report lists “Backing Unsafely.” The date was May 16, 2024. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>It’s in the record</a>.</p><p>By the clock, injuries stack up across the day. Noon hurts. So do the commute hours. Fatal spikes hit at 5 a.m., 10 a.m., 1 p.m., 4 p.m., 7 p.m., 8 p.m., and 11 p.m. in this district’s record. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The hourly grid is cold and clear</a>.</p><h3 id=where-the-street-bleeds>Where the street bleeds</h3><p>Lafayette Street, Sixth Avenue, Hudson, West Houston. These names repeat in the logs. Lafayette shows 27 injuries and three serious. Sixth Avenue has 72 injuries. Hudson and West Houston add more. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The city maps these hotspots</a>.</p><p>Pedestrians take the harshest blow: six dead, 417 injured since 2022. Cyclists: 496 injured. No cyclist deaths in this span, but bones and faces don’t count as luck. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The mode split is plain</a>.</p><p>The killers are familiar: failure to yield, unsafe backing, and “other.” Speed shows up less on the form here, but when a sedan hit fast on Seventh Avenue this March, a pedestrian’s pelvis shattered. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Each field has a name</a>.</p><h3 id=left-turns-heavy-fronts>Left turns, heavy fronts</h3><p>The turn is the pattern. Both West 10th and Spring had left‑turning cars striking people who had the signal. Front‑center. Right front. A body against the grille. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The reports match</a>.</p><p>Trucks and buses are fewer, but weight wins. A 2020 garbage truck, backing, ended a life on a narrow block. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>That’s in the log</a>.</p><p>At Bowery and East 4th, a taxi going straight hit a 79‑year‑old woman.

Pedestrians were killed by sedans, SUVs, taxis, and a truck. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The roll‑up shows it</a>.</p><p>This year to date, crashes are up 26% over last year’s pace; injuries up 48%; serious injuries up 150%.

Harden them with posts. Give people a head start at the signal. Daylight the crosswalks at Lafayette and at Sixth, and on Spring. Protect Cornelia from trucks backing blind.

Start there, then move.</p><h3 id=citywide-levers-right-now>Citywide levers, right now</h3><p>Albany renewed New York City’s 24/7 school‑zone speed cameras through 2030. “Speed cameras have cut speeding by over 60% in locations where installed,” sponsors said when pushing earlier renewals. Assembly Member Deborah Glick backed this year’s extension. <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>AMNY reported the renewal</a> and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A8787&amp;term=2025">Open States lists the bill</a>.</p><p>The state also passed S.8344 to extend and clean up school speed‑zone rules; Glick voted yes. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>The record shows the vote</a>. In 2022, the city’s cameras went 24/7. “The city isn&rsquo;t in the car with you&mldr; If you don&rsquo;t want to get a ticket, don&rsquo;t speed,” Glick said then. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-speed-cameras-can-now-operate-247>Gothamist captured that line</a>.</p><p>Now use the tools. Lower speeds save lives. New Yorkers can also press Albany to rein in the worst repeat speeders with intelligent limiters; bills to expand camera enforcement are on file. <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">See A7997</a>.</p><h3 id=one-ask>One ask</h3><p>This district’s dead include a woman in a crosswalk on a bright corner. A man pinned by a truck in a quiet lane. Names missing from mailboxes.</p><p>Act. Push the city to slow the default speed and the state to stop repeat speeders.

The measure, sponsored by Assemblymember Deborah Glick (District 66) and Senator Andrew Gounardes, allows speed cameras to operate 24/7 in up to 750 school zones. The bill was set to expire but now runs through July 1, 2025. The matter summary states: 'New York City is now able to operate its speed cameras 24 hours a day.' Glick, who sponsored the bill, dismissed criticism that cameras are a cash grab, saying, 'The city isn't in the car with you... If you don't want to get a ticket, don't speed.' Mayor Eric Adams called the cameras a deterrent, not a punishment. Advocates say the law will slow cars and protect pedestrians, especially children. The bill passed just before the legislative session ended, closing a deadly loophole in city enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Assembly Member Deborah Glick and State Senator Andrew Gounardes, was passed after statistics showed rising crashes and injuries near schools. The matter summary: 'The city's school zone speed cameras will now operate 24/7 year-round.' Hochul cited student deaths and the need for constant protection. Mayor Adams called the program a national model, noting, '72 percent of fatalities have been happening when the cameras were off.' The bill was weakened from its original form, dropping escalating fines and stricter penalties for repeat offenders due to City Council concerns. Glick and Gounardes pledged to push for stronger measures. A separate bill to expand red light cameras failed.

The statement, titled 'New York Must Stop Subsidizing Car Usage,' highlights a 44 percent rise in traffic fatalities and criticizes the city’s car-centric policies. Kessler, a candidate for Assembly District 66, calls out incumbent Deborah Glick for supporting speed-camera renewal but failing to reduce car dominance. He states, 'To get cars off the streets, we have to stop subsidizing their usage.' Kessler pledges to expand protected bike and bus lanes, end free curbside parking, and push for weight-based vehicle fees. He argues that current subsidies—free parking, gas-tax holidays, and slow-walked congestion pricing—endanger New Yorkers, especially those outside cars.

The bill, sponsored by Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assembly Member Deborah Glick, originally included tougher measures: escalating fines, registration suspensions, and insurance reporting for repeat speeders. These provisions were stripped during negotiations, leaving only the round-the-clock camera operation. Assembly Member Glick said, 'keeping the cameras on 24/7 was that hill.' Mayor Eric Adams called it 'a major victory for New Yorkers that will save lives.' Advocacy groups and lawmakers voiced frustration at Albany’s reluctance to adopt stronger safety tools. The final law removes blackout periods for cameras, but leaves dangerous drivers with fewer consequences.

Andrew Gounardes introduced the measure on May 19, 2022. The bill allows cameras in up to 750 school zones to run around the clock until July 1, 2025. Assemblymember Deborah Glick, District 66, is expected to sponsor the bill in the Assembly. The bill summary states it will 'allow New York City to extend its soon-to-expire speed camera program and keep the devices running 24 hours a day.' Mayor Eric Adams called the deal 'a major victory for New Yorkers that will save lives and help stem the tide of traffic violence.' The bill dropped harsher penalties for repeat offenders, focusing on the extension and expanded hours. The City Council must approve a home rule message before the state Legislature votes.
