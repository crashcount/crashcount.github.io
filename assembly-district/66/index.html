A delivery worker, doored in Soho and thrown under a truck. A 76-year-old woman, struck dead while crossing with the light. In the last twelve months, <strong>471 people have been injured and 9 seriously hurt</strong> in Assembly District 66. One did not survive. The names fade. The pain does not.</p><h2 id=the-system-favors-steel-not-flesh>The System Favors Steel, Not Flesh</h2><p><strong>Cars and trucks did the most damage.</strong> In three years, they killed 8 and seriously injured 20. Bikes and mopeds hurt people too, but the numbers are smaller. The streets are not safe for anyone without a steel shell. The dead are old and young, walking or riding, crossing with the signal or just trying to get home.</p><p>A cyclist, left broken in the street, said, &ldquo;All my body was blood and the sweater&mldr; All my memory is gone.

She co-sponsored bills to raise fines for blocking bike lanes and to require safer street designs. She also pushed for more speed cameras to catch drivers hiding their plates <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">A 7997</a>. But some bills shift the focus to ticketing technicalities, not stopping the killing.</p><p>Meanwhile, police crack down on cyclists and delivery workers. One protester put it plain: &ldquo;It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/it-seems-unfair-e-bike-riders-protest-nypd-crackdown-and-criminal-summonses>said Cecil Scheib</a>. The drivers keep driving.

The demonstration, which began at Union Square, challenged new policies issuing criminal summonses for minor cycling offenses. Riders followed traffic laws, highlighting the crackdown’s contradictions. One cyclist, Erin Poland, said the policy 'is not actually protecting cyclists [but] putting them in more danger.' Another, Tara Pham, noted, 'I’ve been hit by vehicles twice... those drivers face no criminal charges.' The article details how police arrested a Citi Bike rider for not moving aside and lacking ID, while drivers who injure vulnerable road users often avoid serious consequences.

Cyclists and advocates argue the penalties are harsher than those faced by drivers for similar actions. As one protester said, “It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.” Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the crackdown, citing the lack of licensing for e-bikes as a challenge for enforcement, but acknowledged the need for legislative reform. The article highlights inconsistent enforcement and the risks faced by vulnerable road users, especially delivery workers. Policy gaps and unequal penalties expose systemic danger on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
