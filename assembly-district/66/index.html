She cannot climb back. The train does not stop. She dies there, under the city, as <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/nyc-woman-struck-killed-train-subway-union-square-station-manhattan/16771362/>witnesses watch</a>. The L train is silent for three hours. Her name is not in the news. Only her age: 24.</p><p>In the West Village, a cyclist is struck by a driver who runs a red light. The man is thrown. His bike goes one way, his body another. &ldquo;All my body was blood and the sweater,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/man-arrested-hit-run-52-year-old-bicyclist-west-village-last-month/16705843/>he says</a>. He wakes up in an ambulance. He cannot remember the crash. The driver flees. The city keeps moving.</p><p><strong>In the last twelve months, AD 66 saw 967 crashes, 475 injuries, and 10 serious injuries. One person died.</strong> Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—no one is spared. Cars and trucks did most of the damage. Taxis, SUVs, and sedans left bodies broken. Bikes and mopeds hurt too, but the numbers are smaller. The street does not care who you are.</p><h3 id=what-has-deborah-glick-done>What Has Deborah Glick Done?</h3><p>Assembly Member Deborah Glick has moved on some fronts. She <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1236&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored a bill</a> to raise fines for drivers who block bike lanes. She <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/06/24/hochul-signs-speed-camera-bill-citing-streetsblogs-coverage-of-unsafe-school-streets>backed speed cameras</a> in school zones, pushing for 24/7 enforcement. She has signed on to bills for safer street design and speed limiters. But the pace is slow. Cameras catch speeders, but loopholes remain. Fines rise, but the dead stay dead.</p><p>Some bills shift the focus to plate covers and enforcement gadgets, not the drivers who kill. Others call for more studies, more pilots, more waiting. <strong>Every delay means another family waits for news that will break them.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by the city, the state, and the people in charge. The street can be made safe. The tools exist. The laws can change. But only if you demand it.</p><p><strong>Call Deborah Glick. Call your council member. Tell them: Enough. Lower the speed limit. Build real protection for people, not cars. End the waiting.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The crackdown targets delivery workers, especially undocumented riders, for offenses like sidewalk riding and nonstandard bike setups. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the move, stating, 'When it comes to traffic safety, compliance is not optional.' Protesters and advocates argue the policy is discriminatory and escalates minor violations, risking severe consequences for vulnerable workers. Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives called it 'really inappropriate escalation.'

Cyclists and advocates argue the penalties are harsher than those faced by drivers for similar actions. As one protester said, “It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.” Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the crackdown, citing the lack of licensing for e-bikes as a challenge for enforcement, but acknowledged the need for legislative reform.

He called the PMT hike regressive, unlike congestion pricing, and warned it would undermine safer, fairer streets. The advocacy statement, published by Streetsblog NYC, highlights Komanoff’s decades of work driven by the deaths of pedestrians and cyclists.
