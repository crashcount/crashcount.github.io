Since 2022, <strong>six pedestrians are dead</strong> here, alongside three people inside vehicles. Hundreds are hurt. The city logs 3,868 crashes, 1,649 injuries, and 25 serious injuries in this district’s span of years we track. SUVs and sedans do most of the harm to people on foot. Trucks and buses add their share. The toll does not pause.</p><ul><li>Pedestrian injuries tied to sedans: 112, with two deaths. SUVs: 101, with two deaths. Trucks: 25, with one death.

The city marked “backing unsafely.” He died there. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4725065</a>.</p></li><li><p>On June 23, 2024, at Bowery and E 4th, a taxi going straight hit a 79‑year‑old woman at the intersection.

They are the pattern.</p><h3 id=where-the-street-bites>Where the street bites</h3><p>The police files say when and where people get hurt. Injuries peak at lunch and the late afternoon into the evening. From noon to 8 p.m., the injuries mount hour by hour. Deaths show up at 10 a.m., 1 p.m., 4 p.m., 7 p.m., 8 p.m., 11 p.m., and even 5 a.m. The pain does not keep regular hours. <a href=#sources>District curve</a>.</p><p>The worst corridors include Lafayette Street, Avenue of the Americas, Hudson Street, and West Houston. Lafayette logs 27 injuries and three serious injuries. Sixth Avenue sees 72 injuries. Hudson has 27. West Houston, 23. These are not numbers on a page. They are places you walk. <a href=#sources>Hotspots</a>.</p><p>The city blames “other” most often. After that come failure to yield, inattention, and unsafe speed. But when a driver turns left into a person with the light, the code reads the same: failure to yield. <a href=#sources>Contributing factors</a>.</p><h3 id=turn-strike-repeat>Turn, strike, repeat</h3><p>Left turns keep killing. The fatal files here read like a loop: left‑turning sedan at Greenwich and W 10th; left‑turning SUV at Spring and Crosby. Center‑front impacts. People in the crosswalk with the signal. The driver’s bumper meets a human body. Then the paperwork. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>4667744</a>. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>4767502</a>.</p><p>Large vehicles kill when they back up. The Cornelia Street death is a line in a spreadsheet: “Garbage or Refuse,” “Backing,” “Crush Injuries.” It is also a body in an alley. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>4725065</a>.</p><p>Inside cars, people die too. A December 2023 crash at Sixth Ave and Bleecker lists a 40‑year‑old driver dead after an SUV hit a parked taxi. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>4688160</a>.</p><h3 id=the-fixes-are-known>The fixes are known</h3><p>This district bleeds at left‑turns and tight lanes.

Pull back parking so people can see and be seen.</li><li>Ban or tightly manage backing movements on narrow blocks like Cornelia during peak hours. Separate truck routes from the foot traffic that fills these streets. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City data</a>.</li></ul><h3 id=politics-moves-the-street-still-waits>Politics moves. The street still waits.</h3><p>Albany renewed 24/7 school‑zone speed cameras through 2030. Assembly Member Deborah Glick sponsored and backed the bill. <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>AMNY</a> reports, and the Senate file confirms the extension. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>S 8344</a>. Glick also sponsored the Assembly version. <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A8787&amp;term=2025">A 8787</a>. Cameras slow some streets. Children walk with a bit more cover.</p><p>But the killing keeps its pace outside school zones and outside camera sights. We know who pays: pedestrians most of all, then cyclists, then the rest. The city’s own rollup shows it. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a>.</p><p>Two more tools stand ready. A lower default speed limit across the city. And speed limiters for the drivers who rack up violation after violation. The case is laid out by state bills and advocates. One proposal would force repeat speeders to install intelligent speed control. Survivors and families say it will save lives. See our <a href=/take_action/>take action guide</a>, with sources and bills linked.</p><h3 id=fourteen-blocks-of-promise>Fourteen blocks of promise</h3><p>The city says 14th Street will be redesigned, with a goal to “improve the pedestrian experience.” Money is set: $3 million in design, with the city and two BIDs paying. Work begins next year, the report says. It will help where it lands. The rest of the map still waits its turn. <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/15/redesign-of-14th-street-to-kick-off-next-year>NY1</a>.</p><p>The record is the record. Since 2022, nine dead here. Pedestrians take the brunt. Left turns. Backing trucks. Center‑front impacts. Noon to night. The names are not in the files we cite. The dates and the corners are. The corners are yours.</p><p>Bold steps sit on paper. The street asks for steel and paint. Slower speeds everywhere. Limiters on the worst drivers. Harden the turns. Clear the corners. Do it before the next line gets added.</p><p>Act now. One call, one email, one push.

The Streetsblog NYC report reads: "Our elected officials in Albany have failed the livable streets movement again." Despite support for measures like speed camera reauthorization, most bills to protect pedestrians and cyclists died in committee or never reached the floor. Assembly Member Amy Sohn and others criticized the lack of action. The only major win was extending the city’s speed camera program. A safety analyst notes: 'Failure to advance livable streets policies likely maintains the status quo, which typically prioritizes car-centric infrastructure and neglects the safety and needs of pedestrians and cyclists.'

Police targeted cyclists, not reckless drivers. Riders stopped at every light, exposed the law’s absurdity. One cyclist jailed for lacking ID. Drivers who injure go free. Cyclists demand fair treatment, safety, respect.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC reported on June 2, 2025, that hundreds of New Yorkers joined a mass ride to protest the NYPD’s intensified enforcement against cyclists. The demonstration, which began at Union Square, challenged new policies issuing criminal summonses for minor cycling offenses. Riders followed traffic laws, highlighting the crackdown’s contradictions. One cyclist, Erin Poland, said the policy 'is not actually protecting cyclists [but] putting them in more danger.' Another, Tara Pham, noted, 'I’ve been hit by vehicles twice... those drivers face no criminal charges.' The article details how police arrested a Citi Bike rider for not moving aside and lacking ID, while drivers who injure vulnerable road users often avoid serious consequences. The piece underscores the disparity in enforcement and questions the effectiveness and fairness of current NYPD tactics.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists and advocates argue the penalties are harsher than those faced by drivers for similar actions. As one protester said, “It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.” Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the crackdown, citing the lack of licensing for e-bikes as a challenge for enforcement, but acknowledged the need for legislative reform. The article highlights inconsistent enforcement and the risks faced by vulnerable road users, especially delivery workers. Policy gaps and unequal penalties expose systemic danger on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It 'permits the use of photo speed violation monitoring systems in New York City for the purposes of enforcement of license plate obstruction, concealment, and/or distortion; extends provisions permitting the use of speed cameras in certain school zones.' By targeting plate obstruction, the bill seeks to stop drivers from dodging speed camera enforcement, a move that could help protect pedestrians and cyclists from repeat offenders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
