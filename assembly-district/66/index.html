Twenty-four left with injuries so grave they may never walk the same.</strong> In just the last twelve months, <strong>one person died and twelve suffered serious injuries</strong> on these streets (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).

Trucks and buses killed one, left dozens hurt. Bikes, mopeds, and motorcycles injured many, but did not kill (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The pattern is clear. The larger the vehicle, the greater the harm. The street does not forgive.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Assembly Member Deborah Glick has acted. She sponsored and voted to extend the city’s school speed camera program through 2030, a move praised as an <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>&ldquo;extra boost&rdquo; for automated enforcement</a>. She pushed for <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">bills to expand camera enforcement</a> and keep speeders from dodging the law. When the city’s cameras went 24/7, Glick <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-speed-cameras-can-now-operate-247>dismissed critics</a>: &ldquo;The city isn&rsquo;t in the car with you&mldr; If you don&rsquo;t want to get a ticket, don&rsquo;t speed.&rdquo; But loopholes remain. The worst repeat offenders still slip through. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not. The blood dries, but the danger stays.</p><h3 id=the-next-fight>The Next Fight</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong> The law now lets New York set safer speeds. The cameras are watching, but the cars keep coming. <strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat speeders.</strong> The dead cannot speak. The living must.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The plan aims for a 'complete street'—space for pedestrians, cyclists, transit, and limited cars. The article notes, 'Their (mostly) shared goal is to make 14th into what's often called a complete street.' The study will assess traffic flow and street dynamics. The busway, which restricts cars, may become permanent. No crash or injury data is cited, but the focus is on systemic street changes, not individual driver actions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, described as 'an extra boost' for automated enforcement, updates home-rule provisions first enacted in 2013. State Senator Andrew Gounardes and Assembly Member Deborah Glick sponsored the measure. Both praised the program’s record in cutting speeds and saving lives. Council member Barbara Russo-Lennon supported the renewal. A safety analyst notes the extension is likely to reduce speeds and crashes, improving safety for pedestrians and cyclists, especially children, without burdening vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Streetsblog NYC report reads: "Our elected officials in Albany have failed the livable streets movement again." Despite support for measures like speed camera reauthorization, most bills to protect pedestrians and cyclists died in committee or never reached the floor. Assembly Member Amy Sohn and others criticized the lack of action. The only major win was extending the city’s speed camera program. A safety analyst notes: 'Failure to advance livable streets policies likely maintains the status quo, which typically prioritizes car-centric infrastructure and neglects the safety and needs of pedestrians and cyclists.' The session’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users at risk. No progress.

Glick leads the push to keep speed zones near schools, correcting past errors and removing outdated rules. The bill remains under committee review. No safety analyst note was provided, but the measure aims to keep enforcement strong around schools.

The crackdown targets delivery workers, especially undocumented riders, for offenses like sidewalk riding and nonstandard bike setups. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the move, stating, 'When it comes to traffic safety, compliance is not optional.' Protesters and advocates argue the policy is discriminatory and escalates minor violations, risking severe consequences for vulnerable workers. Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives called it 'really inappropriate escalation.' The article highlights confusion over traffic rules and the risk of criminalization for actions previously handled as civil matters, raising questions about enforcement priorities and the impact on immigrant communities.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

As one protester said, “It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.” Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the crackdown, citing the lack of licensing for e-bikes as a challenge for enforcement, but acknowledged the need for legislative reform.
