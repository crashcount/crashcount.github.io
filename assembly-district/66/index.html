The plan aims for a 'complete street'—space for pedestrians, cyclists, transit, and limited cars. The article notes, 'Their (mostly) shared goal is to make 14th into what's often called a complete street.' The study will assess traffic flow and street dynamics. The busway, which restricts cars, may become permanent.

The bill, described as 'an extra boost' for automated enforcement, updates home-rule provisions first enacted in 2013. State Senator Andrew Gounardes and Assembly Member Deborah Glick sponsored the measure. Both praised the program’s record in cutting speeds and saving lives. Council member Barbara Russo-Lennon supported the renewal. A safety analyst notes the extension is likely to reduce speeds and crashes, improving safety for pedestrians and cyclists, especially children, without burdening vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>The 2025 Albany legislative session ended June 25, with lawmakers failing to pass key street safety bills. The Streetsblog NYC report reads: "Our elected officials in Albany have failed the livable streets movement again." Despite support for measures like speed camera reauthorization, most bills to protect pedestrians and cyclists died in committee or never reached the floor. Assembly Member Amy Sohn and others criticized the lack of action. The only major win was extending the city’s speed camera program. A safety analyst notes: 'Failure to advance livable streets policies likely maintains the status quo, which typically prioritizes car-centric infrastructure and neglects the safety and needs of pedestrians and cyclists.' The session’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users at risk. No progress. No protection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Protesters and advocates argue the policy is discriminatory and escalates minor violations, risking severe consequences for vulnerable workers.
