Some bills stall. Some pass and wait for enforcement. Cameras catch plates, but drivers hide them.

The demonstration, which began at Union Square, challenged new policies issuing criminal summonses for minor cycling offenses.

Another, Tara Pham, noted, 'I’ve been hit by vehicles twice... those drivers face no criminal charges.'

Cyclists and advocates argue the penalties are harsher than those faced by drivers for similar actions. As one protester said, “It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.” Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the crackdown, citing the lack of licensing for e-bikes as a challenge for enforcement, but acknowledged the need for legislative reform.

He urged her to vote no on revenue alternatives to congestion pricing, especially a proposed Payroll Mobility Tax (PMT) increase. Komanoff wrote, 'what motivates me...to demand congestion pricing is its power to act as a counterweight to cars and trucks and driving and traffic.' He called the PMT hike regressive, unlike congestion pricing, and warned it would undermine safer, fairer streets. The advocacy statement, published by Streetsblog NYC, highlights Komanoff’s decades of work driven by the deaths of pedestrians and cyclists. He pressed Glick to keep congestion pricing viable, framing it as the effective, equitable path for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
