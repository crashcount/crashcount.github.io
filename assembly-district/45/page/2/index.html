Since 2022, <strong>15 people have died</strong> and <strong>22 have been seriously injured</strong> in crashes. The victims are not numbers. They are children, elders, neighbors. In the last twelve months alone, three children were killed. Five deaths in a year. The disaster moves slow, but it does not stop.</p><p>On July 8, a 90-year-old man was crossing East 14th Street at Avenue U. A blue moped hit him and kept going. &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/brooklyn-90-year-old-man-hit-run-rider/>said an eyewitness</a>. The man died in the hospital. The driver vanished. The family waits for answers. &ldquo;We hope the authorities can find the person who did this. We are also concerned about the motorcycles running rampant in crowded residential areas,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/90-year-old-killed-brooklyn-moped-nypd/>said the victim&rsquo;s grandson</a>.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-vulnerable-lives-repeat-loss>The Pattern: Vulnerable Lives, Repeat Loss</h2><p>The dead are not all old. Three children under 18 killed in a year. In March, a mother and two daughters were crushed crossing Ocean Parkway. The driver had a record of speed camera violations. The street did not forgive them. The law did not stop him.</p><p>The killers are not just mopeds. <strong>Cars and SUVs killed nine. Trucks and buses killed one. Mopeds and motorcycles killed none directly, but left injuries and fear.</strong></p><h2 id=leadership-delay-deflection-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Delay, Deflection, and Missed Chances</h2><p>Assembly Member Misha Novakhov has not led the fight for safer streets. He voted <strong>against extending school speed zones</strong> and <strong>opposed the Stop Super Speeders bill</strong> that would have forced repeat offenders to slow down. He called for higher speed limits on Ocean Parkway, not lower. He has sponsored bills to require more paperwork for e-scooter riders, but not to redesign streets or rein in the most dangerous drivers. When asked about the carnage, he said, &ldquo;any driver can get much more than six&rdquo; speed camera tickets in a year, and called speed cameras a punishment for regular drivers. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/03/31/locals-outraged-but-political-elite-yawns-after-a-mom-and-two-kids-are-killed-by-recidivist-speeder>source</a></p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a policy failure.</strong></p><p>Call Assembly Member Novakhov. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real action against repeat offenders. Demand streets that put people before cars. Do not wait for another child to die.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
