A car ran the red. The driver was going nearly double the speed limit. The car flipped and crushed them. Their four-year-old brother lost a kidney. The driver had a suspended license, no insurance, and an expired registration. The city counted three dead, one child fighting for his life. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/02/us-news/brooklyn-boy-struck-by-speeding-wigmaker-miriam-yarimi-in-horrific-crash-loses-kidney-as-he-fights-for-life-official/>&ldquo;He is still in critical condition.

They are sedans, SUVs, trucks, taxis. Nine deaths came from cars and SUVs. One from a truck or bus. None from a bike. The old and the young fall first. Three children dead in a single year. One elderly man pinned under a city bus, left in critical condition. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-87-is-critically-injured-after-mta-bus-driver-strikes-him-in-brooklyn-nypd>Police said the man was standing near the corner when the driver made a left onto the avenue and hit him.</a></p><h2 id=the-record-what-misha-novakhov-has-done>The Record: What Misha Novakhov Has Done</h2><p>Assembly Member Misha Novakhov has co-sponsored some bills for safer streets. He backed a <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A116&amp;term=2025">bill for complete street design</a> and another for <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A324&amp;term=2025">general road safety</a>. But when it counted, he voted no on a <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">bill to bring speed cameras to school zones</a>. He also co-sponsored a bill that would force e-scooter riders—mostly working-class delivery workers—to get licenses and insurance, while drivers of deadly vehicles face little new scrutiny. The bills that would save lives move slow. The bills that shift blame move fast.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day of delay is another family broken. Call Assembly Member Novakhov. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand more speed cameras, not fewer. Demand streets built for people, not for speed.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for the next child’s name.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
