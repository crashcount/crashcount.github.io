Eighteen left with serious injuries.</strong> Nearly two thousand hurt since 2022. The streets do not forgive. Children, elders, men and women—no one is spared. In the last year alone, four children died. Three more did not make it to their next birthday. The crash count keeps rising.</p><p><strong>Just weeks ago, a drunk driver in a black Suburban tore through Coney Island Avenue.</strong> The crash left two NYPD officers broken and a passenger fighting for his life. One officer suffered a broken pelvis and arm, and head trauma. Another, a broken hip. The passenger was ejected, left in critical condition. Police charged the driver with DWI and reckless endangerment. As <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/15/brooklyn-drunk-driver-hurts-2-passengers-2-nypd-cops-in-chain-reaction-crash/>police reported</a>, &ldquo;One police officer suffered a broken pelvis and arm, as well as head trauma, while another suffered a broken hip.&rdquo; The violence did not end there. Days later, a driver fleeing a traffic stop dragged an officer near Ocean Parkway and Avenue X. According to <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/sheepshead-bay-crime-police-searching-driver-accused-fleeing-traffic-stop-dragging-nypd-officer-car-brooklyn-nyc/16933142/>ABC7</a>, &ldquo;The 36-year-old suspect fled the attempted traffic stop, dragging the officer as he drove away.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the killing.</strong> Nine deaths, six serious injuries, and over 400 injuries from cars and trucks alone. Motorcycles and mopeds add more pain. Bikes, almost none. The pattern is clear. The most vulnerable—children, the old, those on foot—pay the price for speed and steel.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h2><p>Assembly Member Misha Novakhov has spoken. He called for higher speed limits on Ocean Parkway. He <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>voted against speed cameras in school zones</a>. He called six camera tickets in a year &ldquo;too little&rdquo; to warrant action. He said, &ldquo;any driver can get much more than six.&rdquo; He <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A116&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored bills</a> that put the burden on e-scooter riders, not drivers. When the city needed a champion for the vulnerable, he stood with the status quo.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by those in power. Call Novakhov. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras where children walk. Demand laws that stop repeat offenders. <strong>Do not wait for another child’s name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
