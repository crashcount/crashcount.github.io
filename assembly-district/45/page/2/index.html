Since 2022, 15 people have died and 1,966 have been injured in crashes. Five children are among the dead. The numbers do not flinch. In the last year alone, six people were killed—three of them under 18. Ten more were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</p><p>Last month, a drunk driver on Coney Island Avenue smashed into a Volvo, sending it into a police car. Two officers were left with broken bones and head wounds. A passenger was thrown from the car, left in critical condition. Police said, “One police officer suffered a broken pelvis and arm, as well as head trauma, while another suffered a broken hip” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/15/brooklyn-drunk-driver-hurts-2-passengers-2-nypd-cops-in-chain-reaction-crash/>NY Daily News</a>. The driver was charged with DWI and reckless endangerment.</p><p>Just days ago, a driver fled a traffic stop near Ocean Parkway and Avenue X, dragging an officer with the car. The officer survived with minor injuries. Police said, “the 36-year-old suspect fled the attempted traffic stop, dragging the officer as he drove away” <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/sheepshead-bay-crime-police-searching-driver-accused-fleeing-traffic-stop-dragging-nypd-officer-car-brooklyn-nyc/16933142/>ABC7</a>.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p>The dead are not numbers. They are children crossing with the light. They are mothers holding hands. They are officers in marked cars, and passengers who never make it home. SUVs and sedans do most of the killing—nine deaths, 309 minor injuries, 89 moderate, six serious. Trucks and buses add more. Motorcycles and mopeds, too. Bikes, almost none. The violence is not random. It is the same story, told again and again.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse</h2><p>Assembly Member Misha Novakhov has stood in the way of proven safety tools.
