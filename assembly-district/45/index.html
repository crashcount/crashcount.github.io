Fourteen dead. Sixteen with injuries so grave they will not forget. In the last twelve months, three children died. Two more children were cut down, their bodies broken but alive. A mother and her daughters, crossing with the light, never made it home. The numbers are a drumbeat: 997 crashes, 667 injured, 9 left with wounds called “serious” by the city, but the word is too small.</p><p>A five-year-old girl, an eight-year-old girl, a four-year-old boy, and their mother—all crossing with the signal—were killed at Ocean Parkway and Quentin Road.

He also backed a bill to boost street safety for all users <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">A 1077</a>. But Novakhov voted against a bill to bring speed cameras to school zones <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">A 7652</a>, a measure proven to slow drivers where children walk.</p><p>He co-sponsored a bill to require e-scooter licenses and insurance <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A116&amp;term=2025">A 116</a>. This bill puts the burden on those with the least power, not on the drivers or the roads that kill.

The article states, 'Felder has a long record of opposing street safety measures, including Vision Zero, speed cameras, speed limits, and street redesigns.'
