Fourteen dead. Sixteen with injuries so grave they will not forget. In the last twelve months, three children died. Two more children were cut down, their bodies broken but alive. A mother and her daughters, crossing with the light, never made it home. The numbers are a drumbeat: 997 crashes, 667 injured, 9 left with wounds called “serious” by the city, but the word is too small.</p><p>A five-year-old girl, an eight-year-old girl, a four-year-old boy, and their mother—all crossing with the signal—were killed at Ocean Parkway and Quentin Road. The city’s data is blunt: &ldquo;Crush Injuries. Apparent Death.&rdquo; <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>An 87-year-old man was pinned under a bus at East 12th and Avenue Z. He was standing near the corner. The bus turned left. The man was taken away in critical condition. Police said officers who responded to the scene discovered an 87-year-old man pinned under the city bus&mldr; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-87-is-critically-injured-after-mta-bus-driver-strikes-him-in-brooklyn-nypd>Gothamist</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-evasion>Leadership: Action and Evasion</h3><p>Assembly Member Misha Novakhov has stood on both sides of the line. He co-sponsored a bill to require complete street design for state-funded projects, a step toward safer roads for all <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A324&amp;term=2025">A 324</a>. He also backed a bill to boost street safety for all users <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">A 1077</a>. But Novakhov voted against a bill to bring speed cameras to school zones <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">A 7652</a>, a measure proven to slow drivers where children walk.</p><p>He co-sponsored a bill to require e-scooter licenses and insurance <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A116&amp;term=2025">A 116</a>. This bill puts the burden on those with the least power, not on the drivers or the roads that kill. No bill from Novakhov has forced the city to lower speed limits or redesign deadly intersections.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h3><p>A chain-reaction crash at Avenue U and Coney Island Avenue left two NYPD officers with broken bones and a passenger in critical condition. One police officer suffered a broken pelvis and arm, as well as head trauma, while another suffered a broken hip <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/15/brooklyn-drunk-driver-hurts-2-passengers-2-nypd-cops-in-chain-reaction-crash/>NY Daily News</a>. The driver was charged with DWI. The street remains unchanged.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p>The dead do not write laws. The living must. Call Assembly Member Novakhov. Demand he fight for lower speed limits, more speed cameras, and street redesigns that protect the smallest and the oldest.
