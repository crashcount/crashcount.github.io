The Senate passed the measure 38-21; three city senators—Stephen Chan, Andrew Lanza, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton—voted no. The Assembly passed it 110-31, with nine city lawmakers—Alec Brook-Krasny, Lester Chang, Simcha Eichenstein, Michael Novakhov, Stacey Pheffer Amato, Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Reilly, David Weprin, Kalman Yeger—opposing. The Streetsblog NYC article, 'Ye Shall Know Their Names! Meet the Dirty Dozen City Pols Who Voted Against Speed Camera Program,' quotes lawmakers dismissing speed cameras as revenue grabs or burdens. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action, so no direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists can be assessed.'

This package includes the 'Idaho stop' bill and the 'Stop Super-Speeders' bill. The event saw support from several Assembly members and a senator for speed controls, while Sen. Anthony Palumbo and Assembly Member Michael Novakhov opposed the super speeder bill, citing government overreach. Sen. Leroy Comrie opposed the Idaho stop bill, citing concerns for seniors. Separately, Senate bill S533, which aimed to block congestion pricing, was defeated in the Senate Transportation Committee. Chair Jeremy Cooney stressed, 'You have to have a plan. If you don’t have a plan, what are [you] doing to get the $15 billion revenue?'

It would require speed limiter technology for drivers with six or more automated enforcement tickets in a year. The bill is supported by Amber Adler of Families for Safe Streets and Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives, who call out the deadly pattern of repeat offenders. Furnas says, 'These results point to a small population with a shocking pattern of recidivism, resistance to traditional deterrents, and disregard for human life.' Adler points to a recent fatal crash by a repeat offender as proof of legislative failure. Assembly Member Michael Novakhov opposes the bill, claiming six tickets is not excessive. The NYPD withholds license plate data, blocking public scrutiny. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program has expired, leaving no replacement.

The bill, sponsored in Albany by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, would require drivers with repeated violations to install intelligent speed assistance (ISA) devices. These devices cap speed at 5 mph over the limit for those with 11 or more license points in 24 months or six camera tickets in a year. The rally followed a fatal Gravesend crash that killed a mother and her two daughters. Hanif and other lawmakers called current enforcement—ticketing, suspensions, fines, jail—ineffective. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon said, 'The speed limiter technology is available to us. Let’s use it. It will save lives.' The bill is modeled on EU and Virginia laws.
