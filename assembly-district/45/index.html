The Senate passed the measure 38-21; three city senators—Stephen Chan, Andrew Lanza, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton—voted no. The Assembly passed it 110-31, with nine city lawmakers—Alec Brook-Krasny, Lester Chang, Simcha Eichenstein, Michael Novakhov, Stacey Pheffer Amato, Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Reilly, David Weprin, Kalman Yeger—opposing. The Streetsblog NYC article, 'Ye Shall Know Their Names! Meet the Dirty Dozen City Pols Who Voted Against Speed Camera Program,' quotes lawmakers dismissing speed cameras as revenue grabs or burdens. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action, so no direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists can be assessed.'

Her car struck a cab, then a mother and three children. Two girls died. The boy fights for life. The driver had a long record. The street remains deadly.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC (2025-03-30) reports that Miriam Yarimi faces manslaughter and other charges after running a red light at high speed on Ocean Parkway, killing a mother and her two daughters and injuring a young boy. Police say Yarimi had over 99 traffic violations, including 21 for speeding and five for red-light running. Her license was suspended, yet she continued to drive. Advocates point to the lack of speed-limiting devices on vehicles with repeated violations, a measure pending in Albany. Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives said, "If Albany had passed this bill when it was first introduced, this vehicle would already have been speed limited and this crash would never have happened." The crash has renewed calls for urgent policy action to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
