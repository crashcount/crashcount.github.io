Since 2022, <strong>15 people have died</strong> and <strong>1,973 have been injured</strong> in crashes. Children, elders, mothers. The numbers do not flinch. In the last year alone, five more lives were lost. Three were children under 18. The disaster does not pause for grief.</p><p>Just days ago, a 90-year-old man was killed crossing Avenue U. A blue moped hit him and fled. A witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/brooklyn-man-90-struck-by-hit-and-run-moped-rider-dies/>described the scene</a>: &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open.&rdquo; The driver did not stop. The family waits for answers. The street remains the same.</p><h2 id=patterns-of-harm>Patterns of Harm</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs are the main killers.</strong> Of the deaths and injuries to pedestrians, nine came from cars and SUVs, one from a truck, and four from taxis. Motorcycles and mopeds left their mark too, but the carnage is driven by the largest vehicles. The old and the young are hit hardest. In the last year, three children died. Nineteen people over 75 were injured.</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-and-silence>Leadership: Votes and Silence</h2><p>Assembly Member Misha Novakhov has stood in the way of proven safety tools. He <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">voted against renewing speed cameras</a> in school zones, a measure that saves lives. He <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/04/tragedy-underscores-shortcomings-of-vision-zero-era-state-ocean-parkway-fixes>called for higher speed limits on Ocean Parkway</a>, even as families mourned the dead. At the funeral for a mother and her two children, killed by a repeat speeder, Novakhov <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/03/31/locals-outraged-but-political-elite-yawns-after-a-mom-and-two-kids-are-killed-by-recidivist-speeder>dismissed the need for speed limiters</a>, saying, &ldquo;any driver can get much more than six&rdquo; tickets. He called speed cameras a punishment for &ldquo;regular drivers.&rdquo;</p><p>He has <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A116&amp;term=2025">sponsored bills that shift the burden to cyclists and e-scooter riders</a>, demanding licenses and insurance for the most vulnerable, while opposing stronger rules for drivers.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>The blood on the street is not fate.</strong> It is policy. It is votes. It is delay. Call your Assembly Member. Demand speed cameras, lower speed limits, and real protection for people outside cars. Do not wait for the next siren.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Senate passed the measure 38-21; three city senators—Stephen Chan, Andrew Lanza, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton—voted no. The Assembly passed it 110-31, with nine city lawmakers—Alec Brook-Krasny, Lester Chang, Simcha Eichenstein, Michael Novakhov, Stacey Pheffer Amato, Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Reilly, David Weprin, Kalman Yeger—opposing. The Streetsblog NYC article, 'Ye Shall Know Their Names! Meet the Dirty Dozen City Pols Who Voted Against Speed Camera Program,' quotes lawmakers dismissing speed cameras as revenue grabs or burdens. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action, so no direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists can be assessed.'

Their 4-year-old son, Philip, was critically injured. The article reports Yarimi 'allegedly told first responders at the scene that she was "possessed."' Yarimi is being held at Bellevue Hospital and will be arraigned by video. The crash highlights the lethal risk to pedestrians and children on city streets. No details are given about traffic conditions or vehicle speed. The case raises questions about driver fitness and systemic safeguards, as Yarimi had prior police encounters and was under psychiatric evaluation months before the crash.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law would force repeat reckless drivers to use speed-limiting tech. Survivors demand action. Lawmakers promise change.</p><p class=mb3>On April 1, 2025, Council Member Shahana Hanif joined a rally at Brooklyn Borough Hall demanding passage of the Stop Super Speeders bill. The bill, sponsored in Albany by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, would require drivers with repeated violations to install intelligent speed assistance (ISA) devices. These devices cap speed at 5 mph over the limit for those with 11 or more license points in 24 months or six camera tickets in a year. The rally followed a fatal Gravesend crash that killed a mother and her two daughters. Hanif and other lawmakers called current enforcement—ticketing, suspensions, fines, jail—ineffective. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon said, 'The speed limiter technology is available to us. Let’s use it. It will save lives.' The bill is modeled on EU and Virginia laws. Some opposition remains, but supporters say the measure is urgent and practical.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Miriam Yarimi, driving on a suspended license, ran a red light, made an illegal turn, and struck the Saada family in a crosswalk. Natasha Saada and her daughters, ages 8 and 5, were killed; her son remains critical. Five others were injured. The article notes, 'They happen so frequently that it's not shocking anymore.' Ocean Parkway is notorious for reckless driving and has seen 15 deaths since 2017. Locals and advocates highlight confusing signals, poor bike lane upkeep, and repeated calls for redesign. The crash vehicle had 21 speed tickets since 2023.

The statement came at the funeral for Natasha Saada and her children, killed by a speeding driver on Ocean Parkway. Novakhov argued, 'six red-light or speed violations in one year [is] too little,' and claimed, 'any driver can get much more than six.' He also denounced speed cameras, saying, 'we have too many,' and that they punish regular drivers. The bill’s matter summary centers on requiring devices for vehicles with six violations in a year. Community members and advocates at the funeral demanded stronger accountability and cited the area’s deadly history. Other local politicians, including Kalman Yeger and Simcha Felder, have also opposed speed safety measures. The Department of Transportation has not recommended major changes to Ocean Parkway, despite ongoing danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The police report lists 'Traffic Control Disregarded' and 'Unsafe Speed' as contributing factors for the driver. The pedestrians were crossing with the signal, as documented in the report. The sedan's center front end struck the victims, underscoring the lethal consequences of ignoring traffic controls.
