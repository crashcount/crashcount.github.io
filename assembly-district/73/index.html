Thirty-five left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, five deaths and over five hundred wounded. The old and the young. A woman, 81, crushed by an SUV on East 59th. Two men, both 67, struck down on Fifth Avenue. Blood on the pavement, sirens in the night. The city moves on. The families do not. See the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most harm.</strong> They killed, they maimed, they kept rolling. Trucks and buses followed. Bikes and mopeds hurt too, but the numbers are smaller. The deadliest force is always the same: speed and steel. The old story, told again and again. The sidewalk is not safe. The crosswalk is not safe. The bike lane is not safe.</p><h2 id=what-has-alex-bores-done>What Has Alex Bores Done?</h2><p>Assembly Member Alex Bores has moved on some fronts. He co-sponsored bills to require <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A324&amp;term=2025">complete street design</a>, to <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">install speed limiters on repeat offenders</a>, and to <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A803&amp;term=2025">enforce bike lane safety</a>. He backed <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/07/12/moped-and-e-bike-safety-legislation-becomes-state-law>moped and e-bike safety laws</a>, saying, &ldquo;By requiring the registration of mopeds at point of sale and the collection of e-bike collision data, we are making our streets safer and increasing accountability,&rdquo; as reported by <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/07/12/moped-and-e-bike-safety-legislation-becomes-state-law>Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p><p>But the work is not done. <strong>Sidewalks are still too narrow. Bike lanes are still unprotected.</strong> The Fifth Avenue redesign will widen sidewalks, but leaves out bus and bike lanes. &ldquo;This plan entirely fails to meet the moment,&rdquo; said <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/21/us-news/nycs-fifth-avenue-getting-400m-pedestrian-centered-makeover-that-drivers-and-cyclists-are-sure-to-hate/>Transportation Alternatives</a>. The city claims progress, but the dead are still dead.</p><h2 id=what-next-demand-more>What Next? Demand More</h2><p><strong>Call your leaders. Demand protected bike lanes, slower speeds, and real accountability for dangerous drivers.</strong> Do not let another year pass with bodies in the street. The numbers will not save us.

The city’s pulse slows, but the outcome is uncertain.</p><p class=mb3>West Side Spirit reported on May 23, 2025, that New York’s congestion pricing tolls remain in place despite three missed federal deadlines to remove them. The article details a standoff between the MTA, New York State, and U.S. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy, who demands the tolls be taken down, threatening to withhold highway funds. The MTA argues the legality of the tolls and seeks a court injunction, stating, 'congestion pricing is legal and proper.' The system, operational since January 2025, has reduced daily vehicle entries into Manhattan’s core by 76,000 in April and raised $159 million in the first quarter. The dispute highlights tensions over funding priorities and the impact on lower-income drivers, but the courts, not drivers or pedestrians, will decide the fate of the tolls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Riders pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>West Side Spirit (May 17, 2025) reports that Oliver Casey Esparza filed a class-action lawsuit against the NYPD and city officials. He claims police issue red-light summonses to cyclists who cross intersections with the white pedestrian walk signal, despite a 2019 law permitting this. The article quotes Transportation Alternatives: “That 5-7 second head start can mean the difference between being hit by a turning car and being seen by a turning car.” Esparza says officers ignore the rule, issuing criminal summonses instead of traffic tickets. The suit highlights a gap between city policy and street enforcement, raising questions about NYPD training and the city’s commitment to safe cycling.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation had planned to open the dedicated walkway on March 16, but the mayor's office intervened, citing the need for a briefing. The lawmakers wrote, 'The reasons given for this delay are not satisfactory, as all communications from the DOT have indicated that the project is complete and ready to open to the public.' They warned, 'Any further delays to this project that is otherwise ready to open will unnecessarily put at risk the thousands of New Yorkers who cycle and walk the current shared path every day.' The project, in the works since at least 2017, remains stalled. Cyclists and pedestrians are forced to share a cramped, hazardous lane.

The legislation, sponsored by State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assemblymember Alex Bores, requires retailers to register mopeds at the point of sale, provide safety information, and prohibit the sale of substandard lithium-ion batteries. The law also mandates crash reporting and new safety training for first responders. Hoylman-Sigal said, 'I've received more complaints about the hazards these mopeds cause than just about any other issue.' Bores added, 'By requiring the registration of mopeds at point of sale and the collection of e-bike collision data, we are making our streets safer and increasing accountability.' The law shifts accountability to retailers, aiming to improve street safety without penalizing delivery workers. Council Member Shekar Krishnan and State Senator Liz Kruger also voiced support, highlighting the dangers of unregistered mopeds and the need for better buyer education.

Introduced February 8, 2024, it urges Albany to pass A.8052 and S.7703. The resolution calls for 'purchasers of limited use motorcycles present a driver’s license appropriate for the legal operation... and register such limited use motorcycles, prior to completing a purchase.' Council Member Gale A. Brewer leads, joined by Rivera, Schulman, Krishnan, Won, Bottcher, and others. The bills would require dealers to check licenses and register mopeds at sale. The Council notes that illegal, unregistered mopeds endanger pedestrians, cyclists, and riders. NYPD seized over 8,600 illegal mopeds by September 2023. The resolution presses for safeguards to keep unlicensed, unregistered vehicles off city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
