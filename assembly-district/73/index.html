Thirty-five left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, five deaths and over five hundred wounded. The old and the young. A woman, 81, crushed by an SUV on East 59th. Two men, both 67, struck down on Fifth Avenue. Blood on the pavement, sirens in the night. The city moves on. The families do not. See the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most harm.</strong> They killed, they maimed, they kept rolling. Trucks and buses followed. Bikes and mopeds hurt too, but the numbers are smaller. The deadliest force is always the same: speed and steel. The old story, told again and again. The sidewalk is not safe. The crosswalk is not safe. The bike lane is not safe.</p><h2 id=what-has-alex-bores-done>What Has Alex Bores Done?</h2><p>Assembly Member Alex Bores has moved on some fronts. He co-sponsored bills to require <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A324&amp;term=2025">complete street design</a>, to <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">install speed limiters on repeat offenders</a>, and to <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A803&amp;term=2025">enforce bike lane safety</a>. He backed <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/07/12/moped-and-e-bike-safety-legislation-becomes-state-law>moped and e-bike safety laws</a>, saying, &ldquo;By requiring the registration of mopeds at point of sale and the collection of e-bike collision data, we are making our streets safer and increasing accountability,&rdquo; as reported by <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/07/12/moped-and-e-bike-safety-legislation-becomes-state-law>Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p><p>But the work is not done. <strong>Sidewalks are still too narrow. Bike lanes are still unprotected.</strong> The Fifth Avenue redesign will widen sidewalks, but leaves out bus and bike lanes. &ldquo;This plan entirely fails to meet the moment,&rdquo; said <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/21/us-news/nycs-fifth-avenue-getting-400m-pedestrian-centered-makeover-that-drivers-and-cyclists-are-sure-to-hate/>Transportation Alternatives</a>. The city claims progress, but the dead are still dead.</p><h2 id=what-next-demand-more>What Next? Demand More</h2><p><strong>Call your leaders. Demand protected bike lanes, slower speeds, and real accountability for dangerous drivers.</strong> Do not let another year pass with bodies in the street. The numbers will not save us. Only action will.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Department of Transportation had planned to open the dedicated walkway on March 16, but the mayor's office intervened, citing the need for a briefing. The lawmakers wrote, 'The reasons given for this delay are not satisfactory, as all communications from the DOT have indicated that the project is complete and ready to open to the public.' They warned, 'Any further delays to this project that is otherwise ready to open will unnecessarily put at risk the thousands of New Yorkers who cycle and walk the current shared path every day.' The project, in the works since at least 2017, remains stalled. Cyclists and pedestrians are forced to share a cramped, hazardous lane. City Hall insists on more review, while advocates plan a protest ribbon-cutting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Holden supports both city and state versions, stating, 'We need the state DMV to issue license plates for e-bikes.' Rajkumar declared, 'We will usher in a new era free of e-bikes blasting through red lights.' The bill is named for Priscilla Loke, killed by an e-bike in 2023.

The legislation, sponsored by State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assemblymember Alex Bores, requires retailers to register mopeds at the point of sale, provide safety information, and prohibit the sale of substandard lithium-ion batteries. The law also mandates crash reporting and new safety training for first responders. Hoylman-Sigal said, 'I've received more complaints about the hazards these mopeds cause than just about any other issue.' Bores added, 'By requiring the registration of mopeds at point of sale and the collection of e-bike collision data, we are making our streets safer and increasing accountability.' The law shifts accountability to retailers, aiming to improve street safety without penalizing delivery workers. Council Member Shekar Krishnan and State Senator Liz Kruger also voiced support, highlighting the dangers of unregistered mopeds and the need for better buyer education.

Introduced February 8, 2024, it urges Albany to pass A.8052 and S.7703. The resolution calls for 'purchasers of limited use motorcycles present a driver’s license appropriate for the legal operation... and register such limited use motorcycles, prior to completing a purchase.' Council Member Gale A. Brewer leads, joined by Rivera, Schulman, Krishnan, Won, Bottcher, and others. The bills would require dealers to check licenses and register mopeds at sale. The Council notes that illegal, unregistered mopeds endanger pedestrians, cyclists, and riders. NYPD seized over 8,600 illegal mopeds by September 2023. The resolution presses for safeguards to keep unlicensed, unregistered vehicles off city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On December 14, 2023, Community Board 7’s transportation committee passed a resolution, 8-1, demanding action against unregistered mopeds. The board called on the Department of Motor Vehicles to impose civil penalties on unregistered dealers and urged city and state officials to enforce laws against selling non-street-legal mopeds. The resolution also asks the city to consider a buy-back program for gas-powered mopeds. The matter, titled 'Upper West Side Panel Backs Resolution to Rein in Dangerous Mopeds,' supports Albany legislation requiring sellers to register mopeds with the DMV before sale. State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assembly Member Alex Bores sponsor the bill. Bores said, 'We need to cut off the flow of these vehicles before they get onto these streets.' The board’s move aims to close loopholes, protect vulnerable road users, and address the chaos caused by unregistered mopeds.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
