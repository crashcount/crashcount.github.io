The measure extends and corrects school speed zone laws in New York City, repealing outdated provisions. Gounardes led the push, with strong support from most Senate Democrats and a split Assembly.

The project sits finished. Cyclists and walkers still cram into a narrow, crash-prone lane. Delays keep thousands at risk. City Hall stalls. Advocates plan protest. Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On April 9, 2025, seven elected officials—including Council Members Julie Won and Julie Menin—sent a public letter demanding Mayor Adams open the long-promised Queensboro Bridge pedestrian path. The Department of Transportation had planned to open the dedicated walkway on March 16, but the mayor's office intervened, citing the need for a briefing. The lawmakers wrote, 'The reasons given for this delay are not satisfactory, as all communications from the DOT have indicated that the project is complete and ready to open to the public.' They warned, 'Any further delays to this project that is otherwise ready to open will unnecessarily put at risk the thousands of New Yorkers who cycle and walk the current shared path every day.' The project, in the works since at least 2017, remains stalled. Cyclists and pedestrians are forced to share a cramped, hazardous lane. City Hall insists on more review, while advocates plan a protest ribbon-cutting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Holden (District 30) joined Assembly Member Jenifer Rajkumar and advocates in Midtown to rally for Priscilla’s Law (A339). The bill would require all e-bikes to have license plates and be registered with the DMV or DOT. The rally, held near Governor Hochul’s office, drew support from the NYC E-Vehicle Safety Alliance. The matter title: 'New Yorkers rally in Midtown to combat “lawless” e-bike riding in NYC.' Holden supports both city and state versions, stating, 'We need the state DMV to issue license plates for e-bikes.' Rajkumar declared, 'We will usher in a new era free of e-bikes blasting through red lights.' The bill is named for Priscilla Loke, killed by an e-bike in 2023. Advocates say e-bike collisions often end in hit-and-runs. They demand rules and consequences to protect pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, debated on December 12, 2024, sits before the City Council. It would require all e-mobility devices not covered by the state DMV to register with the city’s Department of Transportation. The bill’s summary states it aims to increase accountability for e-bike riders after fatal crashes. Holden, the sponsor, cited dangers from unregulated e-vehicles and hit-and-runs. Advocacy groups, including Los Deliveristas Unidos and Open Plans, argue the bill would unfairly criminalize immigrants and delivery workers, and increase police stops for people of color. The NYC Hospitality Alliance warns of new financial and administrative burdens for small businesses. Both sides agree cars cause far more deaths, but the bill’s critics say better street design, not registration, would protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Blood pooled on the street. The boy’s abdomen torn, his body in shock. The driver, distracted, did not see him. The driver did not stop.</p><p class=mb3>A 16-year-old boy riding a bike was struck and severely injured by a sedan at East 84th Street and Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, according to the police report. The crash occurred at 1:31 p.m. The report states, 'A sedan struck a 16-year-old boy on a bike. No helmet. Abdomen torn. Blood pooled on the street. He lay in shock. The driver didn’t see him. Didn’t stop.' Police cite 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the primary contributing factor. The boy suffered severe lacerations to his abdomen and pelvis and was in shock at the scene. The police report does note the cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this is listed only after the driver’s inattention. The sedan’s left front quarter panel was damaged. The driver’s failure to see and yield to the cyclist is the central cause, as documented by the police.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Lawmakers say this closes loopholes, shifts blame from workers, and aims to cut rising crashes. Streets see more mopeds, more injuries, more tension.</p><p class=mb3>On July 12, 2024, Governor Hochul signed a package of eight bills into law, including new moped and e-bike safety regulations. The legislation, sponsored by State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assemblymember Alex Bores, requires retailers to register mopeds at the point of sale, provide safety information, and prohibit the sale of substandard lithium-ion batteries. The law also mandates crash reporting and new safety training for first responders. Hoylman-Sigal said, 'I've received more complaints about the hazards these mopeds cause than just about any other issue.' Bores added, 'By requiring the registration of mopeds at point of sale and the collection of e-bike collision data, we are making our streets safer and increasing accountability.' The law shifts accountability to retailers, aiming to improve street safety without penalizing delivery workers. Council Member Shekar Krishnan and State Senator Liz Kruger also voiced support, highlighting the dangers of unregistered mopeds and the need for better buyer education. The law responds to a sharp rise in moped-related injuries and community complaints across New York City.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A man on a bike hit the pavement, his leg torn, blood pooling. No helmet. The Jeep showed no damage. The cyclist’s pain marked the corner, another body broken by traffic’s force.</p><p class=mb3>At the corner of 2nd Avenue and East 48th Street in Manhattan, a collision between a Jeep SUV and a cyclist left a 31-year-old man with severe lacerations to his knee, lower leg, and foot, according to the police report. The narrative states, 'A Jeep kept south. A man on a bike fell hard. Blood pooled near his torn leg. His foot split open. No helmet. No damage to the Jeep. Just pain on the pavement.' The report lists the cyclist as injured, suffering 'severe lacerations,' and notes that the SUV sustained no damage. Both vehicles were traveling straight ahead at the time of the crash. The police report does not specify any driver errors or contributing factors beyond 'Unspecified.' The only detail about the cyclist’s behavior is the absence of a helmet, which is mentioned in the narrative but not cited as a contributing factor. The crash underscores the vulnerability of cyclists on city streets amid heavy vehicle traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
