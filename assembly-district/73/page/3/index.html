Thirty-six left with serious injuries.</strong> In the past year alone, five died and five more suffered wounds that will not heal. Most were walking or riding. Some were old. Some were young. All are gone or changed forever.</p><p>A bus struck a man on East 51st. An SUV killed an 81-year-old woman on East 59th. Two cyclists, both 67, died together at Fifth and 51st. The street does not care who you are. It only takes. Data from <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a> shows the toll.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h3><p>Assembly Member <strong>Alex Bores has moved on key safety bills</strong>. He co-sponsored the Stop Super Speeders Act, pushing for speed-limiting tech in cars with too many violations. He voted to extend school speed zones, a move to protect children and the old. He backed moped and e-bike safety laws, stating, <strong>&ldquo;By requiring the registration of mopeds at point of sale and the collection of e-bike collision data, we are making our streets safer and increasing accountability&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/07/12/moped-and-e-bike-safety-legislation-becomes-state-law>said Bores</a>).</p><p>But not every vote has favored the most vulnerable. Bores voted to weaken bus lane rules, a move that <strong>increases risk for those on foot and on bikes</strong>. He has supported e-bike registration bills that some say shift the burden onto workers and immigrants, not the drivers who kill.</p><h3 id=the-street-belongs-to-the-livingif-they-fight-for-it>The Street Belongs to the Living—If They Fight for It</h3><p><strong>Sidewalks are packed. Crosswalks are short. The city promises more space for people, but the blood dries slow.</strong> As Councilmember Keith Powers put it, <strong>&ldquo;you can feel congestion on the sidewalks&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/fifth-avenue-redesign-plan/>said Powers</a>). The Fifth Avenue redesign will double sidewalk space, but it comes in 2028. The dead cannot wait.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call Bores. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people, not just promises.</strong> Join groups like Transportation Alternatives and Families for Safe Streets. Do not let another name become a number. The street will not change itself. Only you can force their hand.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
