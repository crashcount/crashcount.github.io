Thirty-five left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, five deaths and over five hundred wounded. The old and the young. A woman, 81, crushed by an SUV on East 59th. Two men, both 67, struck down on Fifth Avenue. Blood on the pavement, sirens in the night. The city moves on. The families do not. See the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most harm.</strong> They killed, they maimed, they kept rolling. Trucks and buses followed. Bikes and mopeds hurt too, but the numbers are smaller. The deadliest force is always the same: speed and steel. The old story, told again and again. The sidewalk is not safe. The crosswalk is not safe. The bike lane is not safe.</p><h2 id=what-has-alex-bores-done>What Has Alex Bores Done?</h2><p>Assembly Member Alex Bores has moved on some fronts. He co-sponsored bills to require <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A324&amp;term=2025">complete street design</a>, to <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">install speed limiters on repeat offenders</a>, and to <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A803&amp;term=2025">enforce bike lane safety</a>. He backed <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/07/12/moped-and-e-bike-safety-legislation-becomes-state-law>moped and e-bike safety laws</a>, saying, &ldquo;By requiring the registration of mopeds at point of sale and the collection of e-bike collision data, we are making our streets safer and increasing accountability,&rdquo; as reported by <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/07/12/moped-and-e-bike-safety-legislation-becomes-state-law>Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p><p>But the work is not done. <strong>Sidewalks are still too narrow. Bike lanes are still unprotected.</strong> The Fifth Avenue redesign will widen sidewalks, but leaves out bus and bike lanes. &ldquo;This plan entirely fails to meet the moment,&rdquo; said <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/21/us-news/nycs-fifth-avenue-getting-400m-pedestrian-centered-makeover-that-drivers-and-cyclists-are-sure-to-hate/>Transportation Alternatives</a>.

The board called on the Department of Motor Vehicles to impose civil penalties on unregistered dealers and urged city and state officials to enforce laws against selling non-street-legal mopeds. The resolution also asks the city to consider a buy-back program for gas-powered mopeds. The matter, titled 'Upper West Side Panel Backs Resolution to Rein in Dangerous Mopeds,' supports Albany legislation requiring sellers to register mopeds with the DMV before sale. State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assembly Member Alex Bores sponsor the bill. Bores said, 'We need to cut off the flow of these vehicles before they get onto these streets.' The board’s move aims to close loopholes, protect vulnerable road users, and address the chaos caused by unregistered mopeds.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill aims to block illegal, unregistered mopeds from city streets. Dealers, not riders, would handle paperwork. Advocates say this targets bad actors and protects pedestrians from rogue machines.</p><p class=mb3>On October 23, 2023, State Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal (D-Manhattan) introduced a bill in Albany to require moped dealers to register vehicles with the DMV before buyers leave the shop. The bill, supported by Assembly Member Alex Bores (D-Upper East Side), seeks to close a loophole that lets illegal mopeds flood city streets. The matter summary states: 'New legislation in Albany seeks to eliminate the use of illegal mopeds by requiring sellers to register them with the DMV before buyers can take them out of the shop.' Hoylman-Sigal said, 'This common-sense bill would simply ensure that the registration happens at the point of sale, before someone rides out of the shop.' Ligia Guallpa of the Worker's Justice Project backs the move, stressing manufacturer responsibility. Attorney Daniel Flanzig says the law could clear streets of unregistered, dangerous vehicles. The bill is not yet law, but enforcement actions against illegal mopeds are already underway.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On May 30, 2023, State Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal and other NYC officials lobbied the state legislature to pass key transportation and housing bills before the session ends June 9. The centerpiece is 'Sammy’s Law,' which would let New York City set its own speed limits, potentially lowering them to 20 mph. Hoylman-Sigal, the bill’s sponsor, said, 'Senators in Massapequa shouldn’t set the speed limit for Manhattan—or the reverse.' The law is named for Sammy Cohen Eckstein, a 12-year-old killed by a car in Brooklyn. The bill had stalled before, but this year the required home rule resolution was submitted. Mayor Adams’ administration also pushed for affordable housing reforms. The push for Sammy’s Law is a fight to give NYC control over its streets and protect vulnerable road users from deadly speeding.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
