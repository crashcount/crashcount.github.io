The crash occurred during rush hour, with both vehicles traveling south. The report states the Hyundai driver struck the turning TAIZH, resulting in the Hyundai driver suffering severe crush injuries to his knee and lower leg. According to the police report, the primary contributing factors were 'Following Too Closely' and 'Passing Too Closely.' The narrative describes the impact as 'steel on bone,' with the driver remaining conscious as he waited for aid. The report does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor. No vehicle damage was recorded, but the human toll was immediate and severe.

The crash occurred at 1:31 p.m. The report states, 'A sedan struck a 16-year-old boy on a bike. No helmet. Abdomen torn. Blood pooled on the street. He lay in shock. The driver didn’t see him. Didn’t stop.' Police cite 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the primary contributing factor. The boy suffered severe lacerations to his abdomen and pelvis and was in shock at the scene. The police report does note the cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this is listed only after the driver’s inattention. The sedan’s left front quarter panel was damaged. The driver’s failure to see and yield to the cyclist is the central cause, as documented by the police.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Lawmakers say this closes loopholes, shifts blame from workers, and aims to cut rising crashes. Streets see more mopeds, more injuries, more tension.</p><p class=mb3>On July 12, 2024, Governor Hochul signed a package of eight bills into law, including new moped and e-bike safety regulations. The legislation, sponsored by State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assemblymember Alex Bores, requires retailers to register mopeds at the point of sale, provide safety information, and prohibit the sale of substandard lithium-ion batteries. The law also mandates crash reporting and new safety training for first responders. Hoylman-Sigal said, 'I've received more complaints about the hazards these mopeds cause than just about any other issue.' Bores added, 'By requiring the registration of mopeds at point of sale and the collection of e-bike collision data, we are making our streets safer and increasing accountability.' The law shifts accountability to retailers, aiming to improve street safety without penalizing delivery workers. Council Member Shekar Krishnan and State Senator Liz Kruger also voiced support, highlighting the dangers of unregistered mopeds and the need for better buyer education. The law responds to a sharp rise in moped-related injuries and community complaints across New York City.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The resolution also asks the city to consider a buy-back program for gas-powered mopeds. The matter, titled 'Upper West Side Panel Backs Resolution to Rein in Dangerous Mopeds,' supports Albany legislation requiring sellers to register mopeds with the DMV before sale. State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assembly Member Alex Bores sponsor the bill. Bores said, 'We need to cut off the flow of these vehicles before they get onto these streets.'

The bill aims to block illegal, unregistered mopeds from city streets. Dealers, not riders, would handle paperwork. Advocates say this targets bad actors and protects pedestrians from rogue machines.</p><p class=mb3>On October 23, 2023, State Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal (D-Manhattan) introduced a bill in Albany to require moped dealers to register vehicles with the DMV before buyers leave the shop. The bill, supported by Assembly Member Alex Bores (D-Upper East Side), seeks to close a loophole that lets illegal mopeds flood city streets. The matter summary states: 'New legislation in Albany seeks to eliminate the use of illegal mopeds by requiring sellers to register them with the DMV before buyers can take them out of the shop.' Hoylman-Sigal said, 'This common-sense bill would simply ensure that the registration happens at the point of sale, before someone rides out of the shop.' Ligia Guallpa of the Worker's Justice Project backs the move, stressing manufacturer responsibility. Attorney Daniel Flanzig says the law could clear streets of unregistered, dangerous vehicles. The bill is not yet law, but enforcement actions against illegal mopeds are already underway.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Tech giants profit. City infrastructure lags. Cars and trucks kill most. Enforcement is scattershot. Officials call for safe lanes, charging stations, and real accountability. The crisis demands a fix beyond punishing workers.</p><p class=mb3>"We need to cut off the flow of these vehicles before they get onto these streets." -- Alex Bores</p><p class=mb3>This policy debate, published August 23, 2023, analyzes New York City’s 'moped crisis.' The article, reviewed by Streetsblog NYC, highlights systemic failures: unsafe streets, lack of charging infrastructure, and tech companies shifting risk onto underpaid delivery workers. Council Member Alexa Aviles urges rapid expansion of e-bike charging stations and blames corporate greed. State Senators Jessica Ramos and Brad Hoylman-Sigal call for industry accountability and a standardized, safe delivery vehicle. The matter summary states, 'The city needs a systemic fix, justice for workers and accountability by tech giants.' Advocacy groups reject punitive crackdowns on workers, pushing instead for expanded bike lanes and public infrastructure. The piece concludes that only a multi-pronged, structural approach—never just enforcement—will protect vulnerable road users and delivery workers alike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
