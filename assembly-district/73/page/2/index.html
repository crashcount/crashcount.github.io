Thirty-six left with serious injuries.</strong> In the past year alone, five died and five more suffered wounds that will not heal. Most were walking or riding. Some were old. Some were young. All are gone or changed forever.</p><p>A bus struck a man on East 51st. An SUV killed an 81-year-old woman on East 59th. Two cyclists, both 67, died together at Fifth and 51st. The street does not care who you are. It only takes. Data from <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a> shows the toll.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h3><p>Assembly Member <strong>Alex Bores has moved on key safety bills</strong>. He co-sponsored the Stop Super Speeders Act, pushing for speed-limiting tech in cars with too many violations. He voted to extend school speed zones, a move to protect children and the old. He backed moped and e-bike safety laws, stating, <strong>&ldquo;By requiring the registration of mopeds at point of sale and the collection of e-bike collision data, we are making our streets safer and increasing accountability&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/07/12/moped-and-e-bike-safety-legislation-becomes-state-law>said Bores</a>).</p><p>But not every vote has favored the most vulnerable. Bores voted to weaken bus lane rules, a move that <strong>increases risk for those on foot and on bikes</strong>. He has supported e-bike registration bills that some say shift the burden onto workers and immigrants, not the drivers who kill.</p><h3 id=the-street-belongs-to-the-livingif-they-fight-for-it>The Street Belongs to the Living—If They Fight for It</h3><p><strong>Sidewalks are packed. Crosswalks are short. The city promises more space for people, but the blood dries slow.</strong> As Councilmember Keith Powers put it, <strong>&ldquo;you can feel congestion on the sidewalks&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/fifth-avenue-redesign-plan/>said Powers</a>). The Fifth Avenue redesign will double sidewalk space, but it comes in 2028. The dead cannot wait.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call Bores. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people, not just promises.</strong> Join groups like Transportation Alternatives and Families for Safe Streets. Do not let another name become a number. The street will not change itself. Only you can force their hand.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Citi Bike rider failed to yield the right-of-way and disregarded traffic control, as cited in both the narrative and the contributing factors. The report notes the bike bore no damage after the collision. The pedestrian’s action—crossing with the signal—is listed in the report, but only after the rider’s failure to yield and disregard for traffic controls. The crash underscores the danger posed when drivers or riders ignore basic right-of-way rules on New York City streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The board called on the Department of Motor Vehicles to impose civil penalties on unregistered dealers and urged city and state officials to enforce laws against selling non-street-legal mopeds. The resolution also asks the city to consider a buy-back program for gas-powered mopeds. The matter, titled 'Upper West Side Panel Backs Resolution to Rein in Dangerous Mopeds,' supports Albany legislation requiring sellers to register mopeds with the DMV before sale. State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assembly Member Alex Bores sponsor the bill. Bores said, 'We need to cut off the flow of these vehicles before they get onto these streets.' The board’s move aims to close loopholes, protect vulnerable road users, and address the chaos caused by unregistered mopeds.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill aims to block illegal, unregistered mopeds from city streets. Dealers, not riders, would handle paperwork. Advocates say this targets bad actors and protects pedestrians from rogue machines.</p><p class=mb3>On October 23, 2023, State Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal (D-Manhattan) introduced a bill in Albany to require moped dealers to register vehicles with the DMV before buyers leave the shop. The bill, supported by Assembly Member Alex Bores (D-Upper East Side), seeks to close a loophole that lets illegal mopeds flood city streets. The matter summary states: 'New legislation in Albany seeks to eliminate the use of illegal mopeds by requiring sellers to register them with the DMV before buyers can take them out of the shop.' Hoylman-Sigal said, 'This common-sense bill would simply ensure that the registration happens at the point of sale, before someone rides out of the shop.' Ligia Guallpa of the Worker's Justice Project backs the move, stressing manufacturer responsibility. Attorney Daniel Flanzig says the law could clear streets of unregistered, dangerous vehicles. The bill is not yet law, but enforcement actions against illegal mopeds are already underway.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article, reviewed by Streetsblog NYC, highlights systemic failures: unsafe streets, lack of charging infrastructure, and tech companies shifting risk onto underpaid delivery workers. Council Member Alexa Aviles urges rapid expansion of e-bike charging stations and blames corporate greed. State Senators Jessica Ramos and Brad Hoylman-Sigal call for industry accountability and a standardized, safe delivery vehicle. The matter summary states, 'The city needs a systemic fix, justice for workers and accountability by tech giants.' Advocacy groups reject punitive crackdowns on workers, pushing instead for expanded bike lanes and public infrastructure. The piece concludes that only a multi-pronged, structural approach—never just enforcement—will protect vulnerable road users and delivery workers alike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
