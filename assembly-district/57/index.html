Eight left with injuries that will not heal. In the last year alone, Assembly District 57 saw 1,088 crashes. Pedestrians and cyclists paid the price—crushed bodies, broken lives. A 55-year-old woman, struck by an SUV on Washington Avenue, died with crush injuries to her whole body. A 39-year-old man, killed by a truck and SUV on Atlantic Avenue, never made it home. These are not numbers. They are neighbors.</p><h3 id=the-blame-game-and-the-cost-of-delay>The Blame Game and the Cost of Delay</h3><p>SUVs and trucks led the body count. Of the pedestrian injuries, SUVs caused 39, trucks 5, and sedans 33. The city talks of safety, but the street tells another story. &ldquo;Before this bike lane from 2018 to 2022 this is the area that had the second largest numbers of pedestrian fatalities and crashes in the city,&rdquo; said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez about Bedford Avenue (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/13/breaking-mayor-adams-to-remove-bedford-avenue-protected-bike-lane-citing-bizarrely-safety>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>The city removed a protected bike lane after a child was hit—not by a car, but by a cyclist dodging double-parked cars. The mayor called it a response to &ldquo;community concerns&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/adams-dot-remove-bedford-avenue-bike-lane/>amNY</a>). The cars stayed. The danger stayed. The protection is gone.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-inaction>Leadership: Action and Inaction</h3><p>Assembly Member Phara Souffrant Forrest has taken steps. She co-sponsored bills to force speed limiters on repeat dangerous drivers and to require streets designed for all users. She voted yes on school speed cameras. She stood with other Brooklyn leaders to demand a complete bike lane network and condemned crackdowns that target cyclists instead of reckless drivers (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/05/mondays-headlines-nypd-bike-crackdown-edition>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>But the carnage continues. Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now? No More Waiting</h3><p>Call your council member. Call your assembly member. Demand 20 mph speed limits. Demand protected bike lanes that stay.

The ruling followed a lawsuit by Transportation Alternatives, who argued that removing the lane would endanger road users. The judge found City Hall 'acted arbitrarily, capriciously, and illegally' by failing to consult local officials or the community. The city cited 'several dangerous incidents—many of which involved children getting seriously hurt' as the reason for the proposed removal, after a 3-year-old was struck by an e-bike in May. The protected lane will remain until a court hearing in August. The case highlights the tension between rapid policy changes and the need for community input on street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They protested Governor Kathy Hochul’s June 5 decision to suspend congestion pricing, a move that froze $16.5 billion in MTA upgrades, including elevators for Bed-Stuy’s busy station. The event, covered by brooklynpaper.com, highlighted the urgent need for accessibility: 'We want our elevators, we want our service, and we want it now,' said State Sen. Jabari Brisport. Assembly Member Phara Souffrant Forrest called the delay a denial of basic rights. Ossé called Hochul’s move 'an attack on our most vulnerable constituents.' Only a quarter of city stations are wheelchair-accessible. The hold traps thousands—seniors, parents, disabled riders—forcing them to risk dangerous streets or skip transit altogether.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states, 'The box truck hit him first. The SUV followed. Head shattered. Bones crushed. He died there, beneath the streetlights, far from the crosswalk, alone on the asphalt.' Both vehicles—a box truck and a sport utility vehicle—were traveling straight ahead at the time of the collision. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified' for both drivers, offering no further detail on specific driver errors. The pedestrian was crossing the street at a location not marked by a signal or crosswalk, but the report does not cite this as a contributing factor. The focus remains on the lethal impact of large vehicles moving unchecked through city streets, leaving a man dead and unanswered questions in their wake.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
