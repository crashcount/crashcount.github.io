Over 500 injured. Nine left with wounds that will never heal. That is the toll in Assembly District 57 in the past year alone. The numbers are not just numbers. They are bodies on Fulton Street, Atlantic Avenue, and the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. They are families who will never be whole again.</p><p>On May 17, a 55-year-old man tried to cross Washington Avenue at Fulton. A Ford Explorer hit him and kept going. Police said, &ldquo;the driver sped off without stopping.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/17/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-55-year-old-man-crossing-brooklyn-street/>NY Daily News</a>.

She voted yes on school speed cameras. She joined the call to finish the Ashland Place bike lane, calling it a <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/03/crashland-dot-still-wont-follow-through-on-single-block-bike-lane-promise>&ldquo;missing link in Brooklyn’s protected bike lane network&rdquo;</a>.</p><p>She called the NYPD’s crackdown on cyclists <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/05/mondays-headlines-nypd-bike-crackdown-edition>&ldquo;incredibly misguided&rdquo; and &ldquo;unacceptable&rdquo;</a>. She stood with advocates against the governor’s delay of congestion pricing, calling it a <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/hochul-congestion-pricing-accessibility-upgrades-bed-stuy/>denial of basic rights</a>.</p><p>But the blood keeps coming. The city rips out bike lanes after crashes, not before.

It is policy. Every death is a choice made by those in power. The tools exist: lower speed limits, speed cameras, protected lanes, real enforcement against the worst drivers. Forrest has backed these moves. But laws on paper do not stop cars. Only action does.</p><p>Call Assembly Member Forrest. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed limiters for repeat offenders. Demand that every street is built for the child, the elder, the cyclist, the walker.</p><p>Do not wait for another body in the road.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Seddio claims the lane will only shift location and disputes the safety benefits, arguing, 'The bike lane will still exist, but merely shift to an alternative location in the road.' He also questions crash data, citing seasonal differences: 'The change in accident and injury rates is better explained by seasonal weather patterns.' Streetsblog notes that after the redesign, crashes dropped by 18–19% and injuries by 25–26%. The case highlights ongoing tension between local political power, city notification procedures, and efforts to protect cyclists and pedestrians through street design.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Plaintiffs argue the city violated Administrative Code Section 19-101.2, which requires advance notice and community input before removing bike lanes. The Department of Transportation skipped this step, announcing the removal on social media after consulting only select community members. The article quotes the lawsuit: the city acted "improperly, irrationally, without proper legal notice and in an abuse of discretion." Data cited in the suit show the upgraded lane improved safety for all road users. Councilman Lincoln Restler supported the legal action, seeking a restraining order to keep the lane. The case highlights failures in city process and the risks posed when safe infrastructure is abruptly erased.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'before this bike lane from 2018 to 2022 this is the area that had the second largest numbers of pedestrian fatalities and crashes in the city.' The lane faced opposition from some Hasidic leaders, citing children running into the lane from illegally parked cars and buses. Despite tweaks—school bus zones, daylighted corners, no standing areas—drivers kept parking illegally, blocking sightlines and endangering children. The city rarely removes protected lanes, but Adams acted after political pressure. Moving the lane to Classon Avenue, as some demand, would force cyclists onto a chaotic BQE ramp.

The article, 'Monday’s Headlines: NYPD Bike Crackdown Edition,' revealed that the crackdown would sweep 14 corridors across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. Assembly Member Phara Souffrant Forrest called the policy 'incredibly misguided' and 'unacceptable.' MSNBC’s Chris Hayes called it 'outrageous' and warned it targets immigrant delivery cyclists. The New York Civil Liberties Union warned of amplified racially targeted policing. The safety analyst notes: 'Criminalizing common cycling violations places undue burdens on cyclists, discourages cycling, and may reduce mode shift, ultimately undermining safety in numbers and street equity for vulnerable road users.' No council bill or committee action is involved, but the crackdown stands as a systemic threat to cyclists and street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT delays a promised bike lane. Elected officials and residents demand action. Private interests block progress. Cyclists face crashes and fear. The city shrugs. The gap remains. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On April 3, 2025, a coalition of Brooklyn officials—including Council Members Crystal Hudson, Shahana Hanif, Lincoln Restler, Assembly Members Andrew Gounardes, Jo Anne Simon, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, and Borough President Antonio Reynoso—sent a letter urging DOT to finish the protected bike lane on Ashland Place. The letter called the block a 'missing link in Brooklyn’s protected bike lane network.' Brooklyn Community Board 2 backed the demand. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and Borough Commissioner Keith Bray offered only vague replies. The block’s exclusion traces to a mayoral advisor’s intervention for developer Two Trees. Advocates like Kathy Park Price slammed the city: 'Private interests are able to redesign our streets, prioritizing vehicles over safety at a critical corridor.' Despite unanimous support, DOT keeps the street dangerous. The city’s inaction leaves cyclists exposed and the community frustrated.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crash involved two SUVs, with the Honda SUV moving straight ahead when it struck the cyclist. The police report details the cyclist was ejected and suffered crush injuries.

They protested Governor Kathy Hochul’s June 5 decision to suspend congestion pricing, a move that froze $16.5 billion in MTA upgrades, including elevators for Bed-Stuy’s busy station. The event, covered by brooklynpaper.com, highlighted the urgent need for accessibility: 'We want our elevators, we want our service, and we want it now,' said State Sen. Jabari Brisport. Assembly Member Phara Souffrant Forrest called the delay a denial of basic rights. Ossé called Hochul’s move 'an attack on our most vulnerable constituents.' Only a quarter of city stations are wheelchair-accessible.
