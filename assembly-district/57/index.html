We had a fire that blew out an apartment and brought a lot of fear to the building. For far too long families have lived in fear because they're not charging safely."" -- Phara Souffrant Forrest</p><p class=mb3>On July 22, 2025, a new e-bike battery swap hub opened at Ebbets Field Apartments in Brooklyn. The project, supported by Assembly Member Phara Souffrant Forrest and Council Member Crystal Hudson, brings seven PopWheels cabinets to the complex. Streetsblog NYC reports: 'Delivery workers who live in Brooklyn's Ebbets Field Apartments can now swap their dead e-bike batteries for charged ones without leaving their apartment complex.' Con Edison funded fire-safe infrastructure. The safety analyst notes this move cuts unsafe charging, supports delivery workers, and boosts safety for vulnerable road users. No council bill number or committee details apply.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The lane stays for now. Cyclists and pedestrians remain shielded. The fight over safety and street space continues. The city must wait for court.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist reported on June 18, 2025, that Brooklyn Supreme Court Judge Carolyn Walker-Diallo blocked Mayor Adams from removing the protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue. The city must wait until an August hearing before making changes. The ruling follows a lawsuit by Transportation Alternatives, who argued Adams 'abused his discretion' by ordering the lane reverted to its unprotected design. The city had cited community feedback and a viral video of a child struck by an e-bike as reasons for removal. The Department of Transportation installed the protected lane after five pedestrian deaths in 2021 and 2022. Local lawmakers protested the removal, calling the process hasty. The judge’s order keeps the safety improvements in place, pausing the city’s plan to restore curbside parking and expose cyclists to traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'before this bike lane from 2018 to 2022 this is the area that had the second largest numbers of pedestrian fatalities and crashes in the city.' The lane faced opposition from some Hasidic leaders, citing children running into the lane from illegally parked cars and buses. Despite tweaks—school bus zones, daylighted corners, no standing areas—drivers kept parking illegally, blocking sightlines and endangering children. The city rarely removes protected lanes, but Adams acted after political pressure. Moving the lane to Classon Avenue, as some demand, would force cyclists onto a chaotic BQE ramp. The decision highlights persistent driver violations and policy gaps that leave vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT delays a promised bike lane. Elected officials and residents demand action. Private interests block progress. Cyclists face crashes and fear. The city shrugs. The gap remains. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On April 3, 2025, a coalition of Brooklyn officials—including Council Members Crystal Hudson, Shahana Hanif, Lincoln Restler, Assembly Members Andrew Gounardes, Jo Anne Simon, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, and Borough President Antonio Reynoso—sent a letter urging DOT to finish the protected bike lane on Ashland Place. The letter called the block a 'missing link in Brooklyn’s protected bike lane network.' Brooklyn Community Board 2 backed the demand. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and Borough Commissioner Keith Bray offered only vague replies. The block’s exclusion traces to a mayoral advisor’s intervention for developer Two Trees. Advocates like Kathy Park Price slammed the city: 'Private interests are able to redesign our streets, prioritizing vehicles over safety at a critical corridor.' Despite unanimous support, DOT keeps the street dangerous. The city’s inaction leaves cyclists exposed and the community frustrated.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The road stays cold.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a BMW sedan struck a Tesla sedan from behind on the Brooklyn Queens Expressway just before midnight. The BMW driver was cited for 'Following Too Closely' and 'Unsafe Speed.' Both cars were traveling straight. The impact crushed the Tesla’s rear, injuring four male passengers and drivers. One young man suffered severe facial lacerations; others sustained whiplash, concussion, and shock. All wore seat belts. No contributing factors were attributed to the victims. The crash highlights the danger of driver errors—following too closely and speeding—on New York highways.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

She crashed to the pavement, blood running from her scalp. She stayed conscious, 29, staring skyward in Brooklyn’s night.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a sedan traveling south on Washington Avenue near Myrtle Avenue made a left turn and struck an eastbound e-scooter head-on. The report states, 'The car struck her head-on. She hit the pavement hard. No helmet. Blood ran from her scalp.' The e-scooter rider, a 29-year-old woman, suffered a severe head injury and remained conscious at the scene. The police report lists 'Driver Inexperience' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as contributing factors to the crash. The sedan’s driver’s actions—turning left across the path of the oncoming e-scooter—are central to the collision. The victim was not wearing a helmet, but this is noted only after the driver errors cited by police.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
