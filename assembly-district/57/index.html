The numbers do not bleed, but the streets do. Just this May, a 55-year-old man was crossing Washington Avenue at Fulton Street when a Ford Explorer struck him and sped away. He died at the hospital. The driver did not stop. Police called it the second fatal hit-and-run in Brooklyn that week (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/17/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-55-year-old-man-crossing-brooklyn-street/>police called it the second fatal hit-and-run</a>).</p><p>A few months earlier, a woman stepped out of a taxi on Flatbush Avenue.

She voted to extend school speed zones, a move to protect children near schools (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted to extend school speed zones</a>). She co-sponsored bills for speed limiters on repeat offenders (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored bills for speed limiters</a>) and for automated bike lane enforcement (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A4637&amp;term=2023">automated bike lane enforcement</a>).

When the mayor ripped out a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue, Council Member Lincoln Restler said, <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/adams-dot-remove-bedford-avenue-bike-lane/>&ldquo;the Mayor is making a purely political decision to rip out a bike lane with no alternative.&rdquo;</a></p><h2 id=the-road-ahead-demand-more>The Road Ahead: Demand More</h2><p><strong>This is not fate.

Streetsblog NYC reports: 'Delivery workers who live in Brooklyn's Ebbets Field Apartments can now swap their dead e-bike batteries for charged ones without leaving their apartment complex.' Con Edison funded fire-safe infrastructure. The safety analyst notes this move cuts unsafe charging, supports delivery workers, and boosts safety for vulnerable road users.

Judge Ventura issued a restraining order after Transportation Alternatives and Baruch Herzfeld appealed the city’s move. The city had planned to start demolition after complaints from local leaders, but the court’s order blocks any changes until further review. Streetsblog quotes Ben Furnas: 'The Adams administration is going to have to spend their night preparing their legal case, not ripping out a critical safety project.' The article highlights weak enforcement of parking rules and the city’s reversal against its own DOT’s safety plan. The case underscores how political pressure and lax enforcement can threaten vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Head injury. Blood on the street. Police cite blocked view. Driver kept straight. Shock followed.</p><p class=mb3>A Ford SUV traveling north on Flatbush Avenue struck a 29-year-old woman crossing at Lafayette Avenue. According to the police report, the pedestrian suffered a head injury and severe bleeding. The report lists 'View Obstructed/Limited' as the contributing factor. The driver, a 71-year-old man, was licensed and going straight ahead. No other injuries were reported. The police report notes the pedestrian was crossing against the signal, but the primary factor remains the obstructed view.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The city planned to restore the old painted lane, citing complaints about fast bikes and e-bikes. But advocates and residents sued, arguing the old design was unsafe and that 'safety of all road users has improved since the upgraded design was installed.' The judge's order prevents immediate removal, pending an August hearing. Transportation Alternatives called the ruling a win for street safety, saying, 'We won't let anyone make our streets more dangerous.'

Cyclists described the decision as political, with one saying, "There’s a very important voting bloc that’s using their leverage over the mayor to remove the bike lane." The mayor’s refusal to sacrifice parking for safety left vulnerable road users exposed.

The safety analyst notes: 'Criminalizing common cycling violations places undue burdens on cyclists, discourages cycling, and may reduce mode shift, ultimately undermining safety in numbers and street equity for vulnerable road users.'
