A Ford Explorer hit him and kept going. He died at the hospital. No arrest. No justice. It was the second fatal hit-and-run in Brooklyn that week. The city counts these numbers, but they are lives. In the last year, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>three people died and 550 were injured</a> on the streets of Assembly District 57. Eight suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The dead do not speak. The wounded carry scars.</p><h2 id=the-numbers-are-names>The Numbers Are Names</h2><p>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>SUVs, trucks, and cars caused the most harm</a>—three deaths, 86 moderate injuries, six serious injuries from cars and SUVs alone. Trucks and buses killed two more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes added to the toll. Children, the elderly, the young—no one is spared. In one year, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>38 children were hurt</a>. The violence is steady, not sudden. It is a slow bleed.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h2><p>Assembly Member Phara Souffrant Forrest has taken some steps. She co-sponsored a bill to force speed limiters on repeat dangerous drivers, aiming to stop the worst offenders before they kill again. She backed a bill for safer street design, so roads protect people, not just cars. She voted for more speed cameras near schools. When the NYPD cracked down on cyclists instead of reckless drivers, she called it <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/05/mondays-headlines-nypd-bike-crackdown-edition>&ldquo;incredibly misguided&rdquo; and &ldquo;unacceptable&rdquo;</a>. When the city stalled on a protected bike lane, she joined others to <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/03/crashland-dot-still-wont-follow-through-on-single-block-bike-lane-promise>demand action</a>, calling the missing block a &ldquo;critical corridor.&rdquo;</p><p>But the pace is slow. The blood dries before the paint on new lanes. The city has the power to lower speed limits now. It has not done so. The cameras that save lives are always under threat. The work is not finished.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>Call your leaders. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand every street is safe for the child, the elder, the cyclist, the walker.</strong> The dead cannot call. The living must. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The article, 'Monday’s Headlines: NYPD Bike Crackdown Edition,' revealed that the crackdown would sweep 14 corridors across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. Assembly Member Phara Souffrant Forrest called the policy 'incredibly misguided' and 'unacceptable.' MSNBC’s Chris Hayes called it 'outrageous' and warned it targets immigrant delivery cyclists. The New York Civil Liberties Union warned of amplified racially targeted policing. The safety analyst notes: 'Criminalizing common cycling violations places undue burdens on cyclists, discourages cycling, and may reduce mode shift, ultimately undermining safety in numbers and street equity for vulnerable road users.' No council bill or committee action is involved, but the crackdown stands as a systemic threat to cyclists and street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The letter called the block a 'missing link in Brooklyn’s protected bike lane network.' Brooklyn Community Board 2 backed the demand. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and Borough Commissioner Keith Bray offered only vague replies. The block’s exclusion traces to a mayoral advisor’s intervention for developer Two Trees. Advocates like Kathy Park Price slammed the city: 'Private interests are able to redesign our streets, prioritizing vehicles over safety at a critical corridor.' Despite unanimous support, DOT keeps the street dangerous.

The report states, 'The box truck hit him first. The SUV followed. Head shattered. Bones crushed. He died there, beneath the streetlights, far from the crosswalk, alone on the asphalt.' Both vehicles—a box truck and a sport utility vehicle—were traveling straight ahead at the time of the collision. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified' for both drivers, offering no further detail on specific driver errors. The pedestrian was crossing the street at a location not marked by a signal or crosswalk, but the report does not cite this as a contributing factor. The focus remains on the lethal impact of large vehicles moving unchecked through city streets, leaving a man dead and unanswered questions in their wake.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
