The numbers do not bleed, but the streets do. Just this May, a 55-year-old man was crossing Washington Avenue at Fulton Street when a Ford Explorer struck him and sped away. He died at the hospital. The driver did not stop. Police called it the second fatal hit-and-run in Brooklyn that week (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/17/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-55-year-old-man-crossing-brooklyn-street/>police called it the second fatal hit-and-run</a>).</p><p>A few months earlier, a woman stepped out of a taxi on Flatbush Avenue.

She voted to extend school speed zones, a move to protect children near schools (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted to extend school speed zones</a>). She co-sponsored bills for speed limiters on repeat offenders (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored bills for speed limiters</a>) and for automated bike lane enforcement (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A4637&amp;term=2023">automated bike lane enforcement</a>).

When the mayor ripped out a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue, Council Member Lincoln Restler said, <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/adams-dot-remove-bedford-avenue-bike-lane/>&ldquo;the Mayor is making a purely political decision to rip out a bike lane with no alternative.&rdquo;</a></p><h2 id=the-road-ahead-demand-more>The Road Ahead: Demand More</h2><p><strong>This is not fate.

Both drivers remained at the scene. No arrests have been made. The NYPD Highway Collision Investigation Squad continues to review the crash.

They protested Governor Kathy Hochul’s June 5 decision to suspend congestion pricing, a move that froze $16.5 billion in MTA upgrades, including elevators for Bed-Stuy’s busy station. The event, covered by brooklynpaper.com, highlighted the urgent need for accessibility: 'We want our elevators, we want our service, and we want it now,' said State Sen. Jabari Brisport. Assembly Member Phara Souffrant Forrest called the delay a denial of basic rights. Ossé called Hochul’s move 'an attack on our most vulnerable constituents.' Only a quarter of city stations are wheelchair-accessible. The hold traps thousands—seniors, parents, disabled riders—forcing them to risk dangerous streets or skip transit altogether.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They warn free bridges funnel traffic into certain neighborhoods. Their letter calls for fairness. The MTA stays silent. The Traffic Mobility Review Board will decide. Streets hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On July 18, 2023, Council Member Shahana Hanif and other Brooklyn officials called for 'equalized tolling on all crossings into Manhattan' as congestion pricing nears. Their letter to the Traffic Mobility Review Board states: 'No one community should disproportionately bear the burden of the cars and trucks passing through their neighborhood.' Hanif, along with Lincoln Restler, Alexa Avilés, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Crystal Hudson, joined borough, state, and federal colleagues in this push. They propose a credit system to balance costs between DOT bridges and MTA tunnels, aiming to protect neighborhoods like the Brooklyn waterfront and the BQE corridor from traffic surges. The MTA declined comment. The Board will soon set final toll rates and rules. The federal government has approved the congestion pricing plan, with tolls for cars expected between $9 and $23. Over 100 exemption requests, including from taxi and for-hire vehicle drivers, are under review.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
