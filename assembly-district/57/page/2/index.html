A Ford Explorer hit him and kept going. He died at the hospital. No arrest. No justice. It was the second fatal hit-and-run in Brooklyn that week. The city counts these numbers, but they are lives. In the last year, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>three people died and 550 were injured</a> on the streets of Assembly District 57. Eight suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The dead do not speak. The wounded carry scars.</p><h2 id=the-numbers-are-names>The Numbers Are Names</h2><p>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>SUVs, trucks, and cars caused the most harm</a>—three deaths, 86 moderate injuries, six serious injuries from cars and SUVs alone. Trucks and buses killed two more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes added to the toll. Children, the elderly, the young—no one is spared. In one year, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>38 children were hurt</a>. The violence is steady, not sudden. It is a slow bleed.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h2><p>Assembly Member Phara Souffrant Forrest has taken some steps. She co-sponsored a bill to force speed limiters on repeat dangerous drivers, aiming to stop the worst offenders before they kill again. She backed a bill for safer street design, so roads protect people, not just cars. She voted for more speed cameras near schools. When the NYPD cracked down on cyclists instead of reckless drivers, she called it <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/05/mondays-headlines-nypd-bike-crackdown-edition>&ldquo;incredibly misguided&rdquo; and &ldquo;unacceptable&rdquo;</a>. When the city stalled on a protected bike lane, she joined others to <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/03/crashland-dot-still-wont-follow-through-on-single-block-bike-lane-promise>demand action</a>, calling the missing block a &ldquo;critical corridor.&rdquo;</p><p>But the pace is slow. The blood dries before the paint on new lanes. The city has the power to lower speed limits now. It has not done so. The cameras that save lives are always under threat. The work is not finished.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>Call your leaders. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand every street is safe for the child, the elder, the cyclist, the walker.</strong> The dead cannot call. The living must. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Their letter to the Traffic Mobility Review Board states: 'No one community should disproportionately bear the burden of the cars and trucks passing through their neighborhood.' Hanif, along with Lincoln Restler, Alexa Avilés, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Crystal Hudson, joined borough, state, and federal colleagues in this push. They propose a credit system to balance costs between DOT bridges and MTA tunnels, aiming to protect neighborhoods like the Brooklyn waterfront and the BQE corridor from traffic surges. The MTA declined comment. The Board will soon set final toll rates and rules. The federal government has approved the congestion pricing plan, with tolls for cars expected between $9 and $23. Over 100 exemption requests, including from taxi and for-hire vehicle drivers, are under review.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On February 10, 2023, eighteen Brooklyn lawmakers issued a joint letter demanding New York State Department of Transportation (DOT) participate in comprehensive planning for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens. Jabari Brisport, Julia Salazar, Kristen Gonzalez, Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Members Bobby Carroll, Maritza Davila, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Emily Gallagher, Jo Anne Simon, Marcela Mitaynes, and Council Members Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Lincoln Restler. Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint. Without state action, only city-owned segments see attention. The city’s efforts are limited.
