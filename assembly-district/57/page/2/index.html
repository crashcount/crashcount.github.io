Eight left with injuries that will not heal. In the last year alone, Assembly District 57 saw 1,088 crashes. Pedestrians and cyclists paid the price—crushed bodies, broken lives. A 55-year-old woman, struck by an SUV on Washington Avenue, died with crush injuries to her whole body. A 39-year-old man, killed by a truck and SUV on Atlantic Avenue, never made it home. These are not numbers. They are neighbors.</p><h3 id=the-blame-game-and-the-cost-of-delay>The Blame Game and the Cost of Delay</h3><p>SUVs and trucks led the body count. Of the pedestrian injuries, SUVs caused 39, trucks 5, and sedans 33. The city talks of safety, but the street tells another story. &ldquo;Before this bike lane from 2018 to 2022 this is the area that had the second largest numbers of pedestrian fatalities and crashes in the city,&rdquo; said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez about Bedford Avenue (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/13/breaking-mayor-adams-to-remove-bedford-avenue-protected-bike-lane-citing-bizarrely-safety>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>The city removed a protected bike lane after a child was hit—not by a car, but by a cyclist dodging double-parked cars. The mayor called it a response to &ldquo;community concerns&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/adams-dot-remove-bedford-avenue-bike-lane/>amNY</a>). The cars stayed. The danger stayed. The protection is gone.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-inaction>Leadership: Action and Inaction</h3><p>Assembly Member Phara Souffrant Forrest has taken steps. She co-sponsored bills to force speed limiters on repeat dangerous drivers and to require streets designed for all users. She voted yes on school speed cameras. She stood with other Brooklyn leaders to demand a complete bike lane network and condemned crackdowns that target cyclists instead of reckless drivers (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/05/mondays-headlines-nypd-bike-crackdown-edition>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>But the carnage continues. Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now? No More Waiting</h3><p>Call your council member. Call your assembly member. Demand 20 mph speed limits. Demand protected bike lanes that stay. Demand enforcement against the drivers who kill and maim.</p><p>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The crash occurred at 23:32 near Council District 35. The report states the truck’s front end crushed the pedestrian’s face, leaving him with severe lacerations, though he remained conscious. Police cite 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the sole contributing factor. The vehicle, registered in North Carolina, was traveling east and struck the pedestrian outside a crosswalk. The police report makes no mention of pedestrian error as a contributing factor, focusing entirely on the driver’s distraction. The incident underscores the ongoing threat posed by inattentive drivers on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Hanif, along with Lincoln Restler, Alexa Avilés, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Crystal Hudson, joined borough, state, and federal colleagues in this push. They propose a credit system to balance costs between DOT bridges and MTA tunnels, aiming to protect neighborhoods like the Brooklyn waterfront and the BQE corridor from traffic surges. The MTA declined comment. The Board will soon set final toll rates and rules. The federal government has approved the congestion pricing plan, with tolls for cars expected between $9 and $23.

The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens.

Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint.
