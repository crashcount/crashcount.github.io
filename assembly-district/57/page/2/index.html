In AD 57, crashes peak late, with deaths logged at 1 a.m., 2 a.m., 3 a.m., and again at 11 p.m. The tally runs through the clock. <a href=#>Hour by hour, the injuries stack</a> — 183 people hurt at 5 p.m., 163 at 6 p.m., 149 at 7 p.m., 122 at 9 p.m., 111 at 11 p.m. The numbers don’t blink.</p><p>Bikes and feet take the blows. In this district since 2022, drivers have hit <a href=#>425 pedestrians and 456 cyclists</a>. Twelve people are dead at the top hot spots alone — Bedford Avenue, the BQE, Fulton Street, Atlantic Avenue, Rogers Avenue — a roll call of corners where the sirens never surprise.</p><h3 id=bedford-and-fulton-a-man-falls-the-driver-flees>Bedford and Fulton: a man falls, the driver flees</h3><p>Just after midnight on May 17, at Washington and Fulton, a <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/17/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-55-year-old-man-crossing-brooklyn-street/>55‑year‑old man was struck</a> by a westbound Ford Explorer. Police said the SUV <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/17/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-55-year-old-man-crossing-brooklyn-street/>“rammed into him” and sped off</a>. He died at the hospital. No arrest.</p><p>On Bedford at Lafayette, at 3:07 a.m. last October, a <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>49‑year‑old pedestrian was killed</a> in the intersection. City data lists the impact at the center front of the vehicle. The entry leaves the rest blank.</p><h3 id=atlantic-avenue-heavy-steel-soft-bodies>Atlantic Avenue: heavy steel, soft bodies</h3><p>Atlantic is a straight line with a long memory. It is one of the district’s top injury sites and a place with <a href=#>a recorded death</a>. A separate fatal crash on Myrtle near Walworth shows the weight of freight: a <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>flatbed, a box truck, a pickup, and an SUV</a> in a chain that <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>killed a 37‑year‑old man working in the roadway</a>. Trucks and buses account for a hard share of pedestrian harm here — <a href=#>three pedestrian deaths tied to trucks, plus more injuries</a>.</p><p>The district’s worst corridors are not a secret. <a href=#>Bedford Avenue leads the list</a> with a death and 203 injuries. <a href=#>Fulton Street follows</a>. The <a href=#>BQE claims two deaths</a> and 159 more injuries; two motorcyclists are among the dead there.</p><h3 id=city-hall-erases-protection-the-crashes-dont-stop>City hall erases protection; the crashes don’t stop</h3><p>The city tore out part of the Bedford Avenue protected lane this summer. The mayor said it was to <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/adams-dot-remove-bedford-avenue-bike-lane/>“better reflect community feedback”</a>. A council member called it <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/adams-dot-remove-bedford-avenue-bike-lane/>“a purely political decision to rip out a bike lane with no alternative”</a>. Advocates sued, saying the city acted <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/breaking-activists-sue-city-to-prevent-erasure-of-bedford-avenue-bike-lane>“without proper legal notice and in an abuse of discretion”</a>. A judge briefly froze the plan; the fight continues in court filings and cones.</p><p>The crashes kept coming. In July, drivers struck riders on <a href=#>Bedford</a> and <a href=#>Vanderbilt</a>. A driver hit a pedestrian at <a href=#>Flatbush and Lafayette</a>. Names withheld. Bodies counted.</p><h3 id=nights-and-repeat-hot-spots>Nights and repeat hot spots</h3><p>Injury spikes hit late afternoon and night. Deaths land at 1 a.m., 2 a.m., 3 a.m., then 9 p.m. and 11 p.m. <a href=#>DOT’s own numbers show clusters</a>. That’s when visibility drops and speed climbs. The city’s data flags two fixes: <a href=#>nighttime conditions and repeat hotspots</a>.</p><p>The victims skew toward people outside cars. Since 2022, pedestrians suffered <a href=#>425 injuries and six deaths</a>. Cyclists, <a href=#>456 injuries and one death</a>. Trucks and buses are over‑represented in serious pedestrian harm here, with <a href=#>three pedestrian deaths tied to trucks</a>.</p><h3 id=what-would-stop-the-bleeding-on-these-blocks>What would stop the bleeding on these blocks</h3><ul><li>Daylight every corner on Bedford, Fulton, Atlantic. Move parking back from crosswalks. Harden turns. Give walkers a head start at signals.</li><li>Lock down truck routes and hours on Atlantic and Myrtle’s work zones. Enforce loading rules. Keep box trucks and flatbeds out of crosswalk sightlines.</li><li>Target enforcement where the bodies fell: Bedford at Lafayette; Washington at Fulton; the BQE ramps. Night operations. No showy blitz. Just the worst spots, at the worst hours.</li></ul><h3 id=the-law-is-there-use-it>The law is there. Use it.</h3><p>Albany extended 24/7 school‑zone cameras through 2030; your senator voted yes on <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>S 8344</a>. The Assembly is pushing tech to choke speed from repeat offenders. One bill would force drivers with heavy point totals or camera tickets to install speed‑limiters (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">A 2299</a>).</p><p>City Hall already has power to slow the rest of the grid. A 20 mph default, block by block, would meet the danger where it lives. The dead can’t call in a complaint.</p><h3 id=two-notes-to-remember>Two notes to remember</h3><ul><li>Bedford Avenue lost protection while the district posted <a href=#>203 injuries and a death on that corridor</a>. The summer brought more crashes.</li><li>On Fulton at Washington, a man’s last minutes ended under an SUV. The driver <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/17/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-55-year-old-man-crossing-brooklyn-street/>left him there</a>.</li></ul><p>Take one step. Tell City Hall and Albany to slow the cars and stop the repeat offenders.

Silence pressed down, broken only by pain.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, an e-bike and an e-scooter collided near 429 Flushing Avenue in Brooklyn at 5:30 p.m. The crash occurred amid scattered debris, which the report lists as 'Obstruction/Debris' under contributing factors. Both vehicles were traveling straight—one southbound, one westbound—when they struck each other. The impact left a 28-year-old man, identified as an e-bike driver, with severe lacerations to his lower leg and knee. The narrative describes blood pooling from his wounds as he lay conscious on the street, machines crumpled around him. The police report does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor, but notes the absence of a helmet after driver errors and environmental hazards. The collision underscores the danger posed by roadway obstructions and debris, which directly contributed to the violent impact.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

They protested Governor Kathy Hochul’s June 5 decision to suspend congestion pricing, a move that froze $16.5 billion in MTA upgrades, including elevators for Bed-Stuy’s busy station. The event, covered by brooklynpaper.com, highlighted the urgent need for accessibility: 'We want our elevators, we want our service, and we want it now,' said State Sen. Jabari Brisport. Assembly Member Phara Souffrant Forrest called the delay a denial of basic rights. Ossé called Hochul’s move 'an attack on our most vulnerable constituents.' Only a quarter of city stations are wheelchair-accessible. The hold traps thousands—seniors, parents, disabled riders—forcing them to risk dangerous streets or skip transit altogether.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
