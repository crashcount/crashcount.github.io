In AD 57, crashes peak late, with deaths logged at 1 a.m., 2 a.m., 3 a.m., and again at 11 p.m. The tally runs through the clock. <a href=#>Hour by hour, the injuries stack</a> — 183 people hurt at 5 p.m., 163 at 6 p.m., 149 at 7 p.m., 122 at 9 p.m., 111 at 11 p.m. The numbers don’t blink.</p><p>Bikes and feet take the blows. In this district since 2022, drivers have hit <a href=#>425 pedestrians and 456 cyclists</a>. Twelve people are dead at the top hot spots alone — Bedford Avenue, the BQE, Fulton Street, Atlantic Avenue, Rogers Avenue — a roll call of corners where the sirens never surprise.</p><h3 id=bedford-and-fulton-a-man-falls-the-driver-flees>Bedford and Fulton: a man falls, the driver flees</h3><p>Just after midnight on May 17, at Washington and Fulton, a <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/17/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-55-year-old-man-crossing-brooklyn-street/>55‑year‑old man was struck</a> by a westbound Ford Explorer. Police said the SUV <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/17/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-55-year-old-man-crossing-brooklyn-street/>“rammed into him” and sped off</a>. He died at the hospital. No arrest.</p><p>On Bedford at Lafayette, at 3:07 a.m. last October, a <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>49‑year‑old pedestrian was killed</a> in the intersection. City data lists the impact at the center front of the vehicle. The entry leaves the rest blank.</p><h3 id=atlantic-avenue-heavy-steel-soft-bodies>Atlantic Avenue: heavy steel, soft bodies</h3><p>Atlantic is a straight line with a long memory. It is one of the district’s top injury sites and a place with <a href=#>a recorded death</a>. A separate fatal crash on Myrtle near Walworth shows the weight of freight: a <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>flatbed, a box truck, a pickup, and an SUV</a> in a chain that <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>killed a 37‑year‑old man working in the roadway</a>. Trucks and buses account for a hard share of pedestrian harm here — <a href=#>three pedestrian deaths tied to trucks, plus more injuries</a>.</p><p>The district’s worst corridors are not a secret. <a href=#>Bedford Avenue leads the list</a> with a death and 203 injuries. <a href=#>Fulton Street follows</a>. The <a href=#>BQE claims two deaths</a> and 159 more injuries; two motorcyclists are among the dead there.</p><h3 id=city-hall-erases-protection-the-crashes-dont-stop>City hall erases protection; the crashes don’t stop</h3><p>The city tore out part of the Bedford Avenue protected lane this summer. The mayor said it was to <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/adams-dot-remove-bedford-avenue-bike-lane/>“better reflect community feedback”</a>. A council member called it <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/adams-dot-remove-bedford-avenue-bike-lane/>“a purely political decision to rip out a bike lane with no alternative”</a>. Advocates sued, saying the city acted <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/breaking-activists-sue-city-to-prevent-erasure-of-bedford-avenue-bike-lane>“without proper legal notice and in an abuse of discretion”</a>. A judge briefly froze the plan; the fight continues in court filings and cones.</p><p>The crashes kept coming. In July, drivers struck riders on <a href=#>Bedford</a> and <a href=#>Vanderbilt</a>. A driver hit a pedestrian at <a href=#>Flatbush and Lafayette</a>. Names withheld. Bodies counted.</p><h3 id=nights-and-repeat-hot-spots>Nights and repeat hot spots</h3><p>Injury spikes hit late afternoon and night. Deaths land at 1 a.m., 2 a.m., 3 a.m., then 9 p.m. and 11 p.m. <a href=#>DOT’s own numbers show clusters</a>. That’s when visibility drops and speed climbs. The city’s data flags two fixes: <a href=#>nighttime conditions and repeat hotspots</a>.</p><p>The victims skew toward people outside cars. Since 2022, pedestrians suffered <a href=#>425 injuries and six deaths</a>. Cyclists, <a href=#>456 injuries and one death</a>. Trucks and buses are over‑represented in serious pedestrian harm here, with <a href=#>three pedestrian deaths tied to trucks</a>.</p><h3 id=what-would-stop-the-bleeding-on-these-blocks>What would stop the bleeding on these blocks</h3><ul><li>Daylight every corner on Bedford, Fulton, Atlantic. Move parking back from crosswalks. Harden turns. Give walkers a head start at signals.</li><li>Lock down truck routes and hours on Atlantic and Myrtle’s work zones. Enforce loading rules. Keep box trucks and flatbeds out of crosswalk sightlines.</li><li>Target enforcement where the bodies fell: Bedford at Lafayette; Washington at Fulton; the BQE ramps. Night operations. No showy blitz. Just the worst spots, at the worst hours.</li></ul><h3 id=the-law-is-there-use-it>The law is there. Use it.</h3><p>Albany extended 24/7 school‑zone cameras through 2030; your senator voted yes on <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>S 8344</a>. The Assembly is pushing tech to choke speed from repeat offenders. One bill would force drivers with heavy point totals or camera tickets to install speed‑limiters (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">A 2299</a>).</p><p>City Hall already has power to slow the rest of the grid. A 20 mph default, block by block, would meet the danger where it lives. The dead can’t call in a complaint.</p><h3 id=two-notes-to-remember>Two notes to remember</h3><ul><li>Bedford Avenue lost protection while the district posted <a href=#>203 injuries and a death on that corridor</a>. The summer brought more crashes.</li><li>On Fulton at Washington, a man’s last minutes ended under an SUV. The driver <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/17/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-55-year-old-man-crossing-brooklyn-street/>left him there</a>.</li></ul><p>Take one step.

According to the police report, the sedan's driver was inattentive and distracted. The crash left a 53-year-old male cyclist with a severe head injury and bleeding, while a 41-year-old male cyclist suffered injuries to his knee, lower leg, and foot. Both cyclists were conscious after the collision. The report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Outside Car Distraction' as contributing factors. The 53-year-old was not wearing a helmet, as noted in the report, but the primary cause remains the driver's failure to pay attention. No injuries were reported for the sedan's occupants.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
