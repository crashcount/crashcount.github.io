Twenty-six left with serious injuries. Over two thousand hurt.</strong> These are not just numbers—they are lives ended or broken on the streets of Greenpoint, Williamsburg, and South Williamsburg since 2022. The dead include a ten-year-old girl, crushed by an SUV while crossing with the signal at Franklin Avenue and Wallabout Street. The driver failed to yield.

In March, a man was killed by an e-bike rider who ran a stop. In June, the city moved to strip protection from the Bedford Avenue bike lane after a series of crashes. The city called it a safety fix. The result: <strong>cyclists forced back into the path of cars and trucks.</strong></p><h3 id=whose-safety-counts>Whose Safety Counts?</h3><p>The fight over Bedford Avenue exposed the fault lines. One resident pleaded, <em>&ldquo;I beg the court, please for my safety and the safety of my children and all the 2,000 children living close to the dangerous new bike lane, please allow the mayor to shift the bike lane&rsquo;s location on the roadway.&rdquo;</em> <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/nyc-cleared-to-move-bedford-ave-bike-lane-in-brooklyn-seen-as-hazard-to-pedestrians/>NY Daily News</a></p><p>But others warned, removing the protected lane would bring &ldquo;irreparable harm&rdquo; to the neighborhood.

Safety and climate take a back seat.</p><p class=mb3>On August 4, 2023, Assemblymember Emily Gallagher (District 50) joined Comptroller Brad Lander in criticizing New York State’s use of federal infrastructure funds. The state plans to spend hundreds of millions widening city highways, including $730 million for the Van Wyck Expressway. Lander called this a repeat of past errors, saying, 'Even maintaining a state of good repair on existing roadway infrastructure would be a better use of money than widening the highway.' Gallagher warned, 'New York state risks squandering the historic investments of the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act by directing far too much funding toward highway expansion instead of climate resilient, multimodal projects.' Both urge a shift to projects that cut emissions and improve safety for all, especially those outside cars.

The bill, introduced in the New York State Legislature, would require drivers with at least six speeding tickets in a single year, or 11 points in 18 months, to install speed limiter devices in their vehicles. The matter summary states: "We are going to literally force you to slow down by requiring you to install a speed limiter on your car." Gounardes led the announcement at the Atlantic Avenue intersection where a driver killed Katherine Harris. Gallagher, co-sponsor, said, "Cars and trucks can act as weapons when used recklessly." The bill aims to bypass bureaucratic hurdles and act automatically, modeled after ignition interlock devices for drunk drivers. Advocates and city officials joined the call, citing data that speed limiters can reduce traffic deaths by 37 percent. The bill targets the most dangerous drivers, seeking to end impunity for repeat offenders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure would force these drivers to install devices that cap speed at five miles per hour above the limit. Gounardes said, 'There is a persistent cohort of drivers... driving on our streets recklessly without any consequences.' The bill was unveiled at the site of a fatal pedestrian crash in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn.

The intersection, once part of an Open Street program, lost its protections after local backlash. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher said, "The community has tried for a bike lane on this exact street & a play street in front of the school, and all were KILLED by backlash. Blood is on our hands. Shame on us." Advocates like Noel Hidalgo and Bronwyn Breitner called out city delays and DOT inaction. The Department of Transportation made minor changes but failed to stand up to opposition. Proposals for bike lanes stalled. The dismantling of safety measures left vulnerable road users exposed. The death highlights the deadly cost of caving to anti-safety voices and the urgent need for real protection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, presented to Community Board 1's Transportation Committee, will remove a car lane in each direction and install protected bike lanes along a 1.1-mile stretch from Meeker Avenue to the Pulaski Bridge. The official summary states the overhaul will 'reconfigure the 1.1-mile stretch... following advocacy for safety upgrades after multiple deaths.' Council Member Lincoln Restler and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher praised the plan, calling it 'transformative' and pledging support. DOT statistics show similar road diets reduce deaths and serious injuries by 30 percent. The redesign includes shorter crosswalks, pedestrian islands, and new loading zones. This action responds to a history of crashes and the 2021 hit-and-run killing of teacher Matthew Jensen.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report lists 'Other Vehicular' as a contributing factor. The e-bike rider was unlicensed and partially ejected from his seat, suffering fatal head and crush injuries. The trailer was parked at the time of the crash and had no occupants. The police report notes the rider wore a helmet, but the primary factors remain the collision and the parked trailer.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi claimed some locals want three lanes each way, but 17 elected officials, including State Sen. Julia Salazar, Sen. Andrew Gounardes, Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, and Council Member Lincoln Restler, publicly rejected the idea. Salazar said, 'no to three lanes. Two lanes at most.' Gounardes confirmed, 'all support a two-lane highway.' Gallagher wrote, '2 lanes if any.' Restler called City Hall’s statements 'plainly inaccurate.' The Department of Transportation delayed environmental review to study both options. Advocates and officials urge investment in mass transit, not highway expansion. Vulnerable road users remain at risk as the city weighs more lanes for cars and trucks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article, titled 'Mayor Adams Has Leverage to Force a Reluctant State DOT to Budge on the BQE,' details how city DOT can veto regional transportation plans and must approve state highway projects within city limits. Jon Orcutt, former city DOT official, urges Adams to push for a full corridor plan and not settle for piecemeal fixes. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher and Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso are named as officials demanding state DOT return to the process. The BQE has long divided North Brooklyn, bringing pollution and danger to dense neighborhoods. Advocates want the city to use its power to protect residents and vulnerable road users from the harms of urban highways.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
