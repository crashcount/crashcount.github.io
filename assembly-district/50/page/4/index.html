Twenty-six left with serious injuries. Over two thousand hurt.</strong> These are not just numbers—they are lives ended or broken on the streets of Greenpoint, Williamsburg, and South Williamsburg since 2022. The dead include a ten-year-old girl, crushed by an SUV while crossing with the signal at Franklin Avenue and Wallabout Street. The driver failed to yield. She never made it home. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>The violence does not stop. In March, a man was killed by an e-bike rider who ran a stop. In June, the city moved to strip protection from the Bedford Avenue bike lane after a series of crashes. The city called it a safety fix. The result: <strong>cyclists forced back into the path of cars and trucks.</strong></p><h3 id=whose-safety-counts>Whose Safety Counts?</h3><p>The fight over Bedford Avenue exposed the fault lines. One resident pleaded, <em>&ldquo;I beg the court, please for my safety and the safety of my children and all the 2,000 children living close to the dangerous new bike lane, please allow the mayor to shift the bike lane&rsquo;s location on the roadway.&rdquo;</em> <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/nyc-cleared-to-move-bedford-ave-bike-lane-in-brooklyn-seen-as-hazard-to-pedestrians/>NY Daily News</a></p><p>But others warned, removing the protected lane would bring &ldquo;irreparable harm&rdquo; to the neighborhood. The city’s own plan now puts cyclists back in the open, with nothing but paint between them and speeding steel. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/nyc-cleared-to-move-bedford-ave-bike-lane-in-brooklyn-seen-as-hazard-to-pedestrians/>NY Daily News</a></p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Assembly Member Emily Gallagher has not been silent.

She stood with families after the Gravesend crash, demanding Albany pass the Stop Super Speeders Act. But the bill sits in committee. The carnage continues.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay means another body on the street.</strong> Call Assembly Member Gallagher. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit.

The bill, introduced in the New York State Legislature, would require drivers with at least six speeding tickets in a single year, or 11 points in 18 months, to install speed limiter devices in their vehicles. The matter summary states: "We are going to literally force you to slow down by requiring you to install a speed limiter on your car." Gounardes led the announcement at the Atlantic Avenue intersection where a driver killed Katherine Harris. Gallagher, co-sponsor, said, "Cars and trucks can act as weapons when used recklessly." The bill aims to bypass bureaucratic hurdles and act automatically, modeled after ignition interlock devices for drunk drivers. Advocates and city officials joined the call, citing data that speed limiters can reduce traffic deaths by 37 percent. The bill targets the most dangerous drivers, seeking to end impunity for repeat offenders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure would force these drivers to install devices that cap speed at five miles per hour above the limit. Gounardes said, 'There is a persistent cohort of drivers... driving on our streets recklessly without any consequences.' The bill was unveiled at the site of a fatal pedestrian crash in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program, which mandates safety courses for repeat offenders, has faced criticism for weak enforcement.

Council Member Lincoln Restler (District 33) and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher backed the safety-focused plan.

The official matter summary states: 'Mayor Eric Adams appears to have ordered the city's Department of Transportation (DOT) to reverse course on a planned redesign of McGuinness Boulevard after powerful locals and influential members of the administration voiced their opposition.'

The event followed the removal of traffic calming measures, which had once protected pedestrians and cyclists. Chris Roberti, chair of the Safe Streets Committee at Public School 110, called for a 'comprehensive, safe street redesign.' Council Member Lincoln Restler promised to 'push like all hell' for changes at Monitor and Driggs by September. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher blamed state legislators for blocking Sammy's Law, which would let New York City lower speed limits. The rally featured a ghost bike and calls for urgent safety improvements. Locals plan further meetings to press for redesign and protection for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, which would grant New York City local control over its speed limits, remains stalled in the Assembly. The rally, led by Families for Safe Streets, called out lawmakers for refusing to bring the measure to a vote. Fabiola Mendieta-Cuapio, a leading advocate, criticized the lack of transparency: 'We are demanding that the Speaker bring this to a vote.' Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz voiced strong support, but others, like Chantel Jackson, hesitated, citing constituent feedback. The bill’s matter summary states it would not mandate lower limits but allow the city to decide. The legislative process left families of crash victims frustrated and angry. The Assembly’s inaction keeps city streets dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Assembly Member Emily Gallagher said, "The community has tried for a bike lane on this exact street & a play street in front of the school, and all were KILLED by backlash. Blood is on our hands. Shame on us." Advocates like Noel Hidalgo and Bronwyn Breitner called out city delays and DOT inaction. The Department of Transportation made minor changes but failed to stand up to opposition.

DMV Deputy Commissioner Lisa Koumjian stated, "The DMV has an established process for replacing plates and that is the process individuals should follow if their plate is in poor condition." If someone reports a plate that does not belong to them, the DMV can pursue replacement with the registrant if enough information is provided. Koumjian added, "If the plate is covered or intentionally defaced, law enforcement should be notified of this criminal activity as they have the jurisdiction to cite the registrant." Assembly Member Emily Gallagher was involved after constituents raised concerns. Critics, including Marius Facktor, blasted the DMV’s approach: "Car drivers are scratching and covering up their plates to avoid accountability when they hit and kill pedestrians. That's why this is so urgent." The DMV’s response drew fire for failing to hold dangerous drivers accountable and leaving vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint.
