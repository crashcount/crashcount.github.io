Twelve left with injuries that change a life.</strong> In the last year, Assembly District 50 saw 1,120 crashes. The bodies are not numbers. A ten-year-old girl, crossing with the signal, was crushed by an SUV. A cyclist, helmet on, was thrown from his bike and did not get up. A man on foot, struck by an e-bike, bled out on India Street. The street remembers. The families do too.</p><h3 id=broken-promises-broken-streets>Broken Promises, Broken Streets</h3><p><strong>No one is safe. Not the child in the crosswalk. Not the old man on a bike.</strong> The city changed the Bedford Avenue bike lane to protect cyclists. Crashes rose. Now the city is putting it back the way it was. The mayor calls it safety. The result is more blood on the street. As one parent <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/11/brooklyn-parents-push-for-paris-style-school-street>described the danger</a>, “There was these like sequences of death—two of children on the way to and from school. There is just this sense of impending doom, it’s an obvious danger and if nothing is being done, another terrible thing will happen.”</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-deeds>Leadership: Words and Deeds</h3><p>Assembly Member Emily Gallagher has not stood silent. She has pushed for speed-limiting tech for repeat offenders, <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">sponsoring a bill</a> to force the worst drivers to slow down. She <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/06/15/greenpoint-lawmaker-opposition-to-mcguinness-redesign-is-about-fear-bad-faith-and-control>backed the McGuinness Boulevard redesign</a>, calling out the “fear, bad faith and control” behind opposition. But the deaths keep coming. The city drags its feet. The law sits in committee. The street keeps taking.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Gallagher. Call the mayor. Demand the city use its new power to lower speed limits. Demand the Assembly pass the speed limiter bill. Demand streets where a child can walk to school and come home alive.</p><p><strong>The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, sponsored by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, targets drivers with six or more automated speed or red light tickets, or eleven license points in 18 months. The measure would force these drivers to install devices that cap speed at five miles per hour above the limit. Gounardes said, 'There is a persistent cohort of drivers... driving on our streets recklessly without any consequences.' The bill was unveiled at the site of a fatal pedestrian crash in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program, which mandates safety courses for repeat offenders, has faced criticism for weak enforcement. This new bill seeks to close those gaps and directly slow down the most dangerous drivers on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Rodriguez said, "[My] personal commitment as the commissioner of DOT [is] to do the best it can to continue doing my job to improve safety on McGuinness Boulevard." Mayor Adams reversed the plan after business opposition, despite support from every other elected official. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher blamed a small group for swaying the mayor, noting, "Other redesigned streets... all get safer and they work better." The timeline is now unclear.

They propose a credit system to balance costs between DOT bridges and MTA tunnels, aiming to protect neighborhoods like the Brooklyn waterfront and the BQE corridor from traffic surges. The MTA declined comment. The Board will soon set final toll rates and rules. The federal government has approved the congestion pricing plan, with tolls for cars expected between $9 and $23.

The plan, presented to Community Board 1's Transportation Committee, will remove a car lane in each direction and install protected bike lanes along a 1.1-mile stretch from Meeker Avenue to the Pulaski Bridge. The official summary states the overhaul will 'reconfigure the 1.1-mile stretch... following advocacy for safety upgrades after multiple deaths.' Council Member Lincoln Restler and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher praised the plan, calling it 'transformative' and pledging support. DOT statistics show similar road diets reduce deaths and serious injuries by 30 percent. The redesign includes shorter crosswalks, pedestrian islands, and new loading zones. This action responds to a history of crashes and the 2021 hit-and-run killing of teacher Matthew Jensen.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report lists 'Other Vehicular' as a contributing factor. The e-bike rider was unlicensed and partially ejected from his seat, suffering fatal head and crush injuries. The trailer was parked at the time of the crash and had no occupants.

Gounardes confirmed, 'all support a two-lane highway.' Gallagher wrote, '2 lanes if any.' Restler called City Hall’s statements 'plainly inaccurate.' The Department of Transportation delayed environmental review to study both options. Advocates and officials urge investment in mass transit, not highway expansion.

The article, titled 'Mayor Adams Has Leverage to Force a Reluctant State DOT to Budge on the BQE,' details how city DOT can veto regional transportation plans and must approve state highway projects within city limits. Jon Orcutt, former city DOT official, urges Adams to push for a full corridor plan and not settle for piecemeal fixes. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher and Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso are named as officials demanding state DOT return to the process.

DMV Deputy Commissioner Lisa Koumjian stated, "The DMV has an established process for replacing plates and that is the process individuals should follow if their plate is in poor condition." If someone reports a plate that does not belong to them, the DMV can pursue replacement with the registrant if enough information is provided. Koumjian added, "If the plate is covered or intentionally defaced, law enforcement should be notified of this criminal activity as they have the jurisdiction to cite the registrant." Assembly Member Emily Gallagher was involved after constituents raised concerns. Critics, including Marius Facktor, blasted the DMV’s approach: "Car drivers are scratching and covering up their plates to avoid accountability when they hit and kill pedestrians. That's why this is so urgent." The DMV’s response drew fire for failing to hold dangerous drivers accountable and leaving vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens. Jabari Brisport, Julia Salazar, Kristen Gonzalez, Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Members Bobby Carroll, Maritza Davila, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Emily Gallagher, Jo Anne Simon, Marcela Mitaynes, and Council Members Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Lincoln Restler. Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint. Without state action, only city-owned segments see attention. The city’s efforts are limited.

Schroeder encouraged the public to send him photos of unreadable plates, saying, "Send them to me. Tell them, 'Send them to Schroeder.'" Gallagher noted the widespread issue in her district and pressed for innovations to prevent plate tampering. Schroeder claimed the DMV would send new plates free to owners, but the agency's public process only allows car owners—not third parties—to request replacements.
