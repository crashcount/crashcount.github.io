Drivers failing to yield. Drivers not paying attention. In 2024, a pickup driver turned left and killed a 49-year-old woman at Franklin and Wallabout; police logged failure to yield and distraction by the driver (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data, Crash 4717867</a>).

Comptroller Lander and Assemblymember Gallagher push back. They call for greenways, bike paths, and transit. Highway expansion repeats old mistakes. Vulnerable road users lose out. Safety and climate take a back seat.</p><p class=mb3>On August 4, 2023, Assemblymember Emily Gallagher (District 50) joined Comptroller Brad Lander in criticizing New York State’s use of federal infrastructure funds. The state plans to spend hundreds of millions widening city highways, including $730 million for the Van Wyck Expressway. Lander called this a repeat of past errors, saying, 'Even maintaining a state of good repair on existing roadway infrastructure would be a better use of money than widening the highway.' Gallagher warned, 'New York state risks squandering the historic investments of the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act by directing far too much funding toward highway expansion instead of climate resilient, multimodal projects.' Both urge a shift to projects that cut emissions and improve safety for all, especially those outside cars. The state DOT defends its plan, but advocates say vulnerable road users are left exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, introduced in the New York State Legislature, would require drivers with at least six speeding tickets in a single year, or 11 points in 18 months, to install speed limiter devices in their vehicles. The matter summary states: "We are going to literally force you to slow down by requiring you to install a speed limiter on your car." Gounardes led the announcement at the Atlantic Avenue intersection where a driver killed Katherine Harris. Gallagher, co-sponsor, said, "Cars and trucks can act as weapons when used recklessly." The bill aims to bypass bureaucratic hurdles and act automatically, modeled after ignition interlock devices for drunk drivers. Advocates and city officials joined the call, citing data that speed limiters can reduce traffic deaths by 37 percent. The bill targets the most dangerous drivers, seeking to end impunity for repeat offenders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, targets drivers with six or more automated speed or red light tickets, or eleven license points in 18 months. The measure would force these drivers to install devices that cap speed at five miles per hour above the limit. Gounardes said, 'There is a persistent cohort of drivers... driving on our streets recklessly without any consequences.' The bill was unveiled at the site of a fatal pedestrian crash in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program, which mandates safety courses for repeat offenders, has faced criticism for weak enforcement.

The MTA declined comment. The Board will soon set final toll rates and rules. The federal government has approved the congestion pricing plan, with tolls for cars expected between $9 and $23.

The Assembly stayed silent.</p><p class=mb3>""It's frustrating. So much of the state legislative infrastructure is dedicated to normalizing and absolving drivers of harmful acts committed while driving."" -- Emily Gallagher</p><p class=mb3>On June 5, 2023, supporters of Sammy’s Law gathered outside Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie’s Bronx office. The bill, which would grant New York City local control over its speed limits, remains stalled in the Assembly. The rally, led by Families for Safe Streets, called out lawmakers for refusing to bring the measure to a vote. Fabiola Mendieta-Cuapio, a leading advocate, criticized the lack of transparency: 'We are demanding that the Speaker bring this to a vote.' Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz voiced strong support, but others, like Chantel Jackson, hesitated, citing constituent feedback. The bill’s matter summary states it would not mandate lower limits but allow the city to decide. The legislative process left families of crash victims frustrated and angry. The Assembly’s inaction keeps city streets dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The intersection, once part of an Open Street program, lost its protections after local backlash. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher said, "The community has tried for a bike lane on this exact street & a play street in front of the school, and all were KILLED by backlash. Blood is on our hands. Shame on us." Advocates like Noel Hidalgo and Bronwyn Breitner called out city delays and DOT inaction. The Department of Transportation made minor changes but failed to stand up to opposition. Proposals for bike lanes stalled. The dismantling of safety measures left vulnerable road users exposed. The death highlights the deadly cost of caving to anti-safety voices and the urgent need for real protection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, presented to Community Board 1's Transportation Committee, will remove a car lane in each direction and install protected bike lanes along a 1.1-mile stretch from Meeker Avenue to the Pulaski Bridge. The official summary states the overhaul will 'reconfigure the 1.1-mile stretch... following advocacy for safety upgrades after multiple deaths.' Council Member Lincoln Restler and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher praised the plan, calling it 'transformative' and pledging support. DOT statistics show similar road diets reduce deaths and serious injuries by 30 percent. The redesign includes shorter crosswalks, pedestrian islands, and new loading zones. This action responds to a history of crashes and the 2021 hit-and-run killing of teacher Matthew Jensen.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi claimed some locals want three lanes each way, but 17 elected officials, including State Sen. Julia Salazar, Sen. Andrew Gounardes, Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, and Council Member Lincoln Restler, publicly rejected the idea. Salazar said, 'no to three lanes. Two lanes at most.' Gounardes confirmed, 'all support a two-lane highway.' Gallagher wrote, '2 lanes if any.' Restler called City Hall’s statements 'plainly inaccurate.' The Department of Transportation delayed environmental review to study both options. Advocates and officials urge investment in mass transit, not highway expansion.
