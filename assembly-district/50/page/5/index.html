Mayor Bill de Blasio pledged $40 million for a redesign after a fatal hit-and-run in 2021, stating, 'We are putting money in the budget immediately to redesign and fix McGuinness Boulevard. It’s time.' Council Member Emily Gallagher voiced frustration: 'Extremely distressing to see another serious crash injuring a pedestrian... improvements can’t come soon enough.' Steve Levin and Danny Harris echoed calls for urgent redesign and speed control. Despite a lowered speed limit and repeated studies, the city has failed to act. Residents and advocates reject further delays, insisting the evidence is clear: McGuinness remains deadly until real changes are made.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
