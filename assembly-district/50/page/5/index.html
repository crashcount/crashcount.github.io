Twenty-six left with serious injuries. Over two thousand hurt.</strong> These are not just numbers—they are lives ended or broken on the streets of Greenpoint, Williamsburg, and South Williamsburg since 2022. The dead include a ten-year-old girl, crushed by an SUV while crossing with the signal at Franklin Avenue and Wallabout Street. The driver failed to yield. She never made it home. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>The violence does not stop. In March, a man was killed by an e-bike rider who ran a stop. In June, the city moved to strip protection from the Bedford Avenue bike lane after a series of crashes. The city called it a safety fix. The result: <strong>cyclists forced back into the path of cars and trucks.</strong></p><h3 id=whose-safety-counts>Whose Safety Counts?</h3><p>The fight over Bedford Avenue exposed the fault lines. One resident pleaded, <em>&ldquo;I beg the court, please for my safety and the safety of my children and all the 2,000 children living close to the dangerous new bike lane, please allow the mayor to shift the bike lane&rsquo;s location on the roadway.&rdquo;</em> <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/nyc-cleared-to-move-bedford-ave-bike-lane-in-brooklyn-seen-as-hazard-to-pedestrians/>NY Daily News</a></p><p>But others warned, removing the protected lane would bring &ldquo;irreparable harm&rdquo; to the neighborhood. The city’s own plan now puts cyclists back in the open, with nothing but paint between them and speeding steel. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/nyc-cleared-to-move-bedford-ave-bike-lane-in-brooklyn-seen-as-hazard-to-pedestrians/>NY Daily News</a></p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Assembly Member Emily Gallagher has not been silent.

She stood with families after the Gravesend crash, demanding Albany pass the Stop Super Speeders Act. But the bill sits in committee. The carnage continues.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay means another body on the street.</strong> Call Assembly Member Gallagher. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit.

Schroeder encouraged the public to send him photos of unreadable plates, saying, "Send them to me. Tell them, 'Send them to Schroeder.'" Gallagher noted the widespread issue in her district and pressed for innovations to prevent plate tampering. Schroeder claimed the DMV would send new plates free to owners, but the agency's public process only allows car owners—not third parties—to request replacements. The DMV spokesman reiterated this policy, sidestepping the issue of public reporting. The loophole leaves enforcement weak and vulnerable road users at risk from untraceable drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Gov. Hochul said, 'It is common sense to make pedestrian and bike safety education mandatory for drivers.' Gounardes noted that driver instruction had not kept pace with the growing presence of cyclists and micro-mobility users. In 2021, driver inexperience contributed to over 2,500 injury crashes in NYC.

Gallagher argues, "$200 million is the amount of money it would take to make it safe and functional." The push follows the Empire State Trail program, which sent most of its funds to rural areas. Advocates like Terri Carta and Jon Orcutt stress the need for a comprehensive, citywide network and dedicated funding. The city DOT and Parks Department did not comment. The bill aims to address high costs, slow progress, and safety gaps for vulnerable road users in underserved neighborhoods.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Funding lags.</p><p class=mb3>On February 24, 2022, a coalition of 39 New York senators and Assembly members, led by Senator Alessandra Biaggi and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, called on Albany leaders to create a $200-million fund for city greenways. The letter urges the Assembly Speaker and Senate Majority Leader to match the Empire State Trail’s rural funding. The lawmakers write, 'Greenways improve safety for the thousands of New Yorkers who rely on cycling in their work or as part of their daily commute, including delivery workers.' Gallagher says, 'This $200 million is the amount of money it would take to make it safe and functional.' The group stresses that underserved neighborhoods need these routes most. Advocates cite decades of slow progress since the 1993 master plan. They demand city, state, and federal resources to build and maintain a safe, connected greenway network.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Gallagher credited the Highway District Collision Investigation Squad and the 94th Precinct for their persistence. The Make McGuinness Safe Coalition called the street 'a highway cutting our community in two,' blaming systemic failure for repeated deaths. After Jensen's killing, then-mayor Bill de Blasio pledged $39 million for a full redesign of the boulevard. Interim safety measures, like shorter light cycles and a new crosswalk, have been installed, but the city has not released final plans.

On February 22, 2022, police arrested Tariq Witherspoon, charging him with criminally negligent homicide, reckless driving, and leaving the scene. The matter sparked renewed urgency for street safety. As the article states, 'Parents and teachers at the school had a huge rally... to demand that the city finally redesign McGuinness Boulevard for safety—a request that dates back more than a decade.' Council Member Steve Levin and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher have both called for action. Gallagher said, 'We must reform the way we use the roads and how we design them so that when drivers make mistakes... they don't kill people.' Despite a $40-million redesign promise from then-Mayor de Blasio, the project remains in planning. The community continues to demand real change to protect pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident follows years of crashes—1,290 in eight years, injuring dozens of cyclists and pedestrians. Mayor Bill de Blasio pledged $40 million for a redesign after a fatal hit-and-run in 2021, stating, 'We are putting money in the budget immediately to redesign and fix McGuinness Boulevard. It’s time.' Council Member Emily Gallagher voiced frustration: 'Extremely distressing to see another serious crash injuring a pedestrian... improvements can’t come soon enough.' Steve Levin and Danny Harris echoed calls for urgent redesign and speed control. Despite a lowered speed limit and repeated studies, the city has failed to act. Residents and advocates reject further delays, insisting the evidence is clear: McGuinness remains deadly until real changes are made.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
