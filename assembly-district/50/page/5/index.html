A Freightliner truck driver hit him. He died there on the street (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/locals-urge-action-morgan-avenue-crash/>Brooklyn Paper</a>, Aug 11, 2025).</p><p>He is one of <strong>12 people killed</strong> in Assembly District 50 since 2022, with <strong>2,339 injured</strong> in that span (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Among the dead here: <strong>five pedestrians</strong> and <strong>two people on bikes</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>). Year to date, crashes in this district are up <strong>18.1%</strong> over last year, injuries up <strong>28.4%</strong>, and serious injuries up <strong>50.0%</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The hour around <strong>7 PM</strong> has been the deadliest here, with three people killed in that single hour over the study period (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=where-the-street-breaks>Where the street breaks</h3><p>Franklin Street shows two deaths and nine injuries. Greenpoint Avenue shows one death and 34 injuries. Neighbors know these corners by feel, not maps (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Police records point to the same bad moves. Drivers failing to yield. Drivers not paying attention. In 2024, a pickup driver turned left and killed a 49-year-old woman at Franklin and Wallabout; police logged failure to yield and distraction by the driver (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data, Crash 4717867</a>). In 2023, a dump truck driver turned left and killed a woman crossing with the signal at Richardson and Kingsland (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data, Crash 4656161</a>).</p><h3 id=promises-peeled-back-paint>Promises, peeled back paint</h3><p>On McGuinness Boulevard, the city trimmed safety plans, then a driver hit a cyclist on an unprotected stretch. “The road diet works where it&rsquo;s been installed and it&rsquo;s needed for the entire corridor before this happens again,” said Kevin LaCherra (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/20/cyclist-badly-hurt-on-segment-of-mcguinness-blvd-that-mayor-adams-refused-to-make-safe>Streetsblog NYC</a>, Jul 20, 2025).</p><p>On Morgan Avenue, after the latest death, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher said, “Far too many preventable crashes have taken place… We must do more… to increase protected bike lanes and visible crossings” (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/locals-urge-action-morgan-avenue-crash/>Brooklyn Paper</a>, Aug 11, 2025). Advocates, joined by Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez and State Sen. Julia Salazar, want a protected bike lane, mid‑block crossings, and safer loading zones on Morgan (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/07/three-years-three-deaths-advocates-want-dot-to-make-morgan-avenue-safe>Streetsblog NYC</a>, Aug 7, 2025).</p><h3 id=the-deadliest-habits-have-names>The deadliest habits have names</h3><p>District data flags driver inattention and failure to yield as repeat causes. Night hours are brutal. Heavy vehicles show up in too many fatal turns. The fixes are not exotic: daylight the corners; give walkers head starts; harden left turns; add protected bike lanes on Morgan and McGuinness; route and calm trucks through the industrial grid (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=albanys-tools-and-who-picked-them-up>Albany’s tools, and who picked them up</h3><p>Assembly Member <strong>Emily Gallagher</strong> sponsored a bill to force repeat offenders to install intelligent speed assistance devices (<strong>A 2299</strong>) (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">Open States</a>). She also led an earlier version (<strong>A 7979</strong>) in 2023 (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">Open States</a>). And she voted yes on <strong>S 8344</strong> to extend school speed-zone protections (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Open States</a>, Jun 17, 2025). The bill to require speed limiters for chronic speeders advanced in the Senate this spring; supporters say it targets the worst repeat offenders (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/stop-super-speeders-bill-advances-in-senate-committee>Streetsblog NYC</a>, May 21, 2025).</p><p>Council Member <strong>Lincoln Restler</strong> represents this area (<a href=/council-district/33/>District 33</a>). State Sen. <strong>Julia Salazar</strong> represents it in Albany (<a href=/senate-district/18/>SD 18</a>). They have stood with advocates on Morgan Avenue (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/07/three-years-three-deaths-advocates-want-dot-to-make-morgan-avenue-safe>Streetsblog NYC</a>). What remains is action on the street.</p><h3 id=what-must-happen-now>What must happen now</h3><p>This district is small. The harm is not. Since 2022, twelve people are gone. The hour around 7 PM keeps taking lives. The same turns keep killing. Slow the cars. Protect the bike lanes. Fix the corners. And pass the speed‑limiter bill.</p><p>Take one step today.

The article, titled 'Mayor Adams Has Leverage to Force a Reluctant State DOT to Budge on the BQE,' details how city DOT can veto regional transportation plans and must approve state highway projects within city limits. Jon Orcutt, former city DOT official, urges Adams to push for a full corridor plan and not settle for piecemeal fixes. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher and Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso are named as officials demanding state DOT return to the process. The BQE has long divided North Brooklyn, bringing pollution and danger to dense neighborhoods.

Law enforcement, not the DMV, should ticket offenders. Critics say sending new plates lets reckless drivers dodge accountability. The city’s most vulnerable remain at risk.</p><p class=mb3>On February 13, 2023, after a Streetsblog investigation, the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles clarified its process for reporting defaced license plates. DMV Deputy Commissioner Lisa Koumjian stated, "The DMV has an established process for replacing plates and that is the process individuals should follow if their plate is in poor condition." If someone reports a plate that does not belong to them, the DMV can pursue replacement with the registrant if enough information is provided. Koumjian added, "If the plate is covered or intentionally defaced, law enforcement should be notified of this criminal activity as they have the jurisdiction to cite the registrant." Assembly Member Emily Gallagher was involved after constituents raised concerns. Critics, including Marius Facktor, blasted the DMV’s approach: "Car drivers are scratching and covering up their plates to avoid accountability when they hit and kill pedestrians. That's why this is so urgent." The DMV’s response drew fire for failing to hold dangerous drivers accountable and leaving vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They reject piecemeal fixes. They call out decades of harm. The state’s refusal leaves neighborhoods exposed. The city’s hands are tied. The highway’s danger remains. Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On February 10, 2023, eighteen Brooklyn lawmakers issued a joint letter demanding New York State Department of Transportation (DOT) participate in comprehensive planning for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens. Jabari Brisport, Julia Salazar, Kristen Gonzalez, Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Members Bobby Carroll, Maritza Davila, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Emily Gallagher, Jo Anne Simon, Marcela Mitaynes, and Council Members Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Lincoln Restler. Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint. Without state action, only city-owned segments see attention. The city’s efforts are limited. The state’s inaction leaves systemic danger unaddressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Schroeder encouraged the public to send him photos of unreadable plates, saying, "Send them to me. Tell them, 'Send them to Schroeder.'" Gallagher noted the widespread issue in her district and pressed for innovations to prevent plate tampering. Schroeder claimed the DMV would send new plates free to owners, but the agency's public process only allows car owners—not third parties—to request replacements. The DMV spokesman reiterated this policy, sidestepping the issue of public reporting. The loophole leaves enforcement weak and vulnerable road users at risk from untraceable drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, representing District 50, responded to the arrest, stating, 'Victims of vehicular homicide rarely see an arrest made in their case.' Gallagher credited the Highway District Collision Investigation Squad and the 94th Precinct for their persistence. The Make McGuinness Safe Coalition called the street 'a highway cutting our community in two,' blaming systemic failure for repeated deaths. After Jensen's killing, then-mayor Bill de Blasio pledged $39 million for a full redesign of the boulevard. Interim safety measures, like shorter light cycles and a new crosswalk, have been installed, but the city has not released final plans. The Coalition urges leaders to act so 'Matt Jensen's is the last death on McGuinness.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

On February 22, 2022, police arrested Tariq Witherspoon, charging him with criminally negligent homicide, reckless driving, and leaving the scene. The matter sparked renewed urgency for street safety. As the article states, 'Parents and teachers at the school had a huge rally... to demand that the city finally redesign McGuinness Boulevard for safety—a request that dates back more than a decade.' Council Member Steve Levin and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher have both called for action. Gallagher said, 'We must reform the way we use the roads and how we design them so that when drivers make mistakes... they don't kill people.' Despite a $40-million redesign promise from then-Mayor de Blasio, the project remains in planning. The community continues to demand real change to protect pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
