The plan, presented to Community Board 1's Transportation Committee, will remove a car lane in each direction and install protected bike lanes along a 1.1-mile stretch from Meeker Avenue to the Pulaski Bridge. The official summary states the overhaul will 'reconfigure the 1.1-mile stretch... following advocacy for safety upgrades after multiple deaths.' Council Member Lincoln Restler and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher praised the plan, calling it 'transformative' and pledging support. DOT statistics show similar road diets reduce deaths and serious injuries by 30 percent. The redesign includes shorter crosswalks, pedestrian islands, and new loading zones. This action responds to a history of crashes and the 2021 hit-and-run killing of teacher Matthew Jensen.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article, titled 'Mayor Adams Has Leverage to Force a Reluctant State DOT to Budge on the BQE,' details how city DOT can veto regional transportation plans and must approve state highway projects within city limits. Jon Orcutt, former city DOT official, urges Adams to push for a full corridor plan and not settle for piecemeal fixes. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher and Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso are named as officials demanding state DOT return to the process. The BQE has long divided North Brooklyn, bringing pollution and danger to dense neighborhoods. Advocates want the city to use its power to protect residents and vulnerable road users from the harms of urban highways.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DMV Deputy Commissioner Lisa Koumjian stated, "The DMV has an established process for replacing plates and that is the process individuals should follow if their plate is in poor condition." If someone reports a plate that does not belong to them, the DMV can pursue replacement with the registrant if enough information is provided. Koumjian added, "If the plate is covered or intentionally defaced, law enforcement should be notified of this criminal activity as they have the jurisdiction to cite the registrant." Assembly Member Emily Gallagher was involved after constituents raised concerns. Critics, including Marius Facktor, blasted the DMV’s approach: "Car drivers are scratching and covering up their plates to avoid accountability when they hit and kill pedestrians. That's why this is so urgent." The DMV’s response drew fire for failing to hold dangerous drivers accountable and leaving vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On February 10, 2023, eighteen Brooklyn lawmakers issued a joint letter demanding New York State Department of Transportation (DOT) participate in comprehensive planning for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens. Jabari Brisport, Julia Salazar, Kristen Gonzalez, Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Members Bobby Carroll, Maritza Davila, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Emily Gallagher, Jo Anne Simon, Marcela Mitaynes, and Council Members Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Lincoln Restler. Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint. Without state action, only city-owned segments see attention. The city’s efforts are limited.

The street remains a danger zone.</p><p class=mb3>On June 28, 2022, Assemblymember Emily Gallagher and over 2,500 residents backed a petition urging a full redesign of McGuinness Boulevard. The Department of Transportation will present its draft plan to Brooklyn Community Board 1’s Transportation Committee on June 30. The petition, described as a call for 'wider sidewalks and a wider median, a protected bike lane, and eliminating one lane of traffic in each direction,' follows the hit-and-run death of teacher Matthew Jensen. Gallagher stated, 'Our community is speaking loud and clear: no more deaths on McGuinness.' The campaign has support from Councilmember Lincoln Restler and Borough President Antonio Reynoso. The street, a busy four-lane truck route, has seen dozens of crashes and injuries in recent years. Organizers and residents demand urgent action to end the deadly toll on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
