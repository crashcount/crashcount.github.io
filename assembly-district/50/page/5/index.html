Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi claimed some locals want three lanes each way, but 17 elected officials, including State Sen. Julia Salazar, Sen.

Gounardes confirmed, 'all support a two-lane highway.' Gallagher wrote, '2 lanes if any.' Restler called City Hall’s statements 'plainly inaccurate.' The Department of Transportation delayed environmental review to study both options. Advocates and officials urge investment in mass transit, not highway expansion.

Jon Orcutt, former city DOT official, urges Adams to push for a full corridor plan and not settle for piecemeal fixes. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher and Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso are named as officials demanding state DOT return to the process.

DMV Deputy Commissioner Lisa Koumjian stated, "The DMV has an established process for replacing plates and that is the process individuals should follow if their plate is in poor condition." If someone reports a plate that does not belong to them, the DMV can pursue replacement with the registrant if enough information is provided. Koumjian added, "If the plate is covered or intentionally defaced, law enforcement should be notified of this criminal activity as they have the jurisdiction to cite the registrant." Assembly Member Emily Gallagher was involved after constituents raised concerns. Critics, including Marius Facktor, blasted the DMV’s approach: "Car drivers are scratching and covering up their plates to avoid accountability when they hit and kill pedestrians. That's why this is so urgent." The DMV’s response drew fire for failing to hold dangerous drivers accountable and leaving vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens. Jabari Brisport, Julia Salazar, Kristen Gonzalez, Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Members Bobby Carroll, Maritza Davila, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Emily Gallagher, Jo Anne Simon, Marcela Mitaynes, and Council Members Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Lincoln Restler. Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint. Without state action, only city-owned segments see attention. The city’s efforts are limited.

Schroeder encouraged the public to send him photos of unreadable plates, saying, "Send them to me. Tell them, 'Send them to Schroeder.'" Gallagher noted the widespread issue in her district and pressed for innovations to prevent plate tampering. Schroeder claimed the DMV would send new plates free to owners, but the agency's public process only allows car owners—not third parties—to request replacements. The DMV spokesman reiterated this policy, sidestepping the issue of public reporting.

Mamdani said, 'If we implement six-minute service, the consequences would be felt for riders across all aspects of their life.' Septimo called transit an economic and racial justice issue. Gounardes urged the governor to include MTA funding in the initial budget. Gallagher criticized the gas tax holiday, urging funds go to transit. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber warned that cuts or fare hikes would devastate working- and middle-class New Yorkers.

Gallagher said, 'Quick, iterative incremental changes will be a great way to reduce injuries and fatalities rather than waiting for an entire overhaul.' Council Member Lincoln Restler praised the upgrades as 'a step in the right direction.' Bronwyn Breitner of Make McGuinness Safe Coalition called for a full-scale redesign, reallocating space from cars to people.

Gov. Hochul said, 'It is common sense to make pedestrian and bike safety education mandatory for drivers.' Gounardes noted that driver instruction had not kept pace with the growing presence of cyclists and micro-mobility users. In 2021, driver inexperience contributed to over 2,500 injury crashes in NYC.

Restler stated, 'The way we're going to fully connect Greenpoint community and make this street safer is by having less lanes of traffic.'
