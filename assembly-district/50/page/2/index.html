Twelve left with injuries that change a life.</strong> In the last year, Assembly District 50 saw 1,120 crashes. The bodies are not numbers. A ten-year-old girl, crossing with the signal, was crushed by an SUV. A cyclist, helmet on, was thrown from his bike and did not get up. A man on foot, struck by an e-bike, bled out on India Street. The street remembers. The families do too.</p><h3 id=broken-promises-broken-streets>Broken Promises, Broken Streets</h3><p><strong>No one is safe. Not the child in the crosswalk. Not the old man on a bike.</strong> The city changed the Bedford Avenue bike lane to protect cyclists. Crashes rose. Now the city is putting it back the way it was. The mayor calls it safety. The result is more blood on the street. As one parent <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/11/brooklyn-parents-push-for-paris-style-school-street>described the danger</a>, “There was these like sequences of death—two of children on the way to and from school.

She has pushed for speed-limiting tech for repeat offenders, <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">sponsoring a bill</a> to force the worst drivers to slow down. She <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/06/15/greenpoint-lawmaker-opposition-to-mcguinness-redesign-is-about-fear-bad-faith-and-control>backed the McGuinness Boulevard redesign</a>, calling out the “fear, bad faith and control” behind opposition. But the deaths keep coming. The city drags its feet. The law sits in committee. The street keeps taking.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Gallagher. Call the mayor. Demand the city use its new power to lower speed limits. Demand the Assembly pass the speed limiter bill. Demand streets where a child can walk to school and come home alive.</p><p><strong>The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

According to the police report, 'Traffic Control Disregarded' was listed as the primary contributing factor. The narrative states, 'The signal was ignored,' underscoring the failure to obey traffic controls. The impact left the driver with severe lacerations to his arm, as he remained restrained by his lap belt. The parked Dodge was unoccupied at the time of the crash. No evidence in the police report attributes any contributing factors to the parked vehicle or its occupants.

The op-ed, titled 'Two Assembly Pols: Congestion Pricing is Good Policy — Democrats Should Embrace It,' argues the governor’s action is 'effectively a cancellation.' Gallagher and Carroll stress that congestion pricing is essential for funding the MTA and improving public transit. They write, 'Congestion pricing does both and there is no fair or viable alternative way to fund the MTA’s capital needs at this juncture.' The statement warns that the delay will shelve critical projects and worsen conditions for all who rely on safe, accessible streets. Gallagher’s stance is clear: the city’s future depends on prioritizing transit and public space over traffic and private cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The fight continues.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Members Robert Carroll and Emily Gallagher issued a public statement on June 7, 2024, supporting congestion pricing and condemning Governor Hochul’s indefinite delay of the program. The statement, published as an op-ed, argues, 'the Governor’s announcement to indefinitely delay implementation is effectively a cancellation of congestion pricing.' Carroll and Gallagher, both long-time supporters, stress that congestion pricing is vital for funding the MTA’s capital needs and for reducing traffic and pollution. They warn that the governor’s move will stall key transit projects and harm New Yorkers who rely on public transportation. The members urge Democrats to embrace the policy, stating, 'It is past time for New York to join such cities as London, Milan, Stockholm, and Singapore and implement congestion pricing without further delay.' The statement does not mince words: the city’s future depends on streets for people, not cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
