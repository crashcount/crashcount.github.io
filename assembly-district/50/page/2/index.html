A Freightliner truck driver hit him. He died there on the street (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/locals-urge-action-morgan-avenue-crash/>Brooklyn Paper</a>, Aug 11, 2025).</p><p>He is one of <strong>12 people killed</strong> in Assembly District 50 since 2022, with <strong>2,339 injured</strong> in that span (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Among the dead here: <strong>five pedestrians</strong> and <strong>two people on bikes</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>). Year to date, crashes in this district are up <strong>18.1%</strong> over last year, injuries up <strong>28.4%</strong>, and serious injuries up <strong>50.0%</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The hour around <strong>7 PM</strong> has been the deadliest here, with three people killed in that single hour over the study period (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=where-the-street-breaks>Where the street breaks</h3><p>Franklin Street shows two deaths and nine injuries. Greenpoint Avenue shows one death and 34 injuries. Neighbors know these corners by feel, not maps (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Police records point to the same bad moves. Drivers failing to yield. Drivers not paying attention. In 2024, a pickup driver turned left and killed a 49-year-old woman at Franklin and Wallabout; police logged failure to yield and distraction by the driver (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data, Crash 4717867</a>). In 2023, a dump truck driver turned left and killed a woman crossing with the signal at Richardson and Kingsland (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data, Crash 4656161</a>).</p><h3 id=promises-peeled-back-paint>Promises, peeled back paint</h3><p>On McGuinness Boulevard, the city trimmed safety plans, then a driver hit a cyclist on an unprotected stretch. “The road diet works where it&rsquo;s been installed and it&rsquo;s needed for the entire corridor before this happens again,” said Kevin LaCherra (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/20/cyclist-badly-hurt-on-segment-of-mcguinness-blvd-that-mayor-adams-refused-to-make-safe>Streetsblog NYC</a>, Jul 20, 2025).</p><p>On Morgan Avenue, after the latest death, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher said, “Far too many preventable crashes have taken place… We must do more… to increase protected bike lanes and visible crossings” (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/locals-urge-action-morgan-avenue-crash/>Brooklyn Paper</a>, Aug 11, 2025). Advocates, joined by Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez and State Sen. Julia Salazar, want a protected bike lane, mid‑block crossings, and safer loading zones on Morgan (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/07/three-years-three-deaths-advocates-want-dot-to-make-morgan-avenue-safe>Streetsblog NYC</a>, Aug 7, 2025).</p><h3 id=the-deadliest-habits-have-names>The deadliest habits have names</h3><p>District data flags driver inattention and failure to yield as repeat causes. Night hours are brutal. Heavy vehicles show up in too many fatal turns. The fixes are not exotic: daylight the corners; give walkers head starts; harden left turns; add protected bike lanes on Morgan and McGuinness; route and calm trucks through the industrial grid (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=albanys-tools-and-who-picked-them-up>Albany’s tools, and who picked them up</h3><p>Assembly Member <strong>Emily Gallagher</strong> sponsored a bill to force repeat offenders to install intelligent speed assistance devices (<strong>A 2299</strong>) (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">Open States</a>). She also led an earlier version (<strong>A 7979</strong>) in 2023 (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">Open States</a>). And she voted yes on <strong>S 8344</strong> to extend school speed-zone protections (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Open States</a>, Jun 17, 2025). The bill to require speed limiters for chronic speeders advanced in the Senate this spring; supporters say it targets the worst repeat offenders (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/stop-super-speeders-bill-advances-in-senate-committee>Streetsblog NYC</a>, May 21, 2025).</p><p>Council Member <strong>Lincoln Restler</strong> represents this area (<a href=/council-district/33/>District 33</a>). State Sen. <strong>Julia Salazar</strong> represents it in Albany (<a href=/senate-district/18/>SD 18</a>). They have stood with advocates on Morgan Avenue (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/07/three-years-three-deaths-advocates-want-dot-to-make-morgan-avenue-safe>Streetsblog NYC</a>). What remains is action on the street.</p><h3 id=what-must-happen-now>What must happen now</h3><p>This district is small. The harm is not. Since 2022, twelve people are gone. The hour around 7 PM keeps taking lives. The same turns keep killing. Slow the cars. Protect the bike lanes. Fix the corners. And pass the speed‑limiter bill.</p><p>Take one step today.

The report states the e-bike driver was 'unlicensed' and identifies 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as a contributing factor. The impact occurred at the center front end of the e-bike, causing severe head injuries and fatal bleeding to the pedestrian. The police report describes the victim as 'crossing, no signal, or crosswalk' and 'not at intersection,' but the primary focus remains on the unlicensed status of the e-bike operator and the disregard for traffic control. The narrative details a quiet night interrupted by the crash, with the victim left motionless on the pavement.

Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On March 6, 2025, Brooklyn Community Board 1 voted 18-15 to request a 20 mph speed limit for Greenpoint and Williamsburg. The measure, supported by 40 groups and nearly all local elected officials, marks the first neighborhood-wide slow zone request since the passage of Sammy's Law. The board's action follows letters from Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez, and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velazquez to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. They cited CB1's high fatality rate—3.27 deaths per 10,000 residents, above the city average. The board's vote was contentious, with pro-driving members opposing the change. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno acknowledged the support and promised more information on slow zones for outer boroughs. Council Member Lincoln Restler later joined the call for lower speeds. The measure now awaits DOT action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No arrests have been made. The NYPD's Collision Investigation Squad is investigating. The article notes this crash followed two other recent fatal collisions in Brooklyn.

The narrative states, 'He swerved for a ghost — a car that never touched him.' The crash left the left front of the vehicle crumpled and resulted in the driver suffering a shattered knee and severe bleeding. The report lists 'Reaction to Uninvolved Vehicle' as the primary contributing factor, highlighting a critical driver error. The man was not wearing a seatbelt at the time of the crash. No other vehicles made contact, and no other injuries were reported. The incident underscores the danger posed by sudden evasive maneuvers and the unpredictable hazards drivers introduce to city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Assembly Member Emily Gallagher called the compromise 'a plan that does nothing to address the central safety concerns of our community.'

Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, a vocal supporter of the lane-reduction plan, defeated challenger Anathea Simpkins, who was backed by anti-redesign group Keep McGuinness Moving. Gallagher secured over 75 percent of the vote, declaring, “North Brooklyn demands Mayor Adams finish the job and make McGuinness safe.” Down-ballot, street safety advocates Luke Ohlson and Jenna Bimbi also won, both endorsed by Make McGuinness Safe. Opponents, including Broadway Stages executives, lost every race. Despite a partial redesign last year, the city has stalled on completing safety improvements. The election results send a clear mandate: voters want action to protect pedestrians and cyclists on McGuinness Boulevard.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
