Thirty-one suffered wounds so grave they may never walk the same. This is not a war zone. This is Assembly District 50—Greenpoint, Williamsburg, South Williamsburg—since 2022. The numbers do not slow. <strong>In the last year alone, five more died.</strong></p><p>Last spring, a ten-year-old girl was crushed crossing Wallabout Street. She had the light. The driver did not yield. She never made it home, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Just months ago, a man was killed by an e-bike rider who blew through a stop sign in Greenpoint. &ldquo;He died basically on the spot,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-by-e-bike-delivery-worker-who-blew-stop-sign-in-greenpoint-witnesses-say>said a witness</a>. The rider stayed. The man did not get up.</p><h2 id=broken-streets-broken-promises>Broken Streets, Broken Promises</h2><p><strong>The danger is not random.</strong> Morgan Avenue has seen four deaths since 2022. Each time, neighbors gather. Each time, they ask for the same things: protected bike lanes, crosswalks, daylight. Each time, the city waits. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher called it out: &ldquo;Far too many preventable crashes have taken place on Morgan Ave in recent years. We must do more to ensure walkers, cyclists, and drivers are able to use Morgan Ave safely,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/locals-urge-action-morgan-avenue-crash/>she said</a>.</p><p>On McGuinness Boulevard, a cyclist was struck where the city left the bike lane unprotected. The road diet works where it&rsquo;s been installed, but the rest of the corridor waits. &ldquo;The fact is that this wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem if Mayor Adams had just done what he had promised to do, which was, make all of McGuinness safe,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/20/cyclist-badly-hurt-on-segment-of-mcguinness-blvd-that-mayor-adams-refused-to-make-safe>said advocate Kevin LaCherra</a>.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h2><p>Assembly Member Gallagher has backed bills to force repeat speeders to slow down. She sponsored measures to require speed-limiting tech for drivers with a record of violations. She voted to extend school speed zones. She has stood with families after each new death, <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/locals-urge-action-morgan-avenue-crash/>demanding more</a> from the city and state. But the carnage continues. <strong>Policy is not pavement. Words are not protection.</strong></p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>No more waiting.</strong> Call Assembly Member Gallagher. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph citywide speed limit. Demand speed limiters for repeat offenders. Demand real protection for every street. The dead cannot call.

The bill, sponsored in Albany by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, would require drivers with repeated violations to install intelligent speed assistance (ISA) devices. These devices cap speed at 5 mph over the limit for those with 11 or more license points in 24 months or six camera tickets in a year. The rally followed a fatal Gravesend crash that killed a mother and her two daughters. Hanif and other lawmakers called current enforcement—ticketing, suspensions, fines, jail—ineffective. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon said, 'The speed limiter technology is available to us. Let’s use it. It will save lives.' The bill is modeled on EU and Virginia laws.

The measure, supported by 40 groups and nearly all local elected officials, marks the first neighborhood-wide slow zone request since the passage of Sammy's Law. The board's action follows letters from Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez, and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velazquez to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. They cited CB1's high fatality rate—3.27 deaths per 10,000 residents, above the city average. The board's vote was contentious, with pro-driving members opposing the change. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno acknowledged the support and promised more information on slow zones for outer boroughs. Council Member Lincoln Restler later joined the call for lower speeds.
