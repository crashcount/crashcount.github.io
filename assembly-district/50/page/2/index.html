Twenty-six left with serious injuries. Over two thousand hurt.</strong> These are not just numbers—they are lives ended or broken on the streets of Greenpoint, Williamsburg, and South Williamsburg since 2022. The dead include a ten-year-old girl, crushed by an SUV while crossing with the signal at Franklin Avenue and Wallabout Street. The driver failed to yield. She never made it home. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>The violence does not stop. In March, a man was killed by an e-bike rider who ran a stop. In June, the city moved to strip protection from the Bedford Avenue bike lane after a series of crashes. The city called it a safety fix. The result: <strong>cyclists forced back into the path of cars and trucks.</strong></p><h3 id=whose-safety-counts>Whose Safety Counts?</h3><p>The fight over Bedford Avenue exposed the fault lines. One resident pleaded, <em>&ldquo;I beg the court, please for my safety and the safety of my children and all the 2,000 children living close to the dangerous new bike lane, please allow the mayor to shift the bike lane&rsquo;s location on the roadway.&rdquo;</em> <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/nyc-cleared-to-move-bedford-ave-bike-lane-in-brooklyn-seen-as-hazard-to-pedestrians/>NY Daily News</a></p><p>But others warned, removing the protected lane would bring &ldquo;irreparable harm&rdquo; to the neighborhood. The city’s own plan now puts cyclists back in the open, with nothing but paint between them and speeding steel. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/nyc-cleared-to-move-bedford-ave-bike-lane-in-brooklyn-seen-as-hazard-to-pedestrians/>NY Daily News</a></p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Assembly Member Emily Gallagher has not been silent.

The narrative states, 'He swerved for a ghost — a car that never touched him.' The crash left the left front of the vehicle crumpled and resulted in the driver suffering a shattered knee and severe bleeding. The report lists 'Reaction to Uninvolved Vehicle' as the primary contributing factor, highlighting a critical driver error. The man was not wearing a seatbelt at the time of the crash.

The report states the sedan 'never moved' and was parked at the time of impact. The primary contributing factor cited is 'Driver Inattention/Distraction.' The e-bike rider was not wearing a helmet, as noted in the police narrative, but this detail follows the explicit mention of driver inattention as the central cause. The crash underscores the lethal consequences of distraction and inattention on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The report states that both the sedan driver and the e-bike operator were 'distracted' at the time of the crash.

The police explicitly cite 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor for both parties. The sedan made contact with its right front bumper.

Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, a vocal supporter of the lane-reduction plan, defeated challenger Anathea Simpkins, who was backed by anti-redesign group Keep McGuinness Moving. Gallagher secured over 75 percent of the vote, declaring, “North Brooklyn demands Mayor Adams finish the job and make McGuinness safe.” Down-ballot, street safety advocates Luke Ohlson and Jenna Bimbi also won, both endorsed by Make McGuinness Safe. Opponents, including Broadway Stages executives, lost every race. Despite a partial redesign last year, the city has stalled on completing safety improvements. The election results send a clear mandate: voters want action to protect pedestrians and cyclists on McGuinness Boulevard.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The op-ed, titled 'Two Assembly Pols: Congestion Pricing is Good Policy — Democrats Should Embrace It,' argues the governor’s action is 'effectively a cancellation.' Gallagher and Carroll stress that congestion pricing is essential for funding the MTA and improving public transit. They write, 'Congestion pricing does both and there is no fair or viable alternative way to fund the MTA’s capital needs at this juncture.' The statement warns that the delay will shelve critical projects and worsen conditions for all who rely on safe, accessible streets.
