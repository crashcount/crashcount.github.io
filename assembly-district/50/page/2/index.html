Twelve left with injuries that change a life.</strong> In the last year, Assembly District 50 saw 1,120 crashes. The bodies are not numbers. A ten-year-old girl, crossing with the signal, was crushed by an SUV. A cyclist, helmet on, was thrown from his bike and did not get up. A man on foot, struck by an e-bike, bled out on India Street.

Not the old man on a bike.</strong> The city changed the Bedford Avenue bike lane to protect cyclists. Crashes rose. Now the city is putting it back the way it was. The mayor calls it safety. The result is more blood on the street. As one parent <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/11/brooklyn-parents-push-for-paris-style-school-street>described the danger</a>, “There was these like sequences of death—two of children on the way to and from school.

The matter, described as a return to 'the road diet it had previously finalized and then rejected,' follows months of community outcry and advocacy.

According to the event summary, 'the cancellation of elevator installations at 23 subway stations' followed the funding cut. Gallagher condemned the decision, declaring, 'We all matter, and we all need elevators, and we all need congestion pricing.' Comptroller Brad Lander called the move 'shameful.'

The Department of Transportation's original plan, announced after a fatal crash in 2021, would have reduced travel lanes and added a parking-protected bike lane. DOT data showed this 'would reduce deaths and serious injuries by 30 percent.' Under pressure from business interests, especially Broadway Stages, Adams first weakened the plan in July 2023, then scaled it back further in August 2024. Council Member Lincoln Restler said, 'Mayor Adams says he cares about safety, except when it comes to McGuinness Boulevard.' Assembly Member Emily Gallagher called the compromise 'a plan that does nothing to address the central safety concerns of our community.' Public Advocate Jumaane Williams urged the city to follow the evidence and protect lives. The mayor’s decision leaves vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The group—Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, Council Member Lincoln Restler, and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velázquez—called for passage of two state bills: one mandating intelligent speed assistance devices for drivers with six or more speeding tickets in a year, and 'Sammy’s Law,' which would let the City Council lower speed limits. Their statement read, 'We’re calling on the New York State legislature to pass two critical bills that would lead to fewer incidents of traffic violence.' They also urged the Department of Transportation to install raised crosswalks and daylighting at intersections, and to convert Nassau and Norman avenues to one-way streets. The officials’ push highlights the deadly gap in accountability and infrastructure that leaves vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
