Thirty-one suffered wounds so grave they may never walk the same. This is not a war zone. This is Assembly District 50—Greenpoint, Williamsburg, South Williamsburg—since 2022. The numbers do not slow. <strong>In the last year alone, five more died.</strong></p><p>Last spring, a ten-year-old girl was crushed crossing Wallabout Street. She had the light. The driver did not yield. She never made it home, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Just months ago, a man was killed by an e-bike rider who blew through a stop sign in Greenpoint. &ldquo;He died basically on the spot,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-by-e-bike-delivery-worker-who-blew-stop-sign-in-greenpoint-witnesses-say>said a witness</a>. The rider stayed. The man did not get up.</p><h2 id=broken-streets-broken-promises>Broken Streets, Broken Promises</h2><p><strong>The danger is not random.</strong> Morgan Avenue has seen four deaths since 2022. Each time, neighbors gather. Each time, they ask for the same things: protected bike lanes, crosswalks, daylight. Each time, the city waits. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher called it out: &ldquo;Far too many preventable crashes have taken place on Morgan Ave in recent years. We must do more to ensure walkers, cyclists, and drivers are able to use Morgan Ave safely,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/locals-urge-action-morgan-avenue-crash/>she said</a>.</p><p>On McGuinness Boulevard, a cyclist was struck where the city left the bike lane unprotected. The road diet works where it&rsquo;s been installed, but the rest of the corridor waits. &ldquo;The fact is that this wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem if Mayor Adams had just done what he had promised to do, which was, make all of McGuinness safe,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/20/cyclist-badly-hurt-on-segment-of-mcguinness-blvd-that-mayor-adams-refused-to-make-safe>said advocate Kevin LaCherra</a>.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h2><p>Assembly Member Gallagher has backed bills to force repeat speeders to slow down. She sponsored measures to require speed-limiting tech for drivers with a record of violations. She voted to extend school speed zones. She has stood with families after each new death, <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/locals-urge-action-morgan-avenue-crash/>demanding more</a> from the city and state. But the carnage continues. <strong>Policy is not pavement. Words are not protection.</strong></p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>No more waiting.</strong> Call Assembly Member Gallagher. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph citywide speed limit. Demand speed limiters for repeat offenders. Demand real protection for every street. The dead cannot call. The living must.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The fight continues.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Members Robert Carroll and Emily Gallagher issued a public statement on June 7, 2024, supporting congestion pricing and condemning Governor Hochul’s indefinite delay of the program. The statement, published as an op-ed, argues, 'the Governor’s announcement to indefinitely delay implementation is effectively a cancellation of congestion pricing.' Carroll and Gallagher, both long-time supporters, stress that congestion pricing is vital for funding the MTA’s capital needs and for reducing traffic and pollution. They warn that the governor’s move will stall key transit projects and harm New Yorkers who rely on public transportation. The members urge Democrats to embrace the policy, stating, 'It is past time for New York to join such cities as London, Milan, Stockholm, and Singapore and implement congestion pricing without further delay.' The statement does not mince words: the city’s future depends on streets for people, not cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Assembly Member Emily Gallagher joined Gonzalez, highlighting the lack of traffic calming on Nassau Avenue, where Aber was killed. Gallagher stated, 'Nothing to slow traffic on Nassau: no signal, stop sign, even a painted crosswalk.' The officials urged immediate installation of pedestrian safety measures and renewed calls for policy changes to protect vulnerable road users.

Queens Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas, recently injured by a driver, said, 'Had the car been going faster ... I might not be here.' Amy Cohen of Families for Safe Streets highlighted broad support: 'We have organizations from across the city supporting Sammy’s Law.'

The Department of Transportation will install curbside protected bike lanes and reduce car lanes from two to one in each direction on most of the strip. However, north of Calyer Street, two lanes for cars will remain open during weekdays, reverting to parking lanes at night and on weekends. The plan, shaped after lobbying by business interests and mayoral adviser Ingrid Lewis-Martin, mixes two previous DOT proposals. Mayoral spokesman Charles Lutvak said, 'Traffic safety is a key priority for Mayor Adams, and we are delivering with a redesign of McGuinness Boulevard that will make this corridor safer for all road users.' Local officials, including Council Member Lincoln Restler, called it a 'critical step' but noted it lacks key safety elements. The compromise leaves gaps.
