Thirty-one suffered wounds so grave they may never walk the same. This is not a war zone. This is Assembly District 50—Greenpoint, Williamsburg, South Williamsburg—since 2022. The numbers do not slow. <strong>In the last year alone, five more died.</strong></p><p>Last spring, a ten-year-old girl was crushed crossing Wallabout Street. She had the light. The driver did not yield. She never made it home, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Just months ago, a man was killed by an e-bike rider who blew through a stop sign in Greenpoint. &ldquo;He died basically on the spot,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-by-e-bike-delivery-worker-who-blew-stop-sign-in-greenpoint-witnesses-say>said a witness</a>. The rider stayed. The man did not get up.</p><h2 id=broken-streets-broken-promises>Broken Streets, Broken Promises</h2><p><strong>The danger is not random.</strong> Morgan Avenue has seen four deaths since 2022. Each time, neighbors gather. Each time, they ask for the same things: protected bike lanes, crosswalks, daylight. Each time, the city waits. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher called it out: &ldquo;Far too many preventable crashes have taken place on Morgan Ave in recent years. We must do more to ensure walkers, cyclists, and drivers are able to use Morgan Ave safely,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/locals-urge-action-morgan-avenue-crash/>she said</a>.</p><p>On McGuinness Boulevard, a cyclist was struck where the city left the bike lane unprotected. The road diet works where it&rsquo;s been installed, but the rest of the corridor waits. &ldquo;The fact is that this wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem if Mayor Adams had just done what he had promised to do, which was, make all of McGuinness safe,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/20/cyclist-badly-hurt-on-segment-of-mcguinness-blvd-that-mayor-adams-refused-to-make-safe>said advocate Kevin LaCherra</a>.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h2><p>Assembly Member Gallagher has backed bills to force repeat speeders to slow down. She sponsored measures to require speed-limiting tech for drivers with a record of violations. She voted to extend school speed zones. She has stood with families after each new death, <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/locals-urge-action-morgan-avenue-crash/>demanding more</a> from the city and state. But the carnage continues. <strong>Policy is not pavement. Words are not protection.</strong></p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>No more waiting.</strong> Call Assembly Member Gallagher. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph citywide speed limit. Demand speed limiters for repeat offenders. Demand real protection for every street. The dead cannot call.

Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, a vocal supporter of the lane-reduction plan, defeated challenger Anathea Simpkins, who was backed by anti-redesign group Keep McGuinness Moving. Gallagher secured over 75 percent of the vote, declaring, “North Brooklyn demands Mayor Adams finish the job and make McGuinness safe.” Down-ballot, street safety advocates Luke Ohlson and Jenna Bimbi also won, both endorsed by Make McGuinness Safe. Opponents, including Broadway Stages executives, lost every race. Despite a partial redesign last year, the city has stalled on completing safety improvements. The election results send a clear mandate: voters want action to protect pedestrians and cyclists on McGuinness Boulevard.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Gonzalez, representing District 59, called for the state to pass stricter traffic laws targeting drivers with multiple school zone speed camera violations, noting Manel's history of speeding. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher joined Gonzalez, highlighting the lack of traffic calming on Nassau Avenue, where Aber was killed. Gallagher stated, 'Nothing to slow traffic on Nassau: no signal, stop sign, even a painted crosswalk.' The officials urged immediate installation of pedestrian safety measures and renewed calls for policy changes to protect vulnerable road users. The incident marks the first traffic fatality in Northern Brooklyn in 2024, underscoring systemic failures in street design and enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Their statement read, 'We’re calling on the New York State legislature to pass two critical bills that would lead to fewer incidents of traffic violence.' They also urged the Department of Transportation to install raised crosswalks and daylighting at intersections, and to convert Nassau and Norman avenues to one-way streets.

Manel was charged with failure to yield and failure to exercise due care. Nassau Avenue, a two-way street used by cyclists, lacks protective infrastructure. Following the crash, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, Council Member Lincoln Restler, and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velázquez called for passage of two state bills: one requiring repeat speeding offenders to install intelligent speed assistance devices, and Sammy's Law, which would let the City Council lower speed limits. They also urged the Department of Transportation to install raised crosswalks and daylighting at intersections. Their statement reads: “Lowering the speed limit and enforcing real accountability for dangerous drivers are urgent steps we must take to protect New Yorkers.”</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the driver failed to yield the right-of-way. The report states, 'A Dodge pickup turned left. A 49-year-old woman crossed in the marked crosswalk.

The victim was crossing without a signal but within a marked crosswalk, as noted in the police report, after the driver’s error.

The police report lists 'Unsafe Speed' as the primary contributing factor, with 'Pavement Slippery' also noted. The woman was not wearing a helmet, as documented in the report, but this detail appears after the driver error of unsafe speed. No other vehicles or people were involved.

Queens Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas, recently injured by a driver, said, 'Had the car been going faster ... I might not be here.' Amy Cohen of Families for Safe Streets highlighted broad support: 'We have organizations from across the city supporting Sammy’s Law.'
