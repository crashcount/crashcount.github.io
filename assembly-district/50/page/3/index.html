Twelve left with injuries that change a life.</strong> In the last year, Assembly District 50 saw 1,120 crashes. The bodies are not numbers. A ten-year-old girl, crossing with the signal, was crushed by an SUV. A cyclist, helmet on, was thrown from his bike and did not get up. A man on foot, struck by an e-bike, bled out on India Street. The street remembers. The families do too.</p><h3 id=broken-promises-broken-streets>Broken Promises, Broken Streets</h3><p><strong>No one is safe. Not the child in the crosswalk. Not the old man on a bike.</strong> The city changed the Bedford Avenue bike lane to protect cyclists. Crashes rose. Now the city is putting it back the way it was. The mayor calls it safety. The result is more blood on the street. As one parent <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/11/brooklyn-parents-push-for-paris-style-school-street>described the danger</a>, “There was these like sequences of death—two of children on the way to and from school.

She <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/06/15/greenpoint-lawmaker-opposition-to-mcguinness-redesign-is-about-fear-bad-faith-and-control>backed the McGuinness Boulevard redesign</a>, calling out the “fear, bad faith and control” behind opposition. But the deaths keep coming. The city drags its feet. The law sits in committee. The street keeps taking.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Gallagher. Call the mayor. Demand the city use its new power to lower speed limits. Demand the Assembly pass the speed limiter bill.

The driver, Stanley Manel, was charged with failure to yield and failure to exercise due care. Gonzalez, representing District 59, called for the state to pass stricter traffic laws targeting drivers with multiple school zone speed camera violations, noting Manel's history of speeding. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher joined Gonzalez, highlighting the lack of traffic calming on Nassau Avenue, where Aber was killed. Gallagher stated, 'Nothing to slow traffic on Nassau: no signal, stop sign, even a painted crosswalk.' The officials urged immediate installation of pedestrian safety measures and renewed calls for policy changes to protect vulnerable road users. The incident marks the first traffic fatality in Northern Brooklyn in 2024, underscoring systemic failures in street design and enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The group—Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, Council Member Lincoln Restler, and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velázquez—called for passage of two state bills: one mandating intelligent speed assistance devices for drivers with six or more speeding tickets in a year, and 'Sammy’s Law,' which would let the City Council lower speed limits. Their statement read, 'We’re calling on the New York State legislature to pass two critical bills that would lead to fewer incidents of traffic violence.' They also urged the Department of Transportation to install raised crosswalks and daylighting at intersections, and to convert Nassau and Norman avenues to one-way streets.

The plan, shaped after lobbying by business interests and mayoral adviser Ingrid Lewis-Martin, mixes two previous DOT proposals. Mayoral spokesman Charles Lutvak said, 'Traffic safety is a key priority for Mayor Adams, and we are delivering with a redesign of McGuinness Boulevard that will make this corridor safer for all road users.' Local officials, including Council Member Lincoln Restler, called it a 'critical step' but noted it lacks key safety elements. The compromise leaves gaps. Since 2021, 62 people have been injured on this stretch. The carnage continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident happened near Meeker Avenue, one block from where teacher Matthew Jensen was killed in 2021. The matter, titled 'Locals call for mayor to take immediate action after moped rider injured on McGuinness Boulevard,' highlights the urgent need for the Department of Transportation’s proposed safety redesign. Restler, along with U.S. Rep. Nydia Velázquez, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, and State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, issued a joint statement: 'Lives are being put at risk. We need immediate action by the Mayor's office to implement the Department of Transportation's proposed safety improvements so that everyone in our community can feel confident that McGuinness Boulevard will not cause more tragedies.' The safety plan remains blocked, leaving vulnerable road users exposed to ongoing danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, 'A Toyota SUV slammed into the rear of a southbound e-bike. The 20-year-old rider hit the pavement hard. His leg split open. Blood pooled on hot asphalt. Speed did the damage.' The crash left the e-bike rider with severe lacerations to his lower leg and foot. The report lists 'Unsafe Speed' as the contributing factor. The SUV’s center front end struck the e-bike’s rear, causing the rider to fall. The rider was not wearing a helmet, as noted in the report, but the primary cause was the SUV driver’s unsafe speed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The incident, near the site of a 2021 fatality, drew a joint statement from Rep. Nydia Velázquez, Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, and Council Member Lincoln Restler. They called the crash 'entirely predictable' and demanded Mayor Adams immediately implement the Department of Transportation’s stalled safety redesign. The DOT’s plan, which includes narrowing the street and adding a protected bike lane, faces opposition from powerful donors. The mayor’s office claims traffic safety is a priority, but the plan remains in limbo. Advocates and officials say every delay puts more lives at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'After two bodies recovered from Newtown Creek, pols petition for more nightlife safety measures in industrial areas,' highlights the lack of lighting, signage, connectivity, and public transportation in the Industrial Business Zone (IBZ). Gutiérrez, joined by U.S. Rep. Nydia Velázquez, Assembly Members Maritz Davila and Emily Gallagher, and State Senator Julia Salazar, urged a full investigation and demanded urgent infrastructure upgrades. Gutiérrez said, 'We remain committed to enhancing public safety and ensuring that the nightlife community operates and maintains responsible practices.' The push centers vulnerable road users—pedestrians and nightlife patrons—who face systemic danger in neglected, poorly lit streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
