A child was hit weeks before. Injuries on e-bikes outnumber pedal bikes. Officials call it an emergency. The rule moves fast. Riders and workers face new limits.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist reported on June 5, 2025, that Mayor Adams ordered Citi Bike to limit e-bike speeds to 15 mph, citing an 'emergency threat to life and property.' The city rejected Lyft’s plan to add speedometers, demanding immediate compliance. Deputy Mayor Mastro wrote, 'We have requested that you immediately implement this new 15 mph speed limit for Citi Bike e-bikes, and you declined to do so.' Citi Bike agreed to the mandate, though previously voiced concerns. In 2021, e-bike injuries (1,170) and deaths (9) far outpaced those on pedal bikes (236 injuries, 2 deaths). The order follows a crash where a 3-year-old was struck by an e-bike in South Williamsburg. The city will collect public comments before finalizing the rule. The move highlights rising e-bike use and the city’s struggle to manage micromobility safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The group’s ranks swell with each tragedy. No specific bill or committee is named in this event. Kuntzman’s statement underscores the relentless danger faced by pedestrians and cyclists. The safety analyst notes: the event describes a new member joining an advocacy group, which does not directly affect pedestrian or cyclist safety at the population level.

Streetsblog NYC reports, 'A bill that would prevent the most-reckless drivers from speeding easily moved forward on Tuesday.' Senator Andrew Gounardes sponsors the bill, emphasizing it targets the most dangerous drivers. Assembly sponsor Emily Gallagher raised concerns about cost and judicial bias, but stressed that speeding endangers everyone. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins backs the bill's safety focus. According to safety analysts, restricting repeat speeders directly tackles a major threat to pedestrians and cyclists, likely reducing crashes and making streets safer citywide.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The same day, activists lobbied for the Idaho Stop bill (S639/A7071), sponsored by Sen. Rachel May and Assembly Member Karen McMahon. The bill would let cyclists treat red lights as stop signs and stop signs as yield signs, a move proven to reduce injuries. Despite support, the bill remains blocked. NYPD continues harsh enforcement against cyclists, who make up a small share of city trips but receive a disproportionate number of tickets.

Gounardes added, 'It’s no longer simply enough to shake our heads in despair when these preventable tragedies occur—it’s time for us to act.'

It struck a man crouched in the road. He died at Elmhurst Hospital. The driver left. Police are still searching. Brooklyn’s streets claim more lives. The toll mounts. The city remains dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist (published March 3, 2025) reports a fatal crash in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. A man in his 20s, crouched in the street to pick up food, was struck and killed by a turning dump truck just before 4 a.m. at Withers Street and Woodpoint Road. The NYPD stated, “The driver, a 49-year-old man, left the scene.” No arrests have been made. The NYPD’s Collision Investigation Squad is investigating. The article notes this was one of several deadly crashes in Brooklyn that week, highlighting ongoing risks for pedestrians and the persistent issue of hit-and-runs. At least 10 people have died in Brooklyn traffic crashes so far this year, matching last year’s pace. The crash underscores the lethal mix of heavy vehicles, vulnerable road users, and gaps in enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
