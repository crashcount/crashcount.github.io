Twelve left with injuries that change a life.</strong> In the last year, Assembly District 50 saw 1,120 crashes. The bodies are not numbers. A ten-year-old girl, crossing with the signal, was crushed by an SUV. A cyclist, helmet on, was thrown from his bike and did not get up. A man on foot, struck by an e-bike, bled out on India Street. The street remembers. The families do too.</p><h3 id=broken-promises-broken-streets>Broken Promises, Broken Streets</h3><p><strong>No one is safe. Not the child in the crosswalk. Not the old man on a bike.</strong> The city changed the Bedford Avenue bike lane to protect cyclists. Crashes rose. Now the city is putting it back the way it was. The mayor calls it safety. The result is more blood on the street. As one parent <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/11/brooklyn-parents-push-for-paris-style-school-street>described the danger</a>, “There was these like sequences of death—two of children on the way to and from school. There is just this sense of impending doom, it’s an obvious danger and if nothing is being done, another terrible thing will happen.”</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-deeds>Leadership: Words and Deeds</h3><p>Assembly Member Emily Gallagher has not stood silent. She has pushed for speed-limiting tech for repeat offenders, <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">sponsoring a bill</a> to force the worst drivers to slow down. She <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/06/15/greenpoint-lawmaker-opposition-to-mcguinness-redesign-is-about-fear-bad-faith-and-control>backed the McGuinness Boulevard redesign</a>, calling out the “fear, bad faith and control” behind opposition. But the deaths keep coming. The city drags its feet. The law sits in committee. The street keeps taking.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Gallagher. Call the mayor. Demand the city use its new power to lower speed limits. Demand the Assembly pass the speed limiter bill. Demand streets where a child can walk to school and come home alive.</p><p><strong>The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Their plan would turn Monitor Street into a cul-de-sac with a pedestrian plaza, add mid-block crossings, and close a slip lane to block cut-through traffic from the BQE. The push follows a fatal crash at Monitor and Driggs, where a driver killed 73-year-old cyclist Teddy Orzechowski. Streetsblog notes, 'Streets outside schools have higher crash and injury rates than the city average.' Most PS 110 families walk or bike, but the city has not responded to the proposal.

Deputy Mayor Mastro wrote, 'We have requested that you immediately implement this new 15 mph speed limit for Citi Bike e-bikes, and you declined to do so.' Citi Bike agreed to the mandate, though previously voiced concerns. In 2021, e-bike injuries (1,170) and deaths (9) far outpaced those on pedal bikes (236 injuries, 2 deaths). The order follows a crash where a 3-year-old was struck by an e-bike in South Williamsburg. The city will collect public comments before finalizing the rule.

The bill would let cyclists treat red lights as stop signs and stop signs as yield signs, a move proven to reduce injuries. Despite support, the bill remains blocked.

The piece highlights systemic issues, including delivery app pressures and gaps in e-bike regulation. City data shows e-bikes account for less than 2% of traffic deaths, but the policy debate continues. Lawmakers have called for tighter rules, as delivery workers face incentives to rush.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He did not rise.</p><p class=mb3>A 49-year-old pedestrian was killed on Franklin Street at India Street in Brooklyn when an unlicensed e-bike rider traveling south struck him head-on, according to the police report. The report states the e-bike driver was 'unlicensed' and identifies 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as a contributing factor. The impact occurred at the center front end of the e-bike, causing severe head injuries and fatal bleeding to the pedestrian. The police report describes the victim as 'crossing, no signal, or crosswalk' and 'not at intersection,' but the primary focus remains on the unlicensed status of the e-bike operator and the disregard for traffic control. The narrative details a quiet night interrupted by the crash, with the victim left motionless on the pavement. No other contributing factors from the pedestrian are cited in the report.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On March 6, 2025, Brooklyn Community Board 1 voted 18-15 to request a 20 mph speed limit for Greenpoint and Williamsburg. The measure, supported by 40 groups and nearly all local elected officials, marks the first neighborhood-wide slow zone request since the passage of Sammy's Law. The board's action follows letters from Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez, and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velazquez to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. They cited CB1's high fatality rate—3.27 deaths per 10,000 residents, above the city average. The board's vote was contentious, with pro-driving members opposing the change. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno acknowledged the support and promised more information on slow zones for outer boroughs. Council Member Lincoln Restler later joined the call for lower speeds. The measure now awaits DOT action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
