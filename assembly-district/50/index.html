Thirty-one suffered wounds so grave they may never walk the same. This is not a war zone. This is Assembly District 50—Greenpoint, Williamsburg, South Williamsburg—since 2022. The numbers do not slow. <strong>In the last year alone, five more died.</strong></p><p>Last spring, a ten-year-old girl was crushed crossing Wallabout Street. She had the light. The driver did not yield. She never made it home, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Just months ago, a man was killed by an e-bike rider who blew through a stop sign in Greenpoint. &ldquo;He died basically on the spot,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-by-e-bike-delivery-worker-who-blew-stop-sign-in-greenpoint-witnesses-say>said a witness</a>. The rider stayed. The man did not get up.</p><h2 id=broken-streets-broken-promises>Broken Streets, Broken Promises</h2><p><strong>The danger is not random.</strong> Morgan Avenue has seen four deaths since 2022. Each time, neighbors gather. Each time, they ask for the same things: protected bike lanes, crosswalks, daylight. Each time, the city waits. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher called it out: &ldquo;Far too many preventable crashes have taken place on Morgan Ave in recent years. We must do more to ensure walkers, cyclists, and drivers are able to use Morgan Ave safely,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/locals-urge-action-morgan-avenue-crash/>she said</a>.</p><p>On McGuinness Boulevard, a cyclist was struck where the city left the bike lane unprotected. The road diet works where it&rsquo;s been installed, but the rest of the corridor waits. &ldquo;The fact is that this wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem if Mayor Adams had just done what he had promised to do, which was, make all of McGuinness safe,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/20/cyclist-badly-hurt-on-segment-of-mcguinness-blvd-that-mayor-adams-refused-to-make-safe>said advocate Kevin LaCherra</a>.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h2><p>Assembly Member Gallagher has backed bills to force repeat speeders to slow down. She sponsored measures to require speed-limiting tech for drivers with a record of violations. She voted to extend school speed zones. She has stood with families after each new death, <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/locals-urge-action-morgan-avenue-crash/>demanding more</a> from the city and state. But the carnage continues. <strong>Policy is not pavement. Words are not protection.</strong></p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>No more waiting.</strong> Call Assembly Member Gallagher. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph citywide speed limit. Demand speed limiters for repeat offenders. Demand real protection for every street. The dead cannot call.

The move follows a court ruling allowing the change. City Hall claims the redesign addresses 'serious safety concerns.' Legal precedent (Turturro v.

Assembly Member Amy Sohn and others criticized the lack of action. The only major win was extending the city’s speed camera program.

The statement reads, 'There's a new member of Families for Safe Streets, which is not good news.' Joe Jankoski, mourning Amanda Servedio, spoke out after her death by a recidivist speeder. The group’s ranks swell with each tragedy. No specific bill or committee is named in this event. Kuntzman’s statement underscores the relentless danger faced by pedestrians and cyclists. The safety analyst notes: the event describes a new member joining an advocacy group, which does not directly affect pedestrian or cyclist safety at the population level. The city’s streets remain perilous. The group’s growth is a grim measure of failure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, reported by Streetsblog NYC, was not a bill or vote but a personal shift. Sohn said, 'It disconnects you from the life of the city.' She praised Albany’s walkability and called car ownership a hassle. Governor Hochul also spoke on the need for walkable cities and announced a $400-million downtown plan. No committee, bill number, or formal legislative action is tied to this event.

The measure passed with just two 'no' votes out of 13. The bill requires speed-limiting devices in cars of drivers with six or more camera-issued speeding tickets in a year. Streetsblog NYC reports, 'A bill that would prevent the most-reckless drivers from speeding easily moved forward on Tuesday.' Senator Andrew Gounardes sponsors the bill, emphasizing it targets the most dangerous drivers. Assembly sponsor Emily Gallagher raised concerns about cost and judicial bias, but stressed that speeding endangers everyone. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins backs the bill's safety focus. According to safety analysts, restricting repeat speeders directly tackles a major threat to pedestrians and cyclists, likely reducing crashes and making streets safer citywide.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Committee Chair Jeremy Cooney was compelled to place it on the agenda. Democrats may use 'Aye Without Recommendation' to let the bill advance without clear support. A watchdog coalition, including Reinvent Albany and Bike New York, called the bill 'contrary to notions of basic fairness.' The same day, activists lobbied for the Idaho Stop bill (S639/A7071), sponsored by Sen. Rachel May and Assembly Member Karen McMahon. The bill would let cyclists treat red lights as stop signs and stop signs as yield signs, a move proven to reduce injuries. Despite support, the bill remains blocked. NYPD continues harsh enforcement against cyclists, who make up a small share of city trips but receive a disproportionate number of tickets. Cyclist deaths keep rising.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, stalled for years in Albany, gained urgency after a fatal Brooklyn crash on April 1, 2025. Gallagher, joined by State Senator Andrew Gounardes and city Comptroller Brad Lander, rallied at Borough Hall, urging swift passage. The bill targets drivers with 11 or more license points in 24 months, or six camera violations in a year. Gallagher said, 'A lot of what happens when it comes to getting a bill to the top of the list is really through a movement and folks fighting for the bill.' Gounardes added, 'It’s no longer simply enough to shake our heads in despair when these preventable tragedies occur—it’s time for us to act.' The legislation mirrors past efforts like the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Act, aiming to hold reckless drivers accountable and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored in Albany by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, would require drivers with repeated violations to install intelligent speed assistance (ISA) devices. These devices cap speed at 5 mph over the limit for those with 11 or more license points in 24 months or six camera tickets in a year. The rally followed a fatal Gravesend crash that killed a mother and her two daughters. Hanif and other lawmakers called current enforcement—ticketing, suspensions, fines, jail—ineffective. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon said, 'The speed limiter technology is available to us. Let’s use it. It will save lives.' The bill is modeled on EU and Virginia laws.
