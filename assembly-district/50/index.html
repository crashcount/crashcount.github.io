Twenty-six left with serious injuries. Over two thousand hurt.</strong> These are not just numbers—they are lives ended or broken on the streets of Greenpoint, Williamsburg, and South Williamsburg since 2022. The dead include a ten-year-old girl, crushed by an SUV while crossing with the signal at Franklin Avenue and Wallabout Street. The driver failed to yield. She never made it home. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>The violence does not stop. In March, a man was killed by an e-bike rider who ran a stop. In June, the city moved to strip protection from the Bedford Avenue bike lane after a series of crashes. The city called it a safety fix. The result: <strong>cyclists forced back into the path of cars and trucks.</strong></p><h3 id=whose-safety-counts>Whose Safety Counts?</h3><p>The fight over Bedford Avenue exposed the fault lines. One resident pleaded, <em>&ldquo;I beg the court, please for my safety and the safety of my children and all the 2,000 children living close to the dangerous new bike lane, please allow the mayor to shift the bike lane&rsquo;s location on the roadway.&rdquo;</em> <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/nyc-cleared-to-move-bedford-ave-bike-lane-in-brooklyn-seen-as-hazard-to-pedestrians/>NY Daily News</a></p><p>But others warned, removing the protected lane would bring &ldquo;irreparable harm&rdquo; to the neighborhood. The city’s own plan now puts cyclists back in the open, with nothing but paint between them and speeding steel. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/nyc-cleared-to-move-bedford-ave-bike-lane-in-brooklyn-seen-as-hazard-to-pedestrians/>NY Daily News</a></p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Assembly Member Emily Gallagher has not been silent.

She stood with families after the Gravesend crash, demanding Albany pass the Stop Super Speeders Act. But the bill sits in committee. The carnage continues.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay means another body on the street.</strong> Call Assembly Member Gallagher. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit.

Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>The 2025 Albany legislative session ended June 25, with lawmakers failing to pass key street safety bills. The Streetsblog NYC report reads: "Our elected officials in Albany have failed the livable streets movement again." Despite support for measures like speed camera reauthorization, most bills to protect pedestrians and cyclists died in committee or never reached the floor. Assembly Member Amy Sohn and others criticized the lack of action. The only major win was extending the city’s speed camera program. A safety analyst notes: 'Failure to advance livable streets policies likely maintains the status quo, which typically prioritizes car-centric infrastructure and neglects the safety and needs of pedestrians and cyclists.' The session’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users at risk. No progress. No protection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure passed with just two 'no' votes out of 13. The bill requires speed-limiting devices in cars of drivers with six or more camera-issued speeding tickets in a year. Streetsblog NYC reports, 'A bill that would prevent the most-reckless drivers from speeding easily moved forward on Tuesday.' Senator Andrew Gounardes sponsors the bill, emphasizing it targets the most dangerous drivers. Assembly sponsor Emily Gallagher raised concerns about cost and judicial bias, but stressed that speeding endangers everyone. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins backs the bill's safety focus. According to safety analysts, restricting repeat speeders directly tackles a major threat to pedestrians and cyclists, likely reducing crashes and making streets safer citywide.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Committee Chair Jeremy Cooney was compelled to place it on the agenda. Democrats may use 'Aye Without Recommendation' to let the bill advance without clear support. A watchdog coalition, including Reinvent Albany and Bike New York, called the bill 'contrary to notions of basic fairness.' The same day, activists lobbied for the Idaho Stop bill (S639/A7071), sponsored by Sen. Rachel May and Assembly Member Karen McMahon. The bill would let cyclists treat red lights as stop signs and stop signs as yield signs, a move proven to reduce injuries. Despite support, the bill remains blocked. NYPD continues harsh enforcement against cyclists, who make up a small share of city trips but receive a disproportionate number of tickets.

Both teens were partially ejected and suffered severe lacerations to the head and chest, with shock noted in each case. The report states the sedan's driver was unlicensed and had 'looked away,' citing 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as contributing factors. The impact occurred at the center front end of the sedan and the right side doors of the bike. No safety equipment was used by the victims, but the report does not list this as a contributing factor. The collision underscores the lethal consequences of driver inattention and ignoring traffic controls, especially when an unlicensed driver is behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill, stalled for years in Albany, gained urgency after a fatal Brooklyn crash on April 1, 2025. Gallagher, joined by State Senator Andrew Gounardes and city Comptroller Brad Lander, rallied at Borough Hall, urging swift passage. The bill targets drivers with 11 or more license points in 24 months, or six camera violations in a year. Gallagher said, 'A lot of what happens when it comes to getting a bill to the top of the list is really through a movement and folks fighting for the bill.' Gounardes added, 'It’s no longer simply enough to shake our heads in despair when these preventable tragedies occur—it’s time for us to act.' The legislation mirrors past efforts like the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Act, aiming to hold reckless drivers accountable and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored in Albany by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, would require drivers with repeated violations to install intelligent speed assistance (ISA) devices. These devices cap speed at 5 mph over the limit for those with 11 or more license points in 24 months or six camera tickets in a year. The rally followed a fatal Gravesend crash that killed a mother and her two daughters. Hanif and other lawmakers called current enforcement—ticketing, suspensions, fines, jail—ineffective. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon said, 'The speed limiter technology is available to us. Let’s use it. It will save lives.' The bill is modeled on EU and Virginia laws. Some opposition remains, but supporters say the measure is urgent and practical.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article notes this intersection is known for frequent stop sign violations: "It's not a unicorn incident. It's happened a lot." The piece highlights systemic issues, including delivery app pressures and gaps in e-bike regulation. City data shows e-bikes account for less than 2% of traffic deaths, but the policy debate continues.

The report states the e-bike driver was 'unlicensed' and identifies 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as a contributing factor. The impact occurred at the center front end of the e-bike, causing severe head injuries and fatal bleeding to the pedestrian. The police report describes the victim as 'crossing, no signal, or crosswalk' and 'not at intersection,' but the primary focus remains on the unlicensed status of the e-bike operator and the disregard for traffic control. The narrative details a quiet night interrupted by the crash, with the victim left motionless on the pavement. No other contributing factors from the pedestrian are cited in the report.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The measure, supported by 40 groups and nearly all local elected officials, marks the first neighborhood-wide slow zone request since the passage of Sammy's Law. The board's action follows letters from Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez, and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velazquez to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. They cited CB1's high fatality rate—3.27 deaths per 10,000 residents, above the city average. The board's vote was contentious, with pro-driving members opposing the change. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno acknowledged the support and promised more information on slow zones for outer boroughs. Council Member Lincoln Restler later joined the call for lower speeds. The measure now awaits DOT action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
