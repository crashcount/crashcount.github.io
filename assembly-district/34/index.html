The numbers are not just numbers. A 15-year-old, dead on 43rd Street. A 44-year-old woman, killed on 90th Street. A 39-year-old, ejected from a moped and left lifeless on 23rd Avenue. The street keeps its silence. The families do not.</p><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do the most harm.</strong> Three pedestrians killed by SUVs. One by a sedan. Trucks, bikes, mopeds—they all leave scars, but the weight of steel is what ends lives here. No helmet, no crosswalk, no daylight saves you when a driver does not see, or does not care.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-gaps>Leadership: Action and Gaps</h3><p>Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas has felt the pain herself. She was struck in a crosswalk, left with a broken arm. &ldquo;If we had universal daylighting—he could have seen me,&rdquo; she said, calling for safer streets and lower speed limits <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/07/queens-pol-recovering-from-broken-arm-bruises-after-driver-strikes-her-in-crosswalk>after her injury</a>. She has backed protected bike lanes, school speed zones, and the push for a citywide 20 mph limit. She co-sponsored bills to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting tech. She voted to extend speed cameras near schools, saying yes to laws that keep children alive.</p><p>But the crisis does not slow. <strong>One death this year, down from six last year.</strong> Two serious injuries, half of last year’s toll. Still, 278 people hurt since January. The street does not care about percentages. It cares about flesh and bone.</p><h3 id=the-next-fight-no-more-waiting>The Next Fight: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every delay is another body.</strong> The city can set a 20 mph limit now. It has not. The Stop Super Speeders Act sits in Albany. It has not passed. The protected bike lanes on 31st Street face pushback, but González-Rojas stands with them, saying they will &ldquo;protect pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers while making our streets safer and less congested&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/20/dot-stands-by-astoria-bike-lane-plan-despite-foes-childish-outbursts>in a joint letter</a>.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speeders be stopped.</strong> The street will not change itself. Only you can force their hand.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The proposal, discussed at a heated community board meeting, remains active and is set for installation after summer repaving. Council Member Tiffany Caban, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, and Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas endorsed the plan in a letter, stating it would 'protect pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers while making our streets safer and less congested.' DOT spokesman Will Livingston said the design improves safety and supports local businesses. Despite opposition from some business owners, the plan moves forward. Safety analysts note: 'Protected bike lanes are proven to reduce injuries and fatalities for cyclists and pedestrians, encourage mode shift, and improve street equity by reallocating space from cars to vulnerable users.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The system failed them again.</p><p class=mb3>On May 9, 2025, during New York State’s $254-million budget negotiations, lawmakers rejected Governor Hochul’s proposed street safety measures. The legislature dropped a mandate for daylighting—banning parking at corners near elementary schools—deferring instead to New York City, where Council Member Julie Won’s universal daylighting bill faces opposition from the Department of Transportation. Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, herself a crash survivor, vowed to keep fighting for daylighting, saying, 'I think daylighting would have helped me.' Hochul’s proposals to let the city set lower bike lane speed limits and to reclassify heavy e-bikes as mopeds were also cut. Critics argued these would not address core safety issues. The Adams administration opposes a City Council bill for e-bike registration and plates, while State Sen. Jenifer Rajkumar’s state version would shift licensing to the DMV. As Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives put it, 'A daylighting requirement would have made intersections safer around elementary schools, and it’s disappointing that this provision was cut from the New York State budget.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Primary sponsor Emily Gallagher leads a bloc of co-sponsors, including Rebecca Seawright, Andrew Hevesi, and others. The measure aims to clamp down on repeat speeders with mandatory speed-limiting tech.

The toll stirs anger, hope, and a fight over who pays and who breathes.</p><p class=mb3>On January 3, 2025, congestion pricing (no bill number cited) will begin in Manhattan after a federal judge allowed the toll to proceed. The policy charges most drivers $9 to enter south of 60th Street during peak hours. The matter, titled 'Congestion pricing set to begin at midnight Sunday as federal judge clears path for Manhattan toll,' has drawn sharp lines. Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30, Queens) opposes the toll, warning, 'I don't know how my district is going to be impacted.' He fears more cars parking in Queens and unclear pollution risks. Council Member Kristy Marmorato (Bronx) calls it a 'cash grab.' In contrast, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez and Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas support the measure, citing cleaner air, safer streets, and transit upgrades. González-Rojas says, 'Congestion pricing isn't about penalizing anyone—it's about modernizing our transportation system and tackling climate change.' The judge ordered further study on environmental impacts, but the toll begins as scheduled.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, who sponsored the law, said, "I'm excited about the ADA-accessible ramp on the Cross Bay Bridge and that cyclists and pedestrians can access this space... because we passed my legislation." The MTA also announced similar improvements for the Henry Hudson and Triboro Bridges. However, plans for the Verrazzano, Gil Hodges-Marine Parkway, Bronx-Whitestone, and Throgs Neck bridges remain uncertain. Cycling advocates praised the MTA’s progress but criticized its reluctance to consider lane conversions for safer, broader access.
