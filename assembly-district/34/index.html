Two children died before they could grow up. A woman was killed crossing 37th Avenue. A 23-year-old man was thrown from a car on Northern Boulevard and did not get up again.

No daylighting near schools. No lower bike lane speed limits. No new e-bike rules. City and state leaders bickered. Streets stay dangerous. Pedestrians and cyclists remain exposed. The system failed them again.</p><p class=mb3>On May 9, 2025, during New York State’s $254-million budget negotiations, lawmakers rejected Governor Hochul’s proposed street safety measures. The legislature dropped a mandate for daylighting—banning parking at corners near elementary schools—deferring instead to New York City, where Council Member Julie Won’s universal daylighting bill faces opposition from the Department of Transportation. Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, herself a crash survivor, vowed to keep fighting for daylighting, saying, 'I think daylighting would have helped me.' Hochul’s proposals to let the city set lower bike lane speed limits and to reclassify heavy e-bikes as mopeds were also cut. Critics argued these would not address core safety issues. The Adams administration opposes a City Council bill for e-bike registration and plates, while State Sen. Jenifer Rajkumar’s state version would shift licensing to the DMV. As Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives put it, 'A daylighting requirement would have made intersections safer around elementary schools, and it’s disappointing that this provision was cut from the New York State budget.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states the man was ejected from the scooter, suffering a severe head injury with bleeding, though he remained conscious. The narrative describes the impact: 'He flew. No helmet. Head bleeding. Conscious. Forty-two years old. A baby watched.' The police report cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor. The pickup truck showed no damage, but the man’s injuries were grave. The report does not list any victim behavior as a contributing factor, only noting the absence of a helmet after describing the driver’s inattention. The crash underscores the danger posed by inattentive drivers to vulnerable road users in Queens.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The policy charges most drivers $9 to enter south of 60th Street during peak hours. The matter, titled 'Congestion pricing set to begin at midnight Sunday as federal judge clears path for Manhattan toll,' has drawn sharp lines. Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30, Queens) opposes the toll, warning, 'I don't know how my district is going to be impacted.' He fears more cars parking in Queens and unclear pollution risks. Council Member Kristy Marmorato (Bronx) calls it a 'cash grab.' In contrast, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez and Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas support the measure, citing cleaner air, safer streets, and transit upgrades. González-Rojas says, 'Congestion pricing isn't about penalizing anyone—it's about modernizing our transportation system and tackling climate change.'

Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, who sponsored the law, said, "I'm excited about the ADA-accessible ramp on the Cross Bay Bridge and that cyclists and pedestrians can access this space... because we passed my legislation." The MTA also announced similar improvements for the Henry Hudson and Triboro Bridges. However, plans for the Verrazzano, Gil Hodges-Marine Parkway, Bronx-Whitestone, and Throgs Neck bridges remain uncertain. Cycling advocates praised the MTA’s progress but criticized its reluctance to consider lane conversions for safer, broader access.

Council members and advocates demand urgency. The mayor and DOT hesitate. Traffic deaths mount. The city faces a choice: act fast or let danger linger on its streets.</p><p class=mb3>On May 3, 2024, the City Council debated a new policy allowing New York City to lower speed limits from 25 mph to 20 mph on most streets, following a recent state budget measure. The measure, discussed in committee, requires a Council vote for citywide changes and a six-month warning period for drivers. Kamillah Hanks (District 49) was mentioned in the debate. Assemblymember Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas stressed urgency, citing recent deaths. Brooklyn Councilmember Lincoln Restler pledged to push the measure forward. Advocates like Transportation Alternatives called for a citywide approach, not piecemeal action. The Department of Transportation thanked lawmakers but did not commit to a timeline. The debate highlights the tension between urgent safety needs and political delays. Vulnerable road users remain at risk until the city acts.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
