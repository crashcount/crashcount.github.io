Caban demanded a 20 mph limit, protected bike lanes, and universal daylighting. Mamdani backed Sammy’s Law and curbs on car traffic near schools. Transportation Alternatives urged the city to use its new authority to lower speed limits, stating, "Slower speeds are proven to reduce crashes dramatically." Safety analysts confirm: lowering limits cuts crash severity and frequency, protecting pedestrians and cyclists without burdening them. No bill was filed, but the call is clear—speed kills, and the city can stop it.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal, discussed at a heated community board meeting, remains active and is set for installation after summer repaving. Council Member Tiffany Caban, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, and Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas endorsed the plan in a letter, stating it would 'protect pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers while making our streets safer and less congested.' DOT spokesman Will Livingston said the design improves safety and supports local businesses. Despite opposition from some business owners, the plan moves forward. Safety analysts note: 'Protected bike lanes are proven to reduce injuries and fatalities for cyclists and pedestrians, encourage mode shift, and improve street equity by reallocating space from cars to vulnerable users.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The system failed them again.</p><p class=mb3>On May 9, 2025, during New York State’s $254-million budget negotiations, lawmakers rejected Governor Hochul’s proposed street safety measures. The legislature dropped a mandate for daylighting—banning parking at corners near elementary schools—deferring instead to New York City, where Council Member Julie Won’s universal daylighting bill faces opposition from the Department of Transportation. Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, herself a crash survivor, vowed to keep fighting for daylighting, saying, 'I think daylighting would have helped me.' Hochul’s proposals to let the city set lower bike lane speed limits and to reclassify heavy e-bikes as mopeds were also cut. Critics argued these would not address core safety issues. The Adams administration opposes a City Council bill for e-bike registration and plates, while State Sen. Jenifer Rajkumar’s state version would shift licensing to the DMV. As Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives put it, 'A daylighting requirement would have made intersections safer around elementary schools, and it’s disappointing that this provision was cut from the New York State budget.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Holden (District 30, Queens) opposes the toll, warning, 'I don't know how my district is going to be impacted.' He fears more cars parking in Queens and unclear pollution risks. Council Member Kristy Marmorato (Bronx) calls it a 'cash grab.' In contrast, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez and Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas support the measure, citing cleaner air, safer streets, and transit upgrades. González-Rojas says, 'Congestion pricing isn't about penalizing anyone—it's about modernizing our transportation system and tackling climate change.'

This action fulfills a mandate from the 2021 MTA Bike Access bill. Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, who sponsored the law, said, "I'm excited about the ADA-accessible ramp on the Cross Bay Bridge and that cyclists and pedestrians can access this space... because we passed my legislation." The MTA also announced similar improvements for the Henry Hudson and Triboro Bridges. However, plans for the Verrazzano, Gil Hodges-Marine Parkway, Bronx-Whitestone, and Throgs Neck bridges remain uncertain. Cycling advocates praised the MTA’s progress but criticized its reluctance to consider lane conversions for safer, broader access. The new ramp removes a deadly barrier, but the fight for safe passage on all city bridges continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states the teen was 'unlicensed and bareheaded' when he struck the bus and was ejected from his motorscooter, suffering fatal head injuries. The bus, registered in New Jersey, was traveling west and was struck on its right front bumper. The police report lists the boy as unlicensed and not wearing any safety equipment. Contributing factors are marked as 'Unspecified' in the report.
