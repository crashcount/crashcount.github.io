The driver also died. Witnesses said the vehicle appeared to be moving at high speed; another witness told the New York Daily News, “My truck is totaled, but I still have my life. I&rsquo;m just grateful that something moved me out of the way.” (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/astoria-queens-killed-crash-food-truck/>NY Daily News</a>; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/08/12/us-news/two-nyc-food-truck-customers-elderly-driver-killed-in-tragic-caught-on-video-horror/>New York Post</a>). Police continue to investigate.</p><h3 id=the-pattern>The pattern</h3><p>Since 2022, AD 34’s streets have logged 15 deaths and 19 serious injuries, according to city crash data. The morning rush is deadly: the 8 a.m. hour alone shows five deaths. Northern Boulevard and 42nd Street stand out as repeat hotspots. For people on foot, cars and SUVs account for most fatalities (seven deaths); trucks and buses account for one. Records show driver inattention/distraction and disregarded traffic control among the leading contributing factors in local crashes. (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=what-your-assembly-member-has-done>What your Assembly Member has done</h3><p>Assembly Member Jessica González‑Rojas has pushed policy tools to rein in the most dangerous drivers. She co‑sponsors bills that would require intelligent speed‑assistance devices for repeat offenders (see <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">A 2299</a> and earlier <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">A 7979</a>). She voted yes on measures to preserve and clarify school‑zone speed protections (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>S 8344</a>). Locally, she backed DOT’s protected bike‑lane plan on 31st Street. After this crash she joined other local leaders calling for a 20 mph default citywide (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/12/speeding-senior-kills-self-and-two-pedestrians-in-astoria>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><h3 id=fix-what-we-can-now>Fix what we can now</h3><p>Start at the worst corners. Daylight Northern Boulevard and 42nd Street. Remove sightline blockers near food carts and auto shops. Add leading pedestrian intervals, concrete curb extensions and refuge islands. Harden turns and install protected bike lanes and continuous curbs where crowds gather. Target enforcement during the morning rush — automated cameras and stepped-up patrols where crashes cluster. These interventions are proven, local, and urgent. (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=political-solutions--local-to-citywide>Political solutions — local to citywide</h3><p>Two citywide fixes would amplify local gains. First: lower NYC’s default speed limit to 20 mph. Sammy’s Law and local advocacy give the city that power; leaders must use it now. Second: require intelligent speed‑assistance devices for habitual speeders — the bills in Albany (A 2299, A 7979) and related proposals aim at this. Local redesigns and targeted enforcement will save lives faster when paired with these citywide rules.

Show up for redesigns on Northern Boulevard, 42nd Street and 37th Avenue. Support daylighting, LPIs, hardened crossings and morning enforcement.

No daylighting near schools. No lower bike lane speed limits. No new e-bike rules. City and state leaders bickered. Streets stay dangerous. Pedestrians and cyclists remain exposed. The system failed them again.</p><p class=mb3>On May 9, 2025, during New York State’s $254-million budget negotiations, lawmakers rejected Governor Hochul’s proposed street safety measures. The legislature dropped a mandate for daylighting—banning parking at corners near elementary schools—deferring instead to New York City, where Council Member Julie Won’s universal daylighting bill faces opposition from the Department of Transportation. Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, herself a crash survivor, vowed to keep fighting for daylighting, saying, 'I think daylighting would have helped me.' Hochul’s proposals to let the city set lower bike lane speed limits and to reclassify heavy e-bikes as mopeds were also cut. Critics argued these would not address core safety issues. The Adams administration opposes a City Council bill for e-bike registration and plates, while State Sen. Jenifer Rajkumar’s state version would shift licensing to the DMV. As Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives put it, 'A daylighting requirement would have made intersections safer around elementary schools, and it’s disappointing that this provision was cut from the New York State budget.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The policy charges most drivers $9 to enter south of 60th Street during peak hours. The matter, titled 'Congestion pricing set to begin at midnight Sunday as federal judge clears path for Manhattan toll,' has drawn sharp lines. Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30, Queens) opposes the toll, warning, 'I don't know how my district is going to be impacted.' He fears more cars parking in Queens and unclear pollution risks. Council Member Kristy Marmorato (Bronx) calls it a 'cash grab.' In contrast, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez and Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas support the measure, citing cleaner air, safer streets, and transit upgrades. González-Rojas says, 'Congestion pricing isn't about penalizing anyone—it's about modernizing our transportation system and tackling climate change.'

This action fulfills a mandate from the 2021 MTA Bike Access bill. Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, who sponsored the law, said, "I'm excited about the ADA-accessible ramp on the Cross Bay Bridge and that cyclists and pedestrians can access this space... because we passed my legislation." The MTA also announced similar improvements for the Henry Hudson and Triboro Bridges. However, plans for the Verrazzano, Gil Hodges-Marine Parkway, Bronx-Whitestone, and Throgs Neck bridges remain uncertain. Cycling advocates praised the MTA’s progress but criticized its reluctance to consider lane conversions for safer, broader access. The new ramp removes a deadly barrier, but the fight for safe passage on all city bridges continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Residents spoke of fear, injury, and death. City officials promised enforcement and education. Advocates demanded safer streets, not criminalization. The crisis rolls on. Action lags.</p><p class=mb3>On June 11, 2024, Councilmember Shekar Krishnan (District 25) convened a town hall in Jackson Heights to address what he called a 'moped crisis.' The meeting followed a deadly year: a 75-year-old man killed by an e-bike, two injured in a dirt bike crash. Residents described near-misses and constant danger on the 34th Avenue open street. The matter, titled 'On Jackson Heights’ open street, NYC’s ‘moped crisis’ is in full throttle,' drew city officials, including DOT and Mayor Adams, who backed enforcement and moped registration. Krishnan slammed DOT’s reliance on signage, pushing instead for a dedicated micromobility lane. Delivery worker advocates opposed criminalization, demanding labor protections and safe infrastructure. Despite new signs and vehicle seizures, mopeds still speed through. The call for urgent, systemic change grows louder.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
