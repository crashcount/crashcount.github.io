The numbers are not just numbers. A 15-year-old, dead on 43rd Street. A 44-year-old woman, killed on 90th Street. A 39-year-old, ejected from a moped and left lifeless on 23rd Avenue. The street keeps its silence. The families do not.</p><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do the most harm.</strong> Three pedestrians killed by SUVs. One by a sedan. Trucks, bikes, mopeds—they all leave scars, but the weight of steel is what ends lives here. No helmet, no crosswalk, no daylight saves you when a driver does not see, or does not care.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-gaps>Leadership: Action and Gaps</h3><p>Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas has felt the pain herself. She was struck in a crosswalk, left with a broken arm. &ldquo;If we had universal daylighting—he could have seen me,&rdquo; she said, calling for safer streets and lower speed limits <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/07/queens-pol-recovering-from-broken-arm-bruises-after-driver-strikes-her-in-crosswalk>after her injury</a>. She has backed protected bike lanes, school speed zones, and the push for a citywide 20 mph limit. She co-sponsored bills to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting tech. She voted to extend speed cameras near schools, saying yes to laws that keep children alive.</p><p>But the crisis does not slow. <strong>One death this year, down from six last year.</strong> Two serious injuries, half of last year’s toll. Still, 278 people hurt since January. The street does not care about percentages. It cares about flesh and bone.</p><h3 id=the-next-fight-no-more-waiting>The Next Fight: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every delay is another body.</strong> The city can set a 20 mph limit now. It has not. The Stop Super Speeders Act sits in Albany. It has not passed. The protected bike lanes on 31st Street face pushback, but González-Rojas stands with them, saying they will &ldquo;protect pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers while making our streets safer and less congested&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/20/dot-stands-by-astoria-bike-lane-plan-despite-foes-childish-outbursts>in a joint letter</a>.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speeders be stopped.</strong> The street will not change itself. Only you can force their hand.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter, described as a call for a moratorium on car-related development, pits housing needs against car infrastructure. Council Member Julie Won supported the board, stating, "It should be a neighborhood rezoning instead of spot rezoning... we need to make it safer and more liveable." Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas also opposed the dealership, urging the space be used for affordable housing and highlighting dangerous driving by existing dealerships. Despite Borough President Donovan Richards' support for the rezoning, citing cycling and EV promotion, the application faces strong local resistance. The City Planning Commission now reviews the case, with a City Council vote possible. The board and electeds argue more cars mean more risk for pedestrians and cyclists on a deadly stretch.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, launched to comply with a 2019 law, mandates 150 miles of protected bus lanes by 2026—20 miles in 2022 alone. With two months left, only 5.4 miles were finished. González-Rojas declared, 'We demand to get our 20 miles of bus lanes.' The rally took place on Northern Boulevard, a corridor scarred by pedestrian deaths, including 9-year-old Giovanni Ampuero. His father spoke out: 'If you don’t improve the street, people are going to still get killed.' The Department of Transportation claims progress and a $900 million investment, but the pace lags. The city’s delay leaves vulnerable road users at risk, as deadly streets remain unchanged.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

On October 26, 2022, the MTA announced legal cycling on the Cross Bay Bridge, with sharrows painted on the path. The Henry Hudson Bridge will open to cyclists after a major renovation, expected by 2025. The MTA will award a contract for that work next year. Gonzalez-Rojas said, 'This is what we worked toward when...we introduced and passed the MTA Bike Access bill.' Bike New York’s Jon Orcutt called the move 'pretty good progress.' The MTA also plans to add bike parking at 37 subway stations and expand bike access near transit. The Verrazzano Bridge remains off-limits for now.

History shows slow progress.</p><p class=mb3>""Increasing access of cyclists to MTA bridges is a matter of environmental justice, public health, and labor justice,"" -- Jessica González-Rojas</p><p class=mb3>On May 27, 2022, the MTA announced a strategic action plan to improve bicycle, pedestrian, and micromobility access to its trains and facilities. This follows a state bill signed last year mandating better conditions for cyclists. The plan, still in development, aims to create 'equitable access to the transit system and support sustainable transportation modes.' MTA Chairman and CEO Janno Lieber said, 'We want to improve customer access to our environmentally friendly MTA services, however they get to their train or bus.' Queens Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas called bridge access 'a matter of environmental justice, public health, and labor justice.' The MTA has ended bike permits on LIRR and Metro-North and added bike parking at Grand Central, but its record on bike access remains mixed. The agency is now seeking public comment and has hired Sam Schwartz Engineering to help shape the plan.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
