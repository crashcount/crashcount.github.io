The driver also died. Witnesses said the vehicle appeared to be moving at high speed; another witness told the New York Daily News, “My truck is totaled, but I still have my life. I&rsquo;m just grateful that something moved me out of the way.” (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/astoria-queens-killed-crash-food-truck/>NY Daily News</a>; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/08/12/us-news/two-nyc-food-truck-customers-elderly-driver-killed-in-tragic-caught-on-video-horror/>New York Post</a>). Police continue to investigate.</p><h3 id=the-pattern>The pattern</h3><p>Since 2022, AD 34’s streets have logged 15 deaths and 19 serious injuries, according to city crash data. The morning rush is deadly: the 8 a.m. hour alone shows five deaths. Northern Boulevard and 42nd Street stand out as repeat hotspots. For people on foot, cars and SUVs account for most fatalities (seven deaths); trucks and buses account for one. Records show driver inattention/distraction and disregarded traffic control among the leading contributing factors in local crashes. (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=what-your-assembly-member-has-done>What your Assembly Member has done</h3><p>Assembly Member Jessica González‑Rojas has pushed policy tools to rein in the most dangerous drivers. She co‑sponsors bills that would require intelligent speed‑assistance devices for repeat offenders (see <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">A 2299</a> and earlier <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">A 7979</a>). She voted yes on measures to preserve and clarify school‑zone speed protections (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>S 8344</a>). Locally, she backed DOT’s protected bike‑lane plan on 31st Street. After this crash she joined other local leaders calling for a 20 mph default citywide (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/12/speeding-senior-kills-self-and-two-pedestrians-in-astoria>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><h3 id=fix-what-we-can-now>Fix what we can now</h3><p>Start at the worst corners. Daylight Northern Boulevard and 42nd Street. Remove sightline blockers near food carts and auto shops. Add leading pedestrian intervals, concrete curb extensions and refuge islands. Harden turns and install protected bike lanes and continuous curbs where crowds gather. Target enforcement during the morning rush — automated cameras and stepped-up patrols where crashes cluster. These interventions are proven, local, and urgent. (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=political-solutions--local-to-citywide>Political solutions — local to citywide</h3><p>Two citywide fixes would amplify local gains. First: lower NYC’s default speed limit to 20 mph. Sammy’s Law and local advocacy give the city that power; leaders must use it now. Second: require intelligent speed‑assistance devices for habitual speeders — the bills in Albany (A 2299, A 7979) and related proposals aim at this. Local redesigns and targeted enforcement will save lives faster when paired with these citywide rules.

Show up for redesigns on Northern Boulevard, 42nd Street and 37th Avenue. Support daylighting, LPIs, hardened crossings and morning enforcement.

Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>Governor Hochul’s 2023 state budget proposal, analyzed March 3, 2023, keeps New York State’s long-running refusal to match MTA funding under law 18-b. The budget, now under legislative review, forces New York City to cover a $500 million gap, while the state sits on an $8.7 billion surplus. The matter: 'Hochul's budget not only asks city residents to cover the largest chunk of the MTA's budget gap, but does so in part by continuing long-running practices that essentially under-fund the MTA by millions of dollars each year.' Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas and State Sen. Andrew Gounardes both object, demanding the state honor its legal obligations. Riders Alliance and Reinvent Albany condemn the austerity. With fare hikes looming and no service improvements, city transit riders—often pedestrians and cyclists—bear the brunt. The budget leaves vulnerable road users exposed, as transit stagnates and car dominance persists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as a call for a moratorium on car-related development, pits housing needs against car infrastructure. Council Member Julie Won supported the board, stating, "It should be a neighborhood rezoning instead of spot rezoning... we need to make it safer and more liveable." Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas also opposed the dealership, urging the space be used for affordable housing and highlighting dangerous driving by existing dealerships. Despite Borough President Donovan Richards' support for the rezoning, citing cycling and EV promotion, the application faces strong local resistance. The City Planning Commission now reviews the case, with a City Council vote possible. The board and electeds argue more cars mean more risk for pedestrians and cyclists on a deadly stretch.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

González-Rojas declared, 'We demand to get our 20 miles of bus lanes.' The rally took place on Northern Boulevard, a corridor scarred by pedestrian deaths, including 9-year-old Giovanni Ampuero. His father spoke out: 'If you don’t improve the street, people are going to still get killed.' The Department of Transportation claims progress and a $900 million investment, but the pace lags.
