She was struck by a driver while crossing 78th Street. She broke her arm. She called the intersection dangerous and said, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/07/queens-pol-recovering-from-broken-arm-bruises-after-driver-strikes-her-in-crosswalk>&ldquo;If we had universal daylighting—he could have seen me.&rdquo;</a> She pushed for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/23/this-years-mettle-the-push-for-sammys-law-begins-with-or-without-carl-heastie>Sammy’s Law</a> to let New York City lower speed limits. She called for more protected bike lanes and daylighting at every corner.</p><p>González-Rojas co-sponsored <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">bills to force speed-limiting tech on repeat offenders</a> and to require safer street design. She backed <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/06/13/the-albany-report-card-a-scoundrels-f>fare-free buses</a> and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/10/26/cyclists-will-finally-be-welcome-on-cross-bay-and-henry-hudson-bridges>better bike access on bridges</a>. She stood with advocates, but the deaths keep coming. Laws move slow. Cars move fast.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>No one should die for crossing the street. Call González-Rojas. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighting at every corner. Demand protected bike lanes and enforcement that stops reckless drivers before they kill. Do not wait for another child’s name on a sign.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The crash occurred at 4:09 a.m. The report explicitly lists 'Alcohol Involvement' as a contributing factor. The pickup was traveling straight ahead, while the sedan was also moving westbound. The police narrative states: 'A pickup struck a westbound sedan’s side. The front passenger, 29, belted and still, bled out in her seat. Airbag torn open. Harness tight across her chest.

The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified.' The vehicle sustained no damage and continued moving after the passenger was ejected. The victim suffered fatal head injuries and was found unconscious.

The police report lists 'Unsafe Speed' as the contributing factor for the driver.

The bill, which would let New York City control its own speed limits, stalled last year when Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie refused to allow a vote, despite majority support. Brooklyn Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, a strong supporter, noted, 'Even [lawmakers] who had City Council members from their districts supporting the bill were still not interested.' Queens Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas, recently injured by a driver, said, 'Had the car been going faster ... I might not be here.' Amy Cohen of Families for Safe Streets highlighted broad support: 'We have organizations from across the city supporting Sammy’s Law.' City data shows a 36% drop in pedestrian deaths after the 2014 speed limit reduction.

González-Rojas renewed her push for Sammy’s Law, which would let New York City set speed limits below 25 mph, and called for more protected bike lanes. She said, "I absolutely had the right of way.

The primary sponsor is Emily Gallagher (District 50), joined by co-sponsors Rebecca Seawright, Andrew Hevesi, Tony Simone, Jo Anne Simon, Patricia Fahy, Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, MaryJane Shimsky, Yudelka Tapia, Steven Raga, Anna Kelles, Robert C. Carroll, and Sarahana Shrestha. The bill cracks down on repeat offenders, forcing them to install technology that blocks speeding.

The session ended June 13, 2023, with most safety and transit measures stalled in committee or blocked from a vote. The matter summary reads: 'This year's legislative session in Albany was considered one of the worst for livable streets and street safety, largely due to the failure to pass key bills such as Sammy's Law.' Council members and advocates like Eric McClure, Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, Amy Cohen, and Sara Lind voiced anger and disappointment. McClure said, 'We have to give the state legislature an 'F' for wasting an entire session without advancing legislation to make streets safer or to improve public transit.' The Assembly’s inaction left vulnerable road users exposed. Only increased MTA funding and a free bus pilot moved forward.

The budget, now under legislative review, forces New York City to cover a $500 million gap, while the state sits on an $8.7 billion surplus. The matter: 'Hochul's budget not only asks city residents to cover the largest chunk of the MTA's budget gap, but does so in part by continuing long-running practices that essentially under-fund the MTA by millions of dollars each year.' Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas and State Sen. Andrew Gounardes both object, demanding the state honor its legal obligations. Riders Alliance and Reinvent Albany condemn the austerity. With fare hikes looming and no service improvements, city transit riders—often pedestrians and cyclists—bear the brunt.

Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas also opposed the dealership, urging the space be used for affordable housing and highlighting dangerous driving by existing dealerships. Despite Borough President Donovan Richards' support for the rezoning, citing cycling and EV promotion, the application faces strong local resistance.
