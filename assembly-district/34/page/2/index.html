The driver also died. Witnesses said the vehicle appeared to be moving at high speed; another witness told the New York Daily News, “My truck is totaled, but I still have my life. I&rsquo;m just grateful that something moved me out of the way.” (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/astoria-queens-killed-crash-food-truck/>NY Daily News</a>; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/08/12/us-news/two-nyc-food-truck-customers-elderly-driver-killed-in-tragic-caught-on-video-horror/>New York Post</a>). Police continue to investigate.</p><h3 id=the-pattern>The pattern</h3><p>Since 2022, AD 34’s streets have logged 15 deaths and 19 serious injuries, according to city crash data. The morning rush is deadly: the 8 a.m. hour alone shows five deaths. Northern Boulevard and 42nd Street stand out as repeat hotspots. For people on foot, cars and SUVs account for most fatalities (seven deaths); trucks and buses account for one. Records show driver inattention/distraction and disregarded traffic control among the leading contributing factors in local crashes. (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=what-your-assembly-member-has-done>What your Assembly Member has done</h3><p>Assembly Member Jessica González‑Rojas has pushed policy tools to rein in the most dangerous drivers. She co‑sponsors bills that would require intelligent speed‑assistance devices for repeat offenders (see <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">A 2299</a> and earlier <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">A 7979</a>). She voted yes on measures to preserve and clarify school‑zone speed protections (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>S 8344</a>). Locally, she backed DOT’s protected bike‑lane plan on 31st Street. After this crash she joined other local leaders calling for a 20 mph default citywide (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/12/speeding-senior-kills-self-and-two-pedestrians-in-astoria>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><h3 id=fix-what-we-can-now>Fix what we can now</h3><p>Start at the worst corners. Daylight Northern Boulevard and 42nd Street. Remove sightline blockers near food carts and auto shops. Add leading pedestrian intervals, concrete curb extensions and refuge islands. Harden turns and install protected bike lanes and continuous curbs where crowds gather. Target enforcement during the morning rush — automated cameras and stepped-up patrols where crashes cluster. These interventions are proven, local, and urgent. (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=political-solutions--local-to-citywide>Political solutions — local to citywide</h3><p>Two citywide fixes would amplify local gains. First: lower NYC’s default speed limit to 20 mph. Sammy’s Law and local advocacy give the city that power; leaders must use it now. Second: require intelligent speed‑assistance devices for habitual speeders — the bills in Albany (A 2299, A 7979) and related proposals aim at this. Local redesigns and targeted enforcement will save lives faster when paired with these citywide rules.

Show up for redesigns on Northern Boulevard, 42nd Street and 37th Avenue. Support daylighting, LPIs, hardened crossings and morning enforcement.

At a 'Moped Crisis' town hall, Krishnan called the area a 'moped highway' and said, 'The biggest problem that we have is poor design by the DOT.' He demanded a redesign that separates speeding vehicles from people and creates safe corridors for mopeds away from recreational spaces. Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas echoed the call for engineering solutions, stating, 'We must design the roads to ensure that mopeds are not getting on [Paseo Park], and are not driving recklessly.' DOT staff highlighted enforcement efforts, but Krishnan and others insisted that design, not enforcement, must come first. DOT claims a drop in pedestrian crashes, but the current layout leaves pedestrians and cyclists exposed to danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Kruger said, 'My bill makes sure we know who is selling mopeds.' González-Rojas added, 'The bill will help alleviate some of the challenges we see around mopeds.' Advocates like Ligia Guallpa of the Workers Justice Project support enforcement at the point of sale, noting many dealers are unlicensed.

The police report cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the primary contributing factor.

No evidence in the report attributes any contributing actions to the victim; the only cited factor is the inattention of the chassis cab driver.

Assemblymember Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas stressed urgency, citing recent deaths. Brooklyn Councilmember Lincoln Restler pledged to push the measure forward. Advocates like Transportation Alternatives called for a citywide approach, not piecemeal action. The Department of Transportation thanked lawmakers but did not commit to a timeline.

The police report lists 'Unsafe Speed' as the contributing factor for the driver. The report also notes the pedestrian was 'Crossing Against Signal,' but this is mentioned only after the driver’s excessive speed is cited.

The bill, which would let New York City control its own speed limits, stalled last year when Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie refused to allow a vote, despite majority support. Brooklyn Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, a strong supporter, noted, 'Even [lawmakers] who had City Council members from their districts supporting the bill were still not interested.' Queens Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas, recently injured by a driver, said, 'Had the car been going faster ... I might not be here.' Amy Cohen of Families for Safe Streets highlighted broad support: 'We have organizations from across the city supporting Sammy’s Law.' City data shows a 36% drop in pedestrian deaths after the 2014 speed limit reduction.

No safety analyst note is available, but the intent is clear: rein in repeat offenders, protect those outside the car.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the driver suffered a broken back and an amputation but remained conscious. The report lists 'Driver Inexperience,' 'Following Too Closely,' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as contributing factors. The parked Mazdas and Fords did not move; the impact came from the moving sedan. The police report notes the driver wore a lap belt. No pedestrians or cyclists were involved. The crash left the driver with severe injuries, underscoring the risks posed by inattention and inexperience behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The opposition comes from members who might have more car-centered districts and may be more transportation deserts. They argue that this would create traffic and their constituents hate it, but there's a misunderstanding of the bill, because it gives basically the discretion to the city."" -- Jessica González-Rojas</p><p class=mb3>In the 2023 legislative session, Albany lawmakers failed to pass major street safety bills, including Sammy’s Law (which would let New York City set its own speed limits). The session ended June 13, 2023, with most safety and transit measures stalled in committee or blocked from a vote. The matter summary reads: 'This year's legislative session in Albany was considered one of the worst for livable streets and street safety, largely due to the failure to pass key bills such as Sammy's Law.' Council members and advocates like Eric McClure, Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, Amy Cohen, and Sara Lind voiced anger and disappointment. McClure said, 'We have to give the state legislature an 'F' for wasting an entire session without advancing legislation to make streets safer or to improve public transit.' The Assembly’s inaction left vulnerable road users exposed. Only increased MTA funding and a free bus pilot moved forward. The rest—protection for cyclists, pedestrians, and bus riders—died in committee.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
