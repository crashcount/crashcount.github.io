Two children died before they could grow up. A woman was killed crossing 37th Avenue. A 23-year-old man was thrown from a car on Northern Boulevard and did not get up again.

The report states: 'A 23-year-old man, rear seat of a 2015 Nissan SUV, was thrown from the car. Head shattered. Body twisted. The SUV rolled on, untouched. He never woke up.' The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified.' The vehicle sustained no damage and continued moving after the passenger was ejected. The victim suffered fatal head injuries and was found unconscious. No driver errors are specified in the report, but the ejection and death of a rear seat passenger underscore the lethal risks present for vehicle occupants.

The report states the SUV was traveling at an 'Unsafe Speed.' The narrative describes the vehicle coming fast, with the impact causing fatal injuries to the pedestrian, who died before emergency responders arrived. The police report lists 'Unsafe Speed' as the contributing factor for the driver. The report also notes the pedestrian was 'Crossing Against Signal,' but this is mentioned only after the driver’s excessive speed is cited.

The bill, which would let New York City control its own speed limits, stalled last year when Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie refused to allow a vote, despite majority support. Brooklyn Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, a strong supporter, noted, 'Even [lawmakers] who had City Council members from their districts supporting the bill were still not interested.' Queens Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas, recently injured by a driver, said, 'Had the car been going faster ... I might not be here.' Amy Cohen of Families for Safe Streets highlighted broad support: 'We have organizations from across the city supporting Sammy’s Law.' City data shows a 36% drop in pedestrian deaths after the 2014 speed limit reduction. The bill remains in limbo, but advocates are not backing down.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She stated, "If we had universal daylighting—he could have seen me." González-Rojas renewed her push for Sammy’s Law, which would let New York City set speed limits below 25 mph, and called for more protected bike lanes. She said, "I absolutely had the right of way.

The primary sponsor is Emily Gallagher (District 50), joined by co-sponsors Rebecca Seawright, Andrew Hevesi, Tony Simone, Jo Anne Simon, Patricia Fahy, Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, MaryJane Shimsky, Yudelka Tapia, Steven Raga, Anna Kelles, Robert C.

McClure said, 'We have to give the state legislature an 'F' for wasting an entire session without advancing legislation to make streets safer or to improve public transit.'

The budget, now under legislative review, forces New York City to cover a $500 million gap, while the state sits on an $8.7 billion surplus. The matter: 'Hochul's budget not only asks city residents to cover the largest chunk of the MTA's budget gap, but does so in part by continuing long-running practices that essentially under-fund the MTA by millions of dollars each year.' Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas and State Sen. Andrew Gounardes both object, demanding the state honor its legal obligations. Riders Alliance and Reinvent Albany condemn the austerity. With fare hikes looming and no service improvements, city transit riders—often pedestrians and cyclists—bear the brunt.

The fight moves to City Planning.</p><p class=mb3>On November 7, 2022, Queens Community Board 2 passed a resolution rejecting a rezoning application for a Lincoln SUV dealership on Northern Boulevard, Woodside. The matter, described as a call for a moratorium on car-related development, pits housing needs against car infrastructure. Council Member Julie Won supported the board, stating, "It should be a neighborhood rezoning instead of spot rezoning... we need to make it safer and more liveable." Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas also opposed the dealership, urging the space be used for affordable housing and highlighting dangerous driving by existing dealerships. Despite Borough President Donovan Richards' support for the rezoning, citing cycling and EV promotion, the application faces strong local resistance. The City Planning Commission now reviews the case, with a City Council vote possible. The board and electeds argue more cars mean more risk for pedestrians and cyclists on a deadly stretch.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates and Assemblymember Jessica González-Rojas rally on Northern Boulevard. Only 5.4 miles built, far short of the 20-mile goal. The city stalls. Streets stay deadly. Families mourn. The clock runs out.</p><p class=mb3>On November 1, 2022, Assemblymember Jessica González-Rojas joined advocates in Jackson Heights to demand faster bus lane construction under the New York City Streets Plan. The plan, launched to comply with a 2019 law, mandates 150 miles of protected bus lanes by 2026—20 miles in 2022 alone. With two months left, only 5.4 miles were finished. González-Rojas declared, 'We demand to get our 20 miles of bus lanes.' The rally took place on Northern Boulevard, a corridor scarred by pedestrian deaths, including 9-year-old Giovanni Ampuero. His father spoke out: 'If you don’t improve the street, people are going to still get killed.' The Department of Transportation claims progress and a $900 million investment, but the pace lags. The city’s delay leaves vulnerable road users at risk, as deadly streets remain unchanged.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

On October 26, 2022, the MTA announced legal cycling on the Cross Bay Bridge, with sharrows painted on the path. The Henry Hudson Bridge will open to cyclists after a major renovation, expected by 2025. The MTA will award a contract for that work next year. Gonzalez-Rojas said, 'This is what we worked toward when...we introduced and passed the MTA Bike Access bill.' Bike New York’s Jon Orcutt called the move 'pretty good progress.' The MTA also plans to add bike parking at 37 subway stations and expand bike access near transit. The Verrazzano Bridge remains off-limits for now. The announcement marks a step forward, but cyclists still face barriers and delays.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
