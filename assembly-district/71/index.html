Sixteen left with serious injuries.</strong> In just the last twelve months, three more dead, five more lives shattered. Cyclists, pedestrians, children. The street does not care how old you are. A man on a bike, thrown headfirst. A 76-year-old crossing Broadway, struck down. A crash on the parkway—two dead, one left broken. The city moves on. The blood stays in the cracks.</p><h2 id=the-silence-and-the-votes>The Silence and the Votes</h2><p><strong>Al Taylor has not stood in the way of safety.</strong> He co-sponsored bills to make streets safer for everyone, not just drivers.

State law blocks quick action. Critics slam the plan as unfair and toothless. Police already target cyclists. Enforcement and real change remain distant. Streets stay risky.</p><p class=mb3>West Side Spirit (2025-06-19) reports that despite Mayor Eric Adams's proposal for a 15 mph speed limit on e-bikes, shops in Manhattan still advertise illegal speed modifications. Adams admits the plan is 'an idea' needing state approval and a lengthy rulemaking process. Critics like Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives call the proposal 'half-baked and ill-conceived,' arguing it unfairly targets cyclists while drivers face lesser consequences for greater harm. Janet Schroeder of the NYC E-Bike Safety Alliance doubts the limit will matter without enforcement: 'The 15 mph speed limit does nothing.' The NYPD already issues thousands of criminal summonses to cyclists for minor infractions. The article highlights the policy gap and enforcement challenges, with no immediate relief for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
