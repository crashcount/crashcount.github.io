State law blocks quick action. Critics slam the plan as unfair and toothless. Police already target cyclists. Enforcement and real change remain distant. Streets stay risky.</p><p class=mb3>West Side Spirit (2025-06-19) reports that despite Mayor Eric Adams's proposal for a 15 mph speed limit on e-bikes, shops in Manhattan still advertise illegal speed modifications. Adams admits the plan is 'an idea' needing state approval and a lengthy rulemaking process. Critics like Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives call the proposal 'half-baked and ill-conceived,' arguing it unfairly targets cyclists while drivers face lesser consequences for greater harm. Janet Schroeder of the NYC E-Bike Safety Alliance doubts the limit will matter without enforcement: 'The 15 mph speed limit does nothing.' The NYPD already issues thousands of criminal summonses to cyclists for minor infractions.

The measure extends and corrects school speed zone laws in New York City, repealing outdated provisions. Gounardes led the push, with strong support from most Senate Democrats and a split Assembly.
