Sixteen left with serious injuries.</strong> In just the last twelve months, three more dead, five more lives shattered. Cyclists, pedestrians, children. The street does not care how old you are. A man on a bike, thrown headfirst. A 76-year-old crossing Broadway, struck down. A crash on the parkway—two dead, one left broken. The city moves on. The blood stays in the cracks.</p><h2 id=the-silence-and-the-votes>The Silence and the Votes</h2><p><strong>Al Taylor has not stood in the way of safety.</strong> He co-sponsored bills to make streets safer for everyone, not just drivers.

He voted yes on <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">school speed cameras</a>, a small shield for children walking to class. But the work is not done. The dead do not care about bills that sit in committee. The injured do not heal because a law is &ldquo;in sponsorship.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits.

Mayor Eric Adams said, "there’s going to be a whole rule making process to make sure that we comply and follow the laws." Critics argue the plan singles out e-bikes while ignoring faster, heavier vehicles. Ben Furans of Transportation Alternatives called it "half-baked and ill-conceived," noting that "bikes and cars sharing the same road would be subject to different speed limits and consequences." Janet Schroeder of the E-Bike Safety Alliance doubts the rule will matter without real enforcement. The NYPD already issues thousands of criminal summonses to cyclists for minor violations, raising questions about fair and effective policy.
