According to the police report, both vehicles were 'making right turn' when they crashed. The report explicitly cites 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Turning Improperly' as contributing factors. The narrative describes the scene: 'Steel kissed steel. The Honda's side split. The BMW's nose crushed. Two young men, both 22, slumped inside, heads bleeding. Semiconscious. Silent. The speed still echoed in the wreckage.' The data shows both drivers were licensed and neither occupant was ejected. The focus remains on driver actions—unsafe speed and improper turning—as the root causes of this violent crash.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
