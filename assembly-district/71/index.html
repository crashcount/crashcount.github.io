Sixteen left with serious injuries.</strong> In just the last twelve months, three more dead, five more lives shattered. Cyclists, pedestrians, children. The street does not care how old you are. A man on a bike, thrown headfirst. A 76-year-old crossing Broadway, struck down. A crash on the parkway—two dead, one left broken. The city moves on. The blood stays in the cracks.</p><h2 id=the-silence-and-the-votes>The Silence and the Votes</h2><p><strong>Al Taylor has not stood in the way of safety.</strong> He co-sponsored bills to make streets safer for everyone, not just drivers. He backed <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">A 1077</a> and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1280&amp;term=2023">A 1280</a>, both demanding streets built for people. He voted yes on <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">school speed cameras</a>, a small shield for children walking to class. But the work is not done. The dead do not care about bills that sit in committee. The injured do not heal because a law is &ldquo;in sponsorship.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has the tools to redesign streets. But the pace is slow. The pain is fast. &ldquo;They could&rsquo;ve helped get him out, get him assistance,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/surveillance-video-nypd-officers-fiery-crash-inwood/>said Carmen Colon</a> after a man burned in his car while officers drove away. &ldquo;No help was offered, and then how long he burned for. It was a lot,&rdquo; <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/video-nypd-pursuit-shows-cops-abandoning-site-deadly-crash>said Shakira Guzman</a>. The system failed. The street stayed the same.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Al Taylor. Call the council. Demand speed limits that save lives. Demand streets that protect the people who walk and ride. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
