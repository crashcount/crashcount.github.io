At a June 2023 NY1 debate, Dickens said, 'I do not support it,' arguing that speeders will speed regardless. She also rejected more bike lanes, congestion pricing, bus improvements, and traffic calming. The matter summary states: 'Assembly Member Inez Dickens...does not support lowering the speed limit.' Her challengers, Assembly Member Al Taylor and Yusef Salaam, support Sammy’s Law and more bike lanes. Mayor Adams, a supporter of Sammy’s Law, has endorsed Dickens. Dickens’s stance blocks proven safety measures for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit riders.

On June 7, 2023, Governor Hochul expressed sympathy for hunger-striking mothers but refused to pressure Speaker Carl Heastie, who blocks the bill from a vote. The bill passed the Senate and has City Council and mayoral support. The matter summary: 'Hochul has previously expressed support for Sammy's Law, which would allow New York City to set its speed limits below 25 miles per hour.' Amy Cohen, a mother and advocate, demanded action, showing Heastie photos of victims. Seven new Assembly members, including Yudelka Tapia, Al Taylor, Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn, and Brian Cunningham, now back the bill, giving it majority support among NYC Assembly members.
