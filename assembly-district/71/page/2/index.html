Sixteen left with serious injuries.</strong> In just the last twelve months, three more dead, five more lives shattered. Cyclists, pedestrians, children. The street does not care how old you are. A man on a bike, thrown headfirst. A 76-year-old crossing Broadway, struck down. A crash on the parkway—two dead, one left broken. The city moves on. The blood stays in the cracks.</p><h2 id=the-silence-and-the-votes>The Silence and the Votes</h2><p><strong>Al Taylor has not stood in the way of safety.</strong> He co-sponsored bills to make streets safer for everyone, not just drivers. He backed <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1077&amp;term=2025">A 1077</a> and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A1280&amp;term=2023">A 1280</a>, both demanding streets built for people. He voted yes on <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">school speed cameras</a>, a small shield for children walking to class. But the work is not done. The dead do not care about bills that sit in committee. The injured do not heal because a law is &ldquo;in sponsorship.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has the tools to redesign streets. But the pace is slow.

It was a lot,&rdquo; <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/video-nypd-pursuit-shows-cops-abandoning-site-deadly-crash>said Shakira Guzman</a>. The system failed. The street stayed the same.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Al Taylor. Call the council. Demand speed limits that save lives. Demand streets that protect the people who walk and ride. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Amy Cohen, a mother and advocate, demanded action, showing Heastie photos of victims. Seven new Assembly members, including Yudelka Tapia, Al Taylor, Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn, and Brian Cunningham, now back the bill, giving it majority support among NYC Assembly members.
