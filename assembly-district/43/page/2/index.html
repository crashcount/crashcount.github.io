An SUV hit him. He died there, dragged from under the car by a woman as blood ran from his ears and mouth. &ldquo;I saw the kid being dragged from underneath the car by a woman,&rdquo; a witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/boy-fatally-struck-honda-suv-driver-crown-heights-brooklyn/>said</a>.</p><p>Just days later, a 90-year-old man was killed by a moped in a hit-and-run. Security video caught the moment. The driver fled. The man died at the hospital, as <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/90-year-old-man-killed-in-hit-and-run-in-brooklyn-involving-moped/>reported</a>.</p><p><strong>In the last 12 months, three people have died and over 500 have been injured on these streets.</strong> Children, elders, men, women. No one is spared. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.</p><h2 id=the-numbers-behind-the-names>The Numbers Behind the Names</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> In this district, they have killed three, seriously injured thirteen, and left hundreds more with wounds. Trucks and buses have hurt and maimed. Motorcycles and mopeds add to the toll. Bikes, too, but the numbers are small. The street is a battlefield, and the most vulnerable lose.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-taken-steps-needed>Leadership: Steps Taken, Steps Needed</h2><p>Assembly Member Brian Cunningham has backed some safety bills. He co-sponsored measures for complete street design, advanced vehicle safety tech, and automated bike lane enforcement. He voted yes on school speed cameras. He supported <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/06/07/hunger-strike-day-2-gov-hochul-is-sympathetic-but-wont-pressure-heastie-on-sammys-law>Sammy’s Law</a>, giving NYC the power to lower speed limits. He called for scramble crosswalks near schools. But the carnage continues. &ldquo;Sometimes we can’t account for whether or not the trucks actually got down the block, or whether or not cars are obstructing them,&rdquo; Cunningham <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/25/d-minus-the-annual-albany-report-card-for-2025>told Streetsblog</a>. &ldquo;That destroys our catch basins because they don’t get clean.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>The laws are not enough. The deaths do not stop.</strong></p><h2 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Every day without action is another day someone dies.</strong> Call Assembly Member Cunningham. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people walking and biking. Demand streets that do not kill children and elders.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another body in the road. Act now.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Seven new Assembly members, including Yudelka Tapia, Al Taylor, Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn, and Brian Cunningham, now back the bill, giving it majority support among NYC Assembly members.
