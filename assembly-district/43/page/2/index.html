The resolution urges the New York State Legislature and Governor to pass A.5001-A/S.2515-B, which would require scramble crosswalks at intersections near schools during student arrival and dismissal. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, A.5001-A/S.2515-B, in relation to establishing scramble crosswalks leading to and from school buildings during times of student arrival and dismissal.' Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary), Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, Lincoln Restler, and Kevin C. Riley sponsored the measure. The bill responds to persistent crashes near schools and the loss of hundreds of crossing guards. Scramble crosswalks, also called Barnes Dances, stop all traffic so pedestrians cross in every direction.

Hochul offers sympathy, not action. Heastie keeps the bill off the floor. The law would let New York City lower speed limits. Assembly support grows. Vulnerable road users wait. Streets stay deadly. Lawmakers stall. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>Sammy’s Law, stalled in the New York State Assembly, would let New York City set speed limits below 25 mph. On June 7, 2023, Governor Hochul expressed sympathy for hunger-striking mothers but refused to pressure Speaker Carl Heastie, who blocks the bill from a vote. The bill passed the Senate and has City Council and mayoral support. The matter summary: 'Hochul has previously expressed support for Sammy's Law, which would allow New York City to set its speed limits below 25 miles per hour.' Amy Cohen, a mother and advocate, demanded action, showing Heastie photos of victims. Seven new Assembly members, including Yudelka Tapia, Al Taylor, Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn, and Brian Cunningham, now back the bill, giving it majority support among NYC Assembly members. Still, the Speaker’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed to speeding drivers and systemic danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
