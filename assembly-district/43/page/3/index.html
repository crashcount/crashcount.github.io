He was eight. The SUV kept going. The street stayed the same. In the last twelve months, three people have died on the roads of Assembly District 43. Thirteen more suffered serious injuries. Children, elders, men and women—no one is spared. In the same year, over 700 people were hurt in crashes here. The numbers do not stop. They do not slow down.</p><p>Neighbors see the danger. After a hit-and-run killed two men, a resident said, &ldquo;drivers speed on that stretch of roadway&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>CBS New York</a>). The dead do not speak. The living are left to watch the road and wait.</p><h2 id=leadership-words-votes-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Words, Votes, and Missed Chances</h2><p>Assembly Member Brian Cunningham has backed some bills for safer streets. He co-sponsored measures for complete street design and bike lane enforcement. He voted to fund safer street designs and driver education. He also supported a bill to require advanced vehicle safety tech. But when it mattered most, he was not there. In June, Cunningham missed the committee vote on the bill to extend school speed zone protections (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Open States</a>). The bill passed, but the absence is on record.</p><p>Cunningham has also voted to weaken bus lane rules, a move that puts more people at risk. The record is mixed. The streets are not safe. The work is not done.</p><h2 id=the-system-grinds-on>The System Grinds On</h2><p>The cars keep coming. In three years, over 4,000 crashes have torn through this district. Seven dead. Thirty-eight seriously hurt. Most of the pain comes from cars and SUVs. Trucks, motorcycles, mopeds, bikes—they all play a part, but the big machines do the most harm (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>A neighbor’s words hang in the air: &ldquo;drivers speed on that stretch of roadway&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>CBS New York</a>). The city moves slow. The blood dries fast.</p><p>Call your Assembly Member. Call your Council Member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for every child and elder who walks these streets. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
