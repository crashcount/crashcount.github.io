He was eight. The SUV kept going. The street stayed the same. In the last twelve months, three people have died on the roads of Assembly District 43. Thirteen more suffered serious injuries. Children, elders, men and women—no one is spared. In the same year, over 700 people were hurt in crashes here. The numbers do not stop. They do not slow down.</p><p>Neighbors see the danger. After a hit-and-run killed two men, a resident said, &ldquo;drivers speed on that stretch of roadway&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>CBS New York</a>). The dead do not speak. The living are left to watch the road and wait.</p><h2 id=leadership-words-votes-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Words, Votes, and Missed Chances</h2><p>Assembly Member Brian Cunningham has backed some bills for safer streets. He co-sponsored measures for complete street design and bike lane enforcement. He voted to fund safer street designs and driver education. He also supported a bill to require advanced vehicle safety tech. But when it mattered most, he was not there. In June, Cunningham missed the committee vote on the bill to extend school speed zone protections (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Open States</a>). The bill passed, but the absence is on record.</p><p>Cunningham has also voted to weaken bus lane rules, a move that puts more people at risk. The record is mixed. The streets are not safe. The work is not done.</p><h2 id=the-system-grinds-on>The System Grinds On</h2><p>The cars keep coming. In three years, over 4,000 crashes have torn through this district. Seven dead. Thirty-eight seriously hurt. Most of the pain comes from cars and SUVs. Trucks, motorcycles, mopeds, bikes—they all play a part, but the big machines do the most harm (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>A neighbor’s words hang in the air: &ldquo;drivers speed on that stretch of roadway&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>CBS New York</a>). The city moves slow. The blood dries fast.</p><p>Call your Assembly Member. Call your Council Member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for every child and elder who walks these streets. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>""Sometimes we can’t account for whether or not the trucks actually got down the block, or whether or not cars are obstructing them," Cunningham told Streetsblog. "That destroys our catch basins because they don’t get clean."" -- Brian Cunningham</p><p class=mb3>The 2025 Albany legislative session ended June 25, with lawmakers failing to pass key street safety bills. The Streetsblog NYC report reads: "Our elected officials in Albany have failed the livable streets movement again." Despite support for measures like speed camera reauthorization, most bills to protect pedestrians and cyclists died in committee or never reached the floor. Assembly Member Amy Sohn and others criticized the lack of action. The only major win was extending the city’s speed camera program. A safety analyst notes: 'Failure to advance livable streets policies likely maintains the status quo, which typically prioritizes car-centric infrastructure and neglects the safety and needs of pedestrians and cyclists.' The session’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users at risk. No progress. No protection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
