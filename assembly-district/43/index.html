Thirty-two left with injuries that will never heal.</strong> In the last three years, Assembly District 43 has seen 3,816 crashes. The dead include children, elders, and the nameless. An eight-year-old boy, struck by an SUV at Eastern Parkway and Albany Avenue, never made it home. A 101-year-old woman, crossing with the signal, killed by a left-turning SUV. A 90-year-old man, hit by a moped, died in the hospital. These are not numbers. They are empty chairs at dinner tables.</p><p><strong>The violence does not stop.</strong> Just last week, two men died crossing a Brooklyn street. The car did not stop. Neighbors spoke plain: <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>drivers speed on that stretch of roadway.</a> The city moves on. The street stays the same.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-bills-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Votes, Bills, and Missed Chances</h3><p>Assembly Member Brian Cunningham has backed some safety bills. He co-sponsored measures for <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A4637&amp;term=2023">bike lane cameras</a>, <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A324&amp;term=2025">complete streets</a>, and <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2642&amp;term=2025">advanced vehicle safety tech</a>. He voted to fund safer street designs. But when it mattered most—when the Assembly voted to extend school speed zone protections—<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>he missed the vote</a>. The bill passed, but not with his help.</p><p>Cunningham has spoken about blocked trucks and dirty streets, but not about the bodies in the crosswalk. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/25/d-minus-the-annual-albany-report-card-for-2025>“Sometimes we can’t account for whether or not the trucks actually got down the block, or whether or not cars are obstructing them,”</a> he told Streetsblog. The catch basins get more attention than the children.</p><h3 id=the-road-ahead-action-or-more-names-on-stone>The Road Ahead: Action or More Names on Stone</h3><p><strong>Most deaths here come from cars and SUVs.</strong> They kill, they maim, and they keep rolling. Laws that sound good on paper mean nothing if leaders do not show up to vote, or if they water down rules for bus lanes and enforcement. The city has the power to lower speed limits. The Assembly can pass laws to stop repeat speeders. But every delay is another name on a slab.</p><p><strong>Call your leaders. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against reckless drivers.</strong> Do not wait for another child’s shoes left in the street. The blood is fresh.

"That destroys our catch basins because they don’t get clean."" -- Brian Cunningham</p><p class=mb3>The 2025 Albany legislative session ended June 25, with lawmakers failing to pass key street safety bills. The Streetsblog NYC report reads: "Our elected officials in Albany have failed the livable streets movement again." Despite support for measures like speed camera reauthorization, most bills to protect pedestrians and cyclists died in committee or never reached the floor. Assembly Member Amy Sohn and others criticized the lack of action. The only major win was extending the city’s speed camera program. A safety analyst notes: 'Failure to advance livable streets policies likely maintains the status quo, which typically prioritizes car-centric infrastructure and neglects the safety and needs of pedestrians and cyclists.' The session’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users at risk. No progress.

Liz Krueger (District 28) and other lawmakers responded to a proposed New York City tax hike meant to replace the indefinitely postponed $15 congestion pricing tolls. The measure, debated as Bill 28, has not advanced in committee and faces strong opposition. The matter, described as 'a last-minute funding move that drew fierce opposition,' has Krueger stating, 'I think it does not have support.' Assemblyman Brian Cunningham echoed, 'No new taxes.' The proposal would raise the payroll mobility tax, already increased last year, to fund the MTA. Rep. Jerry Nadler and business groups argue the tax unfairly targets NYC, while congestion pricing would have spread costs regionally. With the legislative session ending, MTA projects remain at risk.
