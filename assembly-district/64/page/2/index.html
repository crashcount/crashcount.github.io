One segment logged <strong>4 deaths and 165 injuries</strong>; another saw <strong>1 death and 305 injuries</strong> over this period. Richmond Road added <strong>129 injuries</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Drivers turning left killed a 57‑year‑old woman at Hylan and Jefferson. A 64‑year‑old woman died after a left‑turning SUV on Mason Avenue crushed her crossing path (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data – CrashID 4771158</a>, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4777953</a>).</p><p>Confusing bus lane signs along Hylan help set up crashes. “That’s one accident every four days,” said Borough President Vito Fossella about drivers who think they must turn from the middle lane (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/bus-lanes-staten-island-hylan-boulevard/>amNY</a>).

Police say the car driver was drunk and unlicensed. “He never stopped working,” said the victim’s brother. “He had a lot of love for his family” (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>NY Daily News</a>, <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/woman-charged-with-driving-while-intoxicated-without-license-in-fatal-brooklyn-crash>Gothamist</a>).

While crashes multiply, the paper trail from Albany and City Hall runs thin.</p><p>Assembly Member Mike Tannousis sponsored <strong><a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A6680&amp;term=2025">A 6680</a></strong> to repeal congestion pricing. He voted no on school‑zone safety bills <strong><a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S5677>S 5677</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">A 7652</a></strong>, and missed votes on <strong><a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S7678>S 7678</a></strong> and <strong><a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S7785>S 7785</a></strong>.

On a bill to extend and fix school speed‑zone law (<strong><a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>S 8344</a></strong>), he was excused (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Open States</a>).</p><p>Council Member David Carr and State Senator Jessica Scarcella‑Spanton represent this area too. The record above is clear for one officeholder. For the rest, the silence is its own entry.</p><h3 id=fix-what-kills-on-hylan-and-richmond>Fix what kills on Hylan and Richmond</h3><p>Start where people die: hardened left turns and daylighted corners at Hylan’s crossings; leading pedestrian intervals where walkers were hit in the crosswalk; clear, consistent bus‑lane signage to stop right turns from the middle lane (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/bus-lanes-staten-island-hylan-boulevard/>amNY</a>). Targeted failure‑to‑yield and distraction enforcement at the hot spots named here.</p><p>Then finish the job citywide. Lower the default speed limit.
