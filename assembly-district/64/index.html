Six people killed. Four left with injuries so grave they may never walk the same. In the last year alone, 567 hurt, 893 crashes. The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross the street. A man, 80, struck dead on Hylan Boulevard, a block from home. The driver stayed. The man did not. Police said, &ldquo;She was heading north on Hylan Blvd. when she struck the victim&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/10/staten-island-pedestrian-struck-suv-driver-block-from-home-chaosheng-wu/>NY Daily News</a>.</p><p>A 58-year-old man, Jose Luis Gomez-Guallazaca, killed by an e-scooter on Targee Street. He suffered &ldquo;severe trauma throughout his body&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/18/us-news/e-scooter-fatally-plows-into-pedestrian-on-nyc-street-cops/>New York Post</a>. The scooter rider survived. The city moved on.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p>SUVs and cars do most of the killing. In the past three years: 6 deaths, 256 injuries, 5 serious injuries from SUVs and cars alone. Trucks and buses: 1 dead, 29 hurt. Bikes: 0 dead, 11 hurt. The numbers do not lie. The street is not safe for those outside a car.</p><h2 id=what-has-mike-tannousis-done>What Has Mike Tannousis Done?</h2><p>Assembly Member Mike Tannousis has not led. He voted no on a bill to bring speed cameras to school zones in Schenectady—cameras proven to slow drivers and save children <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">A 7652</a>. He sponsored a bill to repeal congestion pricing, a move that would put more cars and more danger on city streets <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A6680&amp;term=2025">A 6680</a>. Not one bill to protect the people walking or biking in his district.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p>No one is coming to save you. Not unless you make them. Call Mike Tannousis. Demand action. Demand speed cameras, lower speed limits, and real street redesigns. Stand with the families who have lost everything. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The plan allows cameras on seven bridges and two tunnels, ticketing drivers who exceed speed limits. Fines start at $50 for a first offense, rising to $75 and $100 for repeat violations within 18 months. Governor Hochul's office called the program 'one more way the governor is working to improve safety on our roads and bridges for workers and travelers alike.' MTA Bridges and Tunnels President Catherine Sheridan said, 'We want to make sure that our maintenance workers and contractors are safe.' The program, part of the $254 billion state budget, will be reviewed again in 2031. The move targets driver speed, a key factor in crash severity, and signals a shift toward automated enforcement on major city crossings.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
