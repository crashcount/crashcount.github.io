Four left with injuries so grave they may never walk the same.</strong> In the last twelve months, 574 hurt, 913 crashes. The old and the young, no one spared. On Hylan Boulevard, an 80-year-old man tried to cross the street. He did not make it home. The driver stayed. The street stayed deadly. Police said they were &ldquo;still investigating how fast the woman was driving and what the traffic signals at the intersection were displaying at the time&rdquo; (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/driver-fatally-strikes-80-year-old-staten-island-man-a-block-from-his-home-police-say>Gothamist</a>).</p><p>A few months before, a 64-year-old woman was crushed by an SUV turning left. She was crossing. The driver failed to yield. The road did not forgive. The numbers keep rising. <strong>SUVs and trucks do most of the killing.</strong></p><h2 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h2><p>Assembly Member Mike Tannousis has not led on safety. He voted <strong>no</strong> on a bill to bring speed cameras to school zones in Schenectady—cameras that catch drivers who speed where children walk (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">A 7652</a>). He sponsored a bill to repeal congestion pricing, a move that would bring more cars, more danger, more blood to the street (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A6680&amp;term=2025">A 6680</a>). The bill does not mention the safety of those outside a car. It does not mention the dead. It does not mention the broken.</p><h2 id=the-work-left-undone>The Work Left Undone</h2><p>The city has tools. Speed cameras. Lower limits. Street redesigns. But in AD 64, the carnage continues. &ldquo;A driver struck and killed an 80-year-old man who was walking across a busy Staten Island street a block from his home, police said Monday&rdquo; (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/driver-fatally-strikes-80-year-old-staten-island-man-a-block-from-his-home-police-say>Gothamist</a>). The driver stayed. The street stayed the same.</p><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p>Call Assembly Member Tannousis. Call the council. Demand speed cameras, lower speed limits, and streets built for people, not just cars. <strong>Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The plan allows cameras on seven bridges and two tunnels, ticketing drivers who exceed speed limits. Fines start at $50 for a first offense, rising to $75 and $100 for repeat violations within 18 months. Governor Hochul's office called the program 'one more way the governor is working to improve safety on our roads and bridges for workers and travelers alike.' MTA Bridges and Tunnels President Catherine Sheridan said, 'We want to make sure that our maintenance workers and contractors are safe.' The program, part of the $254 billion state budget, will be reviewed again in 2031. The move targets driver speed, a key factor in crash severity, and signals a shift toward automated enforcement on major city crossings.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
