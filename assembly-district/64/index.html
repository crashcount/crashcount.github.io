Drivers turn from the wrong lane. Collisions mount. Bus lane rules shift by the hour. The street stays dangerous for those on foot and bike.</p><p class=mb3>According to amny (2025-08-05), collisions on Hylan Boulevard have risen due to unclear DOT signage about bus lane hours. Borough President Vito Fossella noted, “That’s one accident every four days where somebody perhaps unwittingly thinks they must turn from the middle lane.” The article reports 32 crashes in 2025 tied to drivers making right turns from the middle lane instead of the curb-side bus lane. Some signs list hours, others only say 'Bus Corridor Photo,' confusing drivers. The lack of clear, consistent information leaves intersections hazardous, especially for vulnerable road users. The report highlights a pressing need for better signage and clearer policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure extends and corrects school speed zone laws in New York City, repealing outdated provisions. Gounardes led the push, with strong support from most Senate Democrats and a split Assembly.

They warned it would raise costs for working families and worsen air for minority neighborhoods. The MTA’s own study found pollution could rise in outer boroughs. The fight continues.</p><p class=mb3>On March 14, 2024, Councilwoman Kamillah Hanks (District 49) stood with Staten Island officials at a press conference to oppose New York’s congestion pricing plan. The event, covered by nypost.com, highlighted concerns that the $15 toll for driving south of 60th Street in Manhattan would, as Hanks said, 'have a negative impact in neighborhoods of color in the outer boroughs.' Hanks and others argued the plan would burden working residents and increase pollution in Staten Island’s minority communities. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s environmental assessment confirmed air quality could worsen in Staten Island, the Bronx, and New Jersey, even as it improves in Manhattan. The MTA pledged $130 million for clean-up, but local leaders remain unconvinced. Hanks’s opposition underscores the ongoing debate over who pays—and who suffers—when the city tries to curb car traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
