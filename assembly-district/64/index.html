Six people killed. Four left with injuries so grave they may never walk the same. In the last year alone, 567 hurt, 893 crashes. The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross the street. A man, 80, struck dead on Hylan Boulevard, a block from home. The driver stayed. The man did not. Police said, &ldquo;She was heading north on Hylan Blvd. when she struck the victim&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/10/staten-island-pedestrian-struck-suv-driver-block-from-home-chaosheng-wu/>NY Daily News</a>.</p><p>A 58-year-old man, Jose Luis Gomez-Guallazaca, killed by an e-scooter on Targee Street.

In the past three years: 6 deaths, 256 injuries, 5 serious injuries from SUVs and cars alone. Trucks and buses: 1 dead, 29 hurt. Bikes: 0 dead, 11 hurt. The numbers do not lie. The street is not safe for those outside a car.</p><h2 id=what-has-mike-tannousis-done>What Has Mike Tannousis Done?</h2><p>Assembly Member Mike Tannousis has not led. He voted no on a bill to bring speed cameras to school zones in Schenectady—cameras proven to slow drivers and save children <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7652&amp;term=2023">A 7652</a>. He sponsored a bill to repeal congestion pricing, a move that would put more cars and more danger on city streets <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A6680&amp;term=2025">A 6680</a>. Not one bill to protect the people walking or biking in his district.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p>No one is coming to save you. Not unless you make them. Call Mike Tannousis. Demand action. Demand speed cameras, lower speed limits, and real street redesigns. Stand with the families who have lost everything. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The fight continues.</p><p class=mb3>On March 14, 2024, Councilwoman Kamillah Hanks (District 49) stood with Staten Island officials at a press conference to oppose New York’s congestion pricing plan. The event, covered by nypost.com, highlighted concerns that the $15 toll for driving south of 60th Street in Manhattan would, as Hanks said, 'have a negative impact in neighborhoods of color in the outer boroughs.' Hanks and others argued the plan would burden working residents and increase pollution in Staten Island’s minority communities. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s environmental assessment confirmed air quality could worsen in Staten Island, the Bronx, and New Jersey, even as it improves in Manhattan. The MTA pledged $130 million for clean-up, but local leaders remain unconvinced. Hanks’s opposition underscores the ongoing debate over who pays—and who suffers—when the city tries to curb car traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the man stepped into the street where there was 'no light, no crosswalk.' A northbound Mercedes SUV struck him head-on. The pedestrian suffered head trauma and internal bleeding and died at the scene. The police report explicitly cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor in the crash. The SUV's point of impact was the center front end, consistent with a direct collision. The report notes the pedestrian was 'crossing, no signal, or crosswalk,' but lists driver inattention as the primary cause. The deadly outcome unfolded on a street lacking basic pedestrian infrastructure, with driver error at its core.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
