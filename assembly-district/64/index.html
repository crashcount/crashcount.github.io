Eighteen left with life-altering wounds.</strong> That is the price paid on the streets of Assembly District 64 since 2022. These are not just numbers. They are fathers, mothers, children—neighbors who never made it home. In the last twelve months alone, six people died and 600 were injured in 970 crashes. The old and the young are not spared. Two people over 75 killed. No one under 18, yet. But the dice keep rolling.</p><h2 id=the-latest-losses>The Latest Losses</h2><p>On March 7, 2025, an 80-year-old man tried to cross Hylan Boulevard. He did not make it. A Ford SUV hit him at the intersection with Benton Avenue. He died at the hospital. Police said they were &ldquo;still investigating how fast the woman was driving and what the traffic signals at the intersection were displaying at the time,&rdquo; as <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/driver-fatally-strikes-80-year-old-staten-island-man-a-block-from-his-home-police-say>reported by Gothamist</a>. The driver stayed. The man did not go home.</p><p>On May 17, 2025, a 58-year-old man was crossing Targee Street. An e-scooter hit him &ldquo;outside the crosswalk,&rdquo; police said. He suffered &ldquo;severe trauma throughout his body&rdquo; and died at the hospital, <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/18/us-news/e-scooter-fatally-plows-into-pedestrian-on-nyc-street-cops/>reported the New York Post</a>. The scooter rider survived. The pedestrian did not.</p><h2 id=who-is-protected>Who Is Protected?</h2><p><strong>SUVs and trucks do the most harm.</strong> Of the deaths and injuries to pedestrians, cars and SUVs are responsible for the vast majority—six deaths, 202 minor injuries, 60 moderate, and five serious injuries. Trucks and buses killed one, injured 18, and left four with serious wounds. Bikes and mopeds are not blameless, but their toll is smaller.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-or-absence>Leadership: Action or Absence?</h2><p>Assembly Member Mike Tannousis has voted for some street safety bills. He supported funding for safer street designs and better driver education. But when it mattered most, he was absent. In June 2025, he missed the vote to extend school speed zone protections, as <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>recorded by Open States</a>. He also sponsored bills to repeal congestion pricing, a move that would put more cars on the road and more lives at risk. The silence is loud.</p><h2 id=what-now>What Now?</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home. Call Assembly Member Tannousis. Demand he show up for votes that protect children and elders. Demand he stop backing bills that put more cars and more danger on our streets. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

According to the police report, the driver failed to yield the right-of-way and was inattentive or distracted at the time of the crash. The report states, 'Steel met flesh. She dropped, broken. The driver did not yield.' The impact occurred at the left front quarter panel of the SUV, causing fatal crush injuries to the pedestrian's entire body. The woman was not at an intersection and was crossing without a signal or crosswalk, as noted in the report, but the primary contributing factors remain 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction.' The driver was licensed and operating a 2023 SUV. The collision underscores the lethal consequences of driver error on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The event, covered by nypost.com, highlighted concerns that the $15 toll for driving south of 60th Street in Manhattan would, as Hanks said, 'have a negative impact in neighborhoods of color in the outer boroughs.' Hanks and others argued the plan would burden working residents and increase pollution in Staten Island’s minority communities. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s environmental assessment confirmed air quality could worsen in Staten Island, the Bronx, and New Jersey, even as it improves in Manhattan. The MTA pledged $130 million for clean-up, but local leaders remain unconvinced.
