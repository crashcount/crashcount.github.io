In the last twelve months, <strong>52 people died</strong> on the borough’s streets. <strong>158 were seriously injured</strong>. The wounded include children, elders, workers, and mothers. In all, <strong>over 12,700 were hurt</strong>. Each number is a body. Each body is a life changed or ended.</p><p>A woman, 32 and pregnant, stepped from her car after a fender bender. The other driver gunned it, struck her, dragged her, and sped away. She died on the street. Her family learned she was expecting just two weeks before. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/25/us-news/pregnant-woman-32-mowed-down-by-suv-driver-after-nyc-fender-bender-on-way-home-from-beyonce-concert-police/>The driver of the Trax gunned it and struck Cifuni from behind, dragging her before speeding away.</a></p><p>An 87-year-old man stood at the corner in Sheepshead Bay.

He left the corner in an ambulance, fighting for his life. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-87-is-critically-injured-after-mta-bus-driver-strikes-him-in-brooklyn-nypd>Police said officers who responded to the scene discovered an 87-year-old man pinned under the city bus at East 12th Street and Avenue Z.</a></p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> In three years, they took 67 lives and left over 1,800 with serious or moderate injuries. Trucks and buses killed 22. Motorcycles and mopeds, 1. Bikes, 3. The street is a field of metal and flesh. The flesh loses.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h3><p>City leaders talk of Vision Zero. They tout new laws. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> passed in Albany, giving New York City the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the city has not used it. Speed cameras, proven to save lives, still face expiration unless Albany acts. The mayor says, <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-87-is-critically-injured-after-mta-bus-driver-strikes-him-in-brooklyn-nypd>one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.</a> But the dead keep coming.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand the citywide 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Stand with the families who have lost. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p><h4 id=the-numbers-keep-climbing>The Numbers Keep Climbing</h4><p>Since last month, the toll has grown. <strong>74,861 crashes. 42,415 injuries. 473 serious injuries.</strong></p><p>The young are not spared.

Nineteen dead, age 75 and older. Ten children dead. Four more, age unknown.</p><p>SUVs killed forty pedestrians. Sedans, nineteen. Trucks, sixteen. Buses, three. Bikes, three. Taxis, five.

He did not rise.</p><p class=mb3>A 49-year-old pedestrian was killed on Franklin Street at India Street in Brooklyn when an unlicensed e-bike rider traveling south struck him head-on, according to the police report. The report states the e-bike driver was 'unlicensed' and identifies 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as a contributing factor. The impact occurred at the center front end of the e-bike, causing severe head injuries and fatal bleeding to the pedestrian. The police report describes the victim as 'crossing, no signal, or crosswalk' and 'not at intersection,' but the primary focus remains on the unlicensed status of the e-bike operator and the disregard for traffic control. The narrative details a quiet night interrupted by the crash, with the victim left motionless on the pavement. No other contributing factors from the pedestrian are cited in the report.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
