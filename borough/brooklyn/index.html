Since January 2022, 196 people have died on Brooklyn streets. Over 42,000 have been injured. 478 suffered serious injuries—the kind that change a life, or end it. In the last 12 months alone, 53 people died and 160 were seriously hurt. Children are not spared: 4 killed, 18 seriously injured in a year. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. A mother crossing Marcus Garvey. A passenger ejected on Avenue U. A baby in a stroller on Kings Highway.</p><h2 id=recent-crashes-no-end-in-sight>Recent Crashes: No End in Sight</h2><p>The carnage does not pause. On May 24, a 32-year-old woman was killed by an SUV on Van Buren Street. On May 28, a 38-year-old woman died behind the wheel on Ditmas Avenue. On June 12, a 42-year-old man was killed in a motorcycle crash on Avenue P. The violence is relentless, the stories the same.</p><p>Even the police are not immune. On June 15, a drunk driver in a Chevy Suburban slammed into a Volvo, then into a marked NYPD cruiser at Coney Island Avenue and Avenue U. Two officers and two passengers went to the hospital. One officer suffered a broken pelvis and arm, another a broken hip. A passenger was ejected and left in critical condition. Police charged the driver with DWI and reckless endangerment. One police officer suffered a broken pelvis and arm, as well as head trauma, while another suffered a broken hip, according to police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/15/brooklyn-drunk-driver-hurts-2-passengers-2-nypd-cops-in-chain-reaction-crash/>reported</a> by NY Daily News.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-delay-and-retreat>Leadership: Action, Delay, and Retreat</h2><p>Local leaders talk of safety, but action is slow. The city has added protected bike lanes and lowered some speed limits. But when push comes to shove, safety is too often the first thing cut. On June 13, Mayor Adams and DOT removed three blocks of the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane after local pushback. Council Member Lincoln Restler called it &ldquo;a purely political decision to rip out a bike lane with no alternative.&rdquo; For months, the Mayor has repeatedly ignored our recommendations for ensuring the safety of children on Bedford Avenue, Restler <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/adams-dot-remove-bedford-avenue-bike-lane/>said</a>.</p><h2 id=what-next-the-cost-of-waiting>What Next: The Cost of Waiting</h2><p>Speed kills. Delay kills. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has the power to protect bike lanes and expand camera enforcement. Every day of delay is another day of blood on the street. Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand action. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Witness Jack Collins said, "He died basically on the spot." The e-bike rider remained at the scene. No arrests were made. The article notes this intersection is known for frequent stop sign violations: "It's not a unicorn incident. It's happened a lot." The piece highlights systemic issues, including delivery app pressures and gaps in e-bike regulation. City data shows e-bikes account for less than 2% of traffic deaths, but the policy debate continues. Lawmakers have called for tighter rules, as delivery workers face incentives to rush.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states the e-bike driver was 'unlicensed' and identifies 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as a contributing factor. The impact occurred at the center front end of the e-bike, causing severe head injuries and fatal bleeding to the pedestrian. The police report describes the victim as 'crossing, no signal, or crosswalk' and 'not at intersection,' but the primary focus remains on the unlicensed status of the e-bike operator and the disregard for traffic control. The narrative details a quiet night interrupted by the crash, with the victim left motionless on the pavement. No other contributing factors from the pedestrian are cited in the report.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
