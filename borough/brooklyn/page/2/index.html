Since 2022, 207 people have died on the borough’s streets. Over 44,000 have been injured. 513 suffered wounds so grave they changed lives forever.</p><p>The dead are not numbers. They are children, elders, neighbors. On June 28, an eight-year-old boy was killed crossing Eastern Parkway. The driver kept going straight. The boy did not get up. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Just days later, two men—one 80, one 59—were struck and killed by a BMW that ran a red light on Third Avenue. The driver sped away. Police found him later. The charges: manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, reckless driving. &ldquo;EMS pronounced both men dead at the scene. Their identities are being withheld pending family notification,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/brooklyn/pedestrians-hit-and-run-brooklyn/>reported amNY</a>.</p><h2 id=reckless-acts-broken-families>Reckless Acts, Broken Families</h2><p>The violence is not always anonymous. On July 13, a young man did donuts in a mall parking lot. He lost control. His girlfriend, 21, was sitting on the curb. He struck her. She died at the hospital. &ldquo;He lost control when he was doing donuts with the vehicle,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>according to NY Daily News</a>.</p><p>A moped rider, 34, was killed on E 35th Street. A 36-year-old man was beaten with a metal object after a crash in Cypress Hills. The violence does not end with the collision. It spills out into the street, into families, into memory.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Brooklyn’s leaders have tools. The city now has the power to lower speed limits. Speed cameras run 24/7. The NYPD has cracked down on ghost cars and reckless drivers. But the carnage continues. Every week brings new deaths. Every week, another family waits for a call that never comes.</p><p>Some leaders call for more enforcement. Some call for better street design. Some say nothing at all. The silence is loud. The streets stay dangerous.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat offenders. Join <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Stand with the living. Remember the dead. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Department of Transportation will ban cars on Scott Avenue between Flushing and Johnson and remove parking at several corners to improve visibility, a process called daylighting. The article notes, 'Drivers struggle to see oncoming traffic on Scott Avenue at Jefferson Street and at Flushing Avenue, due to parking blocking sight lines and the angle of the street.' The intersection saw 39 crashes from 2020 to 2024. The redesign includes a pedestrian plaza, narrowed roadways, and a ban on right turns onto Scott Avenue. These changes follow advocacy from Haussmann’s family and local lawmakers, highlighting systemic danger and the need for proactive street design.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
