One hundred twenty-nine left with wounds so deep they will not heal. The numbers are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors. They are the sound of sirens at 3 a.m. and the hush that follows.</p><p>Just weeks ago, two men tried to cross Third Avenue in Sunset Park. The driver ran the red. He did not stop. Both men died. <strong>Since 2018, drivers have killed or seriously injured 80 people on this two-mile stretch.</strong> State Senator Andrew Gounardes <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/sunset-park-residents-call-for-improvements-on-a-deadly-stretch-of-third-avenue>called out the city’s inaction</a>: &ldquo;We should all be offended. Angry. Insulted. That the response from our city to two deaths blocks away from here is a sign that says: &lsquo;be careful.&rsquo;&rdquo; The city’s answer is a sign. The street stays the same.</p><p>A week later, a 47-year-old man tried to cross Broadway at Suydam. A driver hit him and kept going. Police found the man dead in the street. Police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/cops-looking-for-driver-who-fatally-struck-man-on-brooklyn-street/>reported</a>: &ldquo;A driver struck and killed a 47-year-old pedestrian crossing a Brooklyn street, then left the scene.&rdquo; The driver is still out there.</p><h3 id=promises-and-pauses>Promises and Pauses</h3><p><strong>Local leaders talk. The streets do not change.</strong> Councilmember Alexa Avilés <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>called for real investment</a>: &ldquo;We want the city to actually commit real capital to make sure that it can do treatments that truly address the safety concerns while balancing the fact that we have an industrial business zone here.&rdquo; Plans for a safer Third Avenue have been stalled since 2014. Assemblymember Marcela Mitaynes <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>asked</a>: &ldquo;We started talking about a plan in 2014 and it&rsquo;s now 2025. What is going on?&rdquo;</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h3><p><strong>Every week brings new names.</strong> The dead are old and young. A 90-year-old man killed by a moped on Avenue U. A 21-year-old woman crushed by a sedan on Gateway Drive. Children, elders, workers. No one is spared.</p><p><strong>The city removes protected bike lanes.</strong> Cyclists are left exposed. The city posts warnings. The drivers keep driving.</p><h3 id=act-now-demand-action>Act Now: Demand Action</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand the city finish what it started. <strong>Every day of delay is another body in the road.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Streets stay lethal.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC reported on June 13, 2025, that Mayor Adams will remove the protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue, a corridor known for high crash rates. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'before this bike lane from 2018 to 2022 this is the area that had the second largest numbers of pedestrian fatalities and crashes in the city.' The lane faced opposition from some Hasidic leaders, citing children running into the lane from illegally parked cars and buses. Despite tweaks—school bus zones, daylighted corners, no standing areas—drivers kept parking illegally, blocking sightlines and endangering children. The city rarely removes protected lanes, but Adams acted after political pressure. Moving the lane to Classon Avenue, as some demand, would force cyclists onto a chaotic BQE ramp. The decision highlights persistent driver violations and policy gaps that leave vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
