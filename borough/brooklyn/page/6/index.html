Over 9,000 were hurt. One hundred twenty-two suffered injuries so grave they will not walk the same again. These are not numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors. The city counts them. Their families count the days since.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a driver in a BMW ran a red light at Third Avenue and 52nd Street. Two men, Kex Un Chen and Faqui Lin, were crossing with the signal. The car hit them. The driver fled. Both men died. The city put up a sign: &ldquo;Be careful.&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/sunset-park-residents-call-for-improvements-on-a-deadly-stretch-of-third-avenue>State Senator Andrew Gounardes said</a>, <strong>&ldquo;We should all be offended. Angry. Insulted. That the response from our city to two deaths blocks away from here is a sign that says: &lsquo;be careful.&rsquo;&rdquo;</strong></p><h2 id=a-corridor-of-death-and-delay>A Corridor of Death and Delay</h2><p><strong>Eighty people have been killed or seriously hurt on this two-mile stretch since 2018.</strong> The city promised a redesign. The plan stalled. Assemblymember Marcela Mitaynes put it plain: <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>&ldquo;We started talking about a plan in 2014 and it&rsquo;s now 2025. What is going on?&rdquo;</a> There are no answers. There are more funerals.</p><p>Elsewhere, a cyclist was struck on McGuinness Boulevard. The city had promised protection. The paint on the road did nothing. The driver was not charged. The cyclist was left broken. The city moved on.</p><h2 id=leadership-words-not-action>Leadership: Words, Not Action</h2><p><strong>Brooklyn’s leaders know the danger.</strong> They hold press conferences. They call for studies. They wait. &ldquo;We wait until someone dies. We wait until a tragedy. We wait to say, &lsquo;oh my gosh, how could this possibly have happened?&rsquo; We let this happen time and time again,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>said State Senator Gounardes</a>.</p><p>The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has the power to redesign streets. It has the power to act. It does not use it.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand action before the next name is added to the list. The city will not move until you make it move.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
