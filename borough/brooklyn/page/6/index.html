Nearly 48,000 have been hurt. In the last twelve months alone, 85 people died. Over 15,000 were injured. The numbers do not slow. The bodies do not stop coming.</p><p><strong>Just last week, a 47-year-old man was killed crossing Broadway at Suydam Street.</strong> The driver dragged him more than 50 feet, then fled. Police have not named the victim. They are still looking for the driver. Police <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/police-searching-for-information-on-bushwick-hit-and-run-that-killed-a-pedestrian>were looking on Monday for the driver of a car that struck and dragged a 47-year-old man on a Brooklyn street over the weekend, killing him</a>. The street was quiet. The man died before help could reach him. A driver <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/cops-looking-for-driver-who-fatally-struck-man-on-brooklyn-street/>struck and killed a 47-year-old pedestrian crossing a Brooklyn street, then left the scene, police said Sunday</a>.</p><p>On Morgan Avenue, a box truck killed another man crossing mid-block. No crosswalk. No protection. It is the third death on that stretch in three years. The city has not acted. The dead pile up. The living wait.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay with their lives.</strong> Trucks and cars do the killing. In Brooklyn, cars and SUVs have killed 82, trucks and buses 26, motorcycles and mopeds 2, and bikes 3 since 2022. The old, the young, the ones on foot—none are spared. Children, elders, workers. The street does not care.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Local leaders have made noise. They have passed laws. They have promised change. But the blood on the street says otherwise. The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has not done so. The city can redesign deadly roads. It has not done so on Morgan Avenue. The city can crack down on repeat offenders. The worst drivers keep driving.</p><p>Some leaders have called for more. Some have stayed silent. The dead do not care who speaks. Only action matters.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice made by someone in power. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand safe crossings. Demand action. The street will not change itself. Only you can force their hand.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The 29-year-old motorcycle rider, who was wearing a helmet, was crushed and partially ejected from his bike. He died at the scene from severe injuries to his entire body.

Both vehicles were reported as going straight ahead at the time of impact. The truck's left front quarter panel was struck, and the motorcycle overturned. The report makes no mention of any victim error or behavior contributing to the crash.

The incident occurred as the man stepped into the street, not at an intersection and without a crossing signal, as detailed in the report: 'A 70-year-old man stepped into the street without a signal. An eastbound SUV struck him head-on. He died from head and internal wounds. The driver held a license. The bumper bore the mark where he fell.' The vehicle involved was a 2023 Acura SUV, traveling straight ahead with two occupants. The point of impact was the center front end, and the right front bumper showed damage. The police report lists 'Unspecified' as the contributing factors for both the driver and the pedestrian, and does not cite any specific driver error. The pedestrian’s action—crossing without a signal or crosswalk—is noted after the absence of identified driver errors. The report does not mention any additional contributing factors or behaviors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The report states, 'The box truck hit him first. The SUV followed. Head shattered. Bones crushed. He died there, beneath the streetlights, far from the crosswalk, alone on the asphalt.'

The truck bore blood and silence.' The e-bike rider was ejected and suffered crush injuries to the entire body. The data does not specify helmet use or other victim behaviors as contributing factors.
