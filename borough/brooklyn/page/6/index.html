Just days ago, an 11-year-old boy was hit by a car near a playground in Sheepshead Bay. He survived. Many do not. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/11-year-old-boy-struck-car-playground-sheepshead-bay-brooklyn/17187379/>Police are still investigating</a>.</p><p>A week before, a cyclist was struck on McGuinness Boulevard. The driver turned across an unprotected bike lane. The city had promised safety. The city did not deliver. &ldquo;The fact is that this wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem if Mayor Adams had just done what he had promised to do, which was, make all of McGuinness safe,&rdquo; said <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/20/cyclist-badly-hurt-on-segment-of-mcguinness-blvd-that-mayor-adams-refused-to-make-safe>Kevin LaCherra</a>. The cyclist lived. Others have not.</p><h2 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h2><p>In the past 12 months, Brooklyn saw 74 people killed and over 15,000 injured in crashes. Children are not spared: 7 killed, 1,316 injured. The old are not spared: 13 dead, 779 hurt, just in the 65–74 age group. Serious injuries cut across every age. The city counts the bodies. The city counts the broken.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h2><p>The city passed new laws. Some streets are being rebuilt. But the work is slow. Promises pile up. Asphalt stays the same. &ldquo;The road diet works where it&rsquo;s been installed and it&rsquo;s needed for the entire corridor before this happens again,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/20/cyclist-badly-hurt-on-segment-of-mcguinness-blvd-that-mayor-adams-refused-to-make-safe>LaCherra said</a>. The mayor cut the plan short. The unprotected lane stayed. The crash came.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p>Every crash is preventable. Every delay is a choice. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand slower speeds. Demand action before the next child, the next elder, the next neighbor is lost.</p><p>Do not wait for another headline.
