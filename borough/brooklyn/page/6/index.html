Since 2022, 207 people have died on the borough’s streets. Over 44,000 have been injured. 513 suffered wounds so grave they changed lives forever.</p><p>The dead are not numbers. They are children, elders, neighbors. On June 28, an eight-year-old boy was killed crossing Eastern Parkway. The driver kept going straight. The boy did not get up. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Just days later, two men—one 80, one 59—were struck and killed by a BMW that ran a red light on Third Avenue. The driver sped away. Police found him later. The charges: manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, reckless driving. &ldquo;EMS pronounced both men dead at the scene. Their identities are being withheld pending family notification,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/brooklyn/pedestrians-hit-and-run-brooklyn/>reported amNY</a>.</p><h2 id=reckless-acts-broken-families>Reckless Acts, Broken Families</h2><p>The violence is not always anonymous. On July 13, a young man did donuts in a mall parking lot. He lost control. His girlfriend, 21, was sitting on the curb. He struck her. She died at the hospital. &ldquo;He lost control when he was doing donuts with the vehicle,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>according to NY Daily News</a>.</p><p>A moped rider, 34, was killed on E 35th Street. A 36-year-old man was beaten with a metal object after a crash in Cypress Hills. The violence does not end with the collision. It spills out into the street, into families, into memory.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Brooklyn’s leaders have tools. The city now has the power to lower speed limits. Speed cameras run 24/7. The NYPD has cracked down on ghost cars and reckless drivers. But the carnage continues. Every week brings new deaths. Every week, another family waits for a call that never comes.</p><p>Some leaders call for more enforcement. Some call for better street design. Some say nothing at all. The silence is loud. The streets stay dangerous.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat offenders. Join <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Stand with the living. Remember the dead. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The incident occurred mid-block, away from any intersection or signal. The report describes head trauma and severe bleeding, with the victim dying at the scene, caught between the curb and the car’s front end. The police narrative states the pedestrian was 'crossing mid-block without a signal.' The vehicle’s point of impact and damage were both centered on the front end, consistent with a direct collision. The report lists 'unspecified' as the contributing factor for both driver and pedestrian, offering no further detail on driver actions. The focus remains on the lethal interaction between a moving sedan and a vulnerable pedestrian in daylight, with the system’s gaps leaving another life lost on Brooklyn’s streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
