In the last twelve months, <strong>52 people died</strong> on the borough’s streets. <strong>158 were seriously injured</strong>. The wounded include children, elders, workers, and mothers. In all, <strong>over 12,700 were hurt</strong>. Each number is a body. Each body is a life changed or ended.</p><p>A woman, 32 and pregnant, stepped from her car after a fender bender. The other driver gunned it, struck her, dragged her, and sped away. She died on the street. Her family learned she was expecting just two weeks before. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/25/us-news/pregnant-woman-32-mowed-down-by-suv-driver-after-nyc-fender-bender-on-way-home-from-beyonce-concert-police/>The driver of the Trax gunned it and struck Cifuni from behind, dragging her before speeding away.</a></p><p>An 87-year-old man stood at the corner in Sheepshead Bay.

Trucks and buses killed 22. Motorcycles and mopeds, 1. Bikes, 3. The street is a field of metal and flesh. The flesh loses.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h3><p>City leaders talk of Vision Zero. They tout new laws. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> passed in Albany, giving New York City the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the city has not used it. Speed cameras, proven to save lives, still face expiration unless Albany acts. The mayor says, <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-87-is-critically-injured-after-mta-bus-driver-strikes-him-in-brooklyn-nypd>one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.</a> But the dead keep coming.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand the citywide 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Stand with the families who have lost. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p><h4 id=the-numbers-keep-climbing>The Numbers Keep Climbing</h4><p>Since last month, the toll has grown. <strong>74,861 crashes. 42,415 injuries. 473 serious injuries.</strong></p><p>The young are not spared.

Nineteen dead, age 75 and older. Ten children dead. Four more, age unknown.</p><p>SUVs killed forty pedestrians. Sedans, nineteen. Trucks, sixteen. Buses, three. Bikes, three. Taxis, five.

The report states the e-bike rider was 'thrown' and 'crushed,' dying at the scene. Both the pickup truck and the e-bike were cited for 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as contributing factors. The pickup, a 2007 Chevrolet, was making a left turn when it collided with the e-bike, which was traveling straight. The police report describes the aftermath: 'The bike lay twisted. The truck bore blood and silence.' The e-bike rider was ejected and suffered crush injuries to the entire body. The data does not specify helmet use or other victim behaviors as contributing factors. The crash underscores the lethal consequences when drivers fail to yield to vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The report states, "His SUV struck seven cars. Metal tore. Glass scattered. Airbags bloomed." The driver died at the scene, "strapped in his seat, still and silent, as traffic crawled past the wreckage." The sole contributing factor cited is "Lost Consciousness." The collision involved multiple vehicles traveling straight ahead, with impacts to center back ends, side doors, and quarter panels. Several occupants suffered neck injuries consistent with whiplash. The report does not list any driver errors or contributing factors for the other drivers. The crash was caused by the initial driver's loss of consciousness, triggering a deadly chain reaction.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
