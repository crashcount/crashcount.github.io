Since 2022, 207 people have died in crashes. Over 44,000 have been injured. More than 500 suffered life-changing injuries. The dead include children, elders, and people just trying to cross the street. The city calls them accidents. The families know better.</p><p>Just days ago, two men were killed in Sunset Park. They were crossing 3rd Avenue at 52nd Street when a BMW ran the red light and hit them. The driver fled. Both men died at the scene. They were on their way to a food pantry. &ldquo;We are deeply saddened by the tragic deaths of two individuals in Sunset Park this morning,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/sunset-park-deadly-hit-run-driver-charged-fatal-collision-2-men-brooklyn-nyc-arraigned-court/17083850/>said City Harvest</a>. &ldquo;They may have been on their way to our Mobile Market simply trying to access food like so many New Yorkers in need.&rdquo;</p><p>A week before, an eight-year-old boy was killed at Eastern Parkway and Albany Avenue. A sedan struck a 70-year-old man at Avenue I and East 5th Street. A moped rider died on East 35th Street. The list does not end.</p><h2 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h2><p>Brooklyn’s leaders have taken some steps. The city has lowered speed limits in some zones and expanded speed cameras. The NYPD has cracked down on ghost cars and reckless drivers. But the carnage continues. In the last 12 months, 61 people died and 175 were seriously injured in Brooklyn crashes.</p><p>Too often, the focus shifts to blaming cyclists or pedestrians. But the numbers are clear. Cars and trucks are the main killers. The city’s own data <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>shows that sedans and SUVs caused the most deaths and injuries to pedestrians</a>. Enforcement must target the real threat.</p><h2 id=the-call-for-action>The Call for Action</h2><p>The time for half-measures is over. Every day, another family is broken. &ldquo;The line is really long. So, they get there early so they can get their stuff early,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/sunset-park-deadly-hit-run-driver-charged-fatal-collision-2-men-brooklyn-nyc-arraigned-court/17083850/>said Mike Gonzalez</a>, describing the food pantry where two men died. No one should die trying to feed their family.</p><p>Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand enforcement against reckless drivers, not the people on foot or bike. Join groups like Transportation Alternatives and Families for Safe Streets.</p><p>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. Act now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
