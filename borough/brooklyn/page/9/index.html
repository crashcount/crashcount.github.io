In the last twelve months, <strong>52 people died</strong> on the borough’s streets. <strong>158 were seriously injured</strong>. The wounded include children, elders, workers, and mothers. In all, <strong>over 12,700 were hurt</strong>. Each number is a body. Each body is a life changed or ended.</p><p>A woman, 32 and pregnant, stepped from her car after a fender bender. The other driver gunned it, struck her, dragged her, and sped away. She died on the street. Her family learned she was expecting just two weeks before. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/25/us-news/pregnant-woman-32-mowed-down-by-suv-driver-after-nyc-fender-bender-on-way-home-from-beyonce-concert-police/>The driver of the Trax gunned it and struck Cifuni from behind, dragging her before speeding away.</a></p><p>An 87-year-old man stood at the corner in Sheepshead Bay.

The flesh loses.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h3><p>City leaders talk of Vision Zero. They tout new laws. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> passed in Albany, giving New York City the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the city has not used it. Speed cameras, proven to save lives, still face expiration unless Albany acts. The mayor says, <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-87-is-critically-injured-after-mta-bus-driver-strikes-him-in-brooklyn-nypd>one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.</a> But the dead keep coming.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand the citywide 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Stand with the families who have lost. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
