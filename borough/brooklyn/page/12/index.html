Police records say the driver was merging; she died at the scene (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>This Week</p><ul><li>Earlier that week (Aug 6), a truck driver going straight hit and killed a 46‑year‑old man at Morgan and Maspeth Avenues (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>The same day, an elderly woman was killed crossing 86th Street at 18th Avenue in a marked crosswalk; police recorded “Traffic Control Disregarded” by the driver (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li></ul><p>“An officer directing traffic … was struck from behind by a black sedan,” a local report said of another Brooklyn crash on Aug 31 at Schenectady and Church Avenues (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/nypd-officer-struck-hit-run-driver-brooklyn/17706648/>ABC7</a>).

That is the backdrop for three more funerals this month.</p><p>Among pedestrians alone, drivers in SUVs are tied to 3,018 injuries with 44 deaths, and drivers in sedans to 3,119 injuries with 26 deaths, over the same period (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>).

Albany has a bill on repeat speeders — the Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045C/A2299C) — that would force chronic offenders to slow down by installing speed limiters; New Yorkers have been pushing it (<a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>). City Hall has the authority to set safer speeds and is being asked to use it. Both moves are on the table now (<a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>).</p><p>The woman on Ocean Parkway is gone.

Brooklyn night, one life erased.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, two sedans collided head-on at speed at Kings Highway and Avenue M in Brooklyn. The report states, 'Steel crumpled. Fire bloomed.' A 57-year-old unlicensed man, driving a Ford sedan, was killed—burned to death while strapped in his seat. The Ford was described as 'ash by the time help came.' The crash occurred at 21:45. The police report cites 'Unsafe Speed' as a contributing factor. The deceased was not ejected and was wearing a lap belt and harness. The data shows the man was unlicensed at the time of the crash. The other vehicle, a Toyota sedan, was also demolished. The report does not list any victim behavior as a contributing factor. The deadly outcome traces directly to unsafe speed and the presence of an unlicensed driver behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
