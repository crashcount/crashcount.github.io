Police records say the driver was merging; she died at the scene (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>This Week</p><ul><li>Earlier that week (Aug 6), a truck driver going straight hit and killed a 46‑year‑old man at Morgan and Maspeth Avenues (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>The same day, an elderly woman was killed crossing 86th Street at 18th Avenue in a marked crosswalk; police recorded “Traffic Control Disregarded” by the driver (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li></ul><p>“An officer directing traffic … was struck from behind by a black sedan,” a local report said of another Brooklyn crash on Aug 31 at Schenectady and Church Avenues (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/nypd-officer-struck-hit-run-driver-brooklyn/17706648/>ABC7</a>). The pattern does not spare anyone who stands in the street.</p><h2 id=the-count-since-2022>The count since 2022</h2><p>Since Jan 1, 2022, in Brooklyn there have been <strong>84,911 crashes</strong>, leaving <strong>238 people dead</strong> and <strong>49,029 injured</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). That is the backdrop for three more funerals this month.</p><p>Among pedestrians alone, drivers in SUVs are tied to 3,018 injuries with 44 deaths, and drivers in sedans to 3,119 injuries with 26 deaths, over the same period (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>). These are not outliers. They are the load‑bearing beams of our daily harm.</p><h2 id=this-year-is-worse>This year is worse</h2><p>Year to date, Brooklyn has logged <strong>17,313 crashes</strong>, up 19.5% from 14,488 at this point last year. <strong>66 people have been killed</strong>, up 65.0% from 40. Injuries are up 30.9%, from 8,506 to <strong>11,138</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).

Albany has a bill on repeat speeders — the Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045C/A2299C) — that would force chronic offenders to slow down by installing speed limiters; New Yorkers have been pushing it (<a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>). City Hall has the authority to set safer speeds and is being asked to use it. Both moves are on the table now (<a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>).</p><p>The woman on Ocean Parkway is gone. The line keeps moving. Slowing drivers and reining in repeat offenders will save lives if leaders choose to act.
