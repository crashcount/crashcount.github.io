They are men, women, children. Just last week, a 47-year-old man was crossing Broadway at Suydam Street. A driver hit him, dragged him more than 50 feet, and left him in the road. Police are still looking for the driver. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/police-searching-for-information-on-bushwick-hit-and-run-that-killed-a-pedestrian>Police were looking for the driver of a car that struck and dragged a 47-year-old man on a Brooklyn street over the weekend, killing him.</a></p><p>On Morgan Avenue, another man was killed where there is no crosswalk. It is the third death on that stretch in three years. Juan Ignacio Serra <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/07/three-years-three-deaths-advocates-want-dot-to-make-morgan-avenue-safe>was very frustrated that nothing has been done in more than three years since Daniel Vidal was killed.</a></p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most harm.</strong> In Brooklyn since 2022, they killed 82 people and injured thousands more. Trucks and buses killed 25. Motorcycles and mopeds killed 2. Bikes killed 3. The rest are numbers, but every number is a body.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h2><p>Local leaders have made some moves. The city renewed 24-hour speed cameras. They have the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph but have not used it. On Morgan Avenue, calls for protected bike lanes and crosswalks have gone unanswered. The city has not acted.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand action, not words. The dead cannot call.
