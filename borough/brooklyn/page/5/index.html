Demand Action Before Another Child Dies.</h1><p class="byline f6 silver">Written July 24, 2025</p></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>Brooklyn: Jan 1, 2022 - Jul 24, 2025</h2><h2 id=the-toll-in-flesh-and-blood>The Toll in Flesh and Blood</h2><p>In Brooklyn, the street is a gauntlet. Since January 2022, <strong>225 people have died</strong> in crashes. <strong>542 suffered serious injuries</strong>. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about age. Fourteen children are dead. Fifty-four more are maimed. The old are not spared. Thirty-six people over 65 have died. The city keeps moving. The bodies keep coming.</p><p>Just two weeks ago, <strong>two men were killed crossing Third Avenue</strong>. The driver ran the red and kept going. The city put up a sign: &ldquo;Be careful.&rdquo; State Senator Andrew Gounardes did not mince words: <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/sunset-park-residents-call-for-improvements-on-a-deadly-stretch-of-third-avenue>&ldquo;We should all be offended. Angry. Insulted. That the response from our city to two deaths blocks away from here is a sign that says: &lsquo;be careful.&rsquo;&rdquo;</a></p><p>On Bedford Avenue, an 11-year-old boy was hit near a playground. He survived. This time. The police are still investigating. There are no answers. Only the sound of sirens and the hush that follows. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/11-year-old-boy-struck-car-playground-sheepshead-bay-brooklyn/17187379/>ABC7 reported the boy is in stable condition.</a></p><h2 id=promises-pauses-and-political-drift>Promises, Pauses, and Political Drift</h2><p>The city has plans. They stall. Third Avenue was supposed to be rebuilt. The plan is on hold. Assemblymember Marcela Mitaynes asked, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>&ldquo;We started talking about a plan in 2014 and it&rsquo;s now 2025. What is going on?&rdquo;</a> There is no answer. Only more funerals.</p><p>Some leaders speak up. Councilmember Alexa Avilés called for real investment: <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>&ldquo;We want the city to actually commit real capital to make sure that it can do treatments that truly address the safety concerns while balancing the fact that we have an industrial business zone here.&rdquo;</a></p><p>But the street stays the same. The cars keep coming. The dead keep piling up.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice made by someone in power. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real street redesigns, not more signs. Do not wait for another child’s name in the news.</p><p><strong>Act now. The blood on the street is not washed away by words.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The crash occurred at 23:06. A 48-year-old woman, riding as a rear passenger, was ejected and suffered fatal head injuries after striking the pavement. The police report states she was 'unconscious' and 'lifeless beneath the streetlights.' The report cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor, highlighting a failure by the e-bike operator to remain alert. No helmet was worn by the victim, but this detail is mentioned only after the driver error. The report makes clear that the crash’s deadly outcome stemmed from the e-bike driver’s lack of attention, not the actions of the passenger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The man was crossing the street when a northbound motorcycle, operated by an unlicensed rider, struck him head-on. The report states the impact was to the 'center front end' of the motorcycle, resulting in fatal head injuries to the pedestrian. The police report specifically notes the driver's license status as 'unlicensed,' highlighting a critical driver error. The narrative confirms the rider 'hit him square,' and the man died at the scene. While the report mentions the pedestrian was 'crossing without a signal,' it does not list this as a contributing factor, instead marking both contributing factors as 'unspecified.' The focus remains on the unlicensed operation of the motorcycle and the lethal consequences for a vulnerable road user.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The incident occurred as the man stepped into the street, not at an intersection and without a crossing signal, as detailed in the report: 'A 70-year-old man stepped into the street without a signal. An eastbound SUV struck him head-on. He died from head and internal wounds. The driver held a license. The bumper bore the mark where he fell.' The vehicle involved was a 2023 Acura SUV, traveling straight ahead with two occupants. The point of impact was the center front end, and the right front bumper showed damage. The police report lists 'Unspecified' as the contributing factors for both the driver and the pedestrian, and does not cite any specific driver error. The pedestrian’s action—crossing without a signal or crosswalk—is noted after the absence of identified driver errors. The report does not mention any additional contributing factors or behaviors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
