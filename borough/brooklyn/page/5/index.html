A man lay on Broadway before sunrise. A Lexus flipped on the Belt. A motorcyclist never made it home.</p><h3 id=broadway-and-suydam-dragged-and-left>Broadway and Suydam: dragged and left</h3><p>Police found a 47-year-old man near Broadway and Suydam just before 3:45 a.m. He had been hit by a northbound vehicle and dragged more than 50 feet. The driver fled. Detectives asked for tips. It was not yet clear if he was in the crosswalk. That uncertainty did not change the ending. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/police-searching-for-information-on-bushwick-hit-and-run-that-killed-a-pedestrian>Police said</a> they were seeking the car and the person behind the wheel. Early reports pointed to a garbage truck, but no arrest yet. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/cops-looking-for-driver-who-fatally-struck-man-on-brooklyn-street/>“A driver struck and killed a 47-year-old pedestrian… then left the scene,” police said</a>.</p><h3 id=belt-parkway-speed-a-roll-and-a-body-on-the-road>Belt Parkway: speed, a roll, and a body on the road</h3><p>Just after midnight on August 5, a 2019 Lexus headed west on the Belt Parkway. The car overturned. The 22-year-old driver was ejected and died. The crash log lists two causes: <strong>unsafe speed</strong> and <strong>driver distraction</strong>. No seat restraint noted. Three others rode in the car. One moment upright, the next upside down. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The city’s dataset records the death</a>.</p><h3 id=pitkin-and-strauss-bike-vs-turn>Pitkin and Strauss: bike vs. turn</h3><p>Hours later, also August 5, a Ford sedan turned left off Mother Gaston’s grid at Pitkin and Strauss. A 29-year-old on a Suzuki motorcycle was going straight. He was ejected and died. The car was making the turn. The rider wore a helmet. It did not save him. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The crash record lists him as killed</a>.</p><h3 id=18th-avenue-at-86th-street-a-crossing-that-ended>18th Avenue at 86th Street: a crossing that ended</h3><p>On August 6, a 76-year-old woman was in a marked crosswalk at 18th Avenue and 86th Street. The database says the signal was not in her favor. The contributing factor reads “Traffic Control Disregarded.” She died there. A standing vehicle is listed, but the person is dead, and the paperwork is cold. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The city log documents the fatality</a>.</p><h3 id=the-drumbeat-in-the-numbers>The drumbeat in the numbers</h3><p>Brooklyn keeps the highest toll on foot. Through June, reporters counted 228 injured pedestrians and two killed. The month after, the bodies kept coming. Across the city since 2022, <strong>sedans and SUVs are behind most pedestrian injuries and deaths</strong>. Trucks follow. The city’s rollup shows sedans linked to 3,104 pedestrian injuries and 26 deaths; SUVs to 2,998 injuries and 44 deaths; trucks to 410 injuries and 20 deaths. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>Those figures are in the open data</a>.</p><p>Year to date, the city counts 16,629 crashes and <strong>62 deaths</strong>, up sharply from last year’s pace. Serious injuries are up too. The ledger does not flinch. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The dataset shows the rise</a>.</p><h3 id=slow-it-down-or-keep-digging-graves>Slow it down or keep digging graves</h3><p>Speed shows up again and again in the wreckage. The city has tools. Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The council can lower speeds. The state renewed school‑zone speed cameras. Advocates say the worst repeat offenders do the most harm. One analysis found that <strong>1.5% of motorists cause 21% of pedestrian deaths</strong>, and drivers with <strong>16 camera tickets in 12 months are twice as likely</strong> to kill or seriously injure; <strong>30+ tickets multiplies the risk fifty‑fold</strong>. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/20/the-1-5-percent-of-drivers-who-cause-21-percent-of-pedestrian-deaths>Read the reporting</a>. A Brooklyn case this spring put names to it. A driver with <strong>29 camera tickets</strong> killed a mother and her two girls. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/15/brooklyn-driver-with-29-speed-camera-tickets-kills-mother-and-two-daughters>That story is here</a>.</p><p>Lower the default speed. Fit chronic speeders’ cars with limiters. End the rerun.</p><p>Take one step now. Tell City Hall and your council member to act.

The incident occurred at 9:49 a.m. The narrative states, 'A 65-year-old man lay still in the road. A southbound box truck passed. No screech, no crash, no damage. Just the crack of bone.

Both contributing factors for the pedestrian are marked as 'Unspecified.' The box truck, registered in Illinois and operated by a licensed driver from Pennsylvania, was reportedly 'avoiding object in roadway' before the crash. Despite the lack of visible vehicle damage, the impact proved fatal. The report does not cite any specific driver errors or victim behaviors as contributing factors, but the outcome underscores the lethal risk faced by pedestrians outside intersections in the presence of large vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
