In the last twelve months, <strong>52 people died</strong> on the borough’s streets. <strong>156 were seriously injured</strong>. The list of the wounded is long—children, elders, workers, mothers. In all, <strong>over 12,000 were hurt</strong>. Each number is a body. Each body is a life changed or ended.</p><p>A woman, 32 and pregnant, stepped from her car after a fender bender.

Speed cameras, proven to save lives, still face expiration unless Albany acts. The mayor says, <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-87-is-critically-injured-after-mta-bus-driver-strikes-him-in-brooklyn-nypd>one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.</a> But the dead keep coming.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.
