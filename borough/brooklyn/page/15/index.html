Police records say the driver was merging; she died at the scene (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>This Week</p><ul><li>Earlier that week (Aug 6), a truck driver going straight hit and killed a 46‑year‑old man at Morgan and Maspeth Avenues (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>The same day, an elderly woman was killed crossing 86th Street at 18th Avenue in a marked crosswalk; police recorded “Traffic Control Disregarded” by the driver (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li></ul><p>“An officer directing traffic … was struck from behind by a black sedan,” a local report said of another Brooklyn crash on Aug 31 at Schenectady and Church Avenues (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/nypd-officer-struck-hit-run-driver-brooklyn/17706648/>ABC7</a>).

That is the backdrop for three more funerals this month.</p><p>Among pedestrians alone, drivers in SUVs are tied to 3,018 injuries with 44 deaths, and drivers in sedans to 3,119 injuries with 26 deaths, over the same period (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>).

Albany has a bill on repeat speeders — the Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045C/A2299C) — that would force chronic offenders to slow down by installing speed limiters; New Yorkers have been pushing it (<a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>). City Hall has the authority to set safer speeds and is being asked to use it. Both moves are on the table now (<a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>).</p><p>The woman on Ocean Parkway is gone.
