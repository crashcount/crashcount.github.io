Since January 2022, 207 people have died on Brooklyn streets. Another 44,652 have been injured. 513 suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same again. These are not numbers. They are lives cut short, bodies broken, families left with empty chairs.</p><p>Just last week, two men were killed crossing Third Avenue in Sunset Park. The driver left them in the street and fled. Police found him later. He admitted, &ldquo;I had a six pack of Modelos and two drinks. I was driving the car by myself last night. It&rsquo;s my fault. After I hit them, I came home.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/12/hit-and-run-bmw-driver-who-killed-2-in-brooklyn-had-downed-beers-body-matter-found-on-car-da/>NY Daily News</a>. Neighbors <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>said</a> drivers speed on that stretch of roadway.</p><p>A few days later, a young woman sat on a curb in a Gateway Center parking lot. Her boyfriend spun his car in circles. He lost control. She died before sunrise. He told police he &ldquo;lost control when he was doing donuts with the vehicle.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>NY Daily News</a>.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p>The dead are old and young. In the last year alone, five children under 18 died. Eleven people over 65 died. The most common killers are cars and SUVs—72 pedestrian deaths from these vehicles since 2022. Trucks and buses killed 22. Motorcycles and mopeds, four. Bikes, three. No one is safe from the machines that rule our streets.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Brooklyn’s leaders have tools. Speed cameras run 24/7. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. Some streets have changed. But the carnage continues. The law is slow. Enforcement is uneven. Crackdowns target delivery cyclists, not the drivers who kill.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit on every street. Demand real enforcement against reckless drivers—not just headlines. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
