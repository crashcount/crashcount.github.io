Just last Friday, an 11-year-old boy was <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/11-year-old-boy-struck-car-playground-sheepshead-bay-brooklyn/17187379/>hit by a car near a playground</a> on Bedford Avenue. He survived. Others have not. On June 28, an 8-year-old boy was killed at the corner of Eastern Parkway and Albany Avenue, struck by an SUV while crossing at the intersection. A week before, a 70-year-old man died crossing Avenue I at East 5th Street. The list grows. The names fade. The pain stays.</p><p><strong>In the past twelve months, 61 people have died in Brooklyn traffic.</strong> More than 13,500 have been injured. One hundred seventy-five were seriously hurt—lives changed in a heartbeat. Children, elders, workers. No one is spared.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>A 95-year-old woman survived the Nazis and Chernobyl. She was killed crossing Cropsey Avenue in January. After six months, police charged the driver with failure to yield and failure to exercise due care. &ldquo;Police have arrested a man they say struck and killed a beloved 95-year-old Brooklyn woman with a cargo van as she crossed the street near her home,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/brooklyn-man-arrested-in-fatal-crash-with-pedestrian-95-who-survived-nazis-chernobyl>reported Gothamist</a>.</p><p>In East New York, a young man doing donuts in a parking lot lost control. His girlfriend, 21, was sitting on the curb. She died. &ldquo;He lost control when he was doing donuts with the vehicle,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>he told police</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>Brooklyn leaders have seen the blood on the street. Some have acted. The city has started to lower speed limits, daylight intersections, and expand speed cameras. But the pace is slow. Charges come months after deaths. Enforcement cracks down on cyclists and delivery workers, not just the drivers who kill. The city can set a 20 mph limit now. It has not. <strong>Every day of delay is another family broken.</strong></p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat offenders.</strong> Join <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a> and <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a>. Do not wait for another child’s name to be added to the list. The street will not wait.

The article states, “After the crash, Epps hopped in a taxi and took off, leaving his 26-year-old passenger, Imani Vance, in the front seat suffering severe head trauma.” Epps faces charges of manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, leaving the scene, and unlicensed driving. The bus driver survived. The crash exposes ongoing risks from unlicensed, reckless drivers and the persistent danger at city intersections. The victim’s family is left to grieve and organize a funeral, while the intersection remains a site of loss.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, 'a dump truck turned left. Its right bumper struck a baby boy crossing with the signal. He died there, crushed beneath steel and weight.' The report states the point of impact was the right front bumper of the truck. The child, a pedestrian, suffered fatal crush injuries to his entire body. The police narrative explicitly notes the victim was 'crossing with the signal.' The driver’s actions—executing a left turn in a large vehicle—placed the most vulnerable road user in mortal danger.
