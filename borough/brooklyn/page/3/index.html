In the last twelve months, <strong>52 people died</strong> on the borough’s streets. <strong>158 were seriously injured</strong>. The wounded include children, elders, workers, and mothers. In all, <strong>over 12,700 were hurt</strong>. Each number is a body. Each body is a life changed or ended.</p><p>A woman, 32 and pregnant, stepped from her car after a fender bender. The other driver gunned it, struck her, dragged her, and sped away. She died on the street. Her family learned she was expecting just two weeks before. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/25/us-news/pregnant-woman-32-mowed-down-by-suv-driver-after-nyc-fender-bender-on-way-home-from-beyonce-concert-police/>The driver of the Trax gunned it and struck Cifuni from behind, dragging her before speeding away.</a></p><p>An 87-year-old man stood at the corner in Sheepshead Bay.

He left the corner in an ambulance, fighting for his life. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-87-is-critically-injured-after-mta-bus-driver-strikes-him-in-brooklyn-nypd>Police said officers who responded to the scene discovered an 87-year-old man pinned under the city bus at East 12th Street and Avenue Z.</a></p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> In three years, they took 67 lives and left over 1,800 with serious or moderate injuries. Trucks and buses killed 22. Motorcycles and mopeds, 1. Bikes, 3. The street is a field of metal and flesh. The flesh loses.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h3><p>City leaders talk of Vision Zero. They tout new laws. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> passed in Albany, giving New York City the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the city has not used it. Speed cameras, proven to save lives, still face expiration unless Albany acts. The mayor says, <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-87-is-critically-injured-after-mta-bus-driver-strikes-him-in-brooklyn-nypd>one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.</a> But the dead keep coming.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand the citywide 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Stand with the families who have lost. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p><h4 id=the-numbers-keep-climbing>The Numbers Keep Climbing</h4><p>Since last month, the toll has grown. <strong>74,861 crashes. 42,415 injuries. 473 serious injuries.</strong></p><p>The young are not spared.

Nineteen dead, age 75 and older. Ten children dead. Four more, age unknown.</p><p>SUVs killed forty pedestrians. Sedans, nineteen. Trucks, sixteen. Buses, three. Bikes, three. Taxis, five.

The report states, 'A van turned right. A man, 59, walked with the light. Steel struck him head-on.'

The crash occurred at 23:06. A 48-year-old woman, riding as a rear passenger, was ejected and suffered fatal head injuries after striking the pavement. The police report states she was 'unconscious' and 'lifeless beneath the streetlights.' The report cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor, highlighting a failure by the e-bike operator to remain alert. No helmet was worn by the victim, but this detail is mentioned only after the driver error. The report makes clear that the crash’s deadly outcome stemmed from the e-bike driver’s lack of attention, not the actions of the passenger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The man was crossing the street when a northbound motorcycle, operated by an unlicensed rider, struck him head-on. The report states the impact was to the 'center front end' of the motorcycle, resulting in fatal head injuries to the pedestrian. The police report specifically notes the driver's license status as 'unlicensed,' highlighting a critical driver error. The narrative confirms the rider 'hit him square,' and the man died at the scene. While the report mentions the pedestrian was 'crossing without a signal,' it does not list this as a contributing factor, instead marking both contributing factors as 'unspecified.' The focus remains on the unlicensed operation of the motorcycle and the lethal consequences for a vulnerable road user.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The incident occurred as the man stepped into the street, not at an intersection and without a crossing signal, as detailed in the report: 'A 70-year-old man stepped into the street without a signal. An eastbound SUV struck him head-on. He died from head and internal wounds. The driver held a license. The bumper bore the mark where he fell.' The vehicle involved was a 2023 Acura SUV, traveling straight ahead with two occupants. The point of impact was the center front end, and the right front bumper showed damage. The police report lists 'Unspecified' as the contributing factors for both the driver and the pedestrian, and does not cite any specific driver error. The pedestrian’s action—crossing without a signal or crosswalk—is noted after the absence of identified driver errors. The report does not mention any additional contributing factors or behaviors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
