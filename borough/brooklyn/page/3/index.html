Nearly 48,000 have been hurt. In the last twelve months alone, 85 people died. Over 15,000 were injured. The numbers do not slow. The bodies do not stop coming.</p><p><strong>Just last week, a 47-year-old man was killed crossing Broadway at Suydam Street.</strong> The driver dragged him more than 50 feet, then fled. Police have not named the victim. They are still looking for the driver. Police <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/police-searching-for-information-on-bushwick-hit-and-run-that-killed-a-pedestrian>were looking on Monday for the driver of a car that struck and dragged a 47-year-old man on a Brooklyn street over the weekend, killing him</a>. The street was quiet. The man died before help could reach him. A driver <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/cops-looking-for-driver-who-fatally-struck-man-on-brooklyn-street/>struck and killed a 47-year-old pedestrian crossing a Brooklyn street, then left the scene, police said Sunday</a>.</p><p>On Morgan Avenue, a box truck killed another man crossing mid-block. No crosswalk. No protection. It is the third death on that stretch in three years. The city has not acted. The dead pile up. The living wait.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay with their lives.</strong> Trucks and cars do the killing. In Brooklyn, cars and SUVs have killed 82, trucks and buses 26, motorcycles and mopeds 2, and bikes 3 since 2022. The old, the young, the ones on foot—none are spared. Children, elders, workers. The street does not care.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Local leaders have made noise. They have passed laws. They have promised change. But the blood on the street says otherwise. The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has not done so. The city can redesign deadly roads. It has not done so on Morgan Avenue. The city can crack down on repeat offenders. The worst drivers keep driving.</p><p>Some leaders have called for more. Some have stayed silent. The dead do not care who speaks. Only action matters.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice made by someone in power. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand safe crossings. Demand action. The street will not change itself. Only you can force their hand.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Witness Jack Collins said, "He died basically on the spot." The e-bike rider remained at the scene. No arrests were made. The article notes this intersection is known for frequent stop sign violations: "It's not a unicorn incident. It's happened a lot." The piece highlights systemic issues, including delivery app pressures and gaps in e-bike regulation. City data shows e-bikes account for less than 2% of traffic deaths, but the policy debate continues. Lawmakers have called for tighter rules, as delivery workers face incentives to rush.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states the e-bike driver was 'unlicensed' and identifies 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as a contributing factor. The impact occurred at the center front end of the e-bike, causing severe head injuries and fatal bleeding to the pedestrian. The police report describes the victim as 'crossing, no signal, or crosswalk' and 'not at intersection,' but the primary focus remains on the unlicensed status of the e-bike operator and the disregard for traffic control.
