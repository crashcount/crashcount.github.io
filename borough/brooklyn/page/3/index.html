She died there in the road (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>They were one of <strong>234 people killed</strong> on Brooklyn streets since Jan 1, 2022, through Aug 29, 2025, with <strong>48,719 injured</strong> and <strong>583</strong> seriously hurt in that span (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>). The toll does not pause. So far this year, Brooklyn has seen <strong>62 deaths</strong>, up from <strong>38</strong> at this point last year, with crashes up 21% and serious injuries up 74.7% (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>&ldquo;Police are investigating three separate car crashes that left two people dead and critically injured several others,&rdquo; reported <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-investigating-separate-collisions-that-left-2-dead-teen-critical-early-tuesday>Gothamist</a>. One of those was the Pitkin Avenue crash where a car hit a moped and the rider died; police said charges were pending (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-investigating-separate-collisions-that-left-2-dead-teen-critical-early-tuesday>Gothamist</a>).</p><h3 id=ocean-parkway-then-morgan-avenue>Ocean Parkway, then Morgan Avenue</h3><p>Four days earlier, just before 8 AM on Aug 6, a box truck going straight on Morgan Avenue struck a 46‑year‑old man outside an intersection. He died of crush injuries (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The truck was registered in Tennessee. The man never made it across Maspeth Avenue.</p><p>That same morning, at 18th Avenue and 86th Street, a 76‑year‑old woman in the crosswalk was killed. The data lists “Traffic Control Disregarded” as a factor (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=pitkin-avenue-before-dawn>Pitkin Avenue before dawn</h3><p>On Aug 5, just before 4 AM, a 29‑year‑old motorcyclist on Pitkin Avenue was ejected and killed. The record cites unsafe speed and improper lane use. He wore a helmet. He still died (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>&ldquo;Police were looking &mldr; for the driver of a car that struck and dragged a 47‑year‑old man&rdquo; on Broadway at Suydam around 3:45 AM, said <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/police-searching-for-information-on-bushwick-hit-and-run-that-killed-a-pedestrian>Gothamist</a>. He was dragged more than 50 feet. The driver fled. NYPD sources told the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/cops-looking-for-driver-who-fatally-struck-man-on-brooklyn-street/>Daily News</a> the vehicle might have been a garbage truck.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-dont-blink>The numbers don’t blink</h3><p>In Brooklyn, cars and SUVs have injured over 7,000 pedestrians in this period, with at least <strong>83</strong> pedestrian deaths tied to those vehicle types in the dataset’s rollup; trucks add <strong>20</strong> pedestrian deaths (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>). The year‑to‑date ledger shows <strong>16,846 crashes</strong>, <strong>62 deaths</strong>, <strong>10,828 injuries</strong>, and <strong>159</strong> serious injuries as of Aug 29, 2025, compared to <strong>13,912 crashes</strong>, <strong>38 deaths</strong>, <strong>8,170 injuries</strong>, and <strong>91</strong> serious injuries at this point last year (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=who-moves-now>Who moves now</h3><p>New York has tools. Albany renewed 24/7 school‑zone speed cameras through 2030, and advocates are pressing for the citywide 20 MPH default and devices that cap speeds for repeat offenders. A tiny pool of drivers causes outsized harm; repeat camera tickets flag the worst risk (<a href=/take_action/>CrashCount Take Action</a>).</p><p>Brooklyn’s electeds for this area include Council Member <a href=/council-district/38/>Alexa Avilés</a>, Assembly Member Kalman Yeger (AD 41), and State Senator Steve Chan (SD 17). The record provided here does not list their sponsorship on a speed‑limiter bill. The deaths above sit inside their districts. What gives?</p><p>Lower the default speed. Stop the super speeders.

The article notes this intersection is known for frequent stop sign violations: "It's not a unicorn incident. It's happened a lot." The piece highlights systemic issues, including delivery app pressures and gaps in e-bike regulation. City data shows e-bikes account for less than 2% of traffic deaths, but the policy debate continues.

The impact occurred at the center front end of the e-bike, causing severe head injuries and fatal bleeding to the pedestrian.
