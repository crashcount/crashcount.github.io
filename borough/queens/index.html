The vehicle involved was a station wagon or SUV traveling straight ahead, with the point of impact at the center front end. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified,' offering no further detail on driver behavior or conditions. The narrative underscores the stark aftermath: 'her body still beneath the glare of headlights, as silence settled over the blacktop.'
