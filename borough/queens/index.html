He never makes it home. A car hits him and keeps going. Another car runs him over. His family says, &ldquo;Today is a sad day. We lost a brother, father, son, uncle, and cousin. <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/queens/man-killed-after-hit-run-crash-queens-police-say>He has been snuffed from us by a hit-and-run driver.</a>&rdquo;</p><p>A pedestrian is hit on Hempstead Ave. The driver stops for two minutes, then drags the man’s body for three blocks. Bystanders plead for the driver to stop. Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz: &ldquo;The defendant then allegedly drove over the victim, stopped for more than two minutes, and then proceeded to speed away from the scene while dragging the victim&rsquo;s body, while the victim was still alive.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/03/queens-hit-and-run-crash-arrest-murder-warren-rollins-gary-charlotin/>Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz</a></p><p>Two girls, ages four and eight, walk in a crosswalk. An SUV runs the red, hits them, and flees. Police say the driver &ldquo;went around another vehicle and then blew a red light, striking the girls&mldr; as they were walking south in the crosswalk.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/two-little-girls-4-and-8-struck-by-driver-who-blew-red-light-in-queens/>Police say</a></p><p>A 78-year-old man is killed crossing Jericho Turnpike.

Children are not spared: 4 killed, 998 injured. The old are not spared: 6 killed, 303 injured. The city counts the bodies. The city moves on.</p><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the killing. Trucks, motorcycles, mopeds, bikes—all play their part. The street does not care who you are. It only cares that you are in the way.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city says it is acting. Speed cameras now run 24/7. The law lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit still stands at 25. The cameras need Albany’s blessing to keep running. Each day of delay is another day of risk.</p><p>Some leaders speak. Most wait. The dead do not wait.

The report lists 'Traffic Control Disregarded' and 'Unsafe Speed' as contributing factors for the driver. The motorcycle struck a 23-year-old woman crossing at the intersection. The report states she was 'crossing against the signal,' but the focus remains on the driver's actions: running the light and speeding. The impact was severe, with the victim suffering fatal injuries to her entire body. The police narrative describes the scene: 'Metal strikes flesh. The street runs red. She dies there, whole body broken, as the city sleeps.' Driver error—disregard for traffic control and unsafe speed—stands at the center of this tragedy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

On February 10, 2024, Vennitti allegedly rear-ended David Berney, 43, after Berney and another driver stopped in the middle lane following a minor collision. The crash threw Berney from his car, killing him at the scene. The other driver was injured. Vennitti, unlicensed, abandoned his Mercedes and fled on foot. Police arrested him a year later. A grand jury indicted Vennitti for leaving the scene of a fatal crash and driving without a license.
