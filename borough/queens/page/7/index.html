Over 37,000 have been hurt. In the past year alone, 59 people were killed, 152 suffered serious injuries, and more than 12,000 were wounded. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old. One child, one mother, one grandfather—gone, and the city moves on.</p><p>Just last week, a BMW lost control on the Belt Parkway. The car struck the median, went airborne, and caught fire. Two people died. Three more were hurt. The NYPD said, &ldquo;Thompson lost control of the car and collided with the median divider.&rdquo; No arrests. No answers. Only the sound of sirens and the smell of burning rubber. <a href=https://qns.com/2025/07/deadly-belt-parkway-crash-howard-beach/>Chain-Reaction Crash Kills Two On Belt Parkway</a></p><p>On July 11, an MTA bus in Flushing jumped the curb and slammed into a pole. Eight people were injured. A passenger said, &ldquo;I was all the way in the back and all of a sudden the bus hit the curb, I guess, jumped the curb, I went this way and that way and banged into the side of the bus.&rdquo; The driver had fallen asleep. The MTA pulled him from service. The investigation drags on. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>Bus Jumps Curb, Eight Injured In Flushing</a></p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>The dead do not get a second chance.</strong> In Queens, the old and the young fall first.

Streets stay the same.</strong> The city has lowered some speed limits. Cameras catch some speeders. The mayor calls the drop in deaths &ldquo;historic&rdquo; and vows to &ldquo;continue using all tools available to drive down traffic violence.&rdquo;</p><p>But the carnage continues. Enforcement comes down hard on cyclists and delivery workers, while the worst drivers rack up tickets and keep driving. Community boards demand fairness. &ldquo;It is unjust to hold cyclists to a far higher standard than motor vehicle drivers,&rdquo; said Manhattan’s Community Board 7. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Motor Vehicle Collisions – CrashID 4823380</a></p><h2 id=act-now-demand-action-not-excuses>Act Now: Demand Action, Not Excuses</h2><p><strong>This is not fate.
