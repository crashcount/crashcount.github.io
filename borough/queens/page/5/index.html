Since January 2022, 219 people have died in crashes here. Over 40,000 have been hurt. The numbers do not slow. They do not care about the weather, the hour, or the name of the street.</p><p>Just last week, a 55-year-old woman was killed riding her e-bike on Hollis Court Boulevard. The driver stayed at the scene. Police are still investigating. The news is always the same: another life gone, another family left to wait for answers. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/two-dead-in-separate-nyc-electric-vehicle-crashes-cops/>The driver stayed on the scene, and police are still investigating the crash.</a></p><p>On the same day, a 23-year-old man was run down on 101st Street. The district attorney filed no charges. The car moved on. The street was quiet again. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/08/01/us-news/man-23-fatally-run-over-by-ex-girlfriends-new-beau-in-love-triangle-clash-on-nyc-street-cops/>The Queens District Attorney&rsquo;s Office opted not to charge the driver because he feared for his life when he struck Sonalall.</a></p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p>Cars and SUVs do most of the harm. They killed 58 people and hurt thousands more. Trucks and buses took 14 lives. Motorcycles and mopeds killed 4. Even bikes, meant for freedom, took one. The numbers are plain. The pain is not.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h2><p>The city passed new laws. Speed cameras now run day and night. The council can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. But the limit stands. The cameras catch the same cars, again and again. The city waits. The dead do not.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every death is a choice made by someone in power. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower the speed limit. Tell them to act before another name is added to the list. The street will not change itself.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
