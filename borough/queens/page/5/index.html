Same ending.</p><ul><li><p>On 50th Ave and Hollis Court Blvd, a 55‑year‑old woman on an e‑bike was hit by a Nissan SUV turning left. She was ejected and died. The SUV kept going straight into her path. The city’s crash log lists her as the bicyclist, the SUV as the striking vehicle, and her cause of death as internal injuries. The record is bare and final: <strong>killed</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city crash data</a>).</p></li><li><p>A day later in Astoria, an 84‑year‑old driver plowed into a food truck area. Two men died where they stood. The driver died too. He had suffered a stroke two weeks earlier and, reporters wrote, had been told by his doctor not to drive. Police said the car &ldquo;careened at a high speed&rdquo; and &ldquo;rammed into two men.&rdquo; Debris and bodies on the street, a witness with his head in his hands: &ldquo;I have never seen anything like this&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/queens/carnage-queens-senior-driver-stroke-crash/>amNY</a>).</p></li><li><p>Hours later near JFK, a driver hit a 52‑year‑old man crossing 155th Street at South Conduit and fled. Police said the operator &ldquo;fled the scene.&rdquo; Detectives searched for video. No arrest yet. Another man taken to Jamaica Hospital and pronounced dead (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-in-hit-and-run-near-jfk-airport-police-say>Gothamist</a>, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/13/queens-hit-and-run-driver-kills-52-year-old-man-near-jfk-airport/>NY Daily News</a>, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/police-investigate-hit-run-death-springfield-gardens-queens-john-kennedy-international-airport/17524816/>ABC7</a>).</p></li></ul><p>A 61‑year‑old man was also killed on Union Turnpike at 189th Street. The log says he was crossing not at a crosswalk. The Mercedes sedan hit him head‑on. He died from crush injuries to the head. The SUV parked nearby was just scenery for the impact report (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city crash data</a>).</p><p>Wrong way. Right into you.</p><p>Queens has seen the other kind of crash too. A judge gave eight years to a driver who turned his car into a weapon on the Clearview. He drove north in the southbound lanes. He hit five cars. He injured two people who &ldquo;still have not fully recovered.&rdquo; In court he said: &ldquo;I entered the Clearview Expressway in the wrong direction because I wanted to hurt people&rdquo; and asked a victim, &ldquo;You want to fight?&rdquo; The DA called it terror on a busy highway (<a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY</a>).</p><p>The toll adds up.</p><ul><li>In Queens South, reporters noted 17 traffic deaths this year through Aug. 10. Last year at this time it was 13. The needle moves the wrong way (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-in-hit-and-run-near-jfk-airport-police-say>Gothamist</a>).</li><li>Citywide, in the last 12 months in Queens, there were <strong>23,094 crashes</strong>, <strong>14,527 injuries</strong>, and <strong>72 deaths</strong>. SUVs and sedans hit most pedestrians. The records are blunt: center front end; going straight ahead; apparent death (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Queens period stats</a>).</li></ul><p>Three corners. One fix.</p><ul><li>50th Ave and Hollis Court Blvd: a left turn into a cyclist’s line. The log shows the SUV turning, the bike going straight, the rider ejected. No room for error when metal cuts first (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city crash data</a>).</li><li>42nd Street and 19th Ave: the Astoria morning when a car &ldquo;careened at a high speed&rdquo; into men by a truck. Two pedestrians dead. The driver dead. A witness: &ldquo;I have never seen anything like this&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/queens/carnage-queens-senior-driver-stroke-crash/>amNY</a>).</li><li>155th Street and South Conduit Ave: a man in the roadway. A car that did not stop. NYPD said the operator &ldquo;fled the scene.&rdquo; Police looked for cameras. A family waits for a knock (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/13/queens-hit-and-run-driver-kills-52-year-old-man-near-jfk-airport/>NY Daily News</a>, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/police-investigate-hit-run-death-springfield-gardens-queens-john-kennedy-international-airport/17524816/>ABC7</a>).</li></ul><p>Officials know what works — do they?</p><p>Albany renewed 24‑hour school‑zone speed cameras through 2030. Advocates say speed kills, and slowing cars saves lives. City law now allows the city to lower limits. The fix is not magic. It is a number on a sign and a foot off a pedal. Our city can move that number and rein in the worst repeat offenders. The case is made in full on our page: lower the default speed and require <strong>intelligent speed assistance</strong> for drivers who pile up tickets (<a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>).</p><p>Do not wait for another siren.</p><ul><li>Lower the NYC default speed limit citywide.</li><li>Force the super speeders to slow down.</li></ul><p>Start here: <strong><a href=/take_action/>Act now</a></strong>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
