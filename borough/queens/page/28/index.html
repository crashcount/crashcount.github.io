Pedestrians are most often hurt by drivers of SUVs and sedans. Those drivers account for a combined <strong>59 deaths</strong> and thousands of injuries in that span (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data – Persons</a>).</p><p>The pattern is steady. The toll is not abstract. “Police vehicle pursuits and high-speed car chases can be dangerous and even fatal, and it is time for a change,” New York’s attorney general said this year, backing tighter pursuit rules (<a href=https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/attorney-general-says-police-chases-mostly-banned-20392396.php>Times Union</a>).</p><h3 id=year-to-date-up-again>Year-to-date: up, again</h3><p>From Jan 1 to Sep 11, deaths and injuries in Queens are higher than the same period last year. Deaths are up <strong>55.9%</strong>; serious injuries up <strong>26.0%</strong>; injuries up <strong>28.1%</strong>; crashes up <strong>25.2%</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).
