The moped, traveling west, struck the sedan's left front quarter panel with force, folding in the car's side. The moped rider, a 31-year-old man, suffered severe head injuries and was partially ejected, bleeding heavily but conscious. The police report cites 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as contributing factors, underscoring the moped driver's dangerous actions. The rider was unlicensed and wore no helmet, as noted in the report, but these details follow the primary driver errors. The sedan driver, licensed and traveling south, was also involved. Noon sun, silent street—speed and disregard for traffic rules turned routine movement into trauma.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
