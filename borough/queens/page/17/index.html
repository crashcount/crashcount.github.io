The boy suffered crush injuries to his entire body but remained conscious at the scene. The report notes the SUV sustained no damage. The collision occurred as the boy was 'crossing, no signal, or crosswalk,' and not at an intersection. The police report lists 'unspecified' as the contributing factor for both the driver and the pedestrian, and does not cite any explicit driver error such as 'Failure to Yield.' The narrative underscores that 'the street offered no protection.' The focus remains on the impact and the lack of systemic safeguards for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
