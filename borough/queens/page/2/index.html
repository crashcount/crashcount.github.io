Since 2022, <strong>208 people have died</strong> and <strong>414 have been seriously injured</strong> in crashes here (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about hope or habit. They only climb.</p><p>Just days ago, a BMW tore across the Belt Parkway. It struck the median, flew, and burned. <strong>Two dead. Six hurt.</strong> The NYPD said the driver &ldquo;lost control of the car and collided with the median divider&rdquo; (<a href=https://qns.com/2025/07/deadly-belt-parkway-crash-howard-beach/>amny reported</a>). The fire left nothing but metal and smoke.</p><p>On July 11, an MTA bus in Flushing &ldquo;jumped the curb&rdquo; and slammed into a pole. <strong>Eight people were injured.</strong> A passenger said, &ldquo;I was all the way in the back and all of a sudden the bus hit the curb, I guess, jumped the curb, I went this way and that way and banged into the side of the bus&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>ABC7 reported</a>). The driver had fallen asleep. The MTA pulled him from service. The investigation drags on.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the killing.</strong> Since 2022, these vehicles have caused <strong>54 deaths</strong> and over <strong>5,200 injuries</strong> to pedestrians and cyclists in Queens (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Trucks and buses killed 13. Motorcycles and mopeds, 4. Bikes, 1. The numbers are not fair. They are not random. They follow the weight of steel.</p><p>The dead are not numbers. A 22-year-old woman, ejected from a car. A 76-year-old, killed as a passenger. A 39-year-old, struck on a moped. The stories do not end. The pain does not fade.</p><h2 id=leaders-movebut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Move—But Not Fast Enough</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have acted.</strong> The city has lowered speed limits in some zones. Speed cameras now run 24/7. The NYPD cracks down on &ldquo;ghost cars&rdquo; and reckless drivers. But the carnage continues. The city can set a 20 mph limit everywhere. It has not. The law sits idle. The streets do not wait.</p><p>&ldquo;One traffic fatality is one too many,&rdquo; said Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi. She promised to use &ldquo;every lever&mldr;to ensure that New Yorkers are safe however they choose to get around&rdquo; (<a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/914-23/mayor-adams-launches-new-effort-make-thousands-nyc-intersections-safer-of-broad-new#:~:text=%E2%80%9COne%20traffic%20fatality%20is%20one,%E2%80%9D">NYC.gov</a>). The levers move slow. The bodies pile up fast.</p><h2 id=the-call-demand-action-now>The Call: Demand Action Now</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit on every street. Demand streets built for people, not for speed. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report states she was not at an intersection and was crossing without a signal or crosswalk. The impact killed her instantly, leaving her body in the roadway. The vehicle involved was a station wagon or SUV traveling straight ahead, with the point of impact at the center front end. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified,' offering no further detail on driver behavior or conditions. The narrative underscores the stark aftermath: 'her body still beneath the glare of headlights, as silence settled over the blacktop.' No evidence from the report suggests any action by the victim contributed to the crash; the focus remains on the lethal force of the vehicle and the vulnerability of the pedestrian.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
