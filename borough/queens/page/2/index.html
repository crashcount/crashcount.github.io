In the last twelve months, 69 people died in crashes here. Another 180 were left with injuries so severe they changed lives. The count does not stop. In just the past week, two men were killed while buying food from a truck. A car, moving too fast, slammed into them. The street was left with bodies and broken glass. One witness <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/queens/carnage-queens-senior-driver-stroke-crash/>said, &ldquo;I have never seen anything like this,&rdquo;</a> his head in his hands.</p><p>On the same day, a 52-year-old man was crossing near JFK. A driver hit him and kept going. Police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/13/queens-hit-and-run-driver-kills-52-year-old-man-near-jfk-airport/>said, &ldquo;The driver sped off without stopping. No arrests have been made.&rdquo;</a> The man died at the hospital. His name became a number in the city&rsquo;s tally.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p>Pedestrians and cyclists take the worst of it. In three years, 219 people have died in Queens traffic. Over 40,000 have been hurt. SUVs and cars do most of the killing—58 deaths, 5,662 injuries. Trucks and buses, 14 deaths. Motorcycles and mopeds, 4 deaths. Bikes, 1 death. The numbers do not care about age. Children, elders, workers, all are at risk.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>The city has the power to slow the bloodshed. Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The Council can set a 20 mph speed limit. They have not. Speed cameras are renewed, but the most dangerous drivers still roam. A handful of drivers rack up dozens of tickets and keep driving. The city talks of redesigns and new laws, but the pace is slow. Each delay means another family broken.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Every day leaders wait, more people die. Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat speeders. Join the fight. Do not wait for another body in the road.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
