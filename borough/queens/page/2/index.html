The car hit a food truck and two men. All three died. Police named the pedestrians: <strong>41‑year‑old Joaquin Venancio‑Mendez</strong> and <strong>70‑year‑old Santiago Baires</strong>. The driver died at the scene. The outlet reported the driver had suffered a stroke two weeks earlier and had been told not to drive. An eyewitness said, <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/queens/carnage-queens-senior-driver-stroke-crash/>&ldquo;I have never seen anything like this&rdquo;</a>.</p><p>City data records the crash at 19 Ave and 42 St. Two pedestrians were struck “not at intersection.” Vehicles listed: a parked Volkswagen sedan, a Toyota sedan “going straight ahead,” a parked Chevy SUV, and a Volvo SUV “making left turn.” Three people were recorded as killed. Cause fields read “Unspecified.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=south-conduit-dark-hour-driver-runs>South Conduit, dark hour, driver runs</h3><p>Before dawn on Aug 13, near JFK, a car hit a 52‑year‑old man at 155 St and South Conduit Ave. The driver left him in the road and fled. Police said, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/police-investigate-hit-run-death-springfield-gardens-queens-john-kennedy-international-airport/17524816/>&ldquo;The operator of the vehicle fled the scene after hitting the man&rdquo;</a>. He died at Jamaica Hospital. Another account put it simply: <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/13/queens-hit-and-run-driver-kills-52-year-old-man-near-jfk-airport/>&ldquo;The driver sped off without stopping. No arrests have been made&rdquo;</a>. Detectives from the Collision Investigation Squad were on the case, and Queens South deaths were already climbing this year, reporters noted (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-in-hit-and-run-near-jfk-airport-police-say>Gothamist</a>).</p><p>City records match the time and place. The pedestrian was listed “not at intersection.” The striking vehicle was “Unspecified,” front‑end damage, headed east. The victim’s injury status: “Apparent Death.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=hollis-court-a-left-turn-a-cyclist-goes-down>Hollis Court, a left turn, a cyclist goes down</h3><p>Just after midday on Jul 31, at Hollis Court Blvd and 50 Ave, a 55‑year‑old woman on an e‑bike was hit. She was listed as the cyclist, “Driver,” “Ejected,” injury “Apparent Death.” The other vehicle: a 2015 Nissan SUV, “Making Left Turn,” with right‑front damage. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City crash file</a> shows the fatality and the movements.</p><h3 id=the-count-does-not-stop>The count does not stop</h3><p>In Queens, deaths keep stacking up. In the last 12 months, the borough logged <strong>73 deaths</strong>, <strong>14,527 injuries</strong>, across <strong>23,134 crashes</strong>. This year to date, deaths are up about 61% over last year’s pace. These are not numbers. They are names we often never learn. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data period stats</a>.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-sayand-what-the-street-says-back>What leaders say—and what the street says back</h3><p>Some crashes are not mistakes. In 2023, a Bayside man drove the wrong way on the Clearview and hit five cars. A jury convicted him. At sentencing, the Queens DA said, <a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>&ldquo;Joseph Lee terrorized other drivers as he purposefully drove the wrong way on a busy Queens highway and crashed into multiple cars&rdquo;</a>. Two motorists were badly hurt and “still have not fully recovered,” the DA said. Lee told police, <a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>&ldquo;I wanted to hurt people&rdquo;</a>.</p><p>The street offers no excuses. It records the impact. It keeps the stain.</p><h3 id=slow-it-down-stop-the-repeat-harm>Slow it down. Stop the repeat harm.</h3><p>Queens needs fewer fast cars and fewer second chances for the worst drivers. Two steps would help: <strong>lower the city’s default speed limit</strong>, and <strong>force chronic violators to use speed‑limiters</strong>.
