Two men at the cart were killed. “I have never seen anything like this,” an eyewitness told amNY (2025-08-13).</p><p>The next night, a car struck a 52-year-old man crossing 155th Street at South Conduit Avenue near JFK and fled the scene. “The operator of the vehicle fled the scene,” police told ABC7 (2025-08-13).</p><p>Queens courts did act in another case. After a 2023 wrong-way rampage on the Clearview Expressway, Queens DA Melinda Katz said: “Joseph Lee terrorized other drivers as he purposefully drove the wrong way on a busy Queens highway and crashed into multiple cars” (amNY, 2025-08-15). Two motorists remain seriously injured.</p><p>This is not random. It is a pattern.</p><p>Since 2022, Queens has recorded 222 traffic deaths, 460 serious injuries and 40,642 total injuries, per NYC Open Data (updated 2025-08-16). Cars and SUVs, plus trucks and buses, cause the bulk of pedestrian harm — a combined 74 pedestrian deaths and 6,066 total pedestrian injuries in the dataset (cars/SUVs: deaths 60, total 5,673; trucks/buses: deaths 14, total 393) (NYC Open Data).</p><p>Contributing factors are clear in these files and in reporting: unsafe speed, medical incapacitation behind the wheel, and hit-and-run. Heavy vehicles and SUVs dominate pedestrian deaths.</p><p>Who fixes this? Streets are a civic design problem. Prosecutors can lock up one driver. They cannot rebuild the crossings or slow the lanes where people die. The city can.</p><p>What must happen now (local, concrete):</p><ul><li>Install leading pedestrian intervals (LPIs) and daylight key crossings so walkers get a head start.</li><li>Harden dangerous turns and add curb extensions (shorten crossings).</li><li>Targeted enforcement and improved nighttime lighting and crash-investigation resources where late-night strikes and hit-and-runs cluster.</li></ul><p>Political solutions (citywide):</p><ul><li>Lower NYC’s default speed limit to 20 mph to cut the deadliest crashes. Sammy’s Law gives the city that authority; the city should use it now.</li><li>Require intelligent speed-assistance devices for habitual speeders — a practical tool to stop repeat offenders.</li></ul><p>Act: Call your Council Member and the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph default and speed limiters for repeat offenders.
