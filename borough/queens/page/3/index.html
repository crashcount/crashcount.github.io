The car hit two men. It also killed the driver. The victims were <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/queens/carnage-queens-senior-driver-stroke-crash/>41-year-old Joaquin Venancio-Mendez and 70-year-old Santiago Baires</a>.

In the borough’s recent week alone: two men on foot killed in Astoria; a 52-year-old man killed near JFK. The city’s open data lists more bodies on expressways and local streets: a 24-year-old motorcyclist killed on the Long Island Expressway on July 24; a 55-year-old woman on an e-bike killed at Hollis Court Blvd and 50th Ave on July 31 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>LIE case file</a>, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Hollis Court case file</a>).

Police were “searching for surveillance footage” after the JFK killing, reporters noted, and “<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/police-investigate-hit-run-death-springfield-gardens-queens-john-kennedy-international-airport/17524816/>the investigation remains ongoing</a>.” In another Queens case from 2023, a driver went the wrong way on the Clearview and hit five cars. A jury convicted him. At sentencing this month, the district attorney said, <a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>“Joseph Lee terrorized other drivers.”</a> The line lands because it is true.</p><h3 id=what-changes-the-odds>What changes the odds</h3><p>Speed is the lever. NYC now has the power to set safer speeds and to rein in repeat speeders with limiters. Both save lives. The fixes are known. The cost of waiting is on the street.</p><p>Take one step today.

Pena refused a breath test; a blood draw later confirmed drug use. He was charged with vehicular manslaughter, DWI, and refusal to submit to testing, but posted $50,000 bail.

The narrative underscores that 'the drivers missed the signs,' highlighting systemic failures in driver compliance with traffic controls.
