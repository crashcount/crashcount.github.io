Her father <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>blamed the high-speed chase</a>: &ldquo;It was probably not the place to be doing a high-speed chase, in the residential neighborhood.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=the-numbers-that-haunt>The Numbers That Haunt</h3><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the killing.</strong> In the last three years, cars and SUVs took 52 lives and left thousands hurt. Trucks and buses killed 13. Motorcycles and mopeds, 4. Bikes, 1. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors. They are the old man crossing Linden Boulevard. The young woman on her bike. The child on the way to school.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Local leaders have moved, but slow. The city has started to lower speed limits in some places. Cameras catch speeders, but only after the fact. The council passed laws to decriminalize jaywalking, shifting blame away from those on foot. But the streets remain the same. The danger remains.</p><p>Some speak out. Some stay silent. &ldquo;The number of lives lost to traffic violence is simply unacceptable… 127 deaths in this calendar year alone is 127 too many,&rdquo; <a href="https://transalt.org/press-releases/new-york-city-experiences-deadliest-first-six-months-in-vision-zero-history-new-analysis-from-transportation-alternatives-and-families-for-safe-streets-shows#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20number%20of%20lives%20lost,%E2%80%9D">said Council Member Erik Bottcher</a>. But words do not slow cars. Promises do not heal broken bodies.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand street redesigns that put people first. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The blood is on the street. It does not wash away.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
