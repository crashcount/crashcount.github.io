Since 2022, Queens has seen <strong>208 people killed</strong> and <strong>414 seriously injured</strong> in crashes. The dead do not speak. The wounded carry scars. In the last twelve months alone, <strong>59 people died</strong> on Queens streets. <strong>152 were seriously hurt</strong>. Every week, another family gets the call.</p><h2 id=recent-wounds-unanswered>Recent Wounds, Unanswered</h2><p>Just last week, a BMW lost control on the Belt Parkway. The car hit the median, went airborne, and caught fire. <strong>Two young people died</strong>. Three more were thrown from the car. Police said, &ldquo;Thompson lost control of the car and collided with the median divider&rdquo; (<a href=https://qns.com/2025/07/deadly-belt-parkway-crash-howard-beach/>amny</a>). The investigation is not over. The pain is.</p><p>On July 11, an MTA bus in Flushing jumped the curb. Eight people were hurt. One rider said, &ldquo;I was all the way in the back and all of a sudden the bus hit the curb&mldr; I went this way and that way and banged into the side of the bus&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>ABC7</a>). The driver may have fallen asleep. The MTA pulled him from service. The street stayed the same.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-and-stalls>Leadership: Steps and Stalls</h2><p><strong>Queens leaders have tools.</strong> The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. The speed camera program is renewed. More red-light cameras are coming. But the default speed limit is still not 20 mph. Cameras catch speeders, but the worst repeat offenders keep driving. The city redesigns some streets, but the work is slow. Enforcement falls hardest on cyclists and delivery workers, not the drivers who kill.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every delay means another mother, another child, another name on a slab. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph default. Demand action against repeat speeders. Join the fight. Do not wait for the next siren.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
