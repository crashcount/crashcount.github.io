The truck’s right front bumper struck a 65-year-old woman as she crossed the intersection. The impact knocked her down, and the truck continued forward, rolling over her legs and causing fatal crush injuries. The report states the truck sustained no damage. The driver’s actions are listed as 'unspecified' in the contributing factors, but the narrative details the truck’s movement and its direct role in the fatal outcome. The report notes the woman was 'crossing against the light,' but this is mentioned after describing the truck’s maneuver and impact. The focus remains on the truck’s turn and the systemic danger posed by large vehicles at intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
