The numbers do not bleed, but people do.</p><p>Just last month, a driver in a Ford Mustang failed a turn at East 149th and Courtlandt. He mounted the sidewalk, plowed into six pedestrians, then ran. All six went to the hospital. The car was left behind. The driver was not. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/driver-plows-into-six-people-after-botching-left-turn-in-the-bronx/>Police are still looking for him.</a> EMS called it minor.

Surveillance showed Young rolling over Galan, dragging him 950 feet, then stopping in a bike lane. Prosecutors say Young and a passenger checked under the car but did not help. The article quotes Bronx DA Darcel Clark: "The defendant allegedly drove her car over the victim... then after looking under her vehicle... she allegedly drove away without reporting what happened."

The shooter, Joseph Meeks, 76, tried four credit cards before the argument escalated. ABC7 reports, "Mr. Barrie asked him to get out of the car and pay him, instead of paying him he shot him in the stomach." Meeks, with about 60 prior arrests, was charged with attempted murder. The United Federation of Taxi Drivers urged the district attorney to deny bail.

The van's right front bumper struck a 65-year-old man who was crossing the intersection with the pedestrian signal. The report states the man suffered fatal head injuries and died at the scene. The van sustained no damage. Police cite 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as the primary contributing factor. The victim's action—'Crossing With Signal'—is noted in the report, but only after the driver's failure to yield. The crash underscores the lethal consequences when drivers fail to respect pedestrian priority at intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
