The numbers do not bleed, but people do.</p><p>Just last month, a driver in a Ford Mustang failed a turn at East 149th and Courtlandt. He mounted the sidewalk, plowed into six pedestrians, then ran. All six went to the hospital. The car was left behind. The driver was not. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/driver-plows-into-six-people-after-botching-left-turn-in-the-bronx/>Police are still looking for him.</a> EMS called it minor.
