Metal and flesh torn in the Bronx dusk.</p><p class=mb3>On Van Nest Avenue near 606 in the Bronx, a sedan collided with a box truck that was pulling from the curb. According to the police report, the sedan's driver, a 34-year-old woman, suffered crush injuries to her shoulder, while her 33-year-old male passenger was pinned and injured in the back. Both were conscious but sustained serious injuries. The report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor for both the driver and the passenger. The sedan's left front bumper struck the right side doors of the box truck, which sustained no damage. The box truck was starting from parking, while the sedan was going straight ahead. The focus remains on driver distraction as the systemic danger leading to this violent crash.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The crash occurred at 12:49 a.m. The report states the SUV veered off course after the driver was distracted by something outside the car, a factor explicitly listed as 'Outside Car Distraction.' The vehicle’s right front bumper took the impact, and the airbag deployed. The driver suffered head injuries and crush injuries but remained conscious at the scene. The police report does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor. The incident underscores the danger posed when drivers’ attention is diverted from the road.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The report states the woman driving the sedan did not stop after the collision. The infant suffered crush injuries to his entire body and was conscious but injured. Police cite 'Aggressive Driving/Road Rage' and 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as contributing factors in the crash. The report notes the child was a pedestrian not at an intersection, engaged in 'Other Actions in Roadway,' but lists driver errors first and foremost. The sedan sustained no damage, and the driver was licensed. The incident underscores the lethal consequences of aggressive driving and a driver’s failure to yield, with a vulnerable child left injured in the street.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The report states the taxi 'slides on wet asphalt' and that 'brakes fail,' resulting in the vehicle’s left front bumper striking the pedestrian.

The bus crashed into the wall, leaving it hanging over the edge. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz said, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." No injuries were reported, but the crash caused structural damage and scattered debris below. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz noted, "It speaks to the importance of enforcing our parking rules because it was going around a double-parked car."
