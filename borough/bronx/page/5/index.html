Forty-eight left with wounds that will not heal.</strong> In the Bronx this year, these numbers are not just statistics. They are mothers, sons, neighbors—the cost of walking, riding, or simply being in the wrong place when a driver loses control.</p><p>Just days ago, a 71-year-old woman died when a 79-year-old driver crashed into two cars and a light pole. &ldquo;I saw one lady was out on the ground. They was giving her medical attention, checking her body. She was laid out,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/op-city-crash-multiple-people-injured-including-1-critically-bronx/17075710/>said Samuel Cherry</a>. Seven others were hurt. The street was quiet, except for the sound of sirens and the scrape of metal.</p><p>A week before, liquid asphalt poured across a Bronx road after a truck overturned. No one died, but the street was left slick and dangerous. The risk is always there, waiting. &ldquo;Liquid asphalt poured onto a road in the Bronx after a truck overturned Wednesday,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/truck-overturns-spills-liquid-asphalt-on-bronx-road/>reported CBS New York</a>.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and passengers pay most.</strong> In the last twelve months, 36 people died in Bronx crashes. Ninety-four suffered serious injuries. The young, the old, the ones just trying to cross the street. Cars and SUVs did most of the killing—forty deaths. Trucks and buses took eight more. Motorcycles and mopeds, one. Not one person died from a bicycle.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn’t</h3><p>Local leaders have talked about safety. Some have acted. The city has lowered speed limits in some zones, added speed cameras, and started to redesign streets. But the pace is slow. The dead keep coming. The city has the power to set a 20 mph limit everywhere. It has not used it. The Bronx waits.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another family broken.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to use the laws they have. Lower the speed. Build real protection. End the carnage. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
