Unsafe lane change left a man broken and semiconscious.</p><p class=mb3>A crash on Adee Avenue near Boston Road in the Bronx left a 43-year-old e-scooter rider injured. According to the police report, a sedan veered left while merging, striking the e-scooter. The impact ejected the rider, who wore a helmet but was unlicensed. He suffered crush injuries to his knee and was found semiconscious. The police report lists 'Unsafe Lane Changing' as the contributing factor. The sedan’s front bumper hit the e-scooter’s side. No injuries were reported for the sedan’s occupants. The e-scooter rider’s helmet use is noted, but the primary cause remains the unsafe lane change by the sedan.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Parked sedans and an SUV were struck but had no occupants. No other injuries were reported. The police narrative describes the scene: 'A Jeep, speeding west, slammed parked cars. The unlicensed driver, 22, was flung halfway out, arm torn and bleeding. Airbag burst. Steel folded. The street stood silent, littered with glass and the smell of fuel.' Driver error—unsafe speed—was the primary cause. The driver was unlicensed at the time of the crash.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
