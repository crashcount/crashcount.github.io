Two occupants were inside: a 57-year-old male driver and a 50-year-old female passenger. Both were wearing seat belts and remained conscious after the crash. The police report states the driver sustained chest injuries while the passenger was trapped by her shoulder, both suffering crush injuries. The vehicle was stationary at the time of the incident, with the impact focused on the right front bumper. The report lists contributing factors as 'unspecified' and does not cite any driver errors or external causes. No mention is made of victim behavior as a contributing factor.

According to the police report, the pickup was making a left turn when its unlicensed driver hit the pedestrian, who was 'crossing with the light.' The report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as contributing factors. The woman suffered crush injuries to her knee and lower leg and remained conscious at the scene. The police report notes that the truck sustained no damage. The driver’s lack of a license and failure to yield to a pedestrian in the crosswalk are cited as direct causes of the crash. The victim’s action—crossing with the signal—is mentioned only to clarify she had the right of way.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The report states, 'A moped struck from behind. The woman stayed upright. Her knee split open. Blood soaked her jeans.' The impact caused severe lacerations to her knee, though she did not fall from the vehicle. The moped sustained damage to the center back end, consistent with a rear impact.
