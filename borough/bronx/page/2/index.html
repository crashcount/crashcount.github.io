Bronx Streets Need Justice Now.</h1><p class="byline f6 silver">Written July 6, 2025 <em>(Revised July 6, 2025 – Removed duplicate headline from body and cleaned citations for accuracy and order.)</em></p></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>Bronx: Jan 1, 2022 - Jul 6, 2025</h2><h3 id=the-toll-in-flesh-and-blood>The Toll in Flesh and Blood</h3><p>In the Bronx, the street is a gauntlet. Since 2022, <strong>130 people have died</strong> and <strong>over 21,000 have been injured</strong> in crashes. <strong>316 suffered serious injuries</strong>—the kind that do not heal. The numbers are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors. They are the sound of sirens at dawn, the hush after impact.</p><p><strong>Just days ago, on July 3rd, a Ford Mustang mounted the curb at East 149th and Courtlandt. Six people were struck.</strong> The driver and passenger ran. Vivian Cole heard the aftermath: <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>&ldquo;People were yelling, were in pain, so yelling, crying, it was very upsetting.&rdquo;</a> The street was chaos. Christina Sieh thought it was a bomb: <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/03/us-news/6-pedestrians-struck-by-ford-mustang-that-crashed-into-nyc-scaffolding-before-driver-passenger-flee/>&ldquo;We thought it was a bomb or something, because we are all panicking around here.&rdquo;</a></p><p>This is not rare. In the last year, <strong>14 people have died</strong> and <strong>44 have been seriously injured</strong> in the Bronx. The dead include children and elders. The wounded are left to rebuild their lives, if they can.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> Since 2022, they have killed 38 and seriously injured 73 pedestrians. Trucks and buses killed 8, motorcycles and mopeds 1. Bikes killed none. The street is not neutral. It favors steel over flesh.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city has passed laws. Speed cameras now run 24/7. Speed limits can be lowered. But the carnage continues. Every delay is another body on the pavement. Every unprotected crosswalk is a dare.</p><p>Local leaders have spoken. But words do not stop cars. Policies that shift blame to the walker or the cyclist are a lie. The Bronx needs action—<strong>street redesigns, enforcement against reckless drivers, and a citywide 20 mph speed limit.</strong></p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer streets.</strong> Do not wait for the next siren. The Bronx cannot afford another day of silence.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
