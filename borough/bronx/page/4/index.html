The man now fights for life at Jacobi hospital.</p><p class=mb3>ABC7 reported on April 25, 2025, that a 32-year-old JFK Airport baggage handler was critically injured in a violent Bronx carjacking. After leaving his car running outside a restaurant, a suspect jumped in and sped off. The victim clung to the door as the car accelerated. Detectives told ABC7 the suspect 'intentionally sideswiped a parked car,' knocking the man to the ground. The victim suffered head trauma and lost his left leg. The stolen Infiniti was later found abandoned, showing crash damage. The Bronx has seen a 3.6% rise in car thefts this year, even as rates fall citywide. The incident highlights the lethal risks of vehicle theft and the urgent need for systemic interventions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
