The numbers do not bleed, but people do.</p><p>Just last month, a driver in a Ford Mustang failed a turn at East 149th and Courtlandt. He mounted the sidewalk, plowed into six pedestrians, then ran. All six went to the hospital. The car was left behind. The driver was not. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/driver-plows-into-six-people-after-botching-left-turn-in-the-bronx/>Police are still looking for him.</a> EMS called it minor. The sidewalk says otherwise.</p><p>A week later, a 79-year-old driver crashed into two cars and a pole. His passenger, Stella Nyarko-Dei, did not make it. Seven others were hurt. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/13/multi-car-crash-in-the-bronx-kills-71-year-old-woman-injures-seven-others/>&ldquo;The cause of the crash was not immediately known,&rdquo; police said.</a> The street keeps its secrets.</p><h2 id=the-system-moves-slow-as-asphalt>The System Moves, Slow as Asphalt</h2><p>The city has promised change. <strong>$45 million is now set aside to fix the deadly intersection at East 177th, Devoe, and East Tremont.</strong> Seventeen years late. In that time, at least 246 crashes, 358 injuries, and two deaths. <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/city-commits-45-million-redo-dangerous-three-way-intersection-bronx>&ldquo;We are excited to make progress on this key corridor,&rdquo; said Ian Michaels, city spokesperson.</a> The work will start later this year.

Motorcycles and mopeds took another life, left over 170 hurt. Bikes, too, are in the count—no deaths, but 86 injured. The numbers are not just numbers. They are bodies on the street.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph limit.

His sedan veered off course and struck three parked sedans. The report states, 'His sedan veered into three parked cars. The front end folded. He died at the scene. No skid marks. No sound. Just stillness and a crumpled hood.' The contributing factor listed is 'Lost Consciousness,' with 'Illness' also noted. The crash resulted in the death of the driver, who was the sole occupant of the moving vehicle. No pedestrians, cyclists, or other vehicle occupants were injured. The report does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor. The incident underscores the dangers that arise when a driver loses control, even momentarily, in a densely parked urban environment.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The report states, 'Traffic signal ignored.' The moped lay twisted in the dark, its rider showing no pulse. The contributing factor listed is 'Traffic Control Disregarded,' highlighting the BMW driver's failure to obey a traffic signal. The moped rider was unlicensed and wore no helmet, as noted in the police report, but these details are mentioned only after the primary driver error. The crash underscores the lethal consequences when drivers disregard traffic controls, with the vulnerable moped rider bearing the brunt of systemic danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
