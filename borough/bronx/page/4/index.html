The dead do not get a second chance. The injured carry scars the rest of us never see.</p><p><strong>Just two weeks ago, a driver in a Ford Mustang failed a left turn at East 149th and Courtlandt.

No one is spared. <strong>SUVs and sedans lead the body count.</strong></p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h2><p>Local leaders have talked about Vision Zero. They have promised safer streets. But the blood keeps flowing. <strong>Speed cameras are in place, but the citywide speed limit is still 25 mph.</strong> The power to lower it to 20 mph is there.

His sedan veered off course and struck three parked sedans. The report states, 'His sedan veered into three parked cars. The front end folded. He died at the scene. No skid marks. No sound. Just stillness and a crumpled hood.' The contributing factor listed is 'Lost Consciousness,' with 'Illness' also noted. The crash resulted in the death of the driver, who was the sole occupant of the moving vehicle. No pedestrians, cyclists, or other vehicle occupants were injured. The report does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor. The incident underscores the dangers that arise when a driver loses control, even momentarily, in a densely parked urban environment.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
