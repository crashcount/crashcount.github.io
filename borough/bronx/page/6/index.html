In the last twelve months alone, 38 lives ended and 119 more were shattered by injuries that do not heal. The bodies are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. They are the man thrown from his moped, the woman crossing White Plains Road, the two young riders who never made it home.</p><p>Just this week, <strong>two men on motorcycles were killed on the Bronx River Parkway</strong>. Police say a 21-year-old driver tried to pass, slammed into a car, then struck the riders. Both were thrown onto the road. Both died at the hospital. The driver was charged with DWI and manslaughter. The families ask why he walks free. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>“Two people were killed.

Trucks and buses killed 11 more. Motorcycles and mopeds: another death toll. Pedestrians and cyclists are left broken. The cause is not fate. It is speed, distraction, and a system that lets repeat offenders back behind the wheel.</p><h2 id=leaders-movebut-not-fast-enough>Leaders Move—But Not Fast Enough</h2><p>Local leaders have made noise. Albany renewed speed cameras. The city can now lower speed limits. But the default is still 25 mph. Cameras catch speeders, but the worst repeat offenders keep driving. The city has the power to set a 20 mph limit. It has not used it. The Stop Super Speeders Act sits in Albany. The dead keep coming.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>This is not an accident. It is a choice.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand action against repeat speeders. Join groups like Transportation Alternatives and Families for Safe Streets. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
