Neither does the violence on its streets. In the last twelve months, <strong>36 people have died</strong> and <strong>94 have been seriously injured</strong> in traffic crashes here (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The numbers are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors. They are the sound of sirens at midnight, the hush after a crash.</p><p>Just days ago, a driver in a Ford Mustang failed a left turn at East 149th and Courtlandt. He mounted the sidewalk and struck six people. The driver ran. The victims went to Lincoln Hospital. Their injuries were called minor, but the fear will last longer. Police are still looking for the man who left them behind. The Daily News <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/driver-plows-into-six-people-after-botching-left-turn-in-the-bronx/>reported</a> that &ldquo;Cops are looking for a man who rammed into six people after botching a turn at an intersection in the Bronx.&rdquo;</p><p>A week before, a 79-year-old driver crashed into two cars and a pole. His passenger, Stella Nyarko-Dei, died. Seven others were hurt. A witness <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/op-city-crash-multiple-people-injured-including-1-critically-bronx/17075710/>said</a>, &ldquo;I saw one lady was out on the ground. They was giving her medical attention.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=the-numbers-relentless-and-rising>The Numbers: Relentless and Rising</h2><p><strong>Over 10,000 crashes</strong> in the past year. <strong>6,909 injured.</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>) The Bronx is a slow-motion disaster. Most victims are not behind the wheel. They are walking, riding, waiting for a light to change. Cars and SUVs do the most harm: <strong>40 deaths and 74 serious injuries</strong> to pedestrians and cyclists since 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Trucks and buses killed 8, motorcycles and mopeds 1. Bikes caused none.</p><h2 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h2><p>City leaders have moved—slowly. The city now has the power to lower speed limits. Some streets are down to 20 mph. Speed cameras run day and night. But the default speed is still too high. Enforcement falls hardest on the vulnerable. Cyclists get tickets. Drivers get warnings. The dead stay dead.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next-demand-action>What Comes Next: Demand Action</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower the speed limit to 20 mph everywhere. Tell them to target the drivers who do the most harm. Tell them to stop blaming the people in the crosswalk. The Bronx bleeds. It does not have to.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report states that 'the light was ignored' and lists 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as a contributing factor, underscoring a critical driver error. The motorcyclist, described as unlicensed and not wearing a helmet, was ejected from his bike and suffered fatal head injuries upon impact with the pavement. The police report also notes 'Unsafe Speed' as a contributing factor. The crash resulted in the death of the motorcycle rider at the scene. The data highlights the deadly consequences of ignoring traffic signals and failing to observe safe speeds, with systemic danger compounded by the lack of licensing and safety equipment.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The crash occurred at 21:55. The report states the bicyclist suffered fatal head injuries and internal bleeding, dying at the scene. Police cite 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as a contributing factor, emphasizing that the right-of-way was not given. The narrative notes, 'No helmet. Head smashed. Internal bleeding. He died beneath the streetlights, where the right-of-way was not his, and no one yielded.' The police report does not list any victim behavior as a contributing factor prior to the collision. The focus remains on the failure to yield, a recurring danger on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The contributing factor listed is 'Traffic Control Disregarded.' This means a driver ignored a traffic signal, a critical error that led to the crash.

The report notes a parked box truck was present but was not involved in the collision. No driver or vehicle errors are attributed to the victim. The fatal outcome stemmed from a driver’s failure to obey traffic controls, as documented by police.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
