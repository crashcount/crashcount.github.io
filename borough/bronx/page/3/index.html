In the last twelve months, 35 people died and 97 suffered serious injuries on Bronx streets. Most were walking. Some were children. Some were old. All were loved by someone.</p><p>A 78-year-old woman tried to cross White Plains Road. She did not make it. The SUV kept going. Her family waited at Jacobi Hospital, but she was already gone. The driver stayed. There were no charges, as reported by the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/25/woman-78-fatally-struck-by-bronx-suv-driver/>NY Daily News</a>.</p><p>Kelvin Mitchell, a father, was crossing Webster Avenue. A black Mercedes hit him, dragged him half a block, and kept going. His mother <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bronx-pedestrian-killed-heartbroken-family-mourns-father-3-nyc-hit-run/16394341/>described the horror</a>: “That car deliberately went straight speeding, didn&rsquo;t stop, hit my son all the way up into the air and came down, dragged him half a block, they killed my son.”</p><h2 id=the-pattern-speed-silence-and-the-same-old-story>The Pattern: Speed, Silence, and the Same Old Story</h2><p>Speed kills. In the Bronx, the deadliest weapon is a car going too fast. In the last year, SUVs and sedans led the body count. Hit-and-run drivers vanish into the night. Families are left with questions and grief. “We shouldn’t be afraid to come outside,” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/11/sister-of-bronx-man-killed-by-hit-and-run-mercedes-driver-has-faith-driver-will-be-caught/>said Mitchell’s sister</a>. “Now a family is missing a loved one and it’s just not fair.”</p><h2 id=the-response-promises-laws-and-whats-missing>The Response: Promises, Laws, and What’s Missing</h2><p>Local leaders talk about Vision Zero. They say one death is too many. They point to new speed cameras and lower limits. But the cameras need Albany’s blessing every few years. The city can now set 20 mph limits, but most streets are still waiting. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. No new law has replaced it. The silence is loud.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next-demand-action-not-excuses>What Comes Next: Demand Action, Not Excuses</h2><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Tell them to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. Tell Albany to keep the speed cameras on. Join <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a> and <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a>. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p><p>Every day of delay is another family broken. Act now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
