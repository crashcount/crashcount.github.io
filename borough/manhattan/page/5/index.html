A stolen car, driven at over 100 miles per hour, tore through the intersection. Kevin Cruickshank was riding his bike. May Kwok sat on a bench. Both were killed. The city called it a tragedy. The Department of Transportation promised upgrades. But the blood on the sidewalk is still fresh. NY1 <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/07/chinatown-deadly-crash-safety-upgrades-canal-street>reported the stolen vehicle &ldquo;allegedly driven at more than 100 miles per hour&mldr;crashed into them.&rdquo;</a></p><p>In the last 12 months, Manhattan saw <strong>40 deaths</strong> and over <strong>7,000 injuries</strong> from crashes. <strong>146 people were seriously hurt.</strong> The dead include children, elders, cyclists, and people just trying to get home. The city counts the bodies. The rest of us count the empty chairs.</p><h2 id=promises-and-delays>Promises and Delays</h2><p>After the Canal Street crash, the city moved to add barriers and lower speed limits at that intersection. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>said the city is &ldquo;taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection while developing a long-term safety redesign for the entire Canal Street corridor.&rdquo;</a> But advocates warn most of Canal Street remains deadly. Seven people have died there since 2011. The city schedules meetings. The street stays the same.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p>The numbers are blunt. <strong>SUVs and cars killed 42 people</strong>. <strong>Trucks and buses killed 16</strong>. <strong>Bikes killed 2</strong>. <strong>Motorcycles and mopeds killed 1</strong>. The dead are not statistics. They are neighbors, friends, children. The city’s pace is slow. The crisis is not.</p><h2 id=what-now>What Now</h2><p><strong>Every day without action is another day of risk.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real redesigns, not just promises. The next victim is out there. Don’t wait until it’s someone you know.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
