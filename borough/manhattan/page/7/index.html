The crash occurred as the sedan’s right side door was opened directly into the cyclist’s path. The report lists 'Outside Car Distraction' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as contributing factors. The cyclist, a 25-year-old man, was conscious but bleeding heavily from his arm. The police report notes the cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this is mentioned only after the driver’s errors. The sedan was stationary, and its right rear quarter panel was damaged. The incident underscores the danger posed when drivers or passengers open doors without checking for oncoming cyclists, as detailed in the police narrative: 'No warning.
