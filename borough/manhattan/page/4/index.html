Eighty-seven seriously hurt.</strong> That’s just this year so far in Manhattan. The bodies do not stack up in one place. They scatter—on Canal, on the FDR, on the crosswalks and corners where people wait or walk or ride. The numbers are not abstract. They are flesh and bone.</p><p>Just last month, a car tore through Chinatown at over 100 miles per hour. Two people died. One sat on a bench. One rode a bike. The city called it a tragedy. The city promised change. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>&ldquo;As we mourn the loss of the victims of this horrific crash, we are taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection while developing a long-term safety redesign for the entire Canal Street corridor,&rdquo;</a> said Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. The city will add barriers, lower speed limits, and narrow lanes. But the rest of Canal remains as it was. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>&ldquo;Canal Street is only as safe as its most dangerous block, and even after these changes, the vast majority of the corridor will remain deadly,&rdquo;</a> said Ben Furnas. Seven have died on this corridor since 2011.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-that-never-breaks>The Pattern That Never Breaks</h3><p>The violence is not new. It is not rare. In the last twelve months, Manhattan saw <strong>27 deaths and 87 serious injuries</strong> from crashes. Cyclists, pedestrians, children. The old and the young. The city counts them. The city moves on.</p><p>The killers are not just cars. <strong>SUVs and cars killed 42, trucks and buses killed 16, motorcycles and mopeds killed 1, and bikes killed 2</strong> in the last three years. Buses, motorcycles, bikes—each leaves its mark. The most vulnerable pay the highest price.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>After the Chinatown crash, the city moved fast—on one intersection. The rest waits. The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has the power to redesign streets. It has the power to act. But action comes slow. Promises come easy.</p><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand barriers, daylighting, and real protection for people who walk and bike. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The SUV's point of impact was the center front end, and the vehicle was described as 'going straight ahead.' The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified' for both the driver and the pedestrian. The narrative notes the victim 'died there, alone, under the empty sky.' No specific driver errors are cited in the report, but the fatal outcome underscores the lethal risk vulnerable road users face on wide, fast-moving corridors like Canal Street.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The 57-year-old woman riding the e-bike, who was wearing a helmet, was struck and crushed at the hip. She died at the scene. The report lists 'Passing Too Closely' as the primary contributing factor, underscoring a critical driver error by the truck operator. The truck itself sustained no damage and continued on after the collision. The e-bike rider’s helmet use is noted in the report, but the fatal outcome was driven by the truck driver's failure to maintain a safe passing distance. The report offers no evidence of any error or contributing action by the e-bike rider.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
