Eighty-seven seriously hurt.</strong> That’s just this year so far in Manhattan. The bodies do not stack up in one place. They scatter—on Canal, on the FDR, on the crosswalks and corners where people wait or walk or ride. The numbers are not abstract. They are flesh and bone.</p><p>Just last month, a car tore through Chinatown at over 100 miles per hour. Two people died. One sat on a bench. One rode a bike. The city called it a tragedy. The city promised change. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>&ldquo;As we mourn the loss of the victims of this horrific crash, we are taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection while developing a long-term safety redesign for the entire Canal Street corridor,&rdquo;</a> said Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. The city will add barriers, lower speed limits, and narrow lanes. But the rest of Canal remains as it was. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>&ldquo;Canal Street is only as safe as its most dangerous block, and even after these changes, the vast majority of the corridor will remain deadly,&rdquo;</a> said Ben Furnas. Seven have died on this corridor since 2011.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-that-never-breaks>The Pattern That Never Breaks</h3><p>The violence is not new. It is not rare. In the last twelve months, Manhattan saw <strong>27 deaths and 87 serious injuries</strong> from crashes. Cyclists, pedestrians, children. The old and the young. The city counts them. The city moves on.</p><p>The killers are not just cars. <strong>SUVs and cars killed 42, trucks and buses killed 16, motorcycles and mopeds killed 1, and bikes killed 2</strong> in the last three years. Buses, motorcycles, bikes—each leaves its mark. The most vulnerable pay the highest price.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>After the Chinatown crash, the city moved fast—on one intersection. The rest waits. The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has the power to redesign streets. It has the power to act. But action comes slow. Promises come easy.</p><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand barriers, daylighting, and real protection for people who walk and bike. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Only fragments and silence left behind.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News reported on May 7, 2025, that federal officials released images showing a sightseeing helicopter breaking apart in midair before crashing into the Hudson River, killing six. The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The street stayed the same.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News reported on May 3, 2025, that George Smaragdis, known as synthwave artist Starcadian, died after being doored by a Mercedes van while riding his e-bike westbound on Broome Street in Manhattan. The impact threw him into the path of a red delivery truck, which ran him over. Police said Smaragdis suffered severe head trauma and died at Bellevue Hospital. The article notes, 'The man who died after being doored while riding an e-bike and then run over by a passing truck...was a popular and influential synthwave artist.' The crash highlights the ongoing danger of dooring and the lethal consequences when street design and driver actions fail to protect cyclists. No mention of charges or policy changes followed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
