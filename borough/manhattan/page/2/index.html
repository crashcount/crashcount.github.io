A cyclist pedals through Soho. A child waits at the crosswalk. The city does not stop for them. In the last twelve months, <strong>38 people died</strong> on Manhattan’s streets. <strong>128 were seriously injured</strong>. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old. Two children under 18 are dead. Seven people over 75, gone.

On West End Avenue, a 74-year-old cyclist died after colliding with a bus. The city’s most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, the old—pay the price.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-delays-and-the-fight-for-change>Leadership: Promises, Delays, and the Fight for Change</h2><p>The city says it is acting. Speed cameras now run day and night. The law is called Sammy’s Law. It lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit has not changed yet. The law sits, waiting for leaders to act.</p><p>The NYPD cracks down on cyclists and delivery workers. Hundreds of tickets for minor bike violations. Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives called it a <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/cyclists-protest-nypd-criminalization-push-against-bikers-for-traffic-infractions-AD4665020>“really inappropriate escalation”</a>.

It is not the drivers getting tickets. It is the people outside the cars.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next-the-cost-of-waiting>What Comes Next: The Cost of Waiting</h2><p><strong>Every day the city waits, another family risks losing someone.</strong> The law is there. The cameras are there. The deaths keep coming. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Tell them to protect the vulnerable, not punish them. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
