The SUV was stationary at the time, with no damage reported. The injured rider suffered severe head bleeding but remained conscious. The police report notes the use of a helmet by the rider. No driver errors from the parked SUV are cited; the focus remains on the chain of events triggered by traffic conditions and the presence of large, stationary vehicles on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
