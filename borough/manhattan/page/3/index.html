A truck keeps moving. The man does not get up. In the last twelve months, 39 people died on Manhattan streets. More than 5,500 were hurt. 128 suffered injuries so grave they may never walk right again. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about age. Children, elders, cyclists, workers—none are spared.

They say one death is too many. They point to new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and the power to lower speed limits. But the streets still bleed. The city can now set speeds at 20 mph. It has not done so. Cameras that catch speeders may go dark if Albany does not act. The mayor says, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>&ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many&rdquo;</a>—but every week, another family learns what that means.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p>Call your council member.
