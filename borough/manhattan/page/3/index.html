He swerves to avoid a pedestrian in the crosswalk. He flies from the saddle, strikes his head on the curb, and dies at Mount Sinai Morningside. The pedestrian walks away with a cut hand. The city marks another death. <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/biker-dies-in-central-park-accident-with-pedestrian-YA4736414>A 43-year-old Bronx resident died on June 18 after flying from an e-bike and striking his head on the curb.</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>39 people have died</strong> on Manhattan’s streets. <strong>124 suffered serious injuries</strong>. The dead include children, the old, and the nameless. The living carry scars. In three years, 112 have died. Over 18,000 have been hurt. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars kill most often.</strong> Trucks, buses, bikes, and mopeds all take their share. Of the pedestrians struck, 38 died under the wheels of cars or SUVs. Trucks and buses killed 15. Bikes killed 2. The city counts the bodies. The city moves on.</p><p>A 74-year-old cyclist dies after a crash with a bus on West End Avenue. A 57-year-old man is crushed by an SUV on Broadway. A child is killed crossing Manhattan Avenue. The stories do not end. They only pause for breath.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-waiting>Leadership: Words and Waiting</h3><p>City leaders say the right things. They promise zero deaths. They pass laws. They install cameras. But the pace is slow. &ldquo;In order to make New York City the best place to raise a family, we need to be safer at every level — including on our streets,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/cyclist-fell-hit-head-swerving-avoid-pedestrian-central-park-has-died/16785901/>said Mayor Eric Adams</a>. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so. Cameras that catch speeders need Albany’s blessing to keep running. Each day of delay is another risk, another family left with a hole.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Demand the city lower speed limits now. Tell Albany to keep the speed cameras running.

The incident occurred early in the morning when the motorcycle, traveling south, lost control on slippery pavement and collided head-on with a southbound SUV. The police report lists 'Pavement Slippery' as a contributing factor. The rider, who was helmeted, was ejected from the motorcycle and suffered severe head trauma, resulting in apparent death at the scene. The motorcycle was described as 'demolished,' and blood was visible on the road. Both vehicles sustained front-end damage. No driver errors such as speeding or failure to yield are cited in the report, but the hazardous road surface is explicitly noted. The victim's helmet use is mentioned in the police report after the primary contributing factor of the slick pavement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
