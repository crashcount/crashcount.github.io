They are the old man crushed by an SUV on West 77th. The cyclist killed on Broome Street. The child who never made it across Manhattan Avenue. Just last month, a city worker fixing a sign was slashed by an e-bike rider after a near miss. The DOT called it an <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/dot-worker-slashed-by-e-biker-manhattan/>&ldquo;abhorrent assault&rdquo;</a>. The worker bled on the sidewalk. The rider fled.</p><p>In Central Park, a 72-year-old woman was hit twice by cyclists. She suffered kidney damage. The police never followed up. &ldquo;<strong>Ninety percent of their crashes have no police report and in 90 percent of these crashes over 90 percent the rider flees the scene,</strong>&rdquo; <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/she-was-hit-twice-by-bikes-in-central-park-and-says-nypd-never-followed-up-IH4810802>she said</a>. &ldquo;<strong>It is so much worse than the DOT stats show.</strong>&rdquo;</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-weight>Who Bears the Weight</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the killing.</strong> They are behind 39 pedestrian deaths and over 3,400 injuries. Trucks and buses add 16 more dead. Bikes and mopeds, too, leave their mark—2 killed by bikes, 1 by mopeds. But the scale is not the same. The street is a field of unequal force.</p><p><strong>The city has moved.</strong> Speed limits are dropping. Cameras catch speeders day and night. Intersections are cleared for sightlines. But the work is not done. The city can set a 20 mph limit everywhere. It has not. The most dangerous drivers still roam. The laws to stop them wait in Albany.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another family broken.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand action against repeat speeders. <strong>Do not wait for the next siren.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The narrative notes she was alone, in the dark, and not at an intersection. The data does not list any victim behavior as a contributing factor.
