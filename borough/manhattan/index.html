These are not just numbers. They are people—cyclists, seniors, children—struck down on their way home, to work, or simply living their lives.</p><p>Just this week, a 65-year-old man on an e-bike was hit on Second Avenue. The driver fled. The cyclist was left with severe head trauma, &ldquo;unconscious when paramedics arrived&rdquo; and rushed to Bellevue Hospital in critical condition (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/30/hit-and-run-rogue-driver-caught-after-seriously-injuring-cycling-senior-in-heart-of-the-city>Streetsblog NYC</a>). The unlicensed driver was arrested two hours later (<a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/driver-arrested-after-collision-with-e-biker-on-second-ave-XF4896347>West Side Spirit</a>).</p><p>On July 19th, a speeding car flew off the Manhattan Bridge, killing Kevin Cruickshank, a cyclist, and May Kwok, who was sitting on a bench. Guns and alcohol were found in the car. The intersection was &ldquo;known to some to be very dangerous.&rdquo; Kevin’s sister said, &ldquo;It is time to make this known to all and time for the city to take action&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/fatal-manhattan-bridge-crash-driver-indicted-for-murder-KB4883851>West Side Spirit</a>).</p><h2 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not used it. Speed cameras are renewed, but the worst repeat offenders still drive. Council Member Christopher Marte called out the Department of Transportation for &ldquo;ongoing neglect&rdquo; after the bridge crash (<a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/manhattan-bridge-crash-driver-faces-murder-rap-marte-blasts-dot-for-neglect-KB4883851>West Side Spirit</a>).</p><p>Bills sit in Albany that could force the most dangerous drivers off the road. The Stop Super Speeders Act would require repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. It is not law yet.</p><h2 id=the-numbers-behind-the-blood>The Numbers Behind the Blood</h2><p><strong>The violence is relentless.</strong> In the last year, Manhattan saw <strong>6,942 injuries</strong> and <strong>140 serious injuries</strong>. The dead are mostly the old, the young, the ones on foot or bike. Cars and SUVs do most of the killing. Trucks, buses, motorcycles, and bikes all play their part. The city counts the bodies. The rest of us count the days until the next siren.</p><h2 id=what-now-demand-action>What Now: Demand Action</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor.</strong> Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real penalties for repeat speeders. Demand streets built for people, not cars. Every day of delay is another family broken.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

He crashed head-on into Kirk Walker and Rob McLaurin, killing both. The teen, Jimmy Connors, fled, leaving his injured passenger. The article states, “Walker, 38, was one day from his wedding when he and McLaurin were killed.” An off-duty NYPD officer pursued Connors but did not call 911. The lawsuit names the driver, club, NYPD, and city, raising questions about underage drinking enforcement and police response.

Buses crawl now. Riders wait. DOT wants faster trips, safer crossings. Community boards back the plan. Painted lanes, fewer cars, more eyes on the street. Change comes for riders and walkers.</p><p class=mb3>West Side Spirit reported on May 20, 2025, that the Department of Transportation (DOT) has proposed turning 34th Street into a mostly car-free busway, modeled after the 14th Street busway. The plan comes with support from three local community boards. According to the article, 'bus speeds on 14th Street increased by at least 24 percent, and bus ridership grew by 30 percent' after similar changes. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'far fewer New Yorkers are getting hurt in crashes' since the 14th Street redesign. The 34th Street proposal would divert most cars, add painted intersections for visibility, and focus on pedestrian safety. The move targets slow bus speeds—now just 3 mph—and aims to reduce systemic danger for bus riders and people on foot. No driver errors are cited, but the plan addresses longstanding risks from car traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
