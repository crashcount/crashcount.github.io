The driver made a U-turn, hit her, then ran. The officers checked the victim, then left. The car sat abandoned. The street stayed the same. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>&ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time,&rdquo; a woman named Nita said.</a></p><p>A few blocks away, a 65-year-old e-bike rider was left with head trauma after an unlicensed driver hit him and fled. The driver later confessed. The cyclist was taken to Bellevue, alive but critical. <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/driver-arrested-after-hitting-65-year-old-e-biker-on-second-ave-XF4896347>&ldquo;He told police he fled initially because he did not have a license.&rdquo;</a></p><p>On Madison Avenue, eight people were hurt when a car and SUV crashed into scaffolding. No charges. No answers. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/2-vehicle-crash-upper-east-side-scaffolding-injures-8-people-manhattan/17376667/>&ldquo;There is no word on the cause of the crash. So far, no charges have been filed.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>In the last 12 months, 39 people died and 140 suffered serious injuries on Manhattan streets. Over 6,900 were hurt.</strong> The numbers rise. The names fade.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h2><p>City leaders have made moves. The city legalized jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable and left reckless drivers unchecked. The Fifth Avenue redesign promises wider sidewalks, fewer car lanes, and more space for people. But the blood on the street says it’s not enough. Speed kills, and the city still drags its feet on lowering limits. Cameras catch some, but not the worst. Repeat offenders keep driving. The city has the power to set a 20 mph limit. It has not used it.</p><h2 id=the-system-fails-the-most-vulnerable>The System Fails the Most Vulnerable</h2><p><strong>Most victims are not behind the wheel.</strong> Pedestrians and cyclists take the hit. SUVs and cars do the most damage, but trucks, buses, and even bikes leave scars. The city’s response is slow, uneven, and often silent. The pain is not shared equally. The danger is not random. It is built into the street.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph citywide speed limit. Demand real protection for people, not just promises.</strong> Every day of delay is another life at risk. The crisis is not an accident. It is a choice. Make them choose differently.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

District Attorney Alvin Bragg called it a 'life-threatening act of domestic violence in our transit system.' Valdez fled but was arrested hours later.

The suspect, Miguel Jiraud, was arraigned on attempted murder and assault charges. Prosecutors said Jiraud, on parole and wearing a GPS anklet, attacked Agudela after 11:30 p.m., stole her e-bike, and discarded it in the East River. Agudela is not expected to survive, having undergone multiple brain surgeries. The article quotes Agudela’s daughter: “We need more protection, we need more lights.” The path where the attack occurred lacked lighting and surveillance. The incident highlights gaps in infrastructure and safety for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Only fragments and silence left behind.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News reported on May 7, 2025, that federal officials released images showing a sightseeing helicopter breaking apart in midair before crashing into the Hudson River, killing six. The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
