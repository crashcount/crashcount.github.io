She suffered grave brain injuries. The assailant stole her bike, fled, and dumped it in the river. The path had no lights, no cameras. She was left defenseless.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist reported on May 24, 2025, that Diana Agudela, a 44-year-old e-bike commuter, was brutally beaten on Randall's Island on May 16. The suspect, Miguel Jiraud, was arraigned on attempted murder and assault charges. Prosecutors said Jiraud, on parole and wearing a GPS anklet, attacked Agudela after 11:30 p.m., stole her e-bike, and discarded it in the East River. Agudela is not expected to survive, having undergone multiple brain surgeries. The article quotes Agudela’s daughter: “We need more protection, we need more lights.” The path where the attack occurred lacked lighting and surveillance. The incident highlights gaps in infrastructure and safety for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
