The toll keeps climbing.</h1><p class="byline f6 silver">Written August 26, 2025 <em>(Revised August 26, 2025 – Minor stats refresh)</em></p></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>Manhattan: Jan 1, 2022 - Aug 26, 2025</h2><p>A man on a bike died on the park drive.</p><p>On June 18, a 43-year-old bicyclist was killed on East Drive near the 97th Street Transverse. The city’s crash record lists his injury as “Head,” “Internal,” and “Apparent Death.” No other vehicle is recorded. The lone vehicle is an e‑bike, “Going Straight Ahead.” The dataset marks the rider as “Unlicensed.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City data</a> IDs the case as CrashID 4821445.</p><p>Across Manhattan, the ledger fills.</p><p>Since 2022, the borough logged 43,318 crashes, with 21,433 injuries and 126 deaths. SUVs and cars inflicted the most harm on people walking: 3,851 pedestrian injuries and 42 pedestrian deaths tied to those vehicles. Trucks and buses add 415 pedestrian injuries and 16 deaths. Bikes and micromobility are part of the toll too, with 538 pedestrian injuries and 2 deaths. These counts come straight from the city’s dataset window through August 26, 2025. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the numbers</a>.</p><p>The summer brought more names.</p><p>On July 29, at 2nd Avenue and East 15th Street, a 65-year-old bicyclist was killed. The record lists the SUV as “Going Straight Ahead.” The rider is marked “Ejected.” Injury: “Head.” Cause code on the crash: “Traffic Control Disregarded.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The city’s file</a> identifies it as CrashID 4831391.</p><p>Another driver died behind the wheel on York Avenue at East 83rd Street on July 13. The file says “Lost Consciousness.” CrashID 4832831. And a 31-year-old motorcyclist died on the FDR on July 24, listed “Apparent Death,” ejected. CrashID 4830014. These are not outliers. They are the daily count.</p><p>Speed runs the city.</p><p>In Chinatown, a driver in a stolen car hit at more than 100 mph off the Manhattan Bridge. Two people died at Bowery and Canal. The transportation commissioner said, “we are taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection,” while a city planner warned “the vast majority of the corridor will remain deadly.” <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Gothamist quoted both</a>. <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/07/chinatown-deadly-crash-safety-upgrades-canal-street>NY1 named the victims</a> and reported planned upgrades.</p><p>The violence does not spare the old. Or the young.</p><p>In the last 12 months, 39 people died in Manhattan crashes. Eleven were 65–74; seven were 75+. The year-to-date toll is already higher than last year’s pace: crashes up 28%, injuries up 33%, serious injuries up 36% compared to the same period last year. The city’s own roll-up shows it. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See PeriodStats</a>.</p><p>Streets change after funerals.</p><p>After the Chinatown deaths, the city promised barriers, narrowed lanes, and lower limits at the crash corner. “Immediate steps,” said the commissioner. But the rest of Canal waits. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Read the plan and the warning</a>. On 14th Street, the city says a redesign begins next year “to improve the pedestrian experience,” backed by public and BID dollars. <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/15/redesign-of-14th-street-to-kick-off-next-year>NY1 reported the funding and scope</a>.</p><p>The fixes we need are not a mystery.</p><p>Lower speeds save lives. Albany passed Sammy’s Law; the city can set safer limits. Habitual speeders do outsized harm; state lawmakers have a bill to force speed limiters on the worst offenders. New Yorkers are already organizing for both. Start here, and push them to act.</p><p>Take one step today. Ask the city to slow our streets and the state to stop repeat speeders. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action</a>.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Kwok sat on a bench; Cruickshank rode his bike. The article reports, "The driver hit Cruickshank first, throwing him off his bicycle and across the intersection. Kwok was then thrown from the bench." Prosecutors allege the driver and passenger tried to flee after the crash. Authorities found alcohol and firearms in the car.
