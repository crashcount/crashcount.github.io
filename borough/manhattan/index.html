Eighty-seven seriously hurt.</strong> That’s just this year so far in Manhattan. The bodies do not stack up in one place. They scatter—on Canal, on the FDR, on the crosswalks and corners where people wait or walk or ride. The numbers are not abstract. They are flesh and bone.</p><p>Just last month, a car tore through Chinatown at over 100 miles per hour. Two people died. One sat on a bench. One rode a bike. The city called it a tragedy. The city promised change. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>&ldquo;As we mourn the loss of the victims of this horrific crash, we are taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection while developing a long-term safety redesign for the entire Canal Street corridor,&rdquo;</a> said Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. The city will add barriers, lower speed limits, and narrow lanes. But the rest of Canal remains as it was. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>&ldquo;Canal Street is only as safe as its most dangerous block, and even after these changes, the vast majority of the corridor will remain deadly,&rdquo;</a> said Ben Furnas. Seven have died on this corridor since 2011.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-that-never-breaks>The Pattern That Never Breaks</h3><p>The violence is not new. It is not rare. In the last twelve months, Manhattan saw <strong>27 deaths and 87 serious injuries</strong> from crashes. Cyclists, pedestrians, children. The old and the young. The city counts them. The city moves on.</p><p>The killers are not just cars. <strong>SUVs and cars killed 42, trucks and buses killed 16, motorcycles and mopeds killed 1, and bikes killed 2</strong> in the last three years. Buses, motorcycles, bikes—each leaves its mark. The most vulnerable pay the highest price.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>After the Chinatown crash, the city moved fast—on one intersection. The rest waits. The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has the power to redesign streets. It has the power to act. But action comes slow. Promises come easy.</p><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand barriers, daylighting, and real protection for people who walk and bike. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The city’s system failed again.</p><p class=mb3>According to the New York Post (2025-06-07), Abdulhekim Esiyok, a 23-year-old Turkish immigrant, was killed while crossing Third Avenue after Mahbub Ali, allegedly intoxicated, drove into him. Prosecutors say Ali drank for nearly six hours at three Manhattan bars, reaching a blood alcohol content of .158, almost twice the legal limit. After hitting Esiyok, Ali continued, injuring a cyclist, two more pedestrians, and crashing into a van. The family’s lawsuit cites New York’s Dram Shop Act, which holds bars liable for serving visibly drunk patrons who later cause harm. The article quotes the family’s lawyer: “The family is devastated. They’re still in disbelief.” The case highlights failures in both driver responsibility and alcohol-serving oversight.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident left a family demanding accountability. The report highlights that officers, rather than assisting or remaining at the scene, drove away. This raises questions about police conduct and response protocols after crashes. The case underscores systemic failures in post-crash procedures and the need for transparent investigation when law enforcement is involved. The article does not detail the crash mechanics or the victims, focusing instead on the officers' actions and the family's call for answers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
