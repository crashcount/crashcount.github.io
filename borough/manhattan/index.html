He swerves to avoid a pedestrian in the crosswalk. He flies from the saddle, strikes his head on the curb, and dies at Mount Sinai Morningside. The pedestrian walks away with a cut hand. The city marks another death. <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/biker-dies-in-central-park-accident-with-pedestrian-YA4736414>A 43-year-old Bronx resident died on June 18 after flying from an e-bike and striking his head on the curb.</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>39 people have died</strong> on Manhattan’s streets. <strong>124 suffered serious injuries</strong>. The dead include children, the old, and the nameless. The living carry scars. In three years, 112 have died. Over 18,000 have been hurt. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars kill most often.</strong> Trucks, buses, bikes, and mopeds all take their share. Of the pedestrians struck, 38 died under the wheels of cars or SUVs. Trucks and buses killed 15. Bikes killed 2. The city counts the bodies. The city moves on.</p><p>A 74-year-old cyclist dies after a crash with a bus on West End Avenue. A 57-year-old man is crushed by an SUV on Broadway. A child is killed crossing Manhattan Avenue. The stories do not end. They only pause for breath.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-waiting>Leadership: Words and Waiting</h3><p>City leaders say the right things. They promise zero deaths. They pass laws. They install cameras. But the pace is slow. &ldquo;In order to make New York City the best place to raise a family, we need to be safer at every level — including on our streets,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/cyclist-fell-hit-head-swerving-avoid-pedestrian-central-park-has-died/16785901/>said Mayor Eric Adams</a>. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so. Cameras that catch speeders need Albany’s blessing to keep running. Each day of delay is another risk, another family left with a hole.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Demand the city lower speed limits now. Tell Albany to keep the speed cameras running.

Prosecutors say Ali drank for nearly six hours at three Manhattan bars, reaching a blood alcohol content of .158, almost twice the legal limit. After hitting Esiyok, Ali continued, injuring a cyclist, two more pedestrians, and crashing into a van. The family’s lawsuit cites New York’s Dram Shop Act, which holds bars liable for serving visibly drunk patrons who later cause harm. The article quotes the family’s lawyer: “The family is devastated. They’re still in disbelief.” The case highlights failures in both driver responsibility and alcohol-serving oversight.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The pedestrian was not in a crosswalk or at a signal. The report states the driver was unlicensed, operating a 2019 Nissan SUV registered in Connecticut. The impact caused fatal crush injuries, and the man died at the scene. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified.' The narrative details the pedestrian's location as 'not at intersection' and 'crossing, no signal or crosswalk,' but does not cite these as contributing factors. The focus remains on the unlicensed status of the driver and the fatal outcome on a major city roadway.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The report states she was 'crossing with the light' in the crosswalk when a Ford SUV, making a left turn, struck her with its left front bumper. She suffered fatal injuries to her lower leg and died at the scene. The police report lists 'Outside Car Distraction' and 'Reaction to Uninvolved Vehicle' as contributing factors on the part of the driver. The victim’s actions—crossing with the signal—are noted, but the crash was precipitated by the driver’s failure to yield and inattention. The system allowed an ordinary turn to become deadly.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
