A stolen car, driven at over 100 miles per hour, tore through the intersection. Kevin Cruickshank was riding his bike. May Kwok sat on a bench. Both were killed. The city called it a tragedy. The Department of Transportation promised upgrades. But the blood on the sidewalk is still fresh. NY1 <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/07/chinatown-deadly-crash-safety-upgrades-canal-street>reported the stolen vehicle &ldquo;allegedly driven at more than 100 miles per hour&mldr;crashed into them.&rdquo;</a></p><p>In the last 12 months, Manhattan saw <strong>40 deaths</strong> and over <strong>7,000 injuries</strong> from crashes. <strong>146 people were seriously hurt.</strong> The dead include children, elders, cyclists, and people just trying to get home. The city counts the bodies. The rest of us count the empty chairs.</p><h2 id=promises-and-delays>Promises and Delays</h2><p>After the Canal Street crash, the city moved to add barriers and lower speed limits at that intersection. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>said the city is &ldquo;taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection while developing a long-term safety redesign for the entire Canal Street corridor.&rdquo;</a> But advocates warn most of Canal Street remains deadly. Seven people have died there since 2011. The city schedules meetings. The street stays the same.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p>The numbers are blunt. <strong>SUVs and cars killed 42 people</strong>. <strong>Trucks and buses killed 16</strong>. <strong>Bikes killed 2</strong>. <strong>Motorcycles and mopeds killed 1</strong>. The dead are not statistics. They are neighbors, friends, children. The city’s pace is slow. The crisis is not.</p><h2 id=what-now>What Now</h2><p><strong>Every day without action is another day of risk.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real redesigns, not just promises. The next victim is out there. Don’t wait until it’s someone you know.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The fuselage, rotor, and tail tore loose. Loud bangs echoed. The craft plunged. No black box. No warning. Only fragments and silence left behind.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News reported on May 7, 2025, that federal officials released images showing a sightseeing helicopter breaking apart in midair before crashing into the Hudson River, killing six. The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
