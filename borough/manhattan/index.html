A stolen car flew off the Manhattan Bridge, hitting a cyclist and a woman on a bench. Both were killed instantly. The driver was clocked at over 100 miles per hour. The city called it a tragedy and moved on. <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/07/chinatown-deadly-crash-safety-upgrades-canal-street>&ldquo;Kwok had been sitting on a bench and Cruickshank was riding his bike toward the Manhattan Bridge on a sidewalk at the time of the crash.&rdquo;</a></p><p>Just weeks before, a bus crushed a man at 3rd Avenue and 28th Street. He died at the intersection. Another cyclist died in Central Park, ejected from his e-bike. The numbers keep rising. In the last twelve months, Manhattan saw 40 deaths, 147 serious injuries, and over 13,000 crashes. The dead are not numbers. They are people who never came home.</p><h3 id=leadership-movesand-waits>Leadership Moves—And Waits</h3><p>After the Canal Street crash, the city promised changes. The Department of Transportation said, <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>&ldquo;We are taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection while developing a long-term safety redesign for the entire Canal Street corridor.&rdquo;</a> Barriers will go up. Lanes will narrow. But most of Canal Street stays the same. Seven have died on this corridor since 2011. The city schedules meetings. The street keeps killing.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>SUVs and cars do most of the damage. In three years, they killed 42 people walking or biking in Manhattan. Trucks and buses killed 16. Motorcycles and mopeds killed one. Bikes killed two. The rest is silence.</p><h3 id=what-next-the-call-that-matters>What Next? The Call That Matters</h3><p>This is not fate. These deaths are preventable. The city can lower speed limits. It can redesign streets. It can end the carnage. But only if you force them. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand real change. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
