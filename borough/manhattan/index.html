Since 2022, <strong>117 people have died</strong> and <strong>376 have been seriously injured</strong> in crashes. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about age or luck. In the last twelve months alone, 35 people died. Six were over 75. One was a child. The city counts the bodies. The families count the empty chairs.</p><p>Just last week, a DOT worker was slashed by an e-bike rider at Broadway and Cedar. The worker was fixing a sign. The cyclist nearly hit the truck. Words were exchanged. Then a blade. The DOT called it an <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/dot-worker-slashed-by-e-biker-manhattan/>&ldquo;abhorrent assault of a NYC DOT employee who performs critical work to keep our city moving&rdquo;</a>. The worker survived. The wound will heal. The fear will not.</p><p>On July 15, a van crashed in Midtown. Police found <strong>76 propane tanks and 75 gallons of gasoline</strong> inside. The driver was charged with reckless endangerment. A woman and a child sat in a parked car, struck by a loose food cart. They went to the hospital. The city was lucky this time. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/cops-bust-minivan-driver-in-manhattan-for-carrying-propane-tanks/>Firefighters forced entry into the van, removing 76 20-pound propane cylinders and 15 five-gallon fuel containers</a>.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the highest price.</strong> SUVs and cars killed 39. Trucks and buses killed 16. Bikes killed 2. The old and the young are not spared. The street does not care if you are careful. It does not care if you have the light. The street remembers only the dead.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>The city has moved. Speed limits are dropping. Cameras now watch day and night. The city touts a historic drop in deaths, but the work is not done. Every day, drivers speed. Every day, someone does not come home. The law lets the city set a 20 mph limit. The city has not done it. The council has not forced the issue. The mayor has not signed the order. The blood dries. The street waits.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit for every street.</strong> Demand action against repeat speeders. Do not wait for another name on the list. The street will not wait. The city will not save itself. Only you can force their hand.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Video shows the vehicles touching in a V shape. Investigator Nelson Yu, a retired NYPD detective, confronted the woman, demanding identification and handcuffing her after she failed to produce ID. Yu ordered, 'Get out of the car and show some ID,' and later, 'Get in the car! You're not going anywhere!' The woman was placed in the back seat of Yu’s vehicle. The arrest was later voided. The Attorney General’s office stated, 'OAG is investigating this matter internally and will not have further comment at this time.'

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing.
