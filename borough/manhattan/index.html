Since January 2022, <strong>122 people have died</strong> in crashes. <strong>385 more were seriously injured</strong>. In the last twelve months alone, <strong>40 killed, 136 left with life-altering wounds</strong>. These are not numbers. They are mornings that never ended, plans that never happened, families that will never be whole again.</p><p>Just this weekend, a stolen car jumped the curb at Canal and Bowery. <strong>Kevin Cruickshank was riding his bike. May Kwok was sitting on a bench. Both are dead.</strong> Police say the driver lost control and struck them before crashing into a police van. &ldquo;It appears to be excessive speed. Two people are in custody, unfortunate incident. No one should lose their life in that manner,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/man-morning-bike-ride-killed-among-victims-chinatown-crash-2-women-arrested/17215969/>said Mayor Eric Adams</a>. Drugs and alcohol were found in the car. The driver had a prior arrest for unlicensed driving after a Brooklyn crash in April. She was released without bail. Three months later, two more are dead. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/20/driver-who-killed-2-in-chinatown-crash-was-out-without-bail-for-april-hit-run-nypd-sources/>&ldquo;The out-of-control driver&mldr; had been freed without bail in April after she was arrested for leaving the scene of a crash that badly injured a pedestrian,&rdquo;</a> reported the Daily News.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> In the last year, children, the elderly, and working people have been killed or maimed. SUVs and sedans do most of the harm, but trucks, buses, and bikes all leave their mark. The city’s own data shows that cars and SUVs alone were involved in <strong>over 3,700 pedestrian injuries and deaths</strong> since 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The violence is steady. It does not let up.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>City Hall has moved, but not fast enough.</strong> The city legalized jaywalking, ending a law that punished Black and Latino New Yorkers for crossing the street. Fifth Avenue is being rebuilt for people, not cars. Police chases are now limited to violent crimes, after too many ended in blood. But the speed limit remains too high. The city has the power to lower it to 20 mph. It has not. Each day of delay is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat dangerous drivers. <strong>Do not wait for the next name.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing.
