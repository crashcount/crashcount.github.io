One hundred forty-six suffered injuries so grave they may never walk right again.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a stolen car tore through Chinatown at 100 miles per hour. It struck a woman on a bench and a man on his bike. Both died where they landed. The driver tried to run. The police found guns and a bottle in the car.
