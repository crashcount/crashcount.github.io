Another 6,298 have been hurt. Fifty-seven suffered injuries so grave they will not forget them. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, parents, children. They are the man crossing Hylan Boulevard, struck down a block from home (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/driver-fatally-strikes-80-year-old-staten-island-man-a-block-from-his-home-police-say>Elderly Pedestrian Killed on Hylan Boulevard</a>). They are the rider thrown from his motorcycle on Bay Street, helmet on, body broken.</p><p><strong>Just last month, a 34-year-old motorcyclist died after colliding with a Toyota making a K-turn on Bay Street.</strong> Police said the driver was &ldquo;making a K-turn from the northbound lane&mldr; into its southbound lane when the collision occurred&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/staten-island-motorcyclist-killed-k-turn-07062025/>amNY</a>). The NYPD&rsquo;s Collision Investigation Squad is still working. No arrests. No comfort for the family.</p><p>In May, a 58-year-old man was killed crossing Targee Street by an e-scooter. The driver was thrown from the scooter. The pedestrian died of &ldquo;severe trauma throughout his body&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/bronx-man-killed-by-e-scooter-driver-05172025/>amNY</a>). No charges. Only loss.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>Most victims are not behind the wheel.</strong> Trucks and SUVs kill more pedestrians than anything else. In three years, SUVs and cars took 10 lives and left 809 more with injuries. Trucks and buses killed 7, hurt 73. Motorcycles and mopeds killed none, but left their mark. Bikes injured a handful. The street is not safe for anyone on foot.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p><strong>The city has started to act.</strong> Speed cameras run day and night. The law now lets New York City lower speed limits. But the pace is slow. The dead pile up while leaders debate. Mayor Adams called out the danger: &ldquo;New Yorkers have strong feelings about illegal mopeds and scooters, because we hear it all the time, especially when they are driving the wrong way down streets or sidewalks or in the dark without lights&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/nyc-officials-destroy-illegal-mopeds-nypd-06132025/>amNY</a>).</p><p>But the work is not done. Cameras and crackdowns are not enough. Streets need to be rebuilt for people, not just cars. Every day without action is another day someone does not come home.</p><h3 id=what-next-demand-more>What Next? Demand More</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower the speed limit, redesign the streets, and end the bloodletting. Do not wait for another name on the list. Demand action now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
