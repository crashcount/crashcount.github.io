Sixty-seven left with injuries that will not heal.</strong> These are not distant tragedies. They are neighbors, children, elders. In the last twelve months alone, <strong>nine people have died and 1,571 have been hurt</strong> on Staten Island’s streets (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Just last month, a 16-year-old on an e-scooter was killed on College Avenue. Police said, &ldquo;Ellis suffered head trauma as a result of the crash&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>Teen E-Scooter Rider Killed In Crash</a>). Days later, a motorcyclist died after slamming into a car making a K-turn on Bay Street. The police report was blunt: &ldquo;A motorcyclist was killed after colliding with a driver awkwardly turning their car on Staten Island&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/staten-island-motorcyclist-killed-k-turn-07062025/>Motorcyclist Dies In Staten Island K-Turn Crash</a>).</p><p>In May, a 58-year-old man was crossing Targee Street when an e-scooter struck him. He died at the hospital. The story was the same: a man crossing the street, a fast-moving machine, and then the silence. &ldquo;Gomez-Guallazaca suffered severe trauma throughout his body and was later pronounced dead at Richmond University Medical Center&rdquo; (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/18/us-news/e-scooter-fatally-plows-into-pedestrian-on-nyc-street-cops/>E-Scooter Kills Pedestrian On Staten Island</a>).</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage.</strong> Of the pedestrians hurt or killed, 11 died at the hands of cars or SUVs, with hundreds more injured. Trucks and buses killed 9. Motorcycles and mopeds, 0 deaths but several injuries. Bikes, none. The pattern is clear. The bigger the machine, the greater the harm (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=leaders-move-but-not-fast-enough>Leaders Move, But Not Fast Enough</h3><p>Local officials have made noise. They have renewed speed cameras and talked of safer streets. But the bodies keep coming. Laws that shift blame to the dead—jaywalking bans, helmet crackdowns—do not stop the killing. <strong>Every week that passes without real change is another week of blood on the asphalt.</strong></p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand streets built for people, not machines. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Mayor Eric Adams and Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch oversaw the event, where a Sanitation Department bulldozer crushed the vehicles. Adams said, 'New Yorkers have strong feelings about illegal mopeds and scooters, especially when they are driving the wrong way down streets or sidewalks or in the dark without lights.' The city links these vehicles to traffic violations and crimes, including robberies and reckless riding. Since Adams took office, police have removed about 62,000 illegal vehicles, aiming to reduce hazards for pedestrians. NYPD data shows a 57% drop in moped-related crime in 2025.

The SUV was traveling straight ahead with two occupants; the Volvo was also moving straight before impact. The police narrative describes the crash as a violent collision that left the sedan’s driver dead at the scene. No contributing factors are attributed to the SUV or its occupants. The focus remains on the deadly force of the rear-end impact and the systemic danger posed by such collisions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
