NYC began lowering some speed limits after Sammy’s Law. The next step is to set a <strong>default 20 MPH</strong> on residential streets and make it uniform. The record is clear: lower speeds save lives. For the worst repeat offenders, the Legislature has a bill ready. The proposed <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045C/A2299C)</strong> would require drivers who rack up violations to install speed limiters. Both steps are laid out on our site with sources and contacts; details here: <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</p><p>Staten Island’s delegation is on the hook. Council Member Frank Morano, Assembly Member Charles Fall, and State Senator Jessica Scarcella‑Spanton represent this area. Our record shows no documented sponsorship positions for them on the speed‑limiter bill. The crashes keep coming. The question is simple: will they act?</p><p>One night on the bridge approach. One family changed.

The impact caused severe front-end damage to both vehicles. A 21-year-old female driver was injured with a deep head laceration but remained conscious and was wearing a seatbelt. The report cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor to the crash. The narrative states, 'She had looked away. The street did not.' This highlights the critical role of driver distraction in causing the violent collision. No other contributing factors were noted for the victim.

Driver inattention and failure to yield sealed her fate.</p><p class=mb3>A 64-year-old woman was killed near 242 Mason Avenue in Staten Island when a westbound SUV, making a left turn, struck her as she crossed the street. According to the police report, the driver failed to yield the right-of-way and was inattentive or distracted at the time of the crash. The report states, 'Steel met flesh. She dropped, broken. The driver did not yield.' The impact occurred at the left front quarter panel of the SUV, causing fatal crush injuries to the pedestrian's entire body. The woman was not at an intersection and was crossing without a signal or crosswalk, as noted in the report, but the primary contributing factors remain 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction.' The driver was licensed and operating a 2023 SUV. The collision underscores the lethal consequences of driver error on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
