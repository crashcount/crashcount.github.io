Serious injuries more than doubled year‑to‑date, from 8 to <strong>25</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>This is not an abstraction. On May 17, police said Jose Luis Gomez‑Guallazaca, 58, was crossing Targee Street when an e‑scooter struck him. He died at the hospital. “Upon impact, the driver was violently ejected off the scooter while Gomez‑Guallazaca sustained severe trauma,” <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/bronx-man-killed-by-e-scooter-driver-05172025/>amNY reported</a>. City crash records list the case as a pedestrian killed at Targee and Pierce that evening (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data CrashID 4813412</a>).</p><h3 id=streets-that-dont-forgive>Streets that don’t forgive</h3><p>On July 5 in Clifton, a Toyota made a K‑turn on Bay Street. A motorcyclist hit the driver’s door and later died at the hospital, according to <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/staten-island-motorcyclist-killed-k-turn-07062025/>amNY</a>. No arrest. The NYPD’s Collision Investigation Squad took the case, the outlet said.</p><p>Weeks later, just after 1 AM on Aug 5 in Port Richmond, a 13‑year‑old on a moped collided with an MTA bus on Castleton Avenue and was left in critical condition. “The moped went through a stop sign without stopping and hit the bus,” the MTA said, per <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/moped-bus-collision-staten-island/>amNY</a>. ABC7 confirmed the boy suffered a severe head injury and the bus occupants were unhurt (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/13-year-old-boy-injured-port-richmond-staten-island-moped-collides-bus/17438785/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>Each case different.

Advocates are pushing to drop the default speed limit and to require speed‑limiting tech for drivers who rack up tickets — the <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045C/A2299C)</strong> would force chronic violators to use devices that keep them within 5 MPH of the limit (<a href=/take_action/>details and contacts</a>).</p><p>One person was killed crossing Hylan. Another on Forest. A worker in a loading yard. A teen on a side street. The list is long in the city’s own ledger (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).
