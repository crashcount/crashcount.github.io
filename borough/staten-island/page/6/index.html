On May 17, police said Jose Luis Gomez‑Guallazaca, 58, was crossing Targee Street when an e‑scooter struck him. He died at the hospital. “Upon impact, the driver was violently ejected off the scooter while Gomez‑Guallazaca sustained severe trauma,” <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/bronx-man-killed-by-e-scooter-driver-05172025/>amNY reported</a>.
