The sedan’s front collapsed. A 78-year-old woman behind the wheel died, crushed in her seat. Metal twisted. No seatbelt. The street fell silent as another life ended in steel.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a 1998 Volvo sedan rear-ended a 2017 SUV on Vanduzer Street near Baring Place in Staten Island at 9:28 a.m. The sedan’s front end struck the SUV’s center back, folding the smaller car’s front. The driver of the Volvo, a 78-year-old woman, was killed. She was not wearing a seatbelt and suffered fatal crush injuries. The report lists 'Other Vehicular' as a contributing factor, indicating a driver-related error but does not specify further. The SUV was traveling straight ahead with two occupants; the Volvo was also moving straight before impact. The police narrative describes the crash as a violent collision that left the sedan’s driver dead at the scene. No contributing factors are attributed to the SUV or its occupants. The focus remains on the deadly force of the rear-end impact and the systemic danger posed by such collisions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
