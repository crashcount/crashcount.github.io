The system holds its breath.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0606-2024 was introduced on March 7, 2024, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring that every bicycle with electric assist, electric scooter and other legal motorized vehicle be licensed and registered," would force all e-bikes, e-scooters, and similar vehicles not already covered by DMV rules to register with the Department of Transportation and display a visible plate. Council Member Inna Vernikov led as primary sponsor, joined by Holden, Farías, Riley, Brannan, and many others. The bill was laid over in committee on December 11, 2024. The measure aims to track these vehicles, but its impact on vulnerable road users remains unassessed. The city’s debate continues, with no law yet in force.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
