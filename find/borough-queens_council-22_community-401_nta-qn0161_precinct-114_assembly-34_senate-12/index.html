But the numbers do not comfort. Seventy-nine people were hurt in 103 crashes in the last twelve months alone. Not one was called a serious injury, but pain lingers. Limps last. The body remembers.

They take what they want.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hit>The Machines That Hit</h3><p>Cars and trucks did most of the harm. In the last three years, they killed two people and left dozens more bleeding. Bikes and mopeds were not spared either. One cyclist was killed. Trucks, sedans, SUVs, bikes—they all left marks. The street is a battlefield, and the weapons are steel and speed.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>City Hall claims progress. They point to new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and the passage of Sammy’s Law, which lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit has not dropped yet. The law sits unused. The cameras need Albany’s blessing to keep running. Each delay is another roll of the dice.</p><p>No local leader has stood up to demand more for Sunnyside Yards (North). No council member has called for urgent redesigns or a citywide 20 mph limit. The silence is loud. The danger is louder.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every injury is a choice made by someone in power. Call your council member. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand real protection for people walking and biking. Do not wait for the next crash. Do not let another family join the count.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

A cyclist died at Monitor and Driggs. Children walk and bike to PS 110. The street stays dangerous. The city has not acted. Families wait. The threat of cars remains.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC reported on June 11, 2025, that parents at Public School 110 in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, are calling for a Paris-style school street to protect children. Their plan would turn Monitor Street into a cul-de-sac with a pedestrian plaza, add mid-block crossings, and close a slip lane to block cut-through traffic from the BQE. The push follows a fatal crash at Monitor and Driggs, where a driver killed 73-year-old cyclist Teddy Orzechowski. Streetsblog notes, 'Streets outside schools have higher crash and injury rates than the city average.' Most PS 110 families walk or bike, but the city has not responded to the proposal. The article highlights the persistent risk from drivers using local streets as shortcuts.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Prosecutors say Ali drank for nearly six hours at three Manhattan bars, reaching a blood alcohol content of .158, almost twice the legal limit. After hitting Esiyok, Ali continued, injuring a cyclist, two more pedestrians, and crashing into a van. The family’s lawsuit cites New York’s Dram Shop Act, which holds bars liable for serving visibly drunk patrons who later cause harm. The article quotes the family’s lawyer: “The family is devastated. They’re still in disbelief.” The case highlights failures in both driver responsibility and alcohol-serving oversight.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, Queens Borough President Donovan Richards, and Council Member Julie Won attended the opening. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative change, so there is no direct impact on pedestrian or cyclist safety to assess.'

The legislature dropped a mandate for daylighting—banning parking at corners near elementary schools—deferring instead to New York City, where Council Member Julie Won’s universal daylighting bill faces opposition from the Department of Transportation. Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, herself a crash survivor, vowed to keep fighting for daylighting, saying, 'I think daylighting would have helped me.' Hochul’s proposals to let the city set lower bike lane speed limits and to reclassify heavy e-bikes as mopeds were also cut. Critics argued these would not address core safety issues. The Adams administration opposes a City Council bill for e-bike registration and plates, while State Sen. Jenifer Rajkumar’s state version would shift licensing to the DMV. As Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives put it, 'A daylighting requirement would have made intersections safer around elementary schools, and it’s disappointing that this provision was cut from the New York State budget.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council members press for daylighting to save lives. DOT claims high costs and flawed data. Advocates cite proven safety gains. The battle pits parking against pedestrian survival.</p><p class=mb3>On April 22, 2025, the City Council held a hearing on a bill to ban parking within 20 feet of intersections—known as daylighting. The bill, sponsored by Council Member Julie Won and backed by 25 sponsors, aims to improve visibility and protect pedestrians. DOT officials opposed the measure, citing a study that warns of increased injuries without costly infrastructure, estimating a $3 billion price tag. Won called the study 'deeply flawed.' Council Member Lincoln Restler blasted DOT for ignoring dangerous corners in his district. Chris Banks opposed the bill over parking concerns. Advocates and Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla countered, pointing to cheap, effective daylighting elsewhere. The debate exposes a stark choice: keep parking or save lives at the curb.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Rahimi, the driver, said, "We were driving right off here. Something fell off the train, damaging the windshield." Passenger Malnick described, "A bolt hit and then right away just the sound of glass exploding and glass all over me." The incident echoes previous cases: in 2019, falling debris from elevated tracks struck vehicles three times in a month. The MTA responded then by intensifying inspections, but the problem persists. The agency now says it is investigating and will inspect the area. The repeated incidents highlight ongoing risks from aging infrastructure above city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets remain dangerous. Action still pending.</p><p class=mb3>On April 21, 2025, the City Council’s transportation committee held a hearing on parking policy. Three bills were considered: a daylighting bill by Councilmember Julie Won to ban parking near crosswalks and require 1,000 daylighting barriers per year; a bill by Councilmember Mercedes Narcisse to waive extra fees for late parking ticket responses; and a bill by Councilmember Natasha Williams to create overnight truck parking in industrial zones. The matter summary reads: 'NYC Council to examine truck parking, daylighting and fine relief in hearing on city parking woes.' Narcisse’s bill targets fee relief for drivers who respond to violations between 45 and 90 days. Won’s daylighting bill drew support from 120 organizations. DOT faced questions on loading zones, permit abuse, and intersection safety. The hearing spotlighted the city’s struggle to balance safety for pedestrians and cyclists with business and driver concerns. No final votes yet.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
