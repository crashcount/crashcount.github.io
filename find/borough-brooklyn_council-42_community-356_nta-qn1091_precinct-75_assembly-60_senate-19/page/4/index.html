Of 57 boards, 38 opposed the plan, 20 supported it, mostly in denser neighborhoods. The proposal, described as aiming to build 'a little more housing in every neighborhood,' faces resistance in low-density areas. Council Member Joann Ariola (R-Woodhaven) opposed more housing in her district, calling it 'suburbs.' Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso criticized neighborhoods that refuse new housing, saying it increases pressure on poorer areas. Arlene Schlesinger, a Queens resident, voiced strong opposition, especially to lifting parking mandates and adding accessory dwelling units. Community boards, often older and whiter, resist change, leaving the city’s most vulnerable to bear the brunt of housing and transportation inequity.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal aims to increase housing near transit, allow mixed-use zoning, and eliminate parking mandates.

Other Queens officials and residents echoed fears for single-family homeowners and suburban 'character.' In contrast, Borough President Donovan Richards's spokesperson and some residents supported the reforms, citing the city's affordability crisis.

The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring that the department of transportation maintain curb heights following street construction,' targets a simple failure: after street work, curbs often vanish, water pools, and property owners get fined for city mistakes. Council Member Joann Ariola sponsors, joined by Holden, Paladino, and Vernikov. The bill orders DOT to restore curbs to proper height after any street, sidewalk, or gutter work. The committee has not voted. The bill aims to stop flooding and fines, but leaves the daily hazard for walkers and wheelchair users unaddressed until passed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Members James F. Gennaro (primary sponsor), Robert F. Holden, Joann Ariola, Vickie Paladino, and Inna Vernikov back the measure. Their bill requires the Parks Department to repair sidewalks damaged by city-owned trees, removing the burden from homeowners of one-, two-, or three-family homes. Owners must notify the city if tree roots break the walk. If the damage is not tree-related, owners still have ninety days to fix it. The bill aims to clarify responsibility and ensure city action on hazards caused by its own trees.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, Lincoln Restler (primary sponsor), Amanda Farías, and others led the charge. The law aims to expose patterns in police stops and holds officers to account.
