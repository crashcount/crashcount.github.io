That is the record, not a story.</p><h3 id=avenue-p-and-kings-highway-wont-forgive>Avenue P and Kings Highway won’t forgive</h3><p>At <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Avenue P and East 19th</a> a dump truck going straight killed a 77‑year‑old woman in the crosswalk in 2023. On <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Kings Highway</a>, an SUV struck and killed a 70‑year‑old man in 2024. The city’s own rollup shows trucks and buses causing a share of pedestrian deaths and severe injuries here, out of proportion to their numbers.</p><p>Peak harm comes when the streets are full. Injury counts jump in the afternoon—2 p.m., 3 p.m., 5 p.m., 6 p.m. The worst corridors are named in the crash logs: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Avenue P</a>, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Kings Highway</a>, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Ocean Avenue</a>, and <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Nostrand Avenue</a>.</p><h3 id=a-cyclist-down-on-nostrand-and-avenue-r>A cyclist down on Nostrand and Avenue R</h3><p>On Nostrand at Avenue R, a driver in an SUV hit a man on an e‑bike at night in 2023. The rider was ejected and died. The city dataset shows the SUV “going straight.” The bike was “going straight.” The man never got up. The case sits in the ledger as <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4633095</a>.</p><h3 id=older-new-yorkers-carry-the-toll>Older New Yorkers carry the toll</h3><p>The dead here skew old. Ages 74, 77, 70, and 90 appear next to “Apparent Death” in the files. The neighborhood record lists four pedestrian deaths, one cyclist, two occupants. The serious injuries are few on paper, but the injuries are not: 682 hurt since 2022. Numbers don’t limp; people do.</p><h3 id=what-keeps-breaking-people-here>What keeps breaking people here</h3><p>Top listed factors in these crashes cluster under “other,” with failures to yield and distraction repeating in smaller numbers. Trucks and buses show up in the worst outcomes. The intersection list is a warning label, not a map.</p><h3 id=fix-the-corners-that-kill>Fix the corners that kill</h3><p>Start with the deadly blocks. Cut turning speeds and sightline traps on Avenue P and Kings Highway. Harden the turns. Daylight every approach. Give walkers a head start. Keep heavy rigs off tight residential corners and set clear truck routes. Target the repeated hotspots with enforcement when injuries spike in the afternoon. These are the moves that stop bodies from hitting asphalt.</p><h3 id=the-politics-of-slow-or-dead>The politics of slow or dead</h3><p>City power exists to slow the cars. Albany already renewed 24/7 school‑zone cameras; the Council passed the home rule and the state acted, making cameras round‑the‑clock through 2030, according to prior reporting. Locally, some officials fight basic visibility fixes. DOT’s own report on daylighting was used by council members including <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/08/we-told-you-so-dots-anti-daylighting-scare-tactic-now-fuels-pro-car-pols>Inna Vernikov</a> to stall a citywide plan. She also helped <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/proudly-anti-safety-brooklyn-pol-boasts-of-getting-dot-to-pause-long-promised-bike-lanes>pause bike lanes</a> in Southern Brooklyn, despite the crash history. The deaths kept coming.</p><p>There is a tool to stop the worst repeat speeders. The Senate moved bill <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S4045</a> through committees to require speed‑limiting tech for drivers with repeated violations. One Brooklyn family is already in the ground because a driver with a long ticket record ran a red; two committees advanced the fix while some lawmakers missed the vote.</p><h3 id=make-the-choice>Make the choice</h3><p>Lower speeds save lives. Limit the repeat offenders who treat streets like strips. Protect the corners where people die. Then do it again on the next block.</p><p>If you want this to change, take one step now.
