She argued, "DOT has a responsibility to also ensure that there also is parking, even municipal lots or garages available, as we look to share the street." Brooks-Powers claimed more parking would clear cars from bus and bike lanes. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and Executive Deputy Commissioner Paul Ochoa disagreed, stressing the need to share streets among all users. Brooks-Powers has opposed bus lane projects and a safety redesign in her own district, despite high traffic fatality rates. Her stance favors drivers, not vulnerable road users. No safety analyst has assessed the impact, but her opposition to proven safety measures puts pedestrians and cyclists at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The resolution, led by Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez, is a required step before state passage. Brooks-Powers had withheld support until the bill included street redesigns for safety, especially in low-income communities of color. She said, 'Lowering speed limits works best when paired with traffic calming and street safety infrastructure.' The resolution now has 23 co-sponsors, three short of a majority. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams has not signed on. Assembly Member Linda Rosenthal sponsors the bill in Albany. Sammy’s Law is named for a child killed by a reckless driver.

Last year, the Council reversed course and failed to pass the message. This session, Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez introduced a resolution urging passage, with 10 sponsors. Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers must hold a hearing before a vote. Speaker Adrienne Adams and Brooks-Powers have not signed on, citing negotiations. The bill’s summary states: 'Life-saving legislation that would allow New York City to set speed limits below 25 miles per hour failed to make it into this year's state budget.' Data show slower speeds save lives. Advocates and victims’ families keep pushing. The Council’s inaction keeps streets dangerous.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT must study effects before rollout in 2025.</p><p class=mb3>Bill number not specified. Passed by City Council on April 28, 2023, after review by the transportation committee. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers (D-Queens), committee chair, sponsored the bill. The measure requires the Department of Transportation to study daylighting—removing parking near corners to improve visibility—and then install it at 100 intersections each year starting in 2025. The bill’s matter title: 'The Department of Transportation must study the safety benefits of 'daylighting' and implement the street safety measure that helps improve visibility at a minimum of 100 intersections each year.' Brooks-Powers said, 'Daylighting is a proven safety measure that expands sight lines at intersections, where traffic violence often seems to take place.' The Council voted 40-7. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez initially objected, citing concerns about driver speed, but supported the amended bill requiring physical barriers. The law comes after the death of 7-year-old Dolma Naadhun at a non-daylighted intersection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
