Brooks-Powers’s action responds to calls for accountability, as highlighted in the article: 'there will be a hearing on obscured plates.' Despite City Hall’s claim that 'obscuring and defacing license plates is against the law' and that enforcement is increasing, the streets tell a different story. Unreadable plates let reckless drivers escape detection. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, passengers—face greater risk.

Kuntzman urges expansion of Council Member Lincoln Restler’s Intro 501, which would let the public report illegal plates via 311.

The lack of action lets reckless drivers escape accountability, undermining automated enforcement and endangering vulnerable road users.

The bill, titled “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the installation of bollards at reconstructed sidewalks, curb extensions and pedestrian ramps,” was sponsored by Council Members Brooks-Powers, Krishnan (primary), Stevens, Hanif, Hudson, Richardson Jordan, Riley, and the Manhattan Borough President. The bill requires the Department of Transportation to install bollards at reconstructed sidewalks, curb extensions, and pedestrian ramps, especially where accessibility upgrades are made. It mandates a study on bollard effectiveness in high pedestrian areas and demands annual reporting on installations and requests. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, with no enactment. The measure aims to harden pedestrian space, forcing the city to act where cars threaten walkers and wheelchair users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brooks-Powers led a resolution supporting commuter vans and spoke on transportation equity, but did not advance key street safety or Vision Zero legislation. The committee failed to hold the Adams administration accountable for missing protected bike and bus lane benchmarks. Advocates and council members voiced frustration at the lack of progress on urgent issues like traffic violence and the Streets Master Plan.
