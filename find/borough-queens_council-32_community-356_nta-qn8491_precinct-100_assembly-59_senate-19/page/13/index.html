NYPD Transportation Bureau’s Michael Pilecki reported arrests for forged plates fell 11 percent from last year, while summonses rose just 0.6 percent. The hearing spotlighted two bills from Council Member Oswald Feliz to raise fines for using or selling fake plates, both widely supported, including by the NYPD. The matter summary: 'NYPD claims it has stepped up its efforts to summons and arrest car drivers who cover or deface their plate, or drive with a fake temporary tag, but its own statistics show that the effort has not continued into this year.' Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers and Kamillah Hanks did not comment. Activists and officials noted DOT’s automated cameras failed to bill 1.2 million violations last year due to temp tags, leaving dangerous drivers unaccountable. The city’s weak enforcement leaves vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The work, running from Beach Channel Drive to Shore Front Parkway, added porous pavement, new bike lanes, and wider pedestrian walkways. The city says the 11,000 square feet of new surface can absorb nearly 1.3 million gallons of stormwater each year. Ariola said, 'At long last, we will finally have a safe, steady, and efficient flow of traffic here, and the area is now more resilient than ever before.' The project, part of a $16.6 million investment begun in March 2021, also repaired or replaced 1,100 feet of storm sewer and added new left turn lanes.

The program, which began as a pilot in The Bronx in 2021, will now cover roughly 20 square miles and serve about 600,000 residents. DOT Commissioner Rodriguez said, 'E-scooters and other forms of micromobility will help us build a cleaner and greener transportation system that connects residents to commercial and transit hubs.' Council Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers celebrated the move, highlighting its impact on transit deserts in Southeast Queens. The Bronx pilot logged over two million trips with very low injury rates. Safety features—speed limits, in-app training, 'Beginner Mode,' and no overnight use for new riders—will continue. Discounted rates remain for NYCHA and assistance program residents.

Borough presidents Antonio Reynoso (Brooklyn) and Donovan Richards (Queens) pushed for this expansion, with Reynoso praising the use of major corridors like Eastern Parkway. Mayor Adams said, “This is a five-borough city and we are now saying the Summer Streets program is going be a five-borough initiative. Everyone deserves to enjoy that.” Adams expressed interest in longer hours but cited public safety and NYPD staffing costs as barriers. Advocates want more hours and connected car-free routes. The city will spend $1.5 million, not including staffing.

Council Member Jen Gutierrez carried the resolution; Selvena Brooks-Powers later signed on. The bill targets corridors like Bushwick Avenue, Laurelton Parkway, and East Gun Hill Road—sites of hundreds of crashes and dozens killed or maimed since 2019. The matter summary states: 'Because people are dying and being maimed on New York's most-dangerous 25-mile-per-hour streets.' Supporters, including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, cite the science: lower speeds mean less force, fewer deaths. Research shows 20 mph zones cut crashes by 60 percent. The bill does not mandate, but allows, lower limits where carnage is highest.

The matter summary states, 'Officials called on Albany to pass legislation to lower the BAC threshold to .05%, arguing it would reduce DWI fatalities by about 10% and align with other countries.' Simon declared, 'Lowering the BAC limit from .08% to .05% is desperately needed to adequately tackle this epidemic of traffic violence.' NYPD Chief Kim Royster and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez echoed the urgency. The bill awaits action in Albany.

The bill faces opposition from Council Members David Weprin, Joann Ariola, and Ari Kagan, who argue it will hurt small businesses and outer-borough residents. On May 22, 2023, Ari Kagan said, 'Congestion Pricing will hurt countless New Yorkers, small businesses, residents of so-called outer-boroughs & will create huge lines of parked cars right outside of Manhattan.' Yet, the MTA’s assessment shows only 5,200 city drivers commute by car from areas far from fast transit—just 1.2% of that population. Advocates like Felicia Park-Rogers counter, 'this policy has the potential to be utterly transformational for our city.' The plan includes exemptions for disabled and low-income drivers.
