The proposal, presented to Community Board 5's transportation committee, passed with a 10-2 vote. The matter summary reads: 'DOT plans to widen the Sixth Avenue bike lane... eliminating one of the four vehicle lanes.' Council Member Joann Ariola, mentioned in the debate, strongly opposed the move, warning it 'will seriously impede emergency responders.' Other council members and residents voiced sharp criticism, calling the redesign dangerous and disruptive. DOT officials insist the plan is rooted in community input and data. No formal safety analyst assessment was provided for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Pena faces charges of vehicular manslaughter, DWI, and refusal to take a breath test. Two passengers in Pena’s car were hospitalized. The FDNY suspended Pena for 28 days without pay.

Lives lost.</p><p class=mb3>On February 17, 2025, Council Member Joann Ariola (District 32) announced draft legislation to crack down on drivers who block fire hydrants. The bill, not yet numbered, would raise fines from $115 to $1,000 and allow 311 video submissions for automatic summonses. Ariola said, 'We have seen two fires in the past week that have resulted in fatalities where the firefighters were unable to access the closest fire hydrant.' The measure responds to a surge in complaints—over 134,000 in 2023—about blocked hydrants. Ariola’s office blamed lost parking to DOT bike lanes and racks, but the DOT countered, calling protected bike lanes a proven safety tool. FDNY Commissioner Robert S. Tucker said blocked hydrants slowed firefighting in a recent fatal fire. The bill aims to keep hydrants clear and prevent more deaths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brooks-Powers noted that new tolls will likely be passed to riders as higher fares. Commissioner David Do of the Taxi and Limousine Commission testified that for-hire vehicle trips dropped 1%.

She cited DOT's repeated failure to meet the 2019 Streets Master Plan benchmarks—50 miles of protected bike lanes and 30 miles of bus lanes each year. In 2024, DOT delivered only 5.3 miles of bus lanes and 25.7 miles of bike lanes. Brooks-Powers introduced Intro 1105, a bill requiring DOT to publish a tracker of its progress. She declared, "DOT gives us their word every hearing and we are not getting results." DOT First Deputy Commissioner Margaret Forgione objected, claiming the tracker would add paperwork and reduce community engagement. Brooks-Powers countered, "DOT needs to be more transparent about its project pipeline so we can identify bottlenecks." The committee signaled intent to advance the bill.

Reinvent Albany called the measure 'contrary to notions of basic fairness' and a '$22 million handout' to a special interest. The Traffic Mobility Review Board had already rejected such exemptions.

The bill, sponsored by Farah N. Louis (primary) and co-sponsored by Brannan, Schulman, Banks, Farías, Carr, Ariola, and others, passed on March 15, 2025. The law demands annual reporting on compliance and reasons for any delay. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to installing pavement markings.' Quick, visible lines cut confusion and protect people crossing or riding.

The matter title reads: 'establishing a high visibility pavement marking pilot program.' Council Member Yusef Salaam leads, joined by Menin, De La Rosa, Brooks-Powers, Cabán, Brannan, and Hanif. The law demands a report on results and challenges.

Critics say it slows life-saving street redesigns. Advocates warn it props up car culture and blocks safer bike lanes. The bill risks more sidewalk riding and fewer safe crossings.</p><p class=mb3>Intro 103, now before the City Council, would require the Department of Transportation to notify Council members every time a single parking spot is repurposed—for car-share, bike corrals, or Citi Bike docks. The bill, sponsored by Council Member Joann Ariola, claims residents need notice before losing parking. But DOT and street safety advocates slam the measure as a bureaucratic drag on urgent safety fixes. Council Member Lincoln Restler calls it 'additional hoops and hurdles' for street safety. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso says, 'I don’t know why we entertain any effort to stop or slow-roll safe street design.' Open Plans and StreetsPAC argue the bill props up car dominance and blocks safer, more sustainable streets. The bill could make it harder to move bike infrastructure off sidewalks, risking more sidewalk riding and fewer safe crossings for pedestrians. Similar bills (Intro 606, Intro 104) face the same criticism.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Rollout set for summer 2025.</p><p class=mb3>The MTA announced its final Queens bus network redesign on December 18, 2024. The plan, now entering its last public feedback phase, will be reviewed by the MTA Board in early winter 2025 and implemented by late summer. The proposal includes over $30 million in new funding, 17 new local routes, and increased frequency for 17 lines, but also service reductions on 29 routes. The main highlight is the introduction of 'rush' routes to connect riders to rail faster. MTA Chair Janno Lieber said, 'Every change to a route has an impact on the schedule... and we did it.' Queens Borough President Donovan Richards voiced support, stating, 'I'm ready. We're ready.' The process began in 2019 and was shaped by extensive community input. No formal safety analysis was provided for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
