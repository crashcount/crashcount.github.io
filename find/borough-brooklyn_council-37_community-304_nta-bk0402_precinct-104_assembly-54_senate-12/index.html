Thirteen left with serious injuries.</strong> In three and a half years, there have been <strong>1,661 crashes</strong>. <strong>824 people hurt.</strong></p><p>A 71-year-old woman, crossing in a marked crosswalk, never made it to the other side. A 29-year-old passenger, ejected and crushed. A 49-year-old e-bike rider, thrown and killed by a turning truck. The dead do not speak. The living limp on.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price.</strong> Vans, SUVs, sedans, trucks—they strike the body and keep moving. In the last year alone, two people died. <strong>232 were injured.</strong> Seven suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Children are not spared. Sixteen under 18 were hurt in the past year.

They point to new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and lower speed limits. But in Bushwick (East), the blood keeps flowing. <strong>Crashes are down, but injuries are not.</strong></p><p><strong>Local leaders have not done enough.</strong> The laws are slow. The changes crawl. The silence is loud. There is no record of bold action from those who hold power here. No flood of press releases. No urgent votes. The streets remain the same. The bodies pile up.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong></p><p><strong>Demand more.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand enforcement that protects the walker, not the driver. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Streetsblog NYC reports: 'renewing calls from advocates for the city to redesign the dangerous street.' Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez, State Sen. Julia Salazar, and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher back the push. Advocates want a protected bike lane, mid-block crossings, and safer loading zones. Despite meetings and official letters, the city has not acted. The safety analyst notes: advocacy alone brings no immediate safety change, but it could spark future improvements.

The Council passed the bill with a veto-proof majority. Council Member Sandy Nurse, the sponsor, called out Adams for breaking his 2022 promise to raise pay standards. The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection backed the bill, saying it would close gaps in pay protections. According to safety analysts, this event concerns labor protections and does not directly affect street safety or infrastructure for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
