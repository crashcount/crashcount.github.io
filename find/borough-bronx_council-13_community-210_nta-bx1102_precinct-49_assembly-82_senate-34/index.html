In the last year alone, 122 people were hurt in 182 crashes. No one was killed, but luck will not hold. A one-year-old boy was struck by an SUV while crossing. He survived. Others did not.

The truck flipped. Three people were sent to Jacobi Hospital. The cause is still under investigation. The city calls these crashes accidents.

The city touts new speed cameras and intersection redesigns. But the pace is slow. The law now allows New York City to lower speed limits to 20 mph. The city could act today. It has not. The cameras that catch speeders are at risk of going dark if Albany does not act. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program, which forced repeat offenders to take safety courses, has lapsed. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=the-words-that-remain>The Words That Remain</h3><p>After the ambulance crash, the news <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/ambulance-box-truck-collide-injuring-3-people-morris-park-bronx/16177097/>reported</a>: &ldquo;Three people were hurt: the box truck driver and two ambulance workers.

Lander promised more protected bike lanes, a citywide Bus Rapid Transit network, and using congestion pricing revenue for busways and bikeways. He pledged six-minute service on subways and buses and action on street homelessness. StreetsPAC’s endorsement signals strong support for policies that prioritize vulnerable road users.
