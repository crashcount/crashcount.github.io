Council Member Inna Vernikov sponsored the bill, joined by Robert F. Holden and 29 co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote. No safety analyst assessed the impact on vulnerable road users. The bill’s failure left the city’s most exposed—cyclists, pedestrians, passengers—without new protections. The streets stayed dangerous. The cars kept their edge.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The letter calls for urgent upgrades to the 133-year-old Washington Bridge. The officials demand a two-way protected bike lane, wider pedestrian paths, improved lighting, and safety cameras. The letter states: 'The city has done a terrific job of making wise investments in improving mobility on both sides of the Harlem River, but left the bridge with just two very narrow, poorly lit lanes for foot and bike traffic.' Stevens and her colleagues stress that the bridge is unsafe for people on foot and bike. They urge DOT to act, citing the need to reduce traffic deaths and make the bridge safe for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
