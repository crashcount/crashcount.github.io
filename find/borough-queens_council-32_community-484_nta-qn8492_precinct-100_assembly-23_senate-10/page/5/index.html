The bill responds to claims of biased enforcement against Black and Latino New Yorkers. Council Majority Leader Joseph Borelli and Councilwoman Joann Ariola oppose the bill, warning it could endanger pedestrians. The bill has not yet advanced to committee or received a hearing.

The city says the 11,000 square feet of new surface can absorb nearly 1.3 million gallons of stormwater each year. Ariola said, 'At long last, we will finally have a safe, steady, and efficient flow of traffic here, and the area is now more resilient than ever before.' The project, part of a $16.6 million investment begun in March 2021, also repaired or replaced 1,100 feet of storm sewer and added new left turn lanes.

On May 22, 2023, Ari Kagan said, 'Congestion Pricing will hurt countless New Yorkers, small businesses, residents of so-called outer-boroughs & will create huge lines of parked cars right outside of Manhattan.' Yet, the MTA’s assessment shows only 5,200 city drivers commute by car from areas far from fast transit—just 1.2% of that population. Advocates like Felicia Park-Rogers counter, 'this policy has the potential to be utterly transformational for our city.' The plan includes exemptions for disabled and low-income drivers.

The vote backs millions who depend on buses and trains.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0460-2023 was adopted by the City Council on April 27, 2023, after review by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The resolution calls on the New York State Legislature and Governor to 'fully fund the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) in the State’s upcoming Fiscal Year 2024 Budget.' Council Member Farah N. Louis sponsored the measure, joined by over thirty co-sponsors. The committee vote was unanimous among present members. The resolution highlights the MTA’s critical role for millions of New Yorkers and warns of a 'looming fiscal cliff' as federal aid dries up. The Council insists that full funding is needed to prevent service cuts and keep transit affordable and frequent. The measure references the 'New York City in Six' plan, pushing for buses and trains every six minutes. The Council’s action centers the needs of riders—especially those with no other way to move safely through the city.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary states the bills aim to address the rise of deadly fires from faulty batteries, often used by delivery workers. Council Member Joann Ariola urged the FDNY to consider international solutions and invest in safe charging infrastructure. Hildalyn Colón Hernández of Los Deliveristas Unidos opposed the bans, arguing they punish low-income workers and miss root causes. The city recently abandoned a proposal to ban e-bikes on NYCHA property and is working on new charging stations. The debate highlights the struggle to protect vulnerable workers while preventing more deaths and injuries.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
