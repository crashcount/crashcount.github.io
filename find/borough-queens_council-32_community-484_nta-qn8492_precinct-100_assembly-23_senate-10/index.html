The Senate passed the measure 38-21; three city senators—Stephen Chan, Andrew Lanza, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton—voted no. The Assembly passed it 110-31, with nine city lawmakers—Alec Brook-Krasny, Lester Chang, Simcha Eichenstein, Michael Novakhov, Stacey Pheffer Amato, Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Reilly, David Weprin, Kalman Yeger—opposing. The Streetsblog NYC article, 'Ye Shall Know Their Names! Meet the Dirty Dozen City Pols Who Voted Against Speed Camera Program,' quotes lawmakers dismissing speed cameras as revenue grabs or burdens. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action, so no direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists can be assessed.' Still, the votes signal disregard for proven tools that protect those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The board voted for new safety measures.</p><p class=mb3>On May 14, 2025, a proposed ban on bicycles along Rockaway Beach’s boardwalk was canceled after public backlash. The plan, discussed at a community board meeting, would have barred cyclists from Beach 108th to Beach 73rd Street during summer months. Council Member Joann Ariola, representing District 32, expressed relief at the reversal, stating, 'I’m glad that the Parks Department is going to continue allowing Rockaway residents to enjoy their bikes on the boardwalk this summer, but now we need real enforcement.' Instead of a ban, the Parks Department will increase signage and enforcement, especially near concessions. The community board voted 30-1 for new signs and called for marked bike lanes, an 8 mph speed limit, and clearer right-of-way rules. Board chair Dolores Orr stressed these safety improvements have been needed since the boardwalk’s post-Sandy rebuild.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, covered by nypost.com, followed a fatal stabbing and NYPD data showing felony assaults up 9% this year. Ariola warned, 'Forcing more New Yorkers underground with this ridiculous congestion pricing scheme is going to put more people into contact with the dangerously unwell.' She called the subway the city's 'de facto mental institution and homeless shelter.' The policy, supported by Governor Hochul, has increased subway and bus ridership by 6% and 9%. Ariola’s stance: congestion pricing endangers vulnerable riders, forcing them into unsafe conditions. The city has responded with more police and outreach, but many riders remain fearful.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable riders left in limbo as funding fights drag on.</p><p class=mb3>On March 19, 2025, the City Council held a budget hearing on the MTA’s 2025-29 capital plan funding. The MTA demanded $4 billion from the city—a 33% jump from the last plan—warning of major subway disruptions if denied. The matter, titled 'MTA threatens another ‘Summer of Hell’ of subway disruptions if NYC doesn’t cough up billions,' drew sharp words. Council Member Joann Ariola (R-Queens) blasted the agency: 'Instead of insulting us with baseless threats, the agency that spends $30 million on a staircase should find ways to cut its wasteful spending and bloated payroll before asking for more taxpayer money.' Other lawmakers and advocates echoed frustration, questioning MTA management and calling for state responsibility. Despite heated criticism, council members did not strongly oppose the request in session. The hearing left the city’s most vulnerable riders—those who rely on safe, reliable transit—caught between political fights and crumbling infrastructure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, not yet numbered, would raise fines from $115 to $1,000 and allow 311 video submissions for automatic summonses. Ariola said, 'We have seen two fires in the past week that have resulted in fatalities where the firefighters were unable to access the closest fire hydrant.' The measure responds to a surge in complaints—over 134,000 in 2023—about blocked hydrants. Ariola’s office blamed lost parking to DOT bike lanes and racks, but the DOT countered, calling protected bike lanes a proven safety tool. FDNY Commissioner Robert S. Tucker said blocked hydrants slowed firefighting in a recent fatal fire.

Susan Lee of New Yorkers Against Congestion Taxes noted, 'January is usually the slowest month,' and warned that some areas saw more congestion as drivers dodged tolls.

The bill could make it harder to move bike infrastructure off sidewalks, risking more sidewalk riding and fewer safe crossings for pedestrians. Similar bills (Intro 606, Intro 104) face the same criticism.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Now, every case number, status, and decision must be public. The move cracks open city data, exposing delays and denials that shape street danger.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0468-2024, now enacted, came through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The Council passed it on October 23, 2024; it became law November 22, 2024, as Local Law 113. The bill’s title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the department of transportation posting information on traffic-control device and speed reducer requests on its website.” Council Member Kalman Yeger led as primary sponsor, joined by dozens of co-sponsors. The law orders DOT to publish every request for traffic signals and speed humps—case number, subject, status, resolution, reason for approval or denial, and timeline if approved. The public can now track what the city does, or fails to do, when streets need taming. This transparency exposes the machinery behind every crosswalk, signal, and speed bump—vital for anyone who walks, bikes, or rides in New York.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
