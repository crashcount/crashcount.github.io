Brooks-Powers (District 31), held a hearing on a slate of street safety bills. The matter, titled 'DOT chief pushes back on City Council’s latest street safety proposals,' saw Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez oppose mandatory installation of bollards, safety signs near schools, reflective curbs, and speed bumps near senior centers. Brooks-Powers opened the hearing noting, 'It sounds, unfortunately, like DOT doesn’t support any of the bills that we’re looking to discuss today.' Street safety advocates, including Priscilla Afokoba and Amy Cohen, spoke in favor of the proposals, citing the 255 people killed by motorists in the previous year. The only consensus: a resolution to urge Albany to reduce the speed limit to 5 mph on Open Streets, with Governor Hochul signaling support. The hearing highlighted deep divides between the Council and DOT on protecting pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers led the debate. The Adams administration, represented by DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, opposed the bills, arguing, 'Streets are dynamic and conditions are constantly changing. We need to be nimble.' The bills would require DOT to install traffic calming near senior centers, daylight intersections, add school safety signs, study and install bollards, and increase crash reporting. Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized the mayor’s budget cuts, saying they undermine safety goals. Brooks-Powers pledged to advance the bills, stressing the need for hard infrastructure, especially in Black and Brown neighborhoods. DOT admitted it is behind on bus and bike lane targets.

The matter focused on the administration’s failure to meet Council-mandated benchmarks in the NYC Streets Plan, especially protected bike lanes and bus lanes. Brooks-Powers stated, 'No New Yorker should have to fear for their life while crossing or using our streets.' She stressed that enforcement alone is not enough, demanding equitable infrastructure in neglected neighborhoods. Advocacy leaders like Elizabeth Adams and Sara Lind echoed the call for physical changes and accountability. The hearing marked a rare moment of scrutiny, with advocates welcoming the Council’s push for real safety measures for all road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brooks-Powers (District 31) announced a forthcoming NYC Council hearing on obscured license plates and enforcement. The hearing, date not yet set, follows mounting evidence that drivers—including law enforcement—deface or cover plates to evade speed and toll cameras. The matter, described as a public safety issue, exposes a gap in city enforcement. Brooks-Powers’s action responds to calls for accountability, as highlighted in the article: 'there will be a hearing on obscured plates.' Despite City Hall’s claim that 'obscuring and defacing license plates is against the law' and that enforcement is increasing, the streets tell a different story. Unreadable plates let reckless drivers escape detection. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, passengers—face greater risk. The city’s failure to act leaves them exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The hearing, not yet scheduled, follows months of reporting by Gersh Kuntzman, who documented widespread plate defacement by drivers—including law enforcement and public officials—to evade speed and toll cameras. The article quotes Brooks-Powers: 'there will be a hearing on obscured plates.' Kuntzman urges expansion of Council Member Lincoln Restler’s Intro 501, which would let the public report illegal plates via 311. City Hall claims it is 'strengthening enforcement,' but Kuntzman’s reporting shows little follow-through. The lack of action lets reckless drivers escape accountability, undermining automated enforcement and endangering vulnerable road users.

The law, named after Carlos Moncayo, aims to curb a surge in construction worker deaths—22 in the past year, the highest in five years. State Sen.

Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On November 26, 2022, the New York City Council took legislative action to combat license plate obscuring, a tactic used by drivers to evade tolls and traffic cameras. The matter, described as 'banning the sale of toll-beating covers and requiring DOT to report cars evading red lights and speed cameras with unreadable license plates,' passed through the transportation and infrastructure committee. Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, chair of the committee and sponsor, stated, 'It’s a safety issue, it’s an issue in terms of [city] revenue, it’s an issue in terms of ensuring we have safe streets and holding people accountable.' The city has lost $19 million this year due to unreadable plates. The new laws aim to close loopholes and restore accountability, but the risk to pedestrians and cyclists from untraceable drivers remains high.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

City eyes safer charging.</p><p class=mb3>On November 14, 2022, the City Council held a hearing on a package of bills addressing lithium-ion battery fires. The FDNY supported four out of five bills, including bans on second-use and non-certified batteries, a public safety campaign, and safety information for delivery workers. The FDNY expressed concern about resource demands for detailed annual fire reporting. The matter summary states the bills aim to address the rise of deadly fires from faulty batteries, often used by delivery workers. Council Member Joann Ariola urged the FDNY to consider international solutions and invest in safe charging infrastructure. Hildalyn Colón Hernández of Los Deliveristas Unidos opposed the bans, arguing they punish low-income workers and miss root causes. The city recently abandoned a proposal to ban e-bikes on NYCHA property and is working on new charging stations. The debate highlights the struggle to protect vulnerable workers while preventing more deaths and injuries.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
