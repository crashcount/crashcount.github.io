They need safe streets.</p><p class=mb3>On April 29, 2022, Council Members Erik Bottcher, Rita Joseph, and Selvena Brooks-Powers introduced a resolution urging the Department of Education to teach bicycle safety in all New York City public schools. The resolution states: 'Providing instruction in bicycle and traffic safety in schools, starting at an early age and continuing throughout students' years in school, would be an effective measure to both promote cycling and prevent bicycle accidents and other safety incidents.' Bottcher criticized the Department of Education for failing to follow the law, noting only a handful of schools offer bike lessons. Bottcher said, 'We want to see that program enlarged significantly.' Advocates support the push but warn that education alone is not enough. Julie Huntington stressed, 'This announcement must come with an investment in building protected bike lanes and safe routes to school to keep our new riders safe.' Bottcher put the responsibility on drivers: 'Drivers are in the vehicle that weighs thousands of pounds... if they hit someone with their car, it’s very likely they could take their life.' The council’s action highlights a gap between policy and real safety for children on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, passed in 2019, requires hundreds of miles of protected bike lanes, bus lanes, and safer sidewalks. Council Member Alexa Avilés led the call: "We want $3.1 billion, a little tiny fraction of the [nearly $100-billion] city budget, to make sure our streets belong to us, and to make sure New Yorkers are safe." Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers, Carlina Rivera, Lincoln Restler, Sandy Nurse, Chi Ossé, Crystal Hudson, Shekar Krishnan, and Amanda Farías joined her. Traffic fatalities rose 44 percent in the first quarter of 2022, the deadliest start since Vision Zero began.

Queens Borough President Donovan Richards said, 'Fully electrifying our bus fleet is a critical step forward to preserving our environment and protecting our families.' MTA Chairman Janno Lieber called mass transit 'the antidote to climate change.' The rollout, however, is slow. High electricity costs and limited charging infrastructure stall progress. New York State has budgeted $1.1 billion for 500 electric buses in its 2020-2024 capital plan.

The project, under the 'Great Streets' program, is split into four phases, with construction for later phases delayed until at least 2024. The matter summary states: 'transform the currently barren median into a linear park to create a safe and easy way of traversing neighborhoods.' Queens Borough President Donovan Richards pledged $1 million to the first phase, stating, 'it really creates an unsafe scenario, especially for pedestrians and cyclists.' DOT spokesman Vin Barone said the redesign 'greatly improv[es] pedestrian safety while also drawing a huge number of new cyclists.' Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives called the delays 'unacceptable.' The plan includes upgraded bike lanes, bus stops, and bus-only lanes, but also adds curbside parking, which could increase congestion. Vulnerable road users remain at risk until the city acts.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It follows backlash to the 2019 draft and pandemic delays. The redesign boosts routes from 77 to 85, adds 20 new lines, and drops the revenue-neutral rule. Hundreds of stops will be cut to speed service. The MTA and NYC DOT picked 49 corridors for upgrades like bus lanes. The official summary states the plan 'incorporates feedback from over 11,000 customer comments and aims to address previous criticisms.' MTA Chair Janno Lieber said, 'We know we need to get it right this time.' Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and advocates like Riders Alliance back the effort but call for more equity and engagement.
