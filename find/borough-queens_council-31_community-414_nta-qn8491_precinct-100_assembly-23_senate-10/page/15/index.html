The committee, according to the matter summary, was 'largely absent from major transportation issues, including street safety, placard abuse, school street safety, e-mobility planning, ghost plates, and NYPD enforcement.' Brooks-Powers led a resolution supporting commuter vans and spoke on transportation equity, but did not advance key street safety or Vision Zero legislation. The committee failed to hold the Adams administration accountable for missing protected bike and bus lane benchmarks. Advocates and council members voiced frustration at the lack of progress on urgent issues like traffic violence and the Streets Master Plan. The committee’s approach prioritized car-dependent communities and lagged behind previous leadership on safety reforms. Vulnerable road users saw little relief.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as 'banning the sale of toll-beating covers and requiring DOT to report cars evading red lights and speed cameras with unreadable license plates,' passed through the transportation and infrastructure committee. Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, chair of the committee and sponsor, stated, 'It’s a safety issue, it’s an issue in terms of [city] revenue, it’s an issue in terms of ensuring we have safe streets and holding people accountable.' The city has lost $19 million this year due to unreadable plates. The new laws aim to close loopholes and restore accountability, but the risk to pedestrians and cyclists from untraceable drivers remains high.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The FDNY expressed concern about resource demands for detailed annual fire reporting. The matter summary states the bills aim to address the rise of deadly fires from faulty batteries, often used by delivery workers. Council Member Joann Ariola urged the FDNY to consider international solutions and invest in safe charging infrastructure. Hildalyn Colón Hernández of Los Deliveristas Unidos opposed the bans, arguing they punish low-income workers and miss root causes. The city recently abandoned a proposal to ban e-bikes on NYCHA property and is working on new charging stations.

The editorial, titled 'Hey, Donovan Richards: It’s actually way more racist to FAVOR congestion pricing,' criticized Queens Borough President Donovan Richards for labeling Holden’s opposition as racist. The piece argued, 'congestion pricing would be a disaster,' claiming it would harm diverse outer-borough residents and worsen air quality in The Bronx by diverting diesel trucks. The editorial cited MTA studies predicting only a 3.1% reduction in Manhattan traffic and framed the plan as an unfair tax on commerce. Holden’s stance reflects ongoing resistance to congestion pricing in the council, with equity and environmental impacts at the center of the debate. No formal council vote or bill was referenced in this editorial.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill’s summary: it allows residents to ticket drivers who block bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or fire hydrants within 1,320 feet of a school, creating a $175 fine and a civilian complaint protocol. Restler and Brooks-Powers are refining the process to avoid the pitfalls of the city’s anti-idling law, which discourages participation. The NYPD and DOT oppose the bill, citing concerns about neighbor conflict. Advocates support it, highlighting NYPD’s failure to protect vulnerable road users.

Despite Borough President Donovan Richards' support for the rezoning, citing cycling and EV promotion, the application faces strong local resistance.

Brewer questioned DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez’s assertion that 750 of 1,000 intersections were redesigned, citing public data showing fewer than 400. Brewer said, “I love the idea of using her committee's investigatory power to explore whether the Adams administration has indeed redesigned 750 of the promised 1,000 intersections... or whether it done fewer than that, as the agency's own public data shows.” She confirmed her intent to use committee investigators and hold an oversight hearing. The matter, titled “City Council oversight inquiry into DOT street safety implementation and data transparency,” highlights DOT’s lack of documentation and reliance on signal retiming over physical improvements. Advocates and Brewer demand full transparency and real progress.

Richards said, 'We need to do both when it comes to making sure that we can enhance our public transportation and also ensuring that our communities have access to open space.' Transit advocates warn the park blocks future rail service, cutting off faster commutes and cleaner air for southern Queens. The MTA previously cited high costs for transit reactivation.

Won, whose district covers the bridge’s eastern approaches, led a walkthrough with DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and staff from Council Members Julie Menin and Selvena Brooks-Powers. Won said, “They kept saying they can’t give the south outer roadway to pedestrians because there would be traffic. Well, I don’t care about the congestion!” She forced the commissioner to stand in the cramped lane, showing how unsafe it is for both cyclists and pedestrians. DOT offered only minor adjustments, like repainting lines, which Won dismissed as “missing the point.” The agency promised lawmakers data to justify keeping five car lanes, but Won insisted the delay puts lives at risk and called for immediate action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
