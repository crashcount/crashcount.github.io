The article centers on Ian Lockwood, a sustainable transportation expert, who was hit by a truck towing a boat while cycling. Lockwood blames road markings, not the driver, saying, 'I blame it on that yellow line.' He criticizes the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) for prioritizing speed over safety, stating, 'They're there to make them faster.' Lockwood argues that traffic controls shift blame onto vulnerable users and do not guarantee safety. He supports Vision Zero and shared space designs, which slow traffic and reduce crashes. The critique calls for fewer big arterials and less reliance on signage, focusing instead on eliminating dangerous road features.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter title reads: 'Adams Administration’s Failure to Reach Bus Lane Requirement Angers Bus Riders.' Council members and advocates, including Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein, criticized the administration’s slow pace and lack of urgency. Bus riders like Holly and Frank voiced frustration at stagnant speeds and unmet promises. The Council has not set consequences for missing the requirement.

Brooklyn organizer Kathy Park-Price of Transportation Alternatives said, 'After decades of car-centric planning, it's time to return Grand Army Plaza to people.'

The incident, reported by Streetsblog NYC, involved a 70-year-old man who died and a critically injured passenger. Witnesses described the SUV smashing through a concrete barrier and fence before falling onto the tracks, estimating speeds of 30 to 40 miles per hour. The NYPD initially suggested a 'medical episode' but later dropped this claim, despite a pattern of police blaming unexplained crashes on health issues. The vehicle’s license plate had 13 speeding violations since 2019, including four in the past year. No council bill or committee action is attached to this event. The case highlights systemic failures: weak enforcement against repeat reckless drivers, barriers that fail to protect, and police narratives that obscure driver responsibility.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The truck, owned by JCDecaux, kept rolling despite 30 violations. No charges. Paint and plastic flappers offered no shield. Concrete came too late.</p><p class=mb3>On December 28, 2022, in Brooklyn’s 34th Council District, a pickup truck driver with 17 school-zone speeding tickets fatally struck moped rider Gerardo Cielo Ahuatl at Grand Street and Graham Avenue. The truck, owned by JCDecaux, had racked up 30 violations since 2017. Despite this, the driver escaped charges, and the vehicle never triggered the city’s Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program, which requires safety courses for drivers with repeated violations. The intersection had only paint and plastic flappers—ignored by drivers—until officials added some concrete barriers in the fall. Local council members had pushed for stronger protection. The DOT said it would review safety practices with JCDecaux. The 34th District has one of Brooklyn’s highest truck-related fatality rates. Vulnerable road users remain exposed by weak enforcement and flimsy infrastructure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, titled 'The Streetsie Awards: Vote for Your Favorite Streetfilm of the Year!', showcases Clarence Eckerson Jr.’s work documenting the fight for safer streets. The films cover cargo bikes, school streets, women’s rides, and international comparisons. They highlight how protected bike lanes and open streets reduce danger for children and families. Jersey City and Hoboken, featured in one film, have reached zero road deaths by redesigning streets for people, not cars. Council action is not involved, but the advocacy is clear: safer infrastructure saves lives. The films make the case—New York can do better for its most vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The agency completed only 25 miles of bike lanes and 11.95 miles of bus lanes. The matter, titled 'DOT Will Not Reach Required Bike and Bus Lane Requirements This Year,' drew sharp criticism from Riders Alliance and Transportation Alternatives. Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance said, 'The Adams administration is many miles wide of the mark when it comes to complying with the Streets Plan and keeping the mayor's promise to millions of riders.' Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives added, 'The city needs to meet these goals without delay or excuse and stop leaving New Yorkers who walk, bike, and bus behind.' A City Council spokesperson blamed staff shortages and unfilled vacancies, calling the situation 'unacceptable.' The Council urged the administration to fill key roles and meet legal requirements.

The commentary notes, 'the stats on 2021's pedestrian death crisis came out not too long ago, and they were awful. As in, the-worst-they-been-in-40-years awful.' No council bill or vote is attached, but the piece draws on federal data and expert analysis. It singles out SUVs as a main threat: drivers are four times more likely to strike pedestrians while turning, and children hit by SUVs are eight times more likely to die than if struck by smaller cars. The article also exposes the frequency and devastation of vehicle-into-building crashes and the false promise of autonomous vehicles. It underscores how car culture’s burdens fall hardest on marginalized communities.

New York City Transit President Richard Davey explained that peak hour service would be trimmed, with modest increases in wait times, while some weekend service would expand. Transit advocates and union leaders, including Richard Davis, condemned the cuts, warning of increased rider frustration and assaults on workers. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani urged passage of bills to freeze fares and fill the MTA’s fiscal gap, stating, "We have to fix the rot at the heart of the transit system."

Assembly Member Amy Paulin, chair of the Corporations Committee, insists, 'we don’t have to justify funding the MTA adequately. It is very justified.' Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany calls for an end to 'raiding dedicated funds.' The governor’s office has not pledged to stop.

They warn against using cameras as cash cows or funding police and private contractors. The report states: "The purpose of [automated enforcement] is to improve safety, not catch unsuspecting drivers." Ralph adds, "They need to be in places with known safety risks, and it should be a data driven process."
