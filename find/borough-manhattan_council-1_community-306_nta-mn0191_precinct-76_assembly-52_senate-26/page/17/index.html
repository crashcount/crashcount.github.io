Riders waited up to 16 minutes. Senator Gounardes called out the agency for misleading the public. Track work on another line delayed improvements. Riders left stranded. Trust broken. Transparency demanded.</p><p class=mb3>On September 7, 2023, the MTA faced backlash for failing to deliver on its pledge of eight-minute weekday headways for the R train in southern Brooklyn. The issue, reported by State Senator Andrew Gounardes, surfaced after riders complained of waits as long as 16 minutes. The MTA had announced service upgrades, but later changed its press release, citing F line track work as the cause for delay—work unrelated to the R train. Gounardes, who fought for MTA funding in Albany, accused the agency of misrepresenting the improvements, saying, 'I’m shocked and frustrated that the MTA would misrepresent these service upgrades to the riding public.' Transit advocates like Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance echoed calls for honesty: 'Public transit shouldn’t be a rollercoaster of mismatched expectations.' The incident has strained relations between the MTA and its legislative supporters, highlighting the need for transparency and reliability in transit service.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article, reviewed by Streetsblog NYC, highlights systemic failures: unsafe streets, lack of charging infrastructure, and tech companies shifting risk onto underpaid delivery workers. Council Member Alexa Aviles urges rapid expansion of e-bike charging stations and blames corporate greed. State Senators Jessica Ramos and Brad Hoylman-Sigal call for industry accountability and a standardized, safe delivery vehicle. The matter summary states, 'The city needs a systemic fix, justice for workers and accountability by tech giants.' Advocacy groups reject punitive crackdowns on workers, pushing instead for expanded bike lanes and public infrastructure. The piece concludes that only a multi-pronged, structural approach—never just enforcement—will protect vulnerable road users and delivery workers alike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

This stretch of Atlantic Avenue is notorious for deadly crashes. Council Member Lincoln Restler responded, stating, “Our community is unified in demanding immediate changes to dramatically slow down traffic, improve safety at intersections, and install new mid block crossings.” The incident marks the second fatal crash on this corridor in 2023. Despite calls from Restler and other local officials for mid-block crossings and traffic calming after previous deaths, the city has not acted. The bill or action is a public statement, not legislation, but it highlights urgent demands for redesign and enforcement to protect vulnerable road users. No safety improvements have been implemented yet.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article, titled 'Beyond KSI: How DOT Can Identify Unsafe Streets Before Tragedy Strikes,' exposes how KSI misses hidden dangers and fails to prevent future deaths. No council bill number is attached; this is a public call to action, not legislation. The critique highlights that, despite 37 road deaths on the Upper West Side in ten years, DOT’s 2023 plan ignored these corridors. The author mapped safety features and hazards, proposing a new, proactive metric based on accessibility, comfort, and livability. The piece urges DOT to shift from counting casualties to preventing them, stating, 'we need a different metric to fix the underlying problem of safety on city streets—one that is community-centered and doesn’t reduce our assessment of a certain street’s needs to grim numbers.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident marks the 21st cyclist death this year, the highest since Vision Zero began in 2014. The matter highlights that only 1.64% of district streets have protected bike lanes, far below the city average. Jada Yeboah, Bronx/Uptown Organizer for Transportation Alternatives, condemned the city's failure: "Inaction is killing New Yorkers of color." She demanded Mayor Adams meet legal requirements for protected bike lanes, noting only five miles have been built in the Bronx out of 50 required citywide this year. The Bronx ranks third in traffic fatalities, eighth in injuries among 51 districts. The city's inaction leaves cyclists exposed.

Rivera and Bike New York’s Jon Orcutt wrote, 'Disruption of any city bikeway requires public information, working detours and operational attention—not just an unheralded shut-down.'

Adriano Espaillat quietly lobbied Bronx officials against proposed Fordham Road bus lane upgrades. The project, under city review since 2022, aimed to speed up buses for 85,000 daily riders by installing dedicated busways or offset lanes. According to Streetsblog, Espaillat leaned on younger electeds to align with Council Member Oswald Feliz, a vocal critic. 'He defers to the local elected officials, and all of them seem to be in agreement,' said Espaillat’s chief of staff, Aneiry Batista. Lawmakers who once supported the upgrades grew silent or opposed them after Espaillat’s intervention. The Department of Transportation, MTA, and governor’s office met with Espaillat to discuss the project, but delays persisted. The opposition from Feliz and business groups led DOT to scrap the most ambitious safety options. Riders, many without cars, remain exposed to slow, hazardous conditions as cars block bus lanes and traffic crawls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill aims to bypass bureaucratic hurdles and act automatically, modeled after ignition interlock devices for drunk drivers.

MTA spokesperson John McCarthy said the environmental assessment 'covered every conceivable potential traffic, air quality, social and economic effect.' The MTA also pledged mitigation for environmental justice communities. The bill’s status is active, with strong support from New York’s leadership and ongoing opposition from New Jersey.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable commuters wait.</p><p class=mb3>On July 20, 2023, the MTA called on Mayor Eric Adams and the Department of Transportation (DOT) to support renewed bus lane expansion on Fordham Road. The city had canceled a planned busway after pushback from business owners and Council Member Oswald Feliz, who remains a vocal critic. MTA New York City Transit President Richard Davey said, "Our hope is that we DOT stays with us and we're implementing this, hopefully, later this year." MTA CEO Janno Lieber stressed, "We can't deemphasize and under-prioritize the lives of people of the Bronx and also Upper Manhattan who are trying to get east and west across this incredibly busy corridor." DOT spokesperson Vin Barone described a new proposal with dedicated curbside loading and minimal traffic diversions. The city’s earlier pledge for 20 new miles of bus lanes per year has not been met. Eighty-five thousand daily bus riders, many vulnerable, remain at risk on slow, crowded streets. No formal safety analysis was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Their letter to the Traffic Mobility Review Board states: 'No one community should disproportionately bear the burden of the cars and trucks passing through their neighborhood.' Hanif, along with Lincoln Restler, Alexa Avilés, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Crystal Hudson, joined borough, state, and federal colleagues in this push. They propose a credit system to balance costs between DOT bridges and MTA tunnels, aiming to protect neighborhoods like the Brooklyn waterfront and the BQE corridor from traffic surges. The MTA declined comment. The Board will soon set final toll rates and rules. The federal government has approved the congestion pricing plan, with tolls for cars expected between $9 and $23. Over 100 exemption requests, including from taxi and for-hire vehicle drivers, are under review.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plans, discussed in committee, propose new highway off-ramps on Hicks Street. The matter summary states: 'DOT proposals rely on outdated approaches by building new highway ramps instead of eliminating them.' Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon criticized the plan for increasing traffic and pollution near homes, urging a new approach: 'They need to go back to the drawing board.' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes called out the reliance on old infrastructure, saying, 'The proposals should not be doubling down on the infrastructure and transportation of the past.' Former DOT Commissioner Hank Gutman said, 'They don't improve safety, they don't improve traffic, and they certainly don't improve any of the surrounding communities.' All concepts include a buffered or protected bike lane on Atlantic Avenue, but the impact on vulnerable road users remains uncertain.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Yet their state rakes in billions from MTA contracts. The plan will raise $15 billion for transit. Jersey firms stand to gain more. Lawsuits loom. Money and politics collide. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On June 29, 2023, a report surfaced in Streetsblog NYC detailing the debate over MTA congestion pricing. The report, titled "New Jersey May See Red over Congestion Pricing, but Garden State Gets Plenty of MTA Green," highlights that from 2014 to 2022, the MTA paid New Jersey companies $3.3 billion for goods and services. The plan, set to raise $15 billion for the MTA's 2020-2024 capital plan, faces opposition from New Jersey officials, including Governor Phil Murphy, who have threatened lawsuits. The article quotes Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany: "Congestion pricing will bring in $15 billion alone for the MTA's $55 billion 2020-2024 capital plan, and New Jersey businesses stand to profit from this major increase in MTA capital spending." MTA spokesperson Eugene Resnick adds that congestion pricing will "reduce traffic, improve regional air quality, and boost the Garden State's economy." Despite the political fight, the money keeps flowing. Vulnerable road users remain at risk as the system prioritizes contracts and capital over street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal, announced June 23, 2023, aims to direct new revenue toward street safety projects. The report behind the bill states: 'Injuries from crashes involving large vehicles increased by 91 percent and fatalities by 75 percent between 2016 and 2019.' Mamdani said, 'This is an initiative to make our streets safer for our children.' Gounardes called out the public cost of 'mini-tanks.' The bill responds to data showing nearly half of children killed on city streets were struck by drivers of large vehicles, rising to 80 percent in 2022.
