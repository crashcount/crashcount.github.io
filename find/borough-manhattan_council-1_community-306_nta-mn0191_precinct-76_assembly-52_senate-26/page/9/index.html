Anger filled the streets.</p><p class=mb3>On September 8, 2024, a coalition of transit advocates and elected officials, including Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, gathered in Manhattan to protest Governor Hochul’s indefinite pause of congestion pricing. The event, described as a 'citywide subway accessibility day of action,' spotlighted the $15 billion shortfall now facing the MTA’s 2020-2024 capital plan. According to the event summary, 'the cancellation of elevator installations at 23 subway stations' followed the funding cut. Gallagher condemned the decision, declaring, 'We all matter, and we all need elevators, and we all need congestion pricing.' Comptroller Brad Lander called the move 'shameful.' The rally demanded immediate reinstatement of congestion pricing to restore funding for subway accessibility, directly impacting disabled New Yorkers, parents, and seniors.

The Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the MTA (PCAC) found that 'various proposals to replace the mass transit money lost from pausing congestion pricing either don’t raise the same revenue or fail to achieve other benefits such as reduced traffic from the Manhattan toll.' The report, reviewed by Weprin, details that none of the eight alternatives—ranging from payroll taxes to casino revenue—would match congestion pricing’s $1 billion annual yield or its bondable value. Lisa Daglian, PCAC’s executive director, said these options either fall short on funding or burden working New Yorkers, while missing out on cleaner air and less traffic.

Congestion pricing, passed in 2019, was designed to fund transit and reduce deadly traffic.
