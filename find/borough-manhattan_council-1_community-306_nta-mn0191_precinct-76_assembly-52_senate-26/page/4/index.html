The article details a standoff between the MTA, New York State, and U.S. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy, who demands the tolls be taken down, threatening to withhold highway funds. The MTA argues the legality of the tolls and seeks a court injunction, stating, 'congestion pricing is legal and proper.' The system, operational since January 2025, has reduced daily vehicle entries into Manhattan’s core by 76,000 in April and raised $159 million in the first quarter. The dispute highlights tensions over funding priorities and the impact on lower-income drivers, but the courts, not drivers or pedestrians, will decide the fate of the tolls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets remain perilous for walkers and riders until the law takes hold.</p><p class=mb3>On May 21, 2025, the Senate Transportation Committee advanced bill S4045B, known as the Stop Super Speeders bill. The measure passed with just two 'no' votes out of 13. The bill requires speed-limiting devices in cars of drivers with six or more camera-issued speeding tickets in a year. Streetsblog NYC reports, 'A bill that would prevent the most-reckless drivers from speeding easily moved forward on Tuesday.' Senator Andrew Gounardes sponsors the bill, emphasizing it targets the most dangerous drivers. Assembly sponsor Emily Gallagher raised concerns about cost and judicial bias, but stressed that speeding endangers everyone. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins backs the bill's safety focus. According to safety analysts, restricting repeat speeders directly tackles a major threat to pedestrians and cyclists, likely reducing crashes and making streets safer citywide.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Local 320 President Edwin Aviles called Lander 'the one and only person in NYC government who has ever publicly recognized and championed safety, fair wages, and a fair Collective Bargaining Agreement.' No council member sponsored or voted on this action. The endorsement signals a push for leadership that may prioritize safer streets and better conditions for cyclists and pedestrians.

The bill’s summary states it targets repeat speeders with court orders and misdemeanor charges for non-compliance. Data shows 21 percent of fatal pedestrian crashes in NYC involve vehicles with six or more camera tickets in the prior year. Speed limiters have been shown to reduce traffic deaths by 37 percent.
