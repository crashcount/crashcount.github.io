The matter arose after attorney Adam White was arrested for removing plastic from an obscured license plate; charges were later dropped by Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez, citing 'insufficient evidence.' The bill, discussed at a press conference, aims to crack down on license plate defacement and illegal parking, which Restler says is rampant among city workers and police. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes introduced a similar bill at the state level. Both lawmakers stress the need for public accountability and tougher enforcement to protect vulnerable road users from drivers who evade responsibility.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Gounardes urged the governor to include MTA funding in the initial budget. Gallagher criticized the gas tax holiday, urging funds go to transit.

The project, championed by Councilmember Lincoln Restler, followed years of complaints about blocked, unprotected lanes and frequent crashes. The matter, described as a 'complete transformation of the look and feel of the corridor,' converted Schermerhorn from a chaotic two-way street to a one-way with parking-protected bike lanes. Restler, who once failed to ride the stretch without leaving the lane due to illegal parking, called the redesign 'real safety in downtown Brooklyn.'

The city claims this crackdown will save lives.</p><p class=mb3>On August 1, 2022, New York City activated speed cameras 24/7 after a legislative deal in Albany. In the first three weeks, cameras issued 513,777 tickets—70 percent more than before. The bill, championed by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, removed harsher penalties but kept round-the-clock enforcement. The matter summary states, 'speed safety cameras are working as they should—catching more speeding drivers and combatting reckless driving.' Council members and advocates, including Elizabeth Adams and Jehiah Czebotar, backed the move. They point to data showing most extra tickets came at night and weekends, exposing a hidden threat to pedestrians and cyclists. Officials insist the expansion will save lives and curb reckless driving.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
