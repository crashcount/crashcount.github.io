The project, coordinated with Council Member Julie Menin, used fiber-reinforced polymer panels to shield riders from the bridge’s hazardous metal grating. The official matter: 'Roosevelt Island Bridge bike lane now covered for a safer, smoother ride.' Won praised the project’s quick finish and its promise of safer, more comfortable biking. DOT and community leaders noted the new surface prevents slips and flats, separating cyclists from traffic. The $100,000 upgrade, never before used in New York, aims to keep vulnerable road users out of harm’s way.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Staff shortages and budget cuts choke progress. Riders wait. Commutes crawl. Promises break. The city’s most vulnerable—bus riders—are left stranded by inaction and empty pledges.</p><p class=mb3>The Streets Plan law, passed by the City Council in 2019, requires DOT to build 20 miles of new bus lanes in 2022 and 30 miles each year for the next four years. As of December 2022, DOT had built only 7.7 miles, with 4.2 miles of new camera-enforced lanes and 7.3 miles under construction. The agency cites staff shortages and budget cuts as the main obstacles. Council members and advocates, including Riders Alliance and the City Council, have condemned the delays and called staff shortages 'unacceptable.' Mayor Adams’s administration has revised its promise, now counting 'enhanced' lanes, not just new ones. DOT spokesman Vin Barone insists the agency intends to meet 2023 goals, but specifics are lacking. The law has no enforcement provision. The city’s one million daily bus riders, many low-income and people of color, continue to suffer slow, unreliable service.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The survey, administered by WBA Research, asked riders to rate satisfaction with conditions like panhandling and homelessness, but gave no room for context. The matter summary states, 'the survey was flawed and would produce biased results.' The critique opposes the narrative that subway danger comes from vulnerable people, and warns that these results justify more police, not real safety. No council bill or committee is involved; this is a public challenge to MTA’s data practices. The author notes, 'the authority is failing to collect key data that it can use to actually improve people’s experience using transit.' Riders’ voices are lost.

The fight is for safer, shared streets.</p><p class=mb3>""For us, it's a no-brainer to put it under DOT so that we can push the program to be a little more holistic, and start thinking about these other opportunities for the curb. If we end up seeing the program fall under DWCP, you're going to lose the opportunity to evolve it."" -- Charles Fall</p><p class=mb3>This proposal, now before the City Council, seeks to expand the Open Restaurant program by allowing curbside space to become 'community parklets.' The bill is led by Council Member Marjorie Velazquez, though she declined comment as the process continues. The matter, as described by the Regional Plan Association and partners, aims to 'enable merchants or organized groups to tap into the Open Restaurant program and its legal infrastructure, giving new mixed-use space to programs that benefit their communities.' The Alfresco NYC Coalition and advocates like Maulin Mehta support shifting oversight to the Department of Transportation (DOT) for a broader, safer approach to curb use. The bill is under active debate, with hearings showing strong support for reclaiming curb space for public benefit, not just cars or restaurants.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Subway riders backed Governor Hochul by an 81 to 19 percent margin in districts with the busiest stations. The article states, 'the governor needs to invest in mass transit and provide the MTA the billions it needs in new dedicated revenues to save it from the fiscal cliff.' Advocates like Rachael Fauss, John McCarthy, Liam Blank, Kate Slevin, and Lisa Daglian urge Hochul and the legislature to boost funding and treat transit as essential. They warn of a 'death spiral' if service cuts and fare hikes hit. Hochul’s support for projects like the Interborough Express and congestion pricing is noted. The message is clear: New Yorkers demand safe, reliable transit, and the governor must deliver.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Manhattan Community Board 4’s Transportation Committee unanimously supported the proposal but urged DOT to add more physical barriers. The plan includes pedestrian islands and repurposes car lanes in some sections, but for 19 blocks, car lanes remain untouched. Council Member Erik Bottcher and local activists pushed for the redesign, citing high crash and fatality rates: 173 crashes this year, 40 injuries, and three pedestrian deaths since 2016. Committee members, including Christine Berthet and Brett Firfer, criticized painted islands as unsafe, calling for concrete or vertical barriers. DOT’s Patrick Kennedy cited resource limits.

The article, titled 'Walkable City 10 Years Later: Cars Make Us Sicker Than We Thought,' draws on studies showing road emissions cause 53,000 early deaths annually in the U.S., with 1,400 in New York City alone. Healthcare costs from vehicle emissions top $21 billion per year in the city. The piece highlights that electric vehicles do not eliminate most toxic emissions, which come from tires and non-tailpipe sources. Traffic noise increases risk of heart attacks, strokes, and dementia. The article quotes, 'People who walk 8.6 minutes a day are 33 percent more likely to report better mental health.' It argues that walking and biking foster stronger communities and civic engagement, while car traffic breeds isolation and danger.

The matter, titled 'Why Do People With Disabilities Have to Sue To Get Accessible Sidewalks?', highlights the city's long resistance to basic ADA compliance. Plaintiffs like Fran Fulton said, 'They're responding to our needs now because we sued them.' Disability Rights Advocates attorney Meredith Weaver called the process 'hard-fought,' noting that leaders' inaction led to injuries and isolation. Weaver stressed that proactive, well-funded sidewalk networks—not lawsuits—would better protect people with mobility challenges.

A 2004 Rutgers study cited in the report found permanent daylight savings time would cut pedestrian deaths by about 13 percent during dusk and dawn.

Committee votes yes. Every resident gets $100 monthly for Metro. Funds target bus, streetcar, and neighborhoods left behind. Lawmakers say it’s costly, but worth it. Riders wait for better, cheaper, fairer service.</p><p class=mb3>The Metro for DC Amendment Act of 2021 advanced on October 3, 2022, with a unanimous vote by the DC Council’s Committee on Transportation and the Environment. The bill promises, as its summary states, to put '$100 per month on District residents' SmarTrip cards' and to invest millions in bus and streetcar improvements, especially for underserved neighborhoods. Councilmember Charles Allen (Ward 6) introduced the bill, joined in support by Christina Henderson (At-large) and Janeese Lewis George (Ward 4). Committee Chair Mary Cheh (Ward 3) acknowledged the program’s high cost—an estimated $163 million in fiscal year 2025—but called the community benefit 'more than worth it.' The bill also creates a $10 million Transit Equity fund. The measure now heads to the Committee of the Whole for further review and two rounds of voting. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson has not yet scheduled a hearing.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He demanded a year’s pause. The move stalls safer, faster transit. Thousands of daily bus riders wait. Pedestrians and cyclists remain exposed. Cars keep ruling the street. The city’s promise fades.</p><p class=mb3>On October 2, 2022, Councilmember Oswald Feliz of District 15 opposed the Department of Transportation’s plan to convert segments of Fordham Road to bus and delivery-only lanes. Feliz asked DOT to pause the redesign for at least 12 months, citing concerns about traffic diversion and business impacts. The matter, reported as 'Eric Adams’ ambitious bus lane plans hit roadblock on NYC’s Fordham Road,' details how Feliz’s opposition blocks a key part of Mayor Adams’ pledge to build 20 new miles of bus lanes. DOT’s proposal aimed to restrict private vehicle traffic and prioritize buses and deliveries, a move supported by transit advocates and local polls. But Feliz’s action keeps the status quo: crowded streets, slow buses, and danger for those outside cars. No safety analyst assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Critics warned of empty shops and lost jobs. But after the lane went in, business grew. Sales rose 12 percent. Crashes fell by nearly a quarter. The street got safer. The warnings proved hollow.</p><p class=mb3>This report covers the installation of a protected bike lane on Skillman Avenue in Queens, completed in fall 2018. The project faced fierce opposition, with critics predicting economic ruin for local businesses. Streetsblog obtained sales tax data from the Department of Finance, showing that, after the bike lane went in, Skillman Avenue’s main commercial stretch saw a 12 percent increase in sales and a net gain of three businesses. The article states: 'The economy of Skillman Avenue grew after the city built the new lane.' Department of Transportation spokeswoman Mona Bruno praised the redesign, saying, 'It's thrilling to see the neighborhood flourish with safer and more sustainable streets.' Crash data show a 24 percent drop in crashes and a 28 percent drop in injuries after installation. The findings challenge the myth that bike lanes hurt business and highlight the safety gains for cyclists and pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She calls for sidewalk-only setups, ignoring cramped sidewalks and city data. Her stance favors car storage over public space. Council Member Bottcher and advocates push back, demanding streets for people.</p><p class=mb3>On September 28, 2022, Council Speaker Adrienne Adams made a public statement opposing the use of parking lanes for outdoor dining. The matter, discussed at a Citizens Union breakfast, centered on the future of the Open Restaurants program. Adams said, "Outdoor dining, in my perspective, should be sidewalk. The street extensions were designed to be temporary." The City Council is currently developing legislation to allow restaurants to use parking lanes, but Adams’s comments signal resistance. Council Member Erik Bottcher countered, calling the use of road space for dining "an overall positive development." Adams’s stance ignores the reality that most city sidewalks are too narrow for sidewalk-only dining, squeezing pedestrians and limiting restaurant survival. Advocates and groups like Transportation Alternatives and Open Plans criticized her position, urging the Council to reclaim public space from cars and support vibrant, safe streets for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
