The bill is led by Council Member Marjorie Velazquez, though she declined comment as the process continues. The matter, as described by the Regional Plan Association and partners, aims to 'enable merchants or organized groups to tap into the Open Restaurant program and its legal infrastructure, giving new mixed-use space to programs that benefit their communities.' The Alfresco NYC Coalition and advocates like Maulin Mehta support shifting oversight to the Department of Transportation (DOT) for a broader, safer approach to curb use. The bill is under active debate, with hearings showing strong support for reclaiming curb space for public benefit, not just cars or restaurants.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article states, 'the governor needs to invest in mass transit and provide the MTA the billions it needs in new dedicated revenues to save it from the fiscal cliff.' Advocates like Rachael Fauss, John McCarthy, Liam Blank, Kate Slevin, and Lisa Daglian urge Hochul and the legislature to boost funding and treat transit as essential. They warn of a 'death spiral' if service cuts and fare hikes hit. Hochul’s support for projects like the Interborough Express and congestion pricing is noted.

Manhattan Community Board 4’s Transportation Committee unanimously supported the proposal but urged DOT to add more physical barriers. The plan includes pedestrian islands and repurposes car lanes in some sections, but for 19 blocks, car lanes remain untouched. Council Member Erik Bottcher and local activists pushed for the redesign, citing high crash and fatality rates: 173 crashes this year, 40 injuries, and three pedestrian deaths since 2016. Committee members, including Christine Berthet and Brett Firfer, criticized painted islands as unsafe, calling for concrete or vertical barriers. DOT’s Patrick Kennedy cited resource limits.

The piece states: "We find it's just as easy to get around within a five-mile radius by bike than it is by car. We get exercise, fresh air, and save so much money." The story features direct quotes from Arnout and Nicole Zoeller Boelens, who describe the ease and joy of cycling as a family. No council bill, vote, or committee action is involved. The article challenges the myth that families need cars, showing how street design—not personal choice—shapes safety and mobility for vulnerable road users.

Streets remain deadly. Walking saves lives.</p><p class=mb3>This policy advocacy, published November 15, 2022, revisits the impact of car dependency a decade after 'Walkable City.' The article, titled 'Walkable City 10 Years Later: Cars Make Us Sicker Than We Thought,' draws on studies showing road emissions cause 53,000 early deaths annually in the U.S., with 1,400 in New York City alone. Healthcare costs from vehicle emissions top $21 billion per year in the city. The piece highlights that electric vehicles do not eliminate most toxic emissions, which come from tires and non-tailpipe sources. Traffic noise increases risk of heart attacks, strokes, and dementia. The article quotes, 'People who walk 8.6 minutes a day are 33 percent more likely to report better mental health.' It argues that walking and biking foster stronger communities and civic engagement, while car traffic breeds isolation and danger. No council member is named; this is a broad policy critique, not a legislative action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'Why Do People With Disabilities Have to Sue To Get Accessible Sidewalks?', highlights the city's long resistance to basic ADA compliance.

Disability Rights Advocates attorney Meredith Weaver called the process 'hard-fought,' noting that leaders' inaction led to injuries and isolation. Weaver stressed that proactive, well-funded sidewalk networks—not lawsuits—would better protect people with mobility challenges.

Lucia Deng, a Transportation Alternatives activist, called the move 'huge,' noting the Bronx and Upper Manhattan have long been neglected. DOT planner Patrick Kennedy said, 'We try to maintain the protected connections as much as possible. They really only work if they’re continuous.'

The piece argues that taxing these vehicles would not only discourage their use but also shift the burden of their societal costs back onto their owners. The model follows Washington, D.C.'s recent move to scale registration fees by vehicle size and dedicate funds to safety programs.

The Safer Intersections Act passed a unanimous preliminary vote. Cyclists could yield at lights. Pedestrians and cyclists face fewer deadly turns. The law targets a decades-old danger. Final approval and Congressional sign-off still needed.</p><p class=mb3>Bill B22-0000, known as the Safer Intersections Act, advanced in the Washington, D.C. council with a unanimous preliminary vote on September 28, 2022. The bill, under committee review, would prohibit right turns on red except at designated intersections and allow cyclists to treat stoplights as yield signs. The matter summary states the act 'will prohibit right-on-reds except at designated intersections.' Council Member Christina Henderson acknowledged the controversy, highlighting that 'the vast majority of [traffic violence] incidents are occurring in communities of color.' Advocates and council members argue the ban will reduce deadly 'right-hook' crashes, especially as large vehicles create blind zones. The bill awaits a final vote and Congressional approval, aiming to protect vulnerable road users and address longstanding inequities in traffic violence.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Trash moves off sidewalks. Curb space shifts from cars to public use. The city eyes more locations. Streets get less cluttered. Pedestrians gain room. The program grows, block by block.</p><p class=mb3>On September 27, 2022, the Department of Sanitation announced the expansion of its 'Clean Curbs' pilot program to Staten Island, with a new installation at 704 Bay St. The initiative, previously launched in Times Square and Brooklyn, containerizes commercial trash to clear sidewalks of leaky bags. The Staten Island Chamber of Commerce received a $3,500 grant for the project, which uses bins from CITIBIN, a Brooklyn-based woman-owned business. DSNY spokesman Vincent Gragnani said, 'Use of bins in these two different locations...will improve quality of life in these locations, while helping us learn more about containerized trash in a variety of New York City settings.' The program also repurposes curbside space for public use—like loading zones and parklets—instead of private car storage, freeing up sidewalks for pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Only 6.9 of 30 promised bike lane miles built. Just 2 of 20 bus lane miles delivered. Advocates say the Bronx is left behind. Riders and walkers wait. Promises broken. Streets stay dangerous. Progress stalls. Lives at risk.</p><p class=mb3>On September 26, 2022, advocacy groups Transportation Alternatives and Riders Alliance released a report slamming the Adams administration for failing to meet the NYC Streets Master Plan’s legal mandates. The report states, 'the city is at only 23% of its bike lane goal and 10% of its bus lane goal for the year.' Elizabeth Adams called for protected bike lanes, saying, 'For the future of our climate and the safety on our streets, protected bike lanes need to be a priority.' Danny Pearlstein demanded faster action on bus lanes. Michael Kaess highlighted the Bronx’s lack of progress. The Department of Transportation disputed the numbers, but advocates pointed to missed deadlines and lack of transparency. Staffing shortages and political interference are blamed. Vulnerable road users—cyclists, bus riders, pedestrians—remain exposed as the city drags its feet.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
