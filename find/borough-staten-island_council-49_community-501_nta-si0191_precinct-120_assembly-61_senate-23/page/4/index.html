The event, covered by nypost.com, followed a fatal stabbing and NYPD data showing felony assaults up 9% this year. Ariola warned, 'Forcing more New Yorkers underground with this ridiculous congestion pricing scheme is going to put more people into contact with the dangerously unwell.' She called the subway the city's 'de facto mental institution and homeless shelter.' The policy, supported by Governor Hochul, has increased subway and bus ridership by 6% and 9%. Ariola’s stance: congestion pricing endangers vulnerable riders, forcing them into unsafe conditions. The city has responded with more police and outreach, but many riders remain fearful.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The case, rooted in the MTA’s lawsuit against the feds, remains unresolved. The DOT’s attorney, Dominika Tarczynska, said, "The Department of Transportation maintains the position that New York City should stop charging tolls by April 20." MTA attorney Robert Kaplan countered, "Congestion pricing is in effect, we believe it's working, and ... we don't intend to turn it off unless there's an order from your honor." Governor Hochul and the MTA refuse to comply. The federal government threatens vague consequences but takes no concrete steps. The MTA’s November agreement with the Biden-era DOT did not allow for unilateral federal withdrawal. As the legal fight drags on, congestion pricing continues. Streets south of 60th Street see fewer crashes. Bus speeds rise. Foot traffic grows. Vulnerable road users benefit while politicians bicker.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The meeting's summary: 'A large number of Lower Manhattan residents turned out to support the Canal Street open street, but organizers reduced the program's operating times in response to complaints from some residents.' Chairperson Vincent Cirrito said, 'This is an open space for our residents, for our kids... where they don’t have to worry about vehicles and cars.' Council Member Chris Marte and some residents pushed for further cutbacks, while others defended the open street as vital for safety, accessibility, and local business. The board sided with vulnerable road users, keeping two blocks of Canal Street open to people, not cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The program, legislated by the City Council, lost its federal Covid funding. Mayor Adams has not allocated city funds. The Department of Transportation (DOT) says $5 million is needed to maintain current operations, but the Council’s preliminary budget omits this. DOT Chief of Staff Ryan Lynch told advocates the agency is lobbying for replacement funds. Council Member Shekar Krishnan criticized the mayor’s stance, saying, “It’s deeply misguided to cut funds from the open street program, especially at this moment.” The City Comptroller’s office also faulted the administration for poor planning. The funding gap has already led to reduced hours and fewer open streets.

The plan, not a council bill but a DOT action, covers a seven-mile route along Bailey Avenue, Sedgwick Avenue, Depot Place, Exterior Street, E. 135th Street, Lincoln Avenue, and Bruckner Boulevard. The DOT cited access issues with state and private landowners, abandoning Mayor Adams’s earlier promise of a true waterfront path. The official summary states: 'protected bike lanes on streets near the waterfront, rather than a true waterfront greenway.' Advocates like Chauncy Young and Laura Solis welcomed protected lanes but lamented the loss of a car-free riverside route. Mayor Adams claimed the project would help undo highway devastation in the Bronx. Still, the plan leaves vulnerable road users exposed to traffic, not shielded by water’s edge.

They called for increased federal funding for the MTA’s $68.4 billion capital plan, citing that New York’s transit system carries 43% of U.S. riders but receives only 17% of federal formula funds. The letter urges, 'Mass transit must be federally funded at a level commensurate to its importance.' Stewart-Cousins, mentioned as a key signatory, previously rejected the capital plan due to a $35 billion shortfall. The group asks for $14 billion in federal support, up from $13 billion in the last plan. The MTA warns that without this funding, critical infrastructure—power, signaling, accessibility—remains at risk. The request is urgent.

The clock ticks.</p><p class=mb3>On March 21, 2025, the Citizens Budget Commission (CBC) released a warning about the MTA’s $33.4-billion capital budget gap for 2025–2029. The CBC recommends slashing $17 billion, scrapping expansion plans like the Interborough Express, and boosting city and state contributions by $9 billion. The CBC calls for a 6 percent hike in fares, tolls, and vehicle fees—higher than the planned 4 percent. Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie said tax hikes are on the table. Governor Hochul’s office backs a payroll tax hike, but the CBC wants it regionalized. The CBC’s Andrew Rein said, “We have to prioritize state-of-good-repair, basic modernization, and delay some of the system expansions.” The report warns that failing to fund maintenance will gut service, repeating past crises. No direct safety analysis was provided, but cuts threaten transit reliability for millions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure follows the passage of Sammy’s Law, which lets the city set its own speed limits. The Department of Transportation cited ten severe injuries and one death in Dumbo over five years. The new zone covers streets packed with pedestrians, from Furman to Navy and Hudson, and John to Sands and the BQE. Restler said, 'Data has shown that a one mile per hour increase in speed results in a nearly three percent increase in mortality.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez added, 'Lowering vehicle speed limits by even a few miles per hour could be the difference between life or death in a traffic crash.' The change will take effect after a public comment period. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso called for more slow zones in high-crash neighborhoods. The city plans to expand 20 mph limits to over 250 locations by the end of 2025.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary states: 'New York City has failed to meet legally required benchmarks for redesigning streets for bikes, buses, and pedestrians due to a lack of resources and political interference.' Mayor Eric Adams is named as the main obstacle. The report cites staff shortages, shrinking divisions, and political pushback—especially the mayor’s role in killing the Fordham Road busway.

Data from Jehiah Czebotar shows cameras now issue 76.4% of bus lane and stop tickets—93% by December. Bus speeds rose 5%, crashes involving buses dropped 20%, and emissions fell up to 10%. Persistent violators remain, with some drivers racking up five tickets. Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein called for escalating fines and legislative changes to target repeat offenders.
