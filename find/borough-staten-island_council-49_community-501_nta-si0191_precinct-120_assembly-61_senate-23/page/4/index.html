The program, legislated by the City Council, lost its federal Covid funding. Mayor Adams has not allocated city funds. The Department of Transportation (DOT) says $5 million is needed to maintain current operations, but the Council’s preliminary budget omits this. DOT Chief of Staff Ryan Lynch told advocates the agency is lobbying for replacement funds. Council Member Shekar Krishnan criticized the mayor’s stance, saying, “It’s deeply misguided to cut funds from the open street program, especially at this moment.” The City Comptroller’s office also faulted the administration for poor planning. The funding gap has already led to reduced hours and fewer open streets.

The plan, not a council bill but a DOT action, covers a seven-mile route along Bailey Avenue, Sedgwick Avenue, Depot Place, Exterior Street, E. 135th Street, Lincoln Avenue, and Bruckner Boulevard. The DOT cited access issues with state and private landowners, abandoning Mayor Adams’s earlier promise of a true waterfront path. The official summary states: 'protected bike lanes on streets near the waterfront, rather than a true waterfront greenway.' Advocates like Chauncy Young and Laura Solis welcomed protected lanes but lamented the loss of a car-free riverside route. Mayor Adams claimed the project would help undo highway devastation in the Bronx. Still, the plan leaves vulnerable road users exposed to traffic, not shielded by water’s edge. Public workshops are ongoing.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They called for increased federal funding for the MTA’s $68.4 billion capital plan, citing that New York’s transit system carries 43% of U.S. riders but receives only 17% of federal formula funds. The letter urges, 'Mass transit must be federally funded at a level commensurate to its importance.' Stewart-Cousins, mentioned as a key signatory, previously rejected the capital plan due to a $35 billion shortfall. The group asks for $14 billion in federal support, up from $13 billion in the last plan. The MTA warns that without this funding, critical infrastructure—power, signaling, accessibility—remains at risk. The request is urgent.

The CBC recommends slashing $17 billion, scrapping expansion plans like the Interborough Express, and boosting city and state contributions by $9 billion. The CBC calls for a 6 percent hike in fares, tolls, and vehicle fees—higher than the planned 4 percent. Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie said tax hikes are on the table. Governor Hochul’s office backs a payroll tax hike, but the CBC wants it regionalized. The CBC’s Andrew Rein said, “We have to prioritize state-of-good-repair, basic modernization, and delay some of the system expansions.” The report warns that failing to fund maintenance will gut service, repeating past crises.

The measure follows the passage of Sammy’s Law, which lets the city set its own speed limits. The Department of Transportation cited ten severe injuries and one death in Dumbo over five years. The new zone covers streets packed with pedestrians, from Furman to Navy and Hudson, and John to Sands and the BQE. Restler said, 'Data has shown that a one mile per hour increase in speed results in a nearly three percent increase in mortality.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez added, 'Lowering vehicle speed limits by even a few miles per hour could be the difference between life or death in a traffic crash.' The change will take effect after a public comment period. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso called for more slow zones in high-crash neighborhoods. The city plans to expand 20 mph limits to over 250 locations by the end of 2025.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Earlier that day, a Dodge Charger in Manhattan changed lanes, clipped a street sweeper, spun out, and pinned an officer against his patrol vehicle.

The matter summary states: 'New York City has failed to meet legally required benchmarks for redesigning streets for bikes, buses, and pedestrians due to a lack of resources and political interference.' Mayor Eric Adams is named as the main obstacle. The report cites staff shortages, shrinking divisions, and political pushback—especially the mayor’s role in killing the Fordham Road busway. Former DOT commissioner Polly Trottenberg warned the plan needed more funding and a new approach. Advocates and officials say Adams’s lack of support left the city’s most vulnerable road users exposed. The law’s promise is broken.

Riders and advocates rage at more fees.</p><p class=mb3>On March 12, 2025, New York State lawmakers unveiled a budget proposal to fund the MTA’s 2025-2029 capital plan, which faces a $35 billion shortfall. The plan, discussed in both Senate and Assembly one-house budgets, suggests new taxes: fees on online deliveries, higher payroll mobility taxes, and more surcharges on rideshare trips. The matter summary reads: 'Taxes to back the MTA? That is what some New York lawmakers are proposing.' Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins is mentioned as a key figure. Stewart-Cousins and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie previously rejected the MTA’s $68.4 billion plan last December over funding gaps. The proposal has sparked public anger, with advocates and riders decrying more taxes. MTA chair Janno Lieber insists full funding is essential to keep trains and buses running safely.

The change, reported by Streetsblog NYC, limits car-free hours to Saturdays only from May to September—a 50 percent cut from last year’s already reduced schedule. The program, once a weekend staple from spring to fall, now faces its smallest footprint yet. Alex Morano, a volunteer organizer, called the rollback 'really unfortunate,' stressing the street’s value to the neighborhood. Saskia Haegens, Chair of the Prospect Heights Neighborhood Development Corporation, urged full city funding, saying the program is 'transformative.' Organizers blame insufficient city support, with less than half the cost covered this year. The Department of Transportation claims $10 million in annual support and promises a permanent redesign, but for now, cars win back space.

Non-residents needn’t be banned from parking here, just charged for it, with the money going to the MTA.' The editorial highlights rampant illegal vehicle registrations and the dangers they pose, including uninsured cars and increased risk for cyclists. The proposal urges charging both residents and visitors for parking, with higher rates in dense, wealthy areas. The plan aims to reduce congestion, generate MTA revenue, and reclaim curb space for safer uses.

MTA spokesperson Laura Cala-Rauch said the program 'is having a big impact on speeding buses and improving the quality of life for New Yorkers.' Data from Jehiah Czebotar shows cameras now issue 76.4% of bus lane and stop tickets—93% by December. Bus speeds rose 5%, crashes involving buses dropped 20%, and emissions fell up to 10%. Persistent violators remain, with some drivers racking up five tickets. Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein called for escalating fines and legislative changes to target repeat offenders.
