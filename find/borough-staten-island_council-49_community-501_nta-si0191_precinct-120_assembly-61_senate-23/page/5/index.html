He argued, 'Congestion pricing alone will not reduce traffic to its fullest potential. Central business district tolling should absolutely be coupled with massive increases and improvements in public transit service.' Samuelsen criticized the MTA for not expanding service and called the toll 'classist.' His stance shifted from earlier support in 2019 to strong opposition, citing unmet promises and risks to transit funding. No council bill or committee action is noted. The union’s move leaves vulnerable road users facing the same old dangers: crowded streets, slow buses, and stalled safety reforms.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Thirty-two business owners petitioned DOT to halt the project, citing truck maneuvering dangers. DOT representative Vincent Barone called the route 'a critical gap' in the bike network and promised 'much-needed safety improvements.'

Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein called it sabotage: 'Governor Kathy Hochul took a gamble when she sabotaged our public transit system for political gain and she lost dearly.' The MTA now faces a $33 billion shortfall for its next plan. No new revenue source is in place. The legislature, as Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany notes, already did its job by passing the law.

Vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>This report, published September 20, 2024, details a wave of transit funding crises nationwide, with New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) at the center. The article, titled '‘Doom Loop’ Alert: Transit Systems are Suffering — And Too Many Are Cutting Service,' chronicles how pandemic relief funds are running dry, ridership lags, and costs soar. Governor Kathy Hochul killed congestion pricing, stripping the MTA of $1 billion a year. Now, the agency slashes repair programs. Streetsblog quotes transit leaders warning that service cuts mean crowded buses, more cars, and lost productivity. Council members and mayors in cities like Miami and Philadelphia face similar choices. The story makes clear: when transit fails, vulnerable road users—those who walk, bike, or rely on buses—face greater risk. The systemic danger grows as public transportation falters and streets fill with traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report singles out New York: 'where congestion pricing was paused, stands out as the urban core with the biggest increase in both congestion and VMT among the top 25.' Governor Hochul’s decision to halt congestion pricing drew sharp criticism from advocates. Sara Lind, Co-Executive Director of Open Plans, called the move 'disastrous,' warning that abandoning congestion pricing is a 'dereliction of duty' on street safety. The report blames city inaction on bus and bike lanes for worsening gridlock. As driving surges, vulnerable road users face greater risk.

Gallagher condemned the decision, declaring, 'We all matter, and we all need elevators, and we all need congestion pricing.' Comptroller Brad Lander called the move 'shameful.'

The report, reviewed by Weprin, details that none of the eight alternatives—ranging from payroll taxes to casino revenue—would match congestion pricing’s $1 billion annual yield or its bondable value. Lisa Daglian, PCAC’s executive director, said these options either fall short on funding or burden working New Yorkers, while missing out on cleaner air and less traffic.
