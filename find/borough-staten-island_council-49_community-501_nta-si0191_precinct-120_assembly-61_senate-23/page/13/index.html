DOT officials, including Deputy Commissioner Eric Beaton and Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, refused to provide current figures, promising data next year. Brooks-Powers called this 'unacceptable.' She stressed, 'The 30 miles of bus lane and 50 miles of bike lanes is not a goal—it’s legal mandate.' The exchange revealed ongoing tension over DOT’s slow rollout and lack of transparency.

State Senators Jessica Ramos and Brad Hoylman-Sigal call for industry accountability and a standardized, safe delivery vehicle. The matter summary states, 'The city needs a systemic fix, justice for workers and accountability by tech giants.'

The article, titled 'Beyond KSI: How DOT Can Identify Unsafe Streets Before Tragedy Strikes,' exposes how KSI misses hidden dangers and fails to prevent future deaths. No council bill number is attached; this is a public call to action, not legislation. The critique highlights that, despite 37 road deaths on the Upper West Side in ten years, DOT’s 2023 plan ignored these corridors. The author mapped safety features and hazards, proposing a new, proactive metric based on accessibility, comfort, and livability. The piece urges DOT to shift from counting casualties to preventing them, stating, 'we need a different metric to fix the underlying problem of safety on city streets—one that is community-centered and doesn’t reduce our assessment of a certain street’s needs to grim numbers.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident marks the 21st cyclist death this year, the highest since Vision Zero began in 2014. The matter highlights that only 1.64% of district streets have protected bike lanes, far below the city average. Jada Yeboah, Bronx/Uptown Organizer for Transportation Alternatives, condemned the city's failure: "Inaction is killing New Yorkers of color." She demanded Mayor Adams meet legal requirements for protected bike lanes, noting only five miles have been built in the Bronx out of 50 required citywide this year. The Bronx ranks third in traffic fatalities, eighth in injuries among 51 districts. The city's inaction leaves cyclists exposed.

The map must show disruptions, detours, hazards, and closures in real time. The bill summary states: 'Cyclists deserve the same attention and information already given to the city's drivers and transit riders in the form of notifications, updates, and well-marked detours.' Council Member Carlina Rivera sponsored the bill and led its passage. Rivera and Bike New York’s Jon Orcutt wrote, 'Disruption of any city bikeway requires public information, working detours and operational attention—not just an unheralded shut-down.' The law aims to end the chaos and danger of sudden bike lane closures, giving half a million daily riders the information they need to stay safe and keep moving.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Adriano Espaillat quietly lobbied Bronx officials against proposed Fordham Road bus lane upgrades. The project, under city review since 2022, aimed to speed up buses for 85,000 daily riders by installing dedicated busways or offset lanes. According to Streetsblog, Espaillat leaned on younger electeds to align with Council Member Oswald Feliz, a vocal critic. 'He defers to the local elected officials, and all of them seem to be in agreement,' said Espaillat’s chief of staff, Aneiry Batista. Lawmakers who once supported the upgrades grew silent or opposed them after Espaillat’s intervention. The Department of Transportation, MTA, and governor’s office met with Espaillat to discuss the project, but delays persisted. The opposition from Feliz and business groups led DOT to scrap the most ambitious safety options. Riders, many without cars, remain exposed to slow, hazardous conditions as cars block bus lanes and traffic crawls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report, titled "New Jersey May See Red over Congestion Pricing, but Garden State Gets Plenty of MTA Green," highlights that from 2014 to 2022, the MTA paid New Jersey companies $3.3 billion for goods and services. The plan, set to raise $15 billion for the MTA's 2020-2024 capital plan, faces opposition from New Jersey officials, including Governor Phil Murphy, who have threatened lawsuits. The article quotes Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany: "Congestion pricing will bring in $15 billion alone for the MTA's $55 billion 2020-2024 capital plan, and New Jersey businesses stand to profit from this major increase in MTA capital spending." MTA spokesperson Eugene Resnick adds that congestion pricing will "reduce traffic, improve regional air quality, and boost the Garden State's economy." Despite the political fight, the money keeps flowing.
