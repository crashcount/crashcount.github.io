Council Member Tiffany Cabán called the loss 'wave after wave of grief and heartbreak' and demanded safer streets for pedestrians and cyclists. Transportation Alternatives Executive Director Danny Harris urged Mayor Adams and DOT Commissioner Rodriguez to invest in safe streets and fulfill the NYC Streets Plan’s legal requirements. Advocates noted the Department of Transportation failed to expand bike and bus lanes as required last year.

The article states: 'cars parked all over the place, garbage everywhere, and little respect for its neighbors.' Officers park illegally, block sidewalks, and force bus passengers into the street. The 75th Precinct surrounds its memorial with cars. The 102nd’s entrance is nearly blocked by police vehicles. Both precincts show disregard for neighbors and the law. Council members are not named; this is a public exposé, not a legislative action.

The matter, described as 'Let New York City lower its own speed limits,' has strong support from the mayor, DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, and advocates like Families for Safe Streets. Restler’s action was public advocacy. The Assembly is the final hurdle; the bill is already in the governor’s and Senate’s budgets.

Experts say bins could reclaim sidewalks from garbage, freeing space for people. The plan would shift trash from pedestrian paths to the curb, cutting sidewalk clutter and car dominance.</p><p class=mb3>""It would be visually nicer and probably cleaner to have the trash in a container versus on the ground, where it can fall out and blow in the wind."" -- Charles Fall</p><p class=mb3>On March 28, 2023, a policy report recommended using Vanderbilt Avenue’s open street in Brooklyn as a blueprint for citywide trash containerization. The report, led by Clare Miflin of the Center for Zero Waste Design, states: 'The Vanderbilt Avenue open street in Brooklyn could become a blueprint for how the city can finally containerize its trash for collection.' The analysis found that containers could replace sidewalk trash piles, freeing up as much as 25 percent of pedestrian space. The Department of Transportation is redesigning the road, adding curb extensions and loading zones, while the Department of Sanitation considers new collection methods. The plan calls for curbside bins, reducing sidewalk obstacles for pedestrians and shifting space away from cars and trash. No council member sponsored this report, but city agencies and experts are involved. The report argues for urgent action to reclaim public space from garbage and vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan leaves vulnerable road users in the dust.</p><p class=mb3>On March 24, 2023, the Biden administration announced a federal initiative to build a vast network of electric vehicle (EV) charging hubs, aiming for 500,000 plugs and offering a $7,500 clean vehicle tax credit. The policy, described as a 'multi-billion dollar network of electric vehicle (EV) charging hubs,' claims to cut carbon emissions in half by 2030. Transportation advocates Jon Orcutt, Chris Rall, and Jaqi Cohen voiced strong opposition, warning that the plan entrenches car dependency and endangers future use of curb space for bike lanes, pedestrian plazas, or outdoor dining. Critics argue the federal grant program ignores transit riders and fails to electrify municipal fleets. As one advocate put it, 'Billions of dollars are essentially being spent to further the public’s dependence on cars with little benefit to those who cannot rely on one.' The initiative, lacking support for transit or active transportation, leaves vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The program, described as creating 'a seamless boarding experience for parents,' will allow strollers to remain open on buses, ending the need for parents to fold them before boarding. Assemblymember Grace Lee, representing District 65, voiced strong support, sharing her own struggles as a parent navigating transit with strollers.

The budget, now under legislative review, forces New York City to cover a $500 million gap, while the state sits on an $8.7 billion surplus. The matter: 'Hochul's budget not only asks city residents to cover the largest chunk of the MTA's budget gap, but does so in part by continuing long-running practices that essentially under-fund the MTA by millions of dollars each year.' Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas and State Sen. Andrew Gounardes both object, demanding the state honor its legal obligations. Riders Alliance and Reinvent Albany condemn the austerity. With fare hikes looming and no service improvements, city transit riders—often pedestrians and cyclists—bear the brunt.

They face long hours, harassment, and disrespect. Most are alone in male-dominated depots. Pay gaps persist. Riders attack and harass them. Still, these women serve the city with grit and pride.</p><p class=mb3>This testimony, published January 26, 2023, documents the daily reality for women transit operators. The article, titled "What It’s Like to Be a Woman Transit Operator," highlights first-person accounts from women in New York and other cities. They describe being underrepresented, facing unwanted advances, and earning less than male colleagues. One operator, Tonya Abernathy, says, 'As a female it’s harder, because some passengers treat you differently because you’re a woman.' Thejoal Hope adds, 'You get a lot of disrespect, and you got to learn how to deal with that.' The piece calls for better training, pay equity, and supportive management. No council bill or vote is attached, but the testimony exposes systemic dangers for frontline workers and the urgent need for safer, more inclusive transit workplaces.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

New York, once a leader, has not built heavy rail since 1950. Other countries race forward. Riders wait. Streets stay dangerous. The gap widens. Vulnerable users pay the price for inaction.</p><p class=mb3>This policy analysis, published January 24, 2023, reviews U.S. transit investment using Transit Explorer data. The article states: 'The U.S. is falling behind in transit investment while other countries are rapidly expanding their systems.' No council bill number applies; this is a report, not legislation. No committee or council member is named. The analysis highlights that New York, despite its vast rail network, has not expanded heavy rail since 1950 and has no major projects funded or under construction. In contrast, cities like Toronto and Seattle are building out their systems. The lack of transit growth leaves vulnerable road users exposed, as safe, reliable alternatives to car travel stagnate. The U.S. commitment to transit is faltering while global peers surge ahead.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
