The hearing spotlighted the Commercial Waste Zones law, which aims to cut crashes by limiting private trash haulers in each zone. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, author of the 2019 reform, and Council Member Shaun Abreu led the charge, questioning why companies like Cogent Waste Solutions—with poor safety records—were awarded contracts. Reynoso declared, "Saving $20 for a business is not worth five human lives." DSNY Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the process, promising to terminate contracts after multiple at-fault fatalities. BIC Commissioner Liz Crotty admitted, "Safety is not a factor" in license denial. Lawmakers condemned the city for putting cost before safety, leaving vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move comes before the city’s new Commercial Waste Zone program launches this fall. Council Members Shaun Abreu and Sandy Nurse raised alarms, asking, 'how the city awarded a contract to a company with a history of endangering workers to begin with.' Cogent’s trucks have killed one, injured four, and racked up hundreds of violations. Despite this, DSNY allowed Cogent to win contracts in four waste zones. DSNY Deputy Commissioner Joshua Goodman defended the process, stating, 'Safety was absolutely one of the weighted factors,' and promised, 'there will be consequences for lack of compliance.' The oversight hearing exposes a system that lets reckless firms operate, even as new rules loom.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, led by the NJ Turnpike Authority, faces criticism for ignoring alternatives like mass transit, greenways, and bikeways. The article states: 'Gov. Phil Murphy wants to spend over $10 billion to widen a highway in an environmental justice community while asking transit riders to shoulder a 15 percent fare hike. That is unjust and unacceptable.' The Turnpike Authority held limited public sessions, excluded on-the-record comments, and failed to address induced demand or environmental justice. The piece urges federal agencies to reject the project, arguing it will worsen pollution, noise, and health outcomes for vulnerable residents. The author calls for investment in safer, more sustainable transportation instead.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan shifts the avenue to one-way car traffic, adds painted pedestrian islands, curb extensions, and may include a car-free plaza. DOT aims to reduce vehicle presence and traffic violence, responding to local advocacy after several high-profile crashes. Residents and organizers, including Alana Herlands and John Surico, voiced strong support: 'We are going to advocate for the most ambitious plan that not only adds more space for the community... but also reduces traffic violence.'

The DOT had pledged to convert a car lane into a two-way protected bike path by fall 2023, but the project remains unfinished. The matter centers on the urgent need for safe cycling infrastructure: 'It's a crowded route, people are coming to and from work. It’s necessary to have a lane that is especially for the bikes,' said Cruz Rosas-Ponzon. Advocacy groups, including Transportation Alternatives, and delivery worker organizations highlight the deadly risk for working-class immigrants and deliveristas.

Researcher Sofia Martinez said, 'We definitely need to be advocates for electrification, and for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants in any way we can.' The study urges more federal subsidies to speed up the transition. Even replacing aging diesel buses as they retire would cut 35 million tons of CO2.

The law, passed in the state budget, excludes wide, multi-lane roads in the outer boroughs. Adams said, 'I do believe as New Yorkers we need to slow down,' but repeatedly referred to preventable crashes as 'accidents,' a term advocates reject for removing driver responsibility. The City Council must legislate any citywide speed limit change, while the Department of Transportation (DOT) can adjust limits on specific streets after community input. Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers and Speaker Adrienne Adams pledged to 'collaborate and negotiate' with City Hall. Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi stressed the need for street redesign and legal reform, noting, 'This is not a problem that goes away on its own.' Despite new authority, the Adams administration has lagged on safe street infrastructure. The city faces its deadliest start to a year in the Vision Zero era, with 60 killed in the first quarter.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The pilot, announced by MTA Chief Customer Officer Shanifah Rieara, aims to expand OMNY access for low-income riders. Fair Fares gives half-priced rides to New Yorkers earning up to 120 percent of the federal poverty line. The bill’s matter: 'New Yorkers who participate in the city's half-priced transit program Fair Fares will finally be able to use OMNY.' Mayor Adams and the City Council raised eligibility last year, but advocates want broader access. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber called OMNY key for proof-of-payment checks. David Jones, Community Service Society CEO and MTA Board member, supports OMNY for Fair Fares and urges non-police fare enforcement. The pilot follows delays tied to vending machine deployment. About 800,000 New Yorkers qualify for Fair Fares, but only 331,000 are enrolled.

Sponsored by Timothy M. Kennedy with support from Jake Ashby, Jamaal Bailey, and others, the bill mandates street designs that protect everyone—not just drivers. The measure saw strong support but faced opposition from some senators. By requiring complete street principles, S 2714 aims to reduce danger for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users. The bill marks a shift away from car-first planning, forcing cities to build streets for people, not just traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

City promised 75 miles by 2022. Cyclist injuries and deaths stay high. Council Members Joseph and Ossé demand action. City Hall and DOT blamed for delay. Equity and safety ignored. Riders remain exposed.</p><p class=mb3>""This failure is yet another glaring example of the administration falling far behind on its commitments to develop bicycle infrastructure in our city,"" -- Charles Fall</p><p class=mb3>On March 26, 2024, the City Council scrutinized DOT’s failure to deliver protected bike lanes in Borough Park, Midwood, Flatbush, and Bedford-Stuyvesant—Vision Zero ‘Bike Priority Areas’ since 2017. The city pledged 75 miles of new or improved bike routes by 2022. As of now, none have been built. Council Member Rita Joseph, representing Flatbush and Midwood, introduced legislation to speed up construction, stating, “My community has been asking for it. The Commissioner has made a commitment. He needs to step up and do it now.” Council Member Chi Ossé condemned the administration’s inaction, calling it “yet another glaring example” of broken promises. Advocates and residents cite safety and equity concerns, noting these districts suffer more cyclist injuries and deaths but get fewer protected lanes. The Council is now considering oversight to enforce legal benchmarks and ensure fair distribution of bike infrastructure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
