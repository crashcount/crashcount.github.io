Her move keeps roads clogged, transit starved, and vulnerable New Yorkers at risk.</p><p class=mb3>On June 5, 2024, Governor Kathy Hochul abruptly canceled New York’s congestion pricing plan. The policy, passed by the Legislature in 2019, was set to begin within weeks. It would have charged drivers entering Manhattan’s core, raising $1 billion yearly for transit repairs and upgrades. Hochul’s decision, made without legislative action, drew sharp criticism. Jumaane Williams, NYC Public Advocate, warned of 'irreparable harm to the city.' Natasha Elder of NYPIRG said, 'Gov. Hochul's decision to delay congestion pricing tells subway and bus riders they don't rank.' Advocates like the Tri-State Transportation Campaign called for 'bold, strong leadership.' The cancellation leaves the city’s streets jammed and transit funding gutted, with no relief for those most at risk: people on foot, on bikes, and on buses.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Protected lanes for kids and cyclists, gone. Homeowners waved signs. Parking won. Only a short stretch gets protection. The rest: paint and sharrows. Schools left exposed. Safety traded for curbside convenience. Another promise broken. Riders pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>""I expected DOT to follow through on what they committed to... They’re falling behind on their Streets Plan [bike lane construction] targets so I would expect them to want to install every bit of protected bike lane they had already committed to."" -- Charles Fall</p><p class=mb3>On June 5, 2024, the Department of Transportation (DOT) reversed course on a two-year-old plan to build protected bike lanes in northeast Queens. The project, once set to connect schools with safe cycling routes, will now feature mostly unprotected lanes and sharrows along 46th Avenue. Only a small segment between Springfield Boulevard and Cloverdale Boulevard will have a protected lane in one direction. DOT cited the need to 'maintain current curbside activities,' meaning parking. Community Board 11 had opposed the original plan, and homeowners rallied with 'NO BIKE LANES' signs and an 800-signature petition. Advocates like Laura Shepard and Elizabeth Adams condemned the rollback, saying, 'We can't let politics get in the way of saving lives.' Ben Turner criticized the prioritization of parking over safety, noting most homes already have driveways. The changes leave children and cyclists exposed, undermining the city's own Streets Master Plan targets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets stay risky for all.</p><p class=mb3>On June 4, 2024, the City Council held an oversight hearing on commercial waste zone implementation and contractor selection. The hearing spotlighted the Commercial Waste Zones law, which aims to cut crashes by limiting private trash haulers in each zone. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, author of the 2019 reform, and Council Member Shaun Abreu led the charge, questioning why companies like Cogent Waste Solutions—with poor safety records—were awarded contracts. Reynoso declared, "Saving $20 for a business is not worth five human lives." DSNY Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the process, promising to terminate contracts after multiple at-fault fatalities. BIC Commissioner Liz Crotty admitted, "Safety is not a factor" in license denial. Lawmakers condemned the city for putting cost before safety, leaving vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city’s new waste program promises stricter oversight, but danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On June 3, 2024, the Department of Sanitation (DSNY) appointed an independent monitor for Cogent Waste Solutions, a private carting firm with a deadly safety record. The move comes before the city’s new Commercial Waste Zone program launches this fall. Council Members Shaun Abreu and Sandy Nurse raised alarms, asking, 'how the city awarded a contract to a company with a history of endangering workers to begin with.' Cogent’s trucks have killed one, injured four, and racked up hundreds of violations. Despite this, DSNY allowed Cogent to win contracts in four waste zones. DSNY Deputy Commissioner Joshua Goodman defended the process, stating, 'Safety was absolutely one of the weighted factors,' and promised, 'there will be consequences for lack of compliance.' The oversight hearing exposes a system that lets reckless firms operate, even as new rules loom.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, led by the NJ Turnpike Authority, faces criticism for ignoring alternatives like mass transit, greenways, and bikeways. The article states: 'Gov. Phil Murphy wants to spend over $10 billion to widen a highway in an environmental justice community while asking transit riders to shoulder a 15 percent fare hike. That is unjust and unacceptable.' The Turnpike Authority held limited public sessions, excluded on-the-record comments, and failed to address induced demand or environmental justice. The piece urges federal agencies to reject the project, arguing it will worsen pollution, noise, and health outcomes for vulnerable residents.

The law, passed in the state budget, excludes wide, multi-lane roads in the outer boroughs. Adams said, 'I do believe as New Yorkers we need to slow down,' but repeatedly referred to preventable crashes as 'accidents,' a term advocates reject for removing driver responsibility. The City Council must legislate any citywide speed limit change, while the Department of Transportation (DOT) can adjust limits on specific streets after community input. Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers and Speaker Adrienne Adams pledged to 'collaborate and negotiate' with City Hall. Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi stressed the need for street redesign and legal reform, noting, 'This is not a problem that goes away on its own.' Despite new authority, the Adams administration has lagged on safe street infrastructure.

The vote was 8-1. The hub replaces an empty newsstand. It offers charging, rest, and repairs. Community Board 1 objected. The project moves forward after delays and pushback.</p><p class=mb3>On April 17, 2024, the Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) approved a delivery worker e-bike hub outside City Hall by a vote of 8-1. The matter, described as a 'federally funded delivery worker charging station and rest stop,' required LPC review due to its location in a historic district. The project is backed by federal funds secured by Sen. Chuck Schumer. Commissioner Jeanne Lutfy said, 'People need to make a living, they need to make a safe living, and they need to be able to recharge batteries, they need to be able to rest.' Vice Chair Frederick Bland voiced support for the hub's function and design. Commissioner Mark Ginsberg suggested minor design changes. Manhattan Community Board 1 opposed the plan, citing sidewalk encroachment and lack of restrooms. The Parks Department will contract the Workers Justice Project to staff the hub. The project faced delays but is now set to open in late fall. No formal safety analyst assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Eleven miles of missing lanes leave cyclists exposed. Most deaths happen outside protected lanes. The city promised more, but progress stalls. Riders want safety, not scattered paint. The call: connect the gaps, save lives.</p><p class=mb3>This opinion piece, published April 15, 2024, urges the city to address gaps in Manhattan’s protected bike lane network. The article highlights that only 3 percent of streets have protected lanes, and 94 percent of cyclist deaths occur outside them. The Department of Transportation (DOT) is required to build 50 miles of protected lanes per year but has missed targets. The author writes, 'quality matters over quantity,' arguing that well-integrated lanes save more lives than disconnected stretches. The piece maps 11.7 miles of missing protected lanes below 60th Street, calling for a one-time investment to connect the Central Business District. The author urges DOT to prioritize quality infrastructure, not just numbers. No council members are named; this is a public call to action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill would create a weekly CityTicket and extend discounts for seniors and people with disabilities. The matter summary reads: 'Expand Half-Priced Fares to Unlock Commuter Rail for Working Class New Yorkers.' Samuel Santaella, an eastern Queens resident, voices strong support: 'Expanding Fair Fares to include the LIRR would revolutionize my options.' The proposal is backed by Riders Alliance and other advocates. No formal council vote has occurred. The act would cut trip times for outerborough residents and make fast, safe rail travel affordable for thousands.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Deaths outside cars now make up 36 percent of all road fatalities. Regulators tout small gains, but the bloodshed for vulnerable users deepens. Hit-and-runs surge. Systemic failure persists.</p><p class=mb3>On April 2, 2024, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration released final 2022 and preliminary 2023 traffic fatality numbers. The agency’s summary highlights a modest dip in overall deaths, but the details are stark: 'drivers had killed more cyclists (1,105) than they had in any single year in the entire history of the reporting system—and pedestrian deaths (7,522) were the highest since 1981.' Vulnerable road users now account for 36 percent of all fatalities, up from 20 percent in 1996. Hit-and-run deaths and serious injuries for pedestrians and cyclists both rose 11 percent. Tami Friedrich of the Truck Safety Coalition demanded urgent federal action, stating, 'No one else needs to die because of bureaucratic inaction.' Advocates and Vision Zero supporters call for systemic reforms—speed limiters, automatic braking, safer trucks, and better infrastructure. Until agencies act, the carnage continues, masked by official optimism.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
