Reinvent Albany called the measure 'contrary to notions of basic fairness' and a '$22 million handout' to a special interest. The Traffic Mobility Review Board had already rejected such exemptions. The group warned that multiple exemption bills could cost the public $100 million yearly and force higher tolls for everyone else. Neither Pheffer Amato nor Scarcella-Spanton commented.

The bill responds to Citi Bike fare hikes that took effect January 13, 2025, raising per-minute and pass prices for both members and non-members. The matter summary: 'New Yorkers can't afford for Citi Bike to hike prices every few months. We need to tie the cost of a CitiBike ride to the cost of a subway fare to make it more accessible and affordable to choose cycling,' said Nieve Mooney, Restler's spokesperson. Restler’s action highlights the burden on low-income riders and the need for regulation. The bill’s status is pending in committee. Mayor Adams voiced support for subsidies but offered no plan.

The author recounts merging into traffic, being closely followed by a driver, and crashing on a wet, greasy iron grid. The car sped away. Passersby helped. The cyclist suffered a broken collarbone. The essay notes, 'Our area of Brooklyn is a major hole in the borough's protected bike lane network.' Council Member Shahana Hanif attended a community meeting on the issue.

The company, which operates the bike-share system under a city contract, will raise e-bike rates from 24 to 25 cents per minute for members and from 36 to 38 cents for non-members. Non-member unlock fees rise to $4.99. Annual membership remains at $219.99. The Adams administration negotiated price caps in 2023; Lyft’s new rates stay below those limits. The matter summary notes, 'Lyft's latest increases still fall below those caps—even as they earned mild jeers from regular users.' No council members are directly involved, as this is a company action, not legislation. The fare hikes frustrate riders, but the city’s price controls and system expansion to new neighborhoods continue.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Stewart-Cousins and Carl Heastie cited a $33 billion funding gap, stating, 'The proposed program currently faces a significant funding deficit... which is a specific concern that needs to be addressed before we can approve the program.' The rejection halts contracts for new train cars and electrical upgrades. The MTA now has ten days to respond. This move follows delays from Governor Hochul’s congestion pricing pause.

Hochul said, 'We've made multiple offers to settle this lawsuit. Very generous offers.' New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy refused, risking further strain on NJ Transit, which recently raised fares 15 percent. Riders Alliance’s Betsy Plum called Murphy’s stance 'a stubbornness tax' paid by transit riders. Environmental advocates criticized Murphy for blocking improvements to public transportation.

The matter centers on the governor's decision to 'pause congestion pricing,' a move that impacts every New Yorker who walks, bikes, or rides transit. Heather Murray of Cornell Law School called the delay 'unconscionable,' saying, 'Delaying release of these records for six months is tantamount to denial of the request and violates the Freedom of Information Law.' Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance urged Hochul to 'level with New Yorkers.'
