Jeremy Cooney, new chair of the Senate Transportation Committee, issued a public demand for Governor Hochul to deliver a '100-day plan' to replace the $16.5 billion MTA funding shortfall caused by her cancellation of congestion pricing. In his op-ed, Cooney wrote, 'the time for debating the merits of congestion pricing has passed,' urging the governor to convene finance, labor, and passenger representatives to find a solution. Cooney’s push comes as the MTA faces threats to station accessibility, signal upgrades, and new trains and buses. Other Albany leaders, including Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and Senate President Andrea Stewart-Cousins, have offered little response. Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger called Hochul’s move illegal. The bill or action is not numbered, but the committee involved is the Senate Transportation Committee. No direct safety analyst note was provided, but the loss of funding jeopardizes projects vital to vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cooney warned that the pause means less expansion, less accessibility, dirtier buses, older trains, and outdated signals.

Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On July 23, 2024, advocates condemned Governor Hochul’s decision to pause congestion pricing, a move that halted funding for 23 new subway elevators. The action, detailed in 'Disabled NYer’s are Victims of Gov. Hochul’s Congestion Pricing Pause,' leaves tens of thousands without access. Michelle Alcaraz and Ray Ray, both disabled New Yorkers, are forced to travel far from home or avoid transit altogether. The MTA’s $16 billion in scheduled repairs, including crucial accessibility upgrades, is now in limbo. Joe Rappaport of the Brooklyn Center for the Independence of the Disabled called on the governor and legislature to restore funding, warning that the lack of elevators treats disabled riders as 'second-class citizens.' The pause keeps stations dangerous for parents, caregivers, and the disabled.

DOT calls the corridor a Vision Zero Priority Corridor, citing 430 injuries from 2019 to 2023, including deaths and serious harm to cyclists and pedestrians. DOT's Rosy Doud said, 'We’re really seeing a need here to make some safety improvements.' Board member Kenneth Crouch supported protected lanes, while Chair Jose Altamirano pushed to limit parking loss. Delivery worker Naquan described drivers 'always trying to run me off the road.'

The change, part of the Fiscal Year 2025 budget, was championed by Council Finance Chair Justin Brannan. The bill increases access for individuals earning up to $21,837 and families of four earning $45,240. The council added $10 million in funding, bringing the total to over $100 million annually. Brannan and economist James Parrott wrote, 'By expanding the reach of Fair Fares, we can ensure that all New Yorkers—particularly those who are already struggling during a crisis of affordability—can fully participate in the economic, social, and cultural opportunities of our city.' The expansion boosts eligibility from 932,000 to just over 1 million people.

The MTA board approved the pause, forcing a $16 billion cut in capital spending. Projects delayed include modern signals, station accessibility, new trains, and electric buses. The plan, crafted by former NYC Transit President Andy Byford, aimed to fix decades of neglect. Byford said, 'The Fast Forward plan we created in 2018 is as necessary today as it was then.' MTA board member Norman Brown lamented, 'We're turning the clock back.' The pause leaves vulnerable riders—especially low-income New Yorkers—exposed to unreliable, unsafe transit.

The project, pitched as a school safety upgrade, will replace painted bike lanes with a two-way protected lane, add sidewalk extensions, and close two slip lanes. DOT cited 110 injury crashes and one fatality in four years along the corridor. The redesign also includes concrete bus boarding islands and pedestrian improvements near schools and hospitals. DOT staffer Alex Ussery said, 'We’ve received some concerns from the community and various elected officials specifically regarding safety around students.' Community board attendees voiced anger over the loss of 28 parking spots, but some residents and advocates praised the safety upgrades, calling them 'desperately needed.' Installation will begin this summer and finish in the fall.

Riders left stranded.</p><p class=mb3>On June 24, 2024, the MTA Board heard public testimony and political debate on the fallout from Governor Hochul’s indefinite pause of congestion pricing, which was set to begin June 30. The meeting focused on the loss of funding for transit accessibility. The matter, described as 'New Yorkers decry loss of congestion pricing money for accessible transit to MTA Board,' drew sharp criticism from disability advocates and riders. State Senator Jessica Scarcella-Spanton, representing District 23, praised the Governor’s pause, calling congestion pricing 'the wrong plan for my constituents.' The pause leaves a $15 billion hole in the MTA’s capital budget, halting upgrades like elevators and ramps at dozens of stations. Advocates warned that without this funding, disabled New Yorkers, seniors, and veterans remain shut out of the subway. The MTA faces a federal mandate to make 95% of stations accessible by 2055, but these projects now stall. Riders demanded action.

Only confusion and risk.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2024, state leaders adjourned without resolving the MTA’s $1 billion funding gap. The crisis followed Governor Hochul’s abrupt halt of congestion pricing, a move that stripped the MTA of critical capital. The MTA warned, "Modernization and improvement projects like electric buses, accessible stations and new signals will likely need to be deprioritized." State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie both expressed uncertainty. The matter, titled "State of Confusion: Albany Pols Adjourn, Hochul Gets Delusional, MTA Plans Capital Cuts in Wild Final Day," leaves transit upgrades stalled. Stewart-Cousins was mentioned but took no direct action. With no new funding, the MTA’s ability to deliver safer, more reliable service for vulnerable New Yorkers is now in jeopardy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move came late. She caved to political pressure. The toll plan is paused. The city’s streets stay clogged. Vulnerable road users remain at risk. No relief. No progress.</p><p class=mb3>On June 6, 2024, Governor Kathy Hochul reversed her support for Manhattan congestion pricing, indefinitely delaying tolls below 60th Street. The plan, once set to launch June 30, was halted after pressure from U.S. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who feared electoral fallout. The matter, described as a move to 'indefinitely delay' tolls, drew criticism for its timing and impact. Hochul’s action, punctuated by a speech echoing toll critics, left the policy in limbo. Political consultants and union leaders, including @TwuSamuelsen, noted the decision failed to win votes or resolve the issue. The MTA confirmed the program’s pause in court. With no congestion pricing, New York’s streets remain dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists. The delay means no reduction in car traffic, no new funding for transit, and no safety gains for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Transit funding hangs in limbo. Liz Krueger says the tax lacks support. Riders and workers face uncertainty as lawmakers reject new burdens and demand fairer solutions.</p><p class=mb3>On June 6, 2024, State Sen. Liz Krueger (District 28) and other lawmakers responded to a proposed New York City tax hike meant to replace the indefinitely postponed $15 congestion pricing tolls. The measure, debated as Bill 28, has not advanced in committee and faces strong opposition. The matter, described as 'a last-minute funding move that drew fierce opposition,' has Krueger stating, 'I think it does not have support.' Assemblyman Brian Cunningham echoed, 'No new taxes.' The proposal would raise the payroll mobility tax, already increased last year, to fund the MTA. Rep. Jerry Nadler and business groups argue the tax unfairly targets NYC, while congestion pricing would have spread costs regionally. With the legislative session ending, MTA projects remain at risk. No safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
