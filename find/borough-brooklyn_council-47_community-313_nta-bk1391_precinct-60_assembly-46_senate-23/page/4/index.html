The matter, described as 'Body found in fifth apparent drowning off NYC beach as pols call for more lifeguard hours,' highlights the deadly gap in city safety policy. Brannan, along with Council Member Shekar Krishnan and Borough Presidents Donovan Richards and Antonio Reynoso, urged the city to extend the beach season, increase lifeguard shifts, and offer universal swimming lessons. The city has only 870 lifeguards, far short of the 1,500 needed. Vulnerable swimmers remain at risk while officials debate.

The change, part of the Fiscal Year 2025 budget, was championed by Council Finance Chair Justin Brannan. The bill increases access for individuals earning up to $21,837 and families of four earning $45,240. The council added $10 million in funding, bringing the total to over $100 million annually. Brannan and economist James Parrott wrote, 'By expanding the reach of Fair Fares, we can ensure that all New Yorkers—particularly those who are already struggling during a crisis of affordability—can fully participate in the economic, social, and cultural opportunities of our city.' The expansion boosts eligibility from 932,000 to just over 1 million people. Advocates and Speaker Adrienne Adams say it is a win, but still short of the 200% threshold they seek.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Politicians split. Riders left stranded.</p><p class=mb3>On June 24, 2024, the MTA Board heard public testimony and political debate on the fallout from Governor Hochul’s indefinite pause of congestion pricing, which was set to begin June 30. The meeting focused on the loss of funding for transit accessibility. The matter, described as 'New Yorkers decry loss of congestion pricing money for accessible transit to MTA Board,' drew sharp criticism from disability advocates and riders. State Senator Jessica Scarcella-Spanton, representing District 23, praised the Governor’s pause, calling congestion pricing 'the wrong plan for my constituents.' The pause leaves a $15 billion hole in the MTA’s capital budget, halting upgrades like elevators and ramps at dozens of stations. Advocates warned that without this funding, disabled New Yorkers, seniors, and veterans remain shut out of the subway. The MTA faces a federal mandate to make 95% of stations accessible by 2055, but these projects now stall. Riders demanded action. Politicians offered little hope.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The piece, titled 'Why expanding Fair Fares eligibility is a matter of racial equity,' highlights the push to raise eligibility from 120% to 200% of the Federal Poverty Level. Brannan, chair of the Council’s Committee on Finance, argues, 'Expanding the eligibility for the City’s Fair Fares discounted-fare program to more low-income New Yorkers can begin to address this disparity.' He points out that subway and bus riders, mostly people of color and low-income workers, get the least public subsidy. The op-ed calls for urgent investment in affordable transit, especially for outer-borough and underinvested communities. Brannan’s action centers the needs of those who rely on safe, accessible transit to move through the city.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brannan (primary sponsor, District 47) and Robert F. Holden (co-sponsor, District 30) lead the push. The bill targets drivers who cover or deface plates to evade speed, red-light, and bus-lane cameras. Data shows unreadable plates rose from 3.98% to 4.66% in one year. The city lost up to $38.7 million in unissued tickets between 2019 and 2022. The resolution calls for higher fines, confiscation of plate coverings, and registration suspensions.

Traffic study answers must come within 60 days when council members or boards ask for new signals or signs. No more endless waits. The clock starts. Streets can’t wait.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0542-2024 was introduced on March 7, 2024, and is now laid over in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill’s title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring that traffic study determinations be issued no later than 60 days from the date a traffic control device is requested by a city council member or community board.” Council Member Lincoln Restler leads as primary sponsor, joined by Brannan, Schulman, Brooks-Powers, and Vernikov. Their bill demands the Department of Transportation deliver traffic study decisions within 60 days of a request. Right now, there’s no set timeline. The bill aims to end delays, forcing the city to move faster when lives are at stake. The measure would take effect 120 days after enactment.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
