The bill seeks to exempt NYPD officers, even off-duty, from paying congestion pricing tolls in Manhattan’s central business district. Reinvent Albany called the measure 'contrary to notions of basic fairness' and a '$22 million handout' to a special interest. The Traffic Mobility Review Board had already rejected such exemptions. The group warned that multiple exemption bills could cost the public $100 million yearly and force higher tolls for everyone else. Neither Pheffer Amato nor Scarcella-Spanton commented. The watchdog urged lawmakers to serve the many, not the powerful few.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The meeting focused on the loss of funding for transit accessibility. The matter, described as 'New Yorkers decry loss of congestion pricing money for accessible transit to MTA Board,' drew sharp criticism from disability advocates and riders. State Senator Jessica Scarcella-Spanton, representing District 23, praised the Governor’s pause, calling congestion pricing 'the wrong plan for my constituents.' The pause leaves a $15 billion hole in the MTA’s capital budget, halting upgrades like elevators and ramps at dozens of stations. Advocates warned that without this funding, disabled New Yorkers, seniors, and veterans remain shut out of the subway. The MTA faces a federal mandate to make 95% of stations accessible by 2055, but these projects now stall. Riders demanded action.
