The plan includes boarding islands for safer passenger access and removes two car lanes. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, “Almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic, and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles.” The redesign aims to separate buses from car traffic, reduce conflicts, and improve safety for vulnerable road users.

The redesign replaces two car lanes with 24/7 bus-only lanes and adds pedestrian islands. DOT officials said, 'almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles.' Since 2019, 55 people have been killed or severely injured in crashes along this stretch. The plan removes curbside parking and bans cars from bus lanes, aiming to speed up twelve bus routes and protect people on foot. Most residents in the area do not own cars and depend on slow buses. The proposal reflects a shift toward prioritizing vulnerable road users and addressing systemic danger on one of Brooklyn's busiest corridors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The intersection saw 39 crashes from 2020 to 2024. The redesign includes a pedestrian plaza, narrowed roadways, and a ban on right turns onto Scott Avenue.
