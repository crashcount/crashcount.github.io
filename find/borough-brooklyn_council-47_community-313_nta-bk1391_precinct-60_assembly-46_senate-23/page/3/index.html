Council Member Sandra Ung leads as primary sponsor, joined by Bottcher, Lee, Brannan, Brewer, Vernikov, Zhuang, Gennaro, Won, Louis, Restler, and the Manhattan Borough President. The bill would raise fines for both light and heavy vehicles. It was referred to committee on the day of introduction. No vote has been held.

Introduced March 7, 2024, it seeks to ban moving billboards in New York City. The matter title reads: "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to banning moving billboards." Council Members Erik D. Bottcher (primary sponsor), Justin L. Brannan, Gale A. Brewer, and Lincoln Restler back the measure. The bill would codify an existing rule—34 RCNY 4-12(j)—that already makes these billboards illegal. By writing the ban into the administrative code, the council aims to close loopholes and strengthen enforcement. No safety analyst note was provided, but the bill targets a known hazard: mobile ads that pull attention from the street and put vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The flyers list eligibility, discounts, and how to apply. The law aims to inform, not punish. It is now in effect.</p><p class=mb3>Int 1011-2023, now enacted as Local Law 30 of 2024, moved through the Committee on Public Safety and passed the City Council on January 20, 2024. The bill requires police officers patrolling subway stations to carry and distribute flyers about city-run reduced fare programs to anyone arrested or summoned for fare evasion. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to providing information on the reduced fare programs to persons issued a summons for fare evasion.' Council Member Farah N. Louis sponsored the bill, joined by Brooks-Powers, Brewer, Dinowitz, Barron, Krishnan, and others. The flyers must explain eligibility, discount details, and application steps. The law took effect 120 days after passage. No direct safety impact for vulnerable road users was noted.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
