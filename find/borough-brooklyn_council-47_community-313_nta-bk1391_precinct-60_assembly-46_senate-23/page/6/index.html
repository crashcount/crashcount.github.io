The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, focused on 'street safety and transit in a lightning round.' Brannan, a Democrat, voiced strong support for expanding bus lanes and protected bike lanes, stating, 'Yes, I'm a big bus lane guy,' and preferring protected lanes over painted ones. Kagan, who switched parties, opposed congestion pricing and any increase in bus or bike lanes, saying, 'Not more. What they have right now is enough.' Both supported some public transit improvements, but split on how to get there. No formal bill was at stake, but their stances set the tone for the district’s future.

Brewer emphasized, 'I don't hear people calling me up, saying, I need a charging station for my electric car.' Advocates Jackson Chabot and Samir Lavingia argued that curbside EV chargers for cars would 'lock in' car use and block future bike lanes or outdoor dining. Eric McClure of StreetsPAC warned against re-privatizing the curb for car owners. Both Chabot and Lavingia backed Council Member Justin Brannan's bill to require EV-ready parking in garages. Despite city plans, no e-bike charging stations have been installed yet.

The matter, described as a debate on public funding for bike-share expansion, highlights the city’s outlier status among major bike-share cities. Council Member Erik Bottcher and others voiced concerns over poor service and limited reach. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives called for city funding to expand access and lower prices. Justin Brannan criticized the system’s neglect of outer boroughs. Mayor Adams’s 2021 pledge to fund expansion remains unfulfilled. Advocates and labor leaders say public funding is vital for equity, affordability, and reliability.

The matter, titled "Citigroup Renews NYC Bike-Share Sponsorship — Is It Time For Public Funding?", highlighted the gap in service for low-income and outer-borough neighborhoods. Council Member Justin Brannan (District 47) criticized Citi Bike’s limited reach, saying, "Ya gotta love @CitiBikeNYC systematically icing out the 'outer' borough transit deserts." Advocates and labor leaders echoed calls for public funding, arguing the for-profit model fails vulnerable New Yorkers. Mayor Adams’s campaign promise to expand Citi Bike with city funding remains unfulfilled. The debate underscores a systemic failure: without public investment, bike-share stays out of reach for those who need it most. No formal safety analysis was provided, but advocates stress that lack of access keeps vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city’s promise of better service clashes with real, lived needs.</p><p class=mb3>On April 4, 2023, Council Member Phara Souffrant Forrest and other Brooklyn officials voiced strong opposition to the MTA’s Brooklyn bus network redesign. The draft plan, released in December, proposes increased spacing between stops, route changes, and new 'Rush' service. Key changes include the elimination and rerouting of the B48, which officials say 'removes a vital connection between Western Crown Heights and Greenpoint without any adequate transit replacement.' Forrest and others argue these cuts threaten accessibility for seniors and people with disabilities. Community members warn that longer distances between stops will hit the most vulnerable hardest. The MTA claims the redesign will bring 'more reliable, frequent service with better connections,' but public feedback shows deep concern. The plan remains under review, with workshops ongoing and legal hurdles for new bus lanes due to budget and staffing woes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, expected before lawmakers next month, keeps sidewalk dining year-round but limits curbside 'streeteries' to warmer months.

The bill responds to complaints about noise, rats, and lost parking, but also credits the program with saving 100,000 jobs.
