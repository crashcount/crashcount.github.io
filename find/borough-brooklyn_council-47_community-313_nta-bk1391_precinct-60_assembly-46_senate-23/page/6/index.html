Other plaintiffs include State Senators James Skoufis, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton, Iwen Chu, Monica Martinez, and Assemblymembers Aileen Gunther, Jamie Williams, and David Weprin.

You have people with disabilities, you have people who just cannot tolerate the elimination of one stop." -- Alec Brook-Krasny</p><p class=mb3>On April 4, 2023, Council Member Phara Souffrant Forrest and other Brooklyn officials voiced strong opposition to the MTA’s Brooklyn bus network redesign. The draft plan, released in December, proposes increased spacing between stops, route changes, and new 'Rush' service. Key changes include the elimination and rerouting of the B48, which officials say 'removes a vital connection between Western Crown Heights and Greenpoint without any adequate transit replacement.' Forrest and others argue these cuts threaten accessibility for seniors and people with disabilities. Community members warn that longer distances between stops will hit the most vulnerable hardest. The MTA claims the redesign will bring 'more reliable, frequent service with better connections,' but public feedback shows deep concern. The plan remains under review, with workshops ongoing and legal hurdles for new bus lanes due to budget and staffing woes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, not tied to a specific council bill, recognized police who 'evacuated and sheltered school children' as a driver struck eight pedestrians and killed one. Gounardes said, 'These students, their families and our entire community here in southern Brooklyn will be forever grateful.' Brannan called the response 'a shining example' of local policing. The commendation took place at Bay Ridge Preparatory School. The incident sparked calls for 'enhanced measures against traffic violence' and more mental health resources at a vigil for the victims.
