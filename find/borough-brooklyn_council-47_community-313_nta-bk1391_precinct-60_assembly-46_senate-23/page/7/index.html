It was introduced on December 21, 2022, and filed at session’s end on December 31, 2023. The bill’s title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to illegal curb cuts and requiring local community board notification of curb cut applications.” Council Members Crystal Hudson (primary), Joseph C. Borelli, Justin L. Brannan, Robert F. Holden, and Kalman Yeger sponsored. The bill required DOT to investigate illegal curb cut complaints within 30 days, mark illegal cuts with green paint, and force owners to restore or legalize them. If owners failed, DOT would repair and recover costs. Community boards would get notice of new curb cut permits and sixty days to comment. The bill did not pass.

The event draws hundreds of thousands. The NYPD deploys extra traffic enforcement and directs buses to designated drop-off zones, aiming to keep large vehicles off pedestrian-packed streets. Brannan, quoted as saying his goal is to keep visitors safe and streets clean, led a 2019 law banning street vendors to reduce bottlenecks. The matter summary notes: 'Homeowners in Dyker Heights are gearing up for the annual Dyker Lights holiday display.' Residents voice concern over congestion and emergency access. Community leaders and police stress the need to balance festive crowds with safety for all. The city’s plan targets traffic and pedestrian risk, but the threat to vulnerable road users remains high amid the surge of cars and foot traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors including Rivera, Hudson, and others. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor on October 27, 2022. The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law.

He added, 'Frank’s tragic death served as a wakeup call for pedestrian safety in the neighborhood.' Decolvenaere’s son Michael said, 'It’s the best way to honor him in this community and also bring awareness to the reality of the situation.'

The car had received at least 12 school-zone speeding tickets since June 21, but authorities failed to intervene until this incident. Council Member Justin Brannan reported the arrest, saying, "It seems the various systems currently in place to deter this type of behavior have failed here." Brannan and Queens DA Melinda Katz both criticized the current penalties, calling them too weak to deter dangerous drivers. Katz said, "There is a strong need for tougher penalties for those who choose to use our city streets as raceways." The article notes that only after 15 camera-issued speeding tickets in a year must drivers take a safety course, and few cars are seized under the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program. Community complaints led to the arrest, but most reckless drivers still evade real consequences.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The resolution, introduced April 14, 2022, and filed at session's end on December 31, 2023, urges the MTA to 'adjust schedules for distant subway terminal lines to include more peak-direction rush hour trains for commuters to travel to central economic hubs.' Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by Brooks-Powers, Hanif, Bottcher, and others. The bill responds to service gaps hitting outer boroughs, end-of-line stations, and transit deserts—areas where 600,000 New Yorkers live with poor transit access. The council points to pandemic-era staffing shortages and train cancellations that left riders stranded. The measure aims to push the MTA to close these gaps and connect more New Yorkers to jobs and opportunity.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary states, 'requiring the placement of temporary priority regulatory signs at intersections within one hour of a report of an inoperable traffic control signal.' Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary), Julie Won, Kalman Yeger, and Justin L. Brannan sponsored the bill. The session ended with the bill filed, not enacted. Analysts noted that faster signage could 'significantly reduce the risk of pedestrian injury and vehicular collisions at intersections with malfunctioning traffic control signals.'

Holden, Kalman Yeger (primary), and Justin L. Brannan. The bill cites data showing out-of-state cars are involved in a growing share of city crashes, including 11,000 injuries and 62 deaths in 2021 alone. The council urges Albany to act, targeting drivers who dodge taxes, fees, and insurance by registering elsewhere.
