The bill’s title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring that traffic study determinations be issued no later than 60 days from the date a traffic control device is requested by a city council member or community board.” Council Member Lincoln Restler leads as primary sponsor, joined by Brannan, Schulman, Brooks-Powers, and Vernikov. Their bill demands the Department of Transportation deliver traffic study decisions within 60 days of a request. Right now, there’s no set timeline. The bill aims to end delays, forcing the city to move faster when lives are at stake. The measure would take effect 120 days after enactment.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The resolution, introduced March 7, 2024, calls for 'the registration of bicycles with electric assist used for commercial purposes and creates liability for employers for certain violations.' Council Member James F. Gennaro leads as primary sponsor, joined by Gale A. Brewer, Christopher Marte, Alexa Avilés, Farah N. Louis, and Justin L. Brannan. The bill would require commercial e-bikes to be registered and display visible license information. Employers, not delivery workers, would be fined for violations like sidewalk riding. The council frames this as a way to identify dangerous vehicles and hold companies accountable, aiming to reduce injuries and deaths among pedestrians and cyclists. The measure remains under committee review.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

City records show speed camera tickets do not count against a driver’s record, so licenses are not suspended or revoked. All tickets were paid, preventing booting or towing. The city’s enforcement system left a dangerous driver on the road.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'Bay Ridge pols call for help with traffic build-up caused by Verrazzano Bridge closures,' highlights gridlock and reckless driving on residential streets. Brannan, joined by State Senator Andrew Gounardes, pressed the MTA and DOT for early closure notifications and more traffic control. Brannan warned, 'Frustrated drivers... driving up on the sidewalk... affects not just the average driver or pedestrian but... first responders.' Gounardes added, 'Buses literally could not go anywhere.' Local leaders echoed the need for action. The MTA claimed safety as the reason for closures but shifted responsibility for street management to the DOT. No formal safety analyst assessment was provided, but the call centers the danger to pedestrians, transit riders, and emergency crews.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Reports must include the reason for the stop, the level of offense, and demographic details, but no personal identifiers. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, Lincoln Restler (primary sponsor), Amanda Farías, and others led the charge. The law aims to expose patterns in police stops and holds officers to account. Reports go online, open to all. This is a step toward transparency, not just for drivers, but for every New Yorker who walks, rides, or waits at the curb.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, focused on 'street safety and transit in a lightning round.' Brannan, a Democrat, voiced strong support for expanding bus lanes and protected bike lanes, stating, 'Yes, I'm a big bus lane guy,' and preferring protected lanes over painted ones. Kagan, who switched parties, opposed congestion pricing and any increase in bus or bike lanes, saying, 'Not more. What they have right now is enough.' Both supported some public transit improvements, but split on how to get there. No formal bill was at stake, but their stances set the tone for the district’s future. Vulnerable road users face starkly different prospects depending on who wins.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
