Six more suffered injuries so grave they were marked as serious. <strong>768 people have been hurt</strong>—bodies broken, lives changed. The dead do not speak. The wounded carry the story in scars and limps. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><h3 id=the-pattern-of-harm>The Pattern of Harm</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians, cyclists, and riders of small vehicles pay the highest price.</strong> Trucks and SUVs strike hardest. In one crash, a 75-year-old woman was killed crossing with the signal, hit by a turning pickup truck. A cyclist crushed by a box truck. A moped rider thrown and left bleeding. The pattern repeats. The names change. The pain does not.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-silence>Leadership: Progress and Silence</h3><p><strong>City leaders have the power to act.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law, giving New York City the right to lower speed limits. The city can set 20 mph limits on local streets. But in Maspeth, the pace of change is slow. No record of bold action from local officials. No public push for safer crossings or protected bike lanes. <strong>The silence is its own answer.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day without action is a day closer to the next siren, the next family shattered. The tools exist: lower speed limits, redesign dangerous intersections, enforce the laws that save lives. <strong>But tools unused are as useless as promises unkept.</strong></p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand safer streets. Do not wait for another obituary.</strong> <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The event, covered by AMNY, saw new routes and stops, including changes to the Q12 and Q13. Assembly Member Claire Valdez praised the redesign, calling buses a 'critical lifeline.' Transit advocates split: Riders Alliance applauded the move, while Passengers United warned of harm to vulnerable riders. A safety analyst noted, 'Bus network redesigns that improve transit access can encourage mode shift away from private vehicles, reducing traffic volumes and crash risk for pedestrians and cyclists while supporting street equity.' The redesign aims to shift trips from cars to buses, making streets less deadly for those outside vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Seventeen council members, led by Robert Holden (bill sponsor) and Erik Bottcher (district includes stables), support the ban. Speaker Adrienne Adams has blocked a hearing and vote.

Safety for vulnerable users finally comes to the bridge.</p><p class=mb3>On May 13, 2025, New York City completed a long-stalled plan to separate cyclists and pedestrians on the Queensboro Bridge. The project, first announced under former Mayor Bill de Blasio, faced delays after Mayor Eric Adams took office. The north outer roadway is now for cyclists, the south for pedestrians. State Senate Deputy Majority Leader Michael Gianaris, District 12, praised the completion, saying, 'After years of advocacy, many of us were excited to see [the city's Department of Transportation] complete the work to open new, dedicated pedestrian paths on the Queensboro Bridge.' Gianaris also criticized the unexplained delays. The plan ends years of conflict and danger for vulnerable road users forced to share a narrow lane.

The street remembers the impact.</p><p class=mb3>ABC7 reported on May 2, 2025, that Michael Peña, a former FDNY probationary firefighter, was released on $75,000 bail after a deadly Queens crash. Police allege Peña was 'drunk and high on cocaine and marijuana' and speeding at 83 mph when he 'ran a red light and T-boned a car driven by 24-year-old Justin Diaz.' The crash happened at Northern Boulevard and East 107th Street as Diaz drove to work. Prosecutors cited Peña’s firing from the FDNY and prior legal issues to argue for remand, but the appellate court released him with minimal bail conditions. Peña faces manslaughter and other charges, with a possible 15-year sentence if convicted. The case highlights the lethal risk of impaired, reckless driving and the limits of pretrial detention policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>Int 1252-2025, introduced April 24, 2025, sits with the Committee on Public Safety. The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to police department parking enforcement," demands the NYPD confirm license plates and VINs on vehicles with temporary tags or those ticketed for violations. The NYPD must also release quarterly reports on parking enforcement. Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary), Oswald Feliz, Lincoln Restler, Robert F. Holden, and Chris Banks sponsor the measure. On April 28, 2025, the committee laid the bill over. The bill aims to expose enforcement gaps and bring accountability, but for now, the city’s most vulnerable—pedestrians and cyclists—see no immediate relief. The system stalls.
