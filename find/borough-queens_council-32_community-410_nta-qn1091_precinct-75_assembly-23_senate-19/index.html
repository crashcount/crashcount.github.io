The Senate passed the measure 38-21; three city senators—Stephen Chan, Andrew Lanza, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton—voted no. The Assembly passed it 110-31, with nine city lawmakers—Alec Brook-Krasny, Lester Chang, Simcha Eichenstein, Michael Novakhov, Stacey Pheffer Amato, Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Reilly, David Weprin, Kalman Yeger—opposing. The Streetsblog NYC article, 'Ye Shall Know Their Names! Meet the Dirty Dozen City Pols Who Voted Against Speed Camera Program,' quotes lawmakers dismissing speed cameras as revenue grabs or burdens. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action, so no direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists can be assessed.'

She flew like 30 feet. It was a lot of force." The article highlights concerns about NYPD's pursuit tactics, quoting the victim's father: "It was probably not the place to be doing a high-speed chase, in the residential neighborhood."

After a crash on the Van Wyck Expressway, Augustin assaulted Jasmer Singh, using slurs and violence. Prosecutors said Augustin yelled, 'No police, no police,' and called Singh 'turban man' before punching him. Singh died from the assault. Police were initially slow to pursue hate crime charges, but a grand jury and community pressure led to a harsher indictment. Augustin pleaded guilty to second-degree assault as a hate crime, avoiding a possible manslaughter conviction.

Ten years of pressure forced change. The fleet stands as the most accessible in the nation. Policy, not luck, drove this. Disabled riders gain ground. Streets shift. Access grows.</p><p class=mb3>amNY reported on June 5, 2025, that New York City’s Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) reached a milestone: 50% of active taxis are now wheelchair accessible. TLC Commissioner David Do said, “We made that today. It is the most accessible fleet in the entire country.” This achievement follows a decade-long push by disability advocates and a 2013 settlement requiring half the medallion fleet to be accessible. The transition faced delays, including the COVID-19 pandemic and medallion owner financial struggles. Policy changes, such as alternating accessible vehicles and funding support, drove the shift. The article highlights systemic progress, not individual driver actions, and underscores the impact of sustained advocacy and regulatory pressure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, discussed at a community board meeting, would have barred cyclists from Beach 108th to Beach 73rd Street during summer months. Council Member Joann Ariola, representing District 32, expressed relief at the reversal, stating, 'I’m glad that the Parks Department is going to continue allowing Rockaway residents to enjoy their bikes on the boardwalk this summer, but now we need real enforcement.' Instead of a ban, the Parks Department will increase signage and enforcement, especially near concessions. The community board voted 30-1 for new signs and called for marked bike lanes, an 8 mph speed limit, and clearer right-of-way rules.
