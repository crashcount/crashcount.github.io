The bill’s title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code... requiring the department of transportation to consult with the fire department prior to approving open street applications and certain bicycle lane projects and to notify affected firehouses...” It requires DOT to consult FDNY and notify firehouses before approving open streets, bike lanes, or major transportation projects that remove car or parking lanes. DOT must certify this consultation. The bill does not apply to emergency projects.

Simcha Felder, Democrat from District 44, voted against. The expansion targets off-hours, which account for 59% of traffic deaths. Speeding dropped 72% and deaths fell 55% where cameras operated.

Riders dodge chaos.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0045-2022 was introduced on February 24, 2022, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill, sponsored by David M. Carr (primary), with Farah N. Louis and Joseph C. Borelli as co-sponsors, sought to require the Department of Transportation to group new active transportation docking stations—bike, scooter, and e-mobility docks—within one city block of each other, unless contracts prevented it. The official summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring centralized siting of active transportation docking stations.' The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not advance. Without passage, the city’s docking stations remain scattered, leaving vulnerable road users to navigate a patchwork of locations and unpredictable street conditions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill aimed to establish an inter-borough advisory commission to recommend locations for active transportation parking hubs—secure spots for bikes, scooters, and similar devices. The measure’s title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to establishing an inter-borough planning and advisory commission for the siting of active transportation parking hubs in the city.' Council Members David M. Carr (primary sponsor), Robert F. Holden, and Joseph C. Borelli backed the bill. The commission would have included 12 members, met quarterly, and submitted recommendations within 18 months. The bill was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023, and did not advance. No safety analyst assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
