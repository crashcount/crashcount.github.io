Safety hangs in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On June 16, 2022, the NYC Department of Transportation proposed a 'road diet' for Hylan Boulevard in Staten Island. The plan would cut the road from four lanes to one in each direction, add a turning bay, and paint bike lanes. The DOT cites high injury and fatality rates, especially among cyclists, as the reason for action, referencing success from similar projects. Council Member Joe Borelli opposes the plan, saying, 'Thousands who use this road each day will be inconvenienced...all for the benefit of 251 aspiring Greg LeMonds who cycle this stretch on the weekends.' Borelli calls the plan unoriginal and unnecessary. DOT spokesman Vin Barone defends the proposal, pointing to injury data and safety gains. The plan remains a proposal as DOT reviews community feedback.

The measure passed 51-12 and now moves to the Assembly. The bill allows cameras to operate 24/7 in nearly 2,000 locations across 750 school zones until July 1, 2025. The matter summary states, 'The proposal to extend New York City's speed camera program for another three years and expand it to run every day and around the clock easily passed.' Senator Andrew Gounardes sponsored the bill, saying, 'We are going to see a marked reduction in traffic violence on our streets at a time when traffic deaths are at their highest in a decade.' Simcha Felder, Democrat from District 44, voted against. The expansion targets off-hours, which account for 59% of traffic deaths. Speeding dropped 72% and deaths fell 55% where cameras operated. The city pushed for this as fatalities rose under Mayor Adams. Some penalties for repeat speeders were removed during negotiations.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
