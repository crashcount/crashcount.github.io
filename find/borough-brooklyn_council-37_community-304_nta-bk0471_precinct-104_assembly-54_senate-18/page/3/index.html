The Chamber of Progress, representing Instacart and others, testified against the bills. The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) and advocacy groups testified in favor, with Commissioner Vilda Vera Mayuga stating, 'This package of bills would close that gap.'

According to police, Simpson "swiped an oncoming car" near Gates Avenue and Marcus Garvey Boulevard, then "drove away, dragging the person several feet and hitting another car with a pregnant woman inside." She struck a third, empty car before being arrested by city sheriffs. No one was seriously injured, though the pregnant woman was taken to a hospital for evaluation. Simpson faces charges of reckless endangerment, assault, and leaving the scene. The incident highlights risks from hit-and-run crashes and the need for stronger enforcement around dangerous driving.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, now before the Council, mandates at least 25 percent of stations be placed in the roadway and requires DOT to report on usage and maintenance after three years. The matter title calls for 'expanding e-bike charging and battery safety infrastructure.' Rivera said, 'We certainly want to expand the conversation around e-bike charging and battery safety as much as possible.' Industry voices, like Baruch Herzfeld of Pop Wheels, argue the plan is too small to meet demand or curb deadly indoor charging fires. Ligia Guallpa of the Worker’s Justice Project warns that infrastructure has not kept pace with e-micromobility growth, increasing risks for riders and workers.

Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, mentioned in the debate, said, 'Our conference is reticent to commit a billion dollars annually for the next 15 years without having some understanding in place as to how we're going to deal with congestion as well.' Lawmakers could not agree on new taxes or a legislative IOU. The inaction leaves critical MTA projects—like electric buses and accessible stations—at risk.
