Since 2022, three people have died and 860 have been injured in crashes. Thirteen of those injuries were serious. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old. Forty-nine children have been hurt. Some never made it to school. Some never made it home.</p><p>Last month, a cyclist was left with a bleeding head after a car struck him on Kent Avenue. Days before, two teenagers on bikes were cut down by a sedan on Driggs Avenue. The crash report lists the cause: &ldquo;Driver Inattention/Distraction. Unsafe Speed.&rdquo; No one writes what the parents saw. No one lists the sound the bike made when it hit the ground.</p><h3 id=the-voices-that-remain>The Voices That Remain</h3><p>The pain does not fade. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating. It&rsquo;s affecting everyone in our family, especially (Ruiz&rsquo;s) mom.

The words are plain. The loss is not.</p><p>A relative tried to explain the unexplainable: &ldquo;It was just a freak accident. Nothing intentional. I know that he loved her. He loved her dearly. He&rsquo;d do anything for her, and she would do the same for him.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>The quote stands alone</a>.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The numbers climb. Local leaders have not stood still. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher has <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/stop-super-speeders-bill-advances-in-senate-committee>sponsored bills to curb repeat speeding and mandate speed limiters</a> for the worst offenders. She has voted to <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/13/can-new-york-city-fix-its-deadly-conduit-to-jfk-airport>extend school speed zones</a> and spoken out for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/06/15/greenpoint-lawmaker-opposition-to-mcguinness-redesign-is-about-fear-bad-faith-and-control>safer street redesigns</a>. State Senator Kristen Gonzalez has <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/20/dot-stands-by-astoria-bike-lane-plan-despite-foes-childish-outbursts>co-sponsored bills for speed limiters and automated bike lane enforcement</a>. These are steps, not finish lines.</p><p>But the street is still hungry. Most injuries come from cars and SUVs. Speed and distraction are not rare. They are the rule. The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has not used it everywhere it can. Every day of delay is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat speeders. The street will not wait. Neither should you.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

According to the police report, contributing factors were “Driver Inattention/Distraction” and “Following Too Closely.” These driver errors led to the crash and the teen’s injuries. The bike’s rider was unlicensed, as listed, but he was the victim. The car sustained no reported damage. Both vehicles were traveling north and going straight ahead when they collided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
