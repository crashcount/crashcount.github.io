Six seriously hurt.</strong> In Gravesend (West), the numbers do not tell the whole story, but they do not lie. Since 2022, cars and trucks have killed four people and left six with wounds that will not heal. Two of the dead were older New Yorkers, crossing with the light, doing nothing wrong. One was a 95-year-old woman, struck by a left-turning van as she walked with her aide. Her family remembered her as &ldquo;a very active lady&rdquo; and said, &ldquo;Everybody knows her&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/woman-who-survived-nazis-chernobyl-covid-killed-while-crossing-brooklyn-street-police-say>said her daughter</a>. The NYPD did not charge the driver. The street stayed the same.</p><p>A mother and her two daughters died on a sidewalk. The driver had a suspended license, over 90 violations, and a taste for speed. She bragged about it. &ldquo;She always talked about driving fast,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/03/31/us-news/miriam-yarimi-accused-of-killing-nyc-mom-2-kids-allegedly-bragged-about-speeding/>an acquaintance told the press</a>. The city let her keep driving. The law let her keep killing.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-behind-the-names>The Numbers Behind the Names</h3><p><strong>680 injured. 1,172 crashes.</strong> In three years, the streets of Gravesend (West) have become a gauntlet. Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians pay the price. Cars and trucks do most of the harm: all four deaths, all but one serious injury. Bikes and motorcycles are not the killers here. The danger comes in steel and glass, moving fast, turning left, not stopping.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-what-they-havent>What Leaders Have Done—and What They Haven&rsquo;t</h3><p>The city passed new laws. Speed cameras now run all day. The council can lower speed limits. But in Gravesend (West), the blood keeps flowing. Drivers with long records stay on the road. Police let killers walk. No statement from the council. No call from the board. No change at the corner where the old woman died.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-action-now><strong>Call to Action: Demand Action Now</strong></h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement. Demand streets where children and elders do not die for crossing with the light. Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Seddio claims the lane will only shift location and disputes the safety benefits, arguing, 'The bike lane will still exist, but merely shift to an alternative location in the road.' He also questions crash data, citing seasonal differences: 'The change in accident and injury rates is better explained by seasonal weather patterns.' Streetsblog notes that after the redesign, crashes dropped by 18–19% and injuries by 25–26%. The case highlights ongoing tension between local political power, city notification procedures, and efforts to protect cyclists and pedestrians through street design.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, both 'Driver Inexperience' and 'Unsafe Speed' contributed to the crash. The moped's center front end took the impact. Neither boy used safety equipment. The report lists no other vehicles or road users involved. Systemic dangers remain for young riders on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Plaintiffs argue the city violated Administrative Code Section 19-101.2, which requires advance notice and community input before removing bike lanes. The Department of Transportation skipped this step, announcing the removal on social media after consulting only select community members. The article quotes the lawsuit: the city acted "improperly, irrationally, without proper legal notice and in an abuse of discretion." Data cited in the suit show the upgraded lane improved safety for all road users. Councilman Lincoln Restler supported the legal action, seeking a restraining order to keep the lane. The case highlights failures in city process and the risks posed when safe infrastructure is abruptly erased.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'before this bike lane from 2018 to 2022 this is the area that had the second largest numbers of pedestrian fatalities and crashes in the city.' The lane faced opposition from some Hasidic leaders, citing children running into the lane from illegally parked cars and buses. Despite tweaks—school bus zones, daylighted corners, no standing areas—drivers kept parking illegally, blocking sightlines and endangering children. The city rarely removes protected lanes, but Adams acted after political pressure. Moving the lane to Classon Avenue, as some demand, would force cyclists onto a chaotic BQE ramp. The decision highlights persistent driver violations and policy gaps that leave vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger, mandates up to $50,000 per person for basic economic loss, regardless of citizenship or employment status. Assembly Member Robert Carroll authored the original Assembly version, stating, 'It is time we require delivery apps to take responsibility for keeping delivery workers and pedestrians safe.' Sen. Andrew Gounardes defended a related speed-limiting bill, but it was weakened. Safety analysts warn: 'Focusing on insurance rather than speed limits shifts responsibility away from prevention and system design, failing to reduce crash risk and potentially discouraging mode shift by not addressing the root causes of danger for pedestrians and cyclists.'

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' Nearly half of city traffic deaths happen at intersections, often due to blocked sightlines and turning vehicles.

The plan includes concrete bus boarding islands and may reduce car lanes, giving more space to pedestrians and buses. However, the article notes gaps: 'DOT didn't share a block-by-block breakdown,' and curbside parking may remain, risking bus lane obstruction by double-parked vehicles. The city may physically protect the lane, but details are pending. The B41 bus, serving 28,000 daily trips, crawls at 4 mph during rush hour.
