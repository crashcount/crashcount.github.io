The action, coordinated with Council Member Lincoln Restler, followed community complaints. Officers issued 40 summonses and towed 10 vehicles. The NYPD stated, "Following community complaints about illegal parking... the NYPD Transportation Bureau and Council Member Lincoln Restler coordinated... to address the parking condition and clear the area." Council Members Restler and Crystal Hudson represent the district but did not claim credit. The crackdown targets city employees who abused parking privileges for years. Safety analysts note: "Cracking down on placard abuse reduces illegal parking, especially in bike lanes, crosswalks, and sidewalks, improving safety and accessibility for pedestrians and cyclists by reclaiming public space and reducing driver entitlement."</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city cannot touch the lane until August. Cyclists and pedestrians keep their lifeline. The fight for safe streets holds, for now.</p><p class=mb3>On June 18, 2025, Judge Carolyn Walker-Dialo issued a judicial order halting the removal of the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane. The case, reported by Kirstyn Brendlen in Brooklyn Paper, centers on the city's attempt to replace the parking-protected lane with an unprotected painted lane. The matter states: 'The city is enjoined and restrained from implementing and commencing/performing any construction or other acts related to the Removal at least until a hearing scheduled for August.' Council Member Lincoln Restler said he was not notified of the plans. Transportation Alternatives and Baruch Herzfeld filed the lawsuit, arguing the city failed to analyze the effects or consult the community. Transportation Alternatives called the city's plan illegal and praised the court's decision. Preventing the removal preserves safe infrastructure for cyclists and encourages active transportation, supporting mode shift and safety in numbers for vulnerable road users. The next hearing is set for August.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

This action followed a lawsuit by cycling advocates and residents, as reported by BKReader. The matter states: 'A judge issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) blocking New York City from removing portions of a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue.' Council Member Lincoln Restler supported the TRO, submitting an affidavit and stressing the legal requirement for community notification. Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives called the removal 'unwarranted, unlawful, reckless.' Safety analysts warn that removing the bike lane strips away vital protection, discourages cycling, and exposes both cyclists and pedestrians to more danger from cars. The TRO stands until a court hearing later this summer, keeping the safety improvements in place for now.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The case, covered by Streetsblog NYC, cites City Administrative Code Section 19-101.2, which requires proper notice before removing a bike lane. The matter summary states, "Plaintiffs, including Transportation Alternatives and Williamsburg resident Baruch Herzfeld, seek a temporary restraining order, claiming that cyclists would be irreparably harmed by the loss of a safe route." Council Member Lincoln Restler, author of the notification law, filed an affidavit supporting the plaintiffs. The Department of Transportation claims the lane will shift, not disappear. The safety analyst notes: "The event text describes a legal threat but does not specify any policy or legislative action, so its direct impact on pedestrian and cyclist safety cannot be determined." The case is pending a judicial ruling.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move followed requests from Williamsburg residents and came after a recent town hall. The mayor’s statement read: 'he is taking away the bike lane on Bedford Avenue... to better reflect community feedback.' Council Member Lincoln Restler condemned the decision, calling it 'purely a political decision' and warning it would 'lead to more tragic crashes.' No council bill number or committee was involved; Adams acted alone. Removing the protected bike lane reduces safety for cyclists, discourages cycling, and undermines street equity. Vulnerable road users now face greater danger on this busy corridor.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Members Lincoln Restler and Chi Ossé condemned the move, calling it reckless and political. Brad Lander and Zohran Mamdani joined in opposition.

Council Member Lincoln Restler condemned the move, calling it 'a purely political decision to rip out a bike lane with no alternative.' Transportation Alternatives noted pedestrian injuries fell 10% and driver injuries 42% after the lane was installed. The safety analyst warns: 'Removing a parking-protected bike lane and replacing it with a painted lane reduces physical protection for cyclists, likely decreasing safety and discouraging cycling, especially on a hazardous stretch.'

They slam the seasonal ban as a blow to street life. Lawmakers blame high fees and red tape for empty curb lanes. The fight pits parking against people. The debate rages on.</p><p class=mb3>On April 23, 2025, the City Council debated a new bill to bring back year-round roadway dining. The measure, still in committee, follows the 2023 law that limited outdoor dining to April through November. Council Member Lincoln Restler (D-Brooklyn) leads the charge, calling the current law a 'failure' that 'prioritized parking spots over vibrant streets.' Restler, who voted against the seasonal restriction, now seeks broader support. Council Member Chi Ossé (D-Bedford-Stuyvesant) and Carlina Rivera (Lower East Side) also back the change, though both previously supported the seasonal law to keep some form of the program alive. Committee chair Selvena Brooks-Powers (D-Queens) is open to the idea, while Council Member Julie Menin (D-Upper East Side) criticizes DOT's management, urging a shift to the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection. Lawmakers and advocates agree: high costs, bureaucracy, and seasonality block participation and hurt street life. The bill's fate remains undecided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council members press for daylighting to save lives. DOT claims high costs and flawed data. Advocates cite proven safety gains. The battle pits parking against pedestrian survival.</p><p class=mb3>On April 22, 2025, the City Council held a hearing on a bill to ban parking within 20 feet of intersections—known as daylighting. The bill, sponsored by Council Member Julie Won and backed by 25 sponsors, aims to improve visibility and protect pedestrians. DOT officials opposed the measure, citing a study that warns of increased injuries without costly infrastructure, estimating a $3 billion price tag. Won called the study 'deeply flawed.' Council Member Lincoln Restler blasted DOT for ignoring dangerous corners in his district. Chris Banks opposed the bill over parking concerns. Advocates and Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla countered, pointing to cheap, effective daylighting elsewhere. The debate exposes a stark choice: keep parking or save lives at the curb.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT delays a promised bike lane. Elected officials and residents demand action. Private interests block progress. Cyclists face crashes and fear. The city shrugs. The gap remains. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On April 3, 2025, a coalition of Brooklyn officials—including Council Members Crystal Hudson, Shahana Hanif, Lincoln Restler, Assembly Members Andrew Gounardes, Jo Anne Simon, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, and Borough President Antonio Reynoso—sent a letter urging DOT to finish the protected bike lane on Ashland Place. The letter called the block a 'missing link in Brooklyn’s protected bike lane network.' Brooklyn Community Board 2 backed the demand. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and Borough Commissioner Keith Bray offered only vague replies. The block’s exclusion traces to a mayoral advisor’s intervention for developer Two Trees. Advocates like Kathy Park Price slammed the city: 'Private interests are able to redesign our streets, prioritizing vehicles over safety at a critical corridor.' Despite unanimous support, DOT keeps the street dangerous. The city’s inaction leaves cyclists exposed and the community frustrated.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
