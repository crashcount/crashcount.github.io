Eighteen seriously hurt.</strong> In the past twelve months, 417 crashes tore through the streets of Upper East Side-Lenox Hill-Roosevelt Island. Two of the dead were over 75. One was a woman crossing York Avenue at dusk, struck first by a yellow cab making a U-turn, then by an SUV. She died at the hospital. Both drivers stayed. No charges were filed. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/02/06/us-news/woman-90-fatally-struck-by-2-cars-including-yellow-taxi-in-nyc-cops/>Frances Rickard was crossing at York Avenue and East 72nd Street around 5:40 p.m. when the 68-year-old man driving the cab made a U-turn and hit her, authorities said. Moments later, a 35-year-old woman driving a 2023 Chevrolet Trailblazer also struck her, police said.</a></p><p>On the FDR, a Tesla flipped and burned. The driver died. The passenger lived. A witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/04/woman-dies-in-fiery-tesla-crash-on-manhattans-fdr-drive/>described the speed and destruction</a>: &ldquo;At least 120, 130 [mph]. At least. The damage was just so much that it split in half. And that just started going on fire.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>SUVs, trucks, sedans, bikes, mopeds</strong>—all have left blood on these streets. But the deadliest wounds come from cars and trucks. In three years, they killed six and left dozens with injuries that will never heal.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p>The city claims progress. They point to new speed cameras, lower speed limits, and intersection redesigns. But on these blocks, the carnage continues. Cameras catch speeders, but only where they are installed. Laws allow lower limits, but the city drags its feet. The dead do not wait for policy.</p><p>Local boards and advocates have pushed for safer crossings, split bike and pedestrian paths, and more space for people. The city <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/cyclists-pedestrians-paths-queensboro-bridge/>opened a separate pedestrian path on the Queensboro Bridge</a> after years of pressure. But every delay is another risk. Every unprotected crossing is a coin toss.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Demand the citywide 20 mph limit. Demand more cameras, more protected crossings, more space for people, not cars. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p><p>The numbers are not just numbers. They are neighbors, mothers, sons. The slow disaster will not stop until leaders feel the heat.

Starting May 18, the north outer roadway becomes bike-only, while the south outer roadway, once for vehicles, opens to pedestrians. The article notes, “Advocates have fought to open a separate pedestrian path, citing dangerous overcrowding that has led to conflicts among cyclists, pedestrians and micromobility users.” The bridge was the last city-owned East River crossing without split paths. Manhattan Community Board 6 urged the city to act, pressing DOT to open the path despite construction delays. The change doubles space for non-drivers and removes a vehicle lane, addressing years of systemic risk from forced mixing of vulnerable users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crash occurred at 17:41 in Manhattan. The report states, 'she stepped off the curb, alone, no signal. A taxi hit her head-on. An SUV rolled over her. Her skull crushed.' The pedestrian was not at an intersection and was crossing without a signal or crosswalk. Both vehicles, a taxi and an SUV, were traveling straight ahead. The police report identifies 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor. The drivers 'did not see' her, according to the narrative. The victim suffered fatal head injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene. No driver errors beyond inattention/distraction are cited in the report.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
