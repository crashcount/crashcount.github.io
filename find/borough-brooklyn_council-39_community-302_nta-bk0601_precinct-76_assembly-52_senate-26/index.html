The driver kept going. The rider, a 30-year-old off-duty NYPD officer, died at the hospital, and police later charged a trucker with leaving the scene (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/off-duty-nypd-officer-killed-hit-run-crash-work-brooklyn/17664404/>ABC7</a>, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/28/truck-driver-arrested-brooklyn-crash-killed-off-duty-nypd-cop-motorcycle/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>He was one of <strong>6 people killed</strong> on the streets and highways of Carroll Gardens–Cobble Hill–Gowanus–Red Hook since Jan 1, 2022. Another <strong>1,099 people were injured</strong> here in that time, across <strong>2,565 crashes</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>“We know how to fix it: safer street design,” State Sen. Andrew Gounardes said at a Brooklyn street-safety rally this summer (<a href=https://www.bkreader.com/policy-government/sunset-park-urges-city-to-fast-track-third-avenue-street-fixes-10986450>BKReader</a>).</p><h3 id=the-highway-and-the-avenue-keep-drawing-blood>The highway and the avenue keep drawing blood</h3><p>The BQE near Atlantic Avenue is this area’s worst hot spot, with <strong>1 death and 248 injuries</strong> since 2022. Atlantic Avenue itself saw another <strong>1 death and 41 injuries</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The pattern is not subtle; it’s carved into the map.</p><p>Crashes here spike through the morning and midday. Deaths are logged at 9, 10, and 11 AM hours in the dataset, even as injuries climb across the day (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=trucks-are-big-people-are-breakable>Trucks are big. People are breakable.</h3><p>Since 2022, trucks have been involved in pedestrian harm in this area, including <strong>2 pedestrian deaths</strong> captured in the records. Sedans and SUVs injure far more people, but heavy vehicles leave no margin when they miss (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Named, fixable factors appear again and again: <strong>failure to yield</strong> and <strong>inattention/distraction</strong> are present in injury and death crashes here. <strong>Unsafe speed</strong> shows up in deadly cases too, including an 18-year-old killed as a passenger at Atlantic and Court in 2023, where police cited speed (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data – CrashID 4655140</a>).</p><h3 id=make-the-turns-human-slow-the-straights>Make the turns human. Slow the straights.</h3><p>On local streets, the fixes are simple and known: daylight corners, add leading pedestrian intervals, and harden turns at Atlantic, Court, Columbia, and Smith. On truck routes, tighten curb radii and add protection at crosswalks. Targeted enforcement for yielding and phone use belongs at the same corners. These match the conditions the city’s own data shows here.</p><h3 id=the-laws-on-the-table-and-who-has-moved>The laws on the table, and who has moved</h3><p>Citywide, Albany has already locked in 24/7 speed cameras through 2030, a program the governor signed this June. Sponsors and supporters say cameras cut speeds and injuries; the law is on the books to keep them running (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/hochul-signs-speed-camera-reauthorization-enforcement-continues-through-2030>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>The next lever is stopping repeat speeders. The <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045/A2299)</strong> would require intelligent speed assistance for drivers with a record of violations. State Sen. <strong>Andrew Gounardes</strong> sponsors the Senate bill and voted it forward in committee. Assembly Members <strong>Jo Anne Simon</strong> and <strong>Marcela Mitaynes</strong> co-sponsor the Assembly version, and Simon also backed a bill to expand camera enforcement against obscured plates (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S4045</a>, <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">A2299</a>).</p><h3 id=after-the-sirens-fade>After the sirens fade</h3><p>The officer died on the BQE. A truck driver was charged with leaving him there. The rest of us still walk Atlantic. We still cross Court. The numbers do not blink.</p><p>The laws exist. The designs exist. The names will, too, if nothing changes. Tell City Hall and Albany to use the tools they already have.

The MTA’s $68.4 billion capital plan for 2025-2029 funds the project. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes said, “With elevators coming to the Smith-9th Street station, that’s finally going to change.” Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon praised the MTA for prioritizing accessibility. The upgrades follow a court settlement requiring 95% ADA-accessible stations by 2055. Safety analysts note: elevator installation boosts access for people with mobility challenges but does not directly impact street safety for pedestrians or cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

State Senator Andrew Gounardes, Assemblymember Jo Anne Simon, and NYCHA leaders backed the move. MTA Chief Accessibility Officer Quemuel Arroyo called Smith-9th the clearest case for access. Installing an elevator helps pedestrians, especially those with mobility impairments. It makes transit a real option, shifting trips away from cars and reducing street danger for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
