An SUV turns left. The man does not make it home. In Kingsbridge-Marble Hill, the story repeats. In the last twelve months, <strong>one person died and six were seriously injured</strong> on these streets. <strong>125 people were hurt</strong>. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old. In the last three years, <strong>five people have died</strong>. <strong>Eight suffered serious injuries</strong>. The wounds do not heal. The dead do not return.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>SUVs and trucks do the most damage.</strong> In this region, SUVs killed two people and caused four serious injuries. Trucks killed one. Cars and sedans left more bodies broken. Buses, mopeds, bikes—they all played their part. But the weight of steel falls hardest from above. Pedestrians at intersections, children in crosswalks, elders with nowhere to run. The street does not forgive.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The state passed Sammy’s Law. <strong>The power to lower speed limits is here.</strong> But in Kingsbridge-Marble Hill, the silence is thick. No bold new protections. No flood of safe crossings. No rush to harden bike lanes or slow the traffic that kills. The numbers do not rise. The leaders wait. The blood dries on the asphalt.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. Every crash is a choice—by a driver, by a planner, by a politician who looks away. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. The council can demand more cameras, more daylight, more concrete between people and cars. But nothing changes unless you demand it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer speeds, more cameras, real protection for people who walk and bike.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list. The street will not wait for you.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Critics worried about diverted car traffic clogging residential streets, with one resident calling for a 'traffic study' and 'action plan.'

The city has not acted on a 2019 resolution calling for real protection. Community members and advocates question the safety of the design, especially for children.

The city’s $2 million pilot lets delivery workers exchange uncertified e-bikes and batteries for certified, UL-standard models. The program also requires a safety course. While battery-related fires rose slightly from 268 in 2023 to 277 in 2024, fatalities fell from 18 to 6.

Residents worry rerouted vehicles will jam local streets and worsen safety. Jessica Lavoie of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association warns, "diverting traffic from this critical corridor onto narrow residential streets would lead to increased congestion, safety hazards, and diminished quality of life." The Department of Transportation aims to replicate the 14th Street busway, which "reduced congestion, sped up bus travel and curbed accidents."

After hitting Esiyok, Ali continued, injuring a cyclist, two more pedestrians, and crashing into a van.
