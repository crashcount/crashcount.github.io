Since January 2022, there have been 638 crashes. Three left victims with serious injuries. No one has been killed—yet. But 335 have been hurt. The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross the street. A 68-year-old man, incoherent and bleeding from the head, after a collision with an SUV. A 69-year-old cyclist, thrown and scraped, helmet cracked. A 19-year-old woman, her arm torn open after a left-turning SUV met her e-scooter. These are not numbers. These are lives, changed in a heartbeat.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hit>The Machines That Hit</h3><p>Cars and SUVs did most of the harm. Out of all pedestrian injuries, 53 came from cars and SUVs, 4 from trucks and buses, 1 from a bike, and 1 from a moped. The street is a gauntlet. The odds are not in your favor if you walk or ride.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-doand-dont>What Leaders Do—And Don’t</h3><p>Council Member Justin Brannan co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks—a move to clear sightlines and save lives.

The new elevators mark the third Brooklyn station made accessible this year. Improved subway access encourages walking and cycling to transit, boosting safety for vulnerable users by increasing their numbers and visibility.
