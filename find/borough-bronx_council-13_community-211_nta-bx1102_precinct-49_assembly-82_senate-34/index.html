Two seriously hurt. 336 injured.</strong> These are not just numbers. They are lives broken on the street. In the last twelve months alone, 139 people were injured in 193 crashes. One was a child. One was a senior. The street does not care. The cars do not stop.</p><p>A 16-year-old girl died crossing at Paulding and Neill. A truck turned left. She never made it to the other side. A 91-year-old man was killed at Radcliff and Rhinelander. He was working in the road. A sedan kept going straight. He did not get up again. A 64-year-old cyclist was struck and killed at Williamsbridge and Pierce. The truck kept going. The bike did not move.</p><h3 id=the-voices-in-the-aftermath>The Voices in the Aftermath</h3><p>On Bartow Avenue, a witness saw the cost. &ldquo;I saw one lady was out on the ground. They was giving her medical attention, checking her body. She was laid out.&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/op-city-crash-multiple-people-injured-including-1-critically-bronx/17075710/>said Samuel Cherry</a>. Another neighbor heard it. &ldquo;It was a terrible sound &ndash; it was a terrible incident that happened.&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/op-city-crash-multiple-people-injured-including-1-critically-bronx/17075710/>said Jennifer</a>.</p><p><strong>These are not accidents. They are the result of choices, laws, and the shape of the road.</strong></p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Assembly Member John Zaccaro co-sponsored a bill to <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">expand speed camera enforcement</a>. Senator Nathalia Fernández <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, which would force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. These are steps. But the blood on the street says it is not enough.</p><p><strong>Most injuries come from cars and trucks.</strong> In Morris Park, SUVs and sedans caused 68 pedestrian injuries and one death. Trucks and buses killed one and hurt three more. Not a single cyclist killed a pedestrian. The danger is not from bikes. It is from heavy, fast machines.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call your assembly member. Tell them the truth:</strong> The deaths are not random. They are preventable. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement. Demand streets built for people, not just cars. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
