Same ending.</p><ul><li><p>Since 2022, this small area logged <strong>982 crashes</strong>, <strong>5 deaths</strong>, and <strong>617 injuries</strong>. Twelve were serious injuries. The harm falls heavy on people outside cars: <strong>Pedestrians — 2 dead, 136 hurt; cyclists — 84 hurt</strong>. SUVs and sedans did most of the striking. Trucks and buses added their share. The city’s own data shows it all in plain rows and numbers. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p></li><li><p>A 61‑year‑old man died in the crosswalk at Bay Parkway and 60th Street. The SUV went straight. He did not get up. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4803841</a></p></li><li><p>On Avenue I at East 5th, a 70‑year‑old crossing at the intersection was hit by a sedan. Police logged distraction. He died. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4825939</a></p></li><li><p>A teenager on a moped was ejected and killed at Avenue N and East 8th. Speed and bad passing were noted. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4822639</a></p></li></ul><p>Heavy hours. Heavy vehicles.</p><ul><li><p>Injury spikes hit the school‑to‑commute band: 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. is a wall — with 52 injuries at 2 p.m., 61 at 3 p.m., 48 at 4 p.m., 45 at 5 p.m. Nights hurt too: deaths logged at 7 p.m., 8 p.m., and 9 p.m. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hourly breakdown</a></p></li><li><p>Pedestrians were most often struck by SUVs and sedans — <strong>2 pedestrian deaths each tied to those body types</strong> in this area’s roll‑up. Trucks and buses caused fewer cases but more severe trauma per hit. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>vehicle roll‑up</a></p></li></ul><p>The corners that don’t forgive.</p><ul><li><p><a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Bay Parkway</a> led the map with 15 injuries and two serious injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Coney Island Avenue</a> saw 44 injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Avenue I</a> took a life and 24 injuries.</p></li><li><p>The top listed factors are a shrug that kills: “other,” “vulnerable road user error,” “disregarded traffic control,” and distraction. One driver change that works everywhere is speed. Lower it, and people live. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>local factors</a></p></li></ul><p>Three fixes. Start now.</p><ul><li><p>Daylight the crossings on Bay Parkway and Coney Island Avenue. Harden the turns. Give pedestrians a head start with LPIs. Aim the work at the 2–5 p.m. surge. Tie in truck routing where trucks show up in the injury rolls. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>top intersections</a></p></li><li><p>Target SUVs and delivery fleets at the hotspots. Afternoon enforcement for failure to yield and turning speed. Keep it where the bodies fall.</p></li><li><p>Track repeat offenders by plate. The worst few do the most harm. The state has a live bill to stop them.</p></li></ul><p>Officials know what works — do they?</p><ul><li><p>Albany gave New York City the power to set safer speeds. The city has not used it citywide. A 20 mph default would make the hit survivable more often. Our own call to action lays it out. <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a></p></li><li><p>“A tiny pool of drivers does outsized harm. Just <strong>1.5% of motorists cause 21% of pedestrian deaths</strong>.” Vehicles with <strong>16 camera tickets in 12 months</strong> are twice as likely to kill or seriously injure; <strong>30+ tickets</strong> multiplies the risk fifty‑fold. One driver with <strong>29 camera tickets</strong> ran a red and killed a mother and her two daughters. These are the numbers. These are names turned into numbers. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/20/the-1-5-percent-of-drivers-who-cause-21-percent-of-pedestrian-deaths>Streetsblog NYC</a> <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/15/brooklyn-driver-with-29-speed-camera-tickets-kills-mother-and-two-daughters>NY Daily News</a></p></li><li><p>The <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045)</strong> would force repeat speeders to use speed‑limiting tech. Committee votes moved it forward in June. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>bill file</a></p></li></ul><p>One neighborhood. Not special.</p><ul><li><p>Year to date, crashes are up here versus last year. <strong>184 this year, 3 dead, 125 injured</strong>, against <strong>168, 1 dead, 108 injured</strong> last year period. The deaths tripled. The streets did not change. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>period stats</a></p></li><li><p>The map keeps lighting up the same blocks. People keep falling in the same hours. This is policy by neglect. Slow the cars. Stop the repeat speeders. Do it now.</p></li></ul><p>For City Hall and Albany, the path is short and clear: <strong>lower the default speed to 20 mph</strong> and <strong>force chronic violators to obey the limit</strong>. Until then, count the bodies.</p><p>If you want that to change, <strong>act</strong>.
