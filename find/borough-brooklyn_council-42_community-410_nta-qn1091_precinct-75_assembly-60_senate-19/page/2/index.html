The MTA claimed, 'There is less traffic and quicker streets,' citing a 16% drop in Midtown traffic and faster bus times. Ariola dismissed the data as 'fugazi.' The plan, imposed by the state, began January 5 with a $9 toll per car. Critics, including Ariola, Staten Island Borough President Vito Fossella, and Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, questioned the numbers and economic impact. Susan Lee of New Yorkers Against Congestion Taxes noted, 'January is usually the slowest month,' and warned that some areas saw more congestion as drivers dodged tolls. The council’s debate highlights deep skepticism about the plan’s real effect on city streets and the daily safety of those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Rivera and his colleagues call for streets built for people, not just cars. The bill has not yet reached committee or vote. Its language is clear: every user deserves safe passage. Complete streets mean sidewalks, bike lanes, and crossings that protect the most vulnerable. This is a direct response to the daily toll of crashes.

Council members Joann Ariola, Robert Holden, and Joe Borelli criticized current safety measures and leadership, calling for stronger action. Mayor Eric Adams backed more police and mental health interventions, while Governor Hochul's National Guard deployment drew fire.

Riley is the primary sponsor, joined by Ariola, Joseph, Moya, Won, Banks, Narcisse, Paladino, and Marmorato. Their action: referral to committee. The bill requires the Department of Transportation to install warning plaques at the request of a parent or guardian. It details the process for requesting, installing, and removing these signs. The stated aim is to alert motorists to the presence of a child with autism. There is no evidence these plaques reduce crashes or protect children.

The law requires the Department of Transportation to consult with the Fire Department before approving open street applications, bicycle lane projects, or major transportation projects. The official matter title states the law amends the city code to require DOT to consult with FDNY and notify affected firehouses before moving forward. Primary sponsor Kalman Yeger, with co-sponsors including Joann Ariola, Robert Holden, Lynn Schulman, and others, pushed the bill through. The law expands notification and comment rights for firehouses and community boards, adding new steps before any street or lane changes.

The bill, sponsored by Council Member Joann Ariola, claims residents need notice before losing parking. But DOT and street safety advocates slam the measure as a bureaucratic drag on urgent safety fixes. Council Member Lincoln Restler calls it 'additional hoops and hurdles' for street safety. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso says, 'I don’t know why we entertain any effort to stop or slow-roll safe street design.' Open Plans and StreetsPAC argue the bill props up car dominance and blocks safer, more sustainable streets. The bill could make it harder to move bike infrastructure off sidewalks, risking more sidewalk riding and fewer safe crossings for pedestrians. Similar bills (Intro 606, Intro 104) face the same criticism.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The SUV struck the rear of a sedan, causing catastrophic damage. The report details that the SUV's driver, a 25-year-old man, was killed in the crash, his body crushed inward despite the deployment of the airbag and use of a lap belt. The sedan, an Acura, was traveling straight ahead when it was hit. The police report lists 'Unsafe Speed' as the contributing factor, highlighting the systemic danger of excessive speed during lane changes. No contributing factors are attributed to the sedan’s driver.

Narcisse highlighted 'systemic bias in how these laws are enforced.'

The move aims to slow cars where people walk, bike, and gather. Resolution passes. Streets may breathe easier. The city pushes Albany to let it set its own pace.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0079-2024, adopted June 6, 2024 by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, urges the State Legislature and Governor to pass S.315/A.1416. The measure would let New York City set a five mile per hour speed limit on streets in the Open Streets program. The matter title reads: 'authorize New York City to set a five mile per hour speed limit on streets participating in the Open Streets program.' Council Member Shahana K. Hanif led as primary sponsor, joined by Amanda Farías, Crystal Hudson, Julie Won, and Carlina Rivera. The committee approved the resolution with strong support. The bill targets streets where pedestrians and cyclists mix with traffic. Lower speeds mean fewer crashes and less severe injuries. The council’s action puts pressure on Albany to give the city the power to protect people where they are most exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lawmakers balked at raising payroll taxes. The MTA’s $15 billion plan now hangs by a thread. Projects stall. Federal funds at risk. Riders, walkers, and cyclists face uncertainty. Albany remains split. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On June 6, 2024, Governor Hochul announced a pause on congestion pricing, sparking confusion in Albany. The state-level response included a rejected proposal to raise the payroll mobility tax (PMT) on NYC businesses to fill the $15 billion gap in the MTA’s capital plan. State Sen. Liz Krueger said, 'Payroll mobility taxes are actually taxes on workers... I do not think we have an appetite for that in the Senate.' Assembly Member Stacey Pheffer Amato, who once voted for congestion pricing, now supports the pause, calling the original vote 'political blackmail.' The MTA’s future projects, including the Second Avenue Subway, are threatened, as federal matching funds require local dollars. Lawmakers remain divided. No clear alternative has emerged. Vulnerable road users are left exposed as transit funding falters.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
