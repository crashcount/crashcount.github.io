The crash threw Berney from his car, killing him at the scene. The other driver was injured. Vennitti, unlicensed, abandoned his Mercedes and fled on foot. Police arrested him a year later. A grand jury indicted Vennitti for leaving the scene of a fatal crash and driving without a license.

The bill seeks to exempt NYPD officers, even off-duty, from paying congestion pricing tolls in Manhattan’s central business district. Reinvent Albany called the measure 'contrary to notions of basic fairness' and a '$22 million handout' to a special interest. The Traffic Mobility Review Board had already rejected such exemptions. The group warned that multiple exemption bills could cost the public $100 million yearly and force higher tolls for everyone else. Neither Pheffer Amato nor Scarcella-Spanton commented.

Vulnerable road users watch from the curb.</p><p class=mb3>On January 13, 2025, Councilwoman Joann Ariola (District 32) publicly challenged the MTA’s first-week report on New York City’s congestion pricing plan. The MTA claimed, 'There is less traffic and quicker streets,' citing a 16% drop in Midtown traffic and faster bus times. Ariola dismissed the data as 'fugazi.' The plan, imposed by the state, began January 5 with a $9 toll per car. Critics, including Ariola, Staten Island Borough President Vito Fossella, and Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, questioned the numbers and economic impact. Susan Lee of New Yorkers Against Congestion Taxes noted, 'January is usually the slowest month,' and warned that some areas saw more congestion as drivers dodged tolls. The council’s debate highlights deep skepticism about the plan’s real effect on city streets and the daily safety of those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Council Member Joann Ariola, claims residents need notice before losing parking. But DOT and street safety advocates slam the measure as a bureaucratic drag on urgent safety fixes. Council Member Lincoln Restler calls it 'additional hoops and hurdles' for street safety. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso says, 'I don’t know why we entertain any effort to stop or slow-roll safe street design.' Open Plans and StreetsPAC argue the bill props up car dominance and blocks safer, more sustainable streets. The bill could make it harder to move bike infrastructure off sidewalks, risking more sidewalk riding and fewer safe crossings for pedestrians.
