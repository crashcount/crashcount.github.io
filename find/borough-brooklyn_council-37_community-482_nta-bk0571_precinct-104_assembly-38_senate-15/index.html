Advocates say this 'all but guarantees that there will be blood on Eric Adams's hands.' NYPD data showed injuries dropped after the lane’s installation. The city acted after complaints from local leaders. The lane sits on a 'Vision Zero Priority Corridor,' one of Brooklyn’s most dangerous streets. Cyclists and residents called the move political and warned it strips away proven safety.
