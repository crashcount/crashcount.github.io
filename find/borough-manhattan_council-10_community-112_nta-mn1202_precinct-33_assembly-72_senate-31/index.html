Fourteen left with serious wounds.</strong> In the last three and a half years, the streets of Washington Heights (North) have not been quiet. The dead do not speak, but the numbers do. Since 2022, there have been <strong>1,226 crashes</strong>. <strong>590 people hurt.</strong> Each number is a body, a family, a life changed or ended.</p><p><strong>Children, teens, elders.</strong> No one is spared. One child killed. One teen struck in a crosswalk. Cyclists thrown, moped riders crushed, pedestrians hit by taxis and SUVs. The pain is not abstract. It is blood on the street, a siren in the night, a mother waiting at the hospital.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt</h3><p><strong>The most vulnerable pay the price.</strong> In these crashes, SUVs and sedans do most of the harm. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>SUVs alone caused 17 pedestrian injuries, three of them serious</a>. Sedans, taxis, mopeds, and bikes all play their part. But the weight of steel always wins.</p><p><strong>Serious injuries are rising.</strong> In the last year, six people suffered life-changing wounds. The year before, there were none. The trend is not mercy. It is luck, and luck runs out.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p><strong>The city talks about Vision Zero.</strong> They say one death is too many. They point to new speed cameras, new laws, and intersection redesigns. But here, the pace is slow. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph, but the limit still stands. The cameras work, but only if they stay on. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. Promises are not pavement.</p><p><strong>Local leaders must do more.</strong> Every day of delay is another risk. Every unprotected crosswalk is a bet against fate. The city has the tools. It needs the will.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. They are choices. Choices about speed, about street design, about who gets to feel safe.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor.

The pedestrian sustained injuries to her hip and upper leg and was reported to be in shock. The report explicitly cites 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as the contributing factor on the part of the taxi driver.
