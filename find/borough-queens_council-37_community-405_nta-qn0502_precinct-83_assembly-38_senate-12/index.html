But the blood did not stop. In twelve months, 199 people were hurt in 363 crashes. Three were left with serious injuries. Children were among the wounded—twenty under eighteen, their lives changed by a driver’s mistake (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The wounds are not rare. Since 2022, Ridgewood has seen 1,399 crashes. Two people died. Seven suffered injuries so grave they may never heal. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old. They do not care if you are careful.</p><h3 id=the-shape-of-danger>The Shape of Danger</h3><p>Cars and SUVs do most of the harm. They killed one person and left twenty-two with moderate or serious injuries. Trucks, motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes all left their mark. No one is safe when the street is built for speed and steel.</p><p>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price. A 74-year-old man was killed crossing Myrtle Avenue. A 64-year-old woman was crushed at Fresh Pond Road and 68th Avenue. A 23-year-old cyclist was thrown and battered on Gates Avenue. The stories repeat. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>City leaders talk of Vision Zero. They say one death is too many. They point to new speed cameras, intersection redesigns, and the power to lower speed limits. But the work is slow. The streets do not wait (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The law now allows a 20 mph limit.

Buses crawl at four miles per hour. New lanes promise relief for 215,000 riders. Space shifts from cars to buses. Streets change. Riders wait.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist (2025-07-08) reports new bus lanes are coming to Hillside Avenue, Queens. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said the corridor suffers from 'an inconsistent, patchwork design' and blocked lanes. Buses crawl at four miles per hour due to congestion. Only a third of road space serves buses, though 83% of transit users ride them. The project adds camera-enforced bus lanes, parking, and loading zones. Policy shifts road space from private cars to public transit, aiming to speed up service for 215,000 daily riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists called the move "unwise and unsafe." The article notes the city had previously identified this stretch as among the most dangerous. Officials responded to concerns by painting pedestrian islands and loading zones but did not install physical barriers or bus boarding islands. Cyclists described the decision as political, with one saying, "There’s a very important voting bloc that’s using their leverage over the mayor to remove the bike lane." The mayor’s refusal to sacrifice parking for safety left vulnerable road users exposed. The city’s Streets Master Plan, which mandates more protected lanes, remains unmet.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Their plan would turn Monitor Street into a cul-de-sac with a pedestrian plaza, add mid-block crossings, and close a slip lane to block cut-through traffic from the BQE. The push follows a fatal crash at Monitor and Driggs, where a driver killed 73-year-old cyclist Teddy Orzechowski. Streetsblog notes, 'Streets outside schools have higher crash and injury rates than the city average.' Most PS 110 families walk or bike, but the city has not responded to the proposal.

The city holds its breath.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC (2025-06-09) reports the Department of Transportation plans a center-running bus lane on Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn. The project aims to connect neighborhoods and calm traffic. DOT Assistant Director Dustin Khuu said the goal is a 'high performing transit priority street.' The plan includes concrete bus boarding islands and may reduce car lanes, giving more space to pedestrians and buses. However, the article notes gaps: 'DOT didn't share a block-by-block breakdown,' and curbside parking may remain, risking bus lane obstruction by double-parked vehicles. The city may physically protect the lane, but details are pending. The B41 bus, serving 28,000 daily trips, crawls at 4 mph during rush hour. The proposal highlights the need for clear enforcement and design to keep cars out of bus lanes and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT’s Chris Brunson said, “The narrower street width for vehicles will de-incentivize double parking on the corridor.” The redesign removes a travel lane, adds a protected bike lane, and aims to curb driver behavior that leads to crashes. Between 2022 and 2024, 165 crashes on this mile-long stretch caused one death and injured 15 cyclists and 23 pedestrians. Most pedestrian injuries happened while crossing with the light, showing drivers failed to yield. The plan targets excess road capacity and prioritizes vulnerable users on a Vision Zero Priority Corridor.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city rejected Lyft’s plan to add speedometers, demanding immediate compliance. Deputy Mayor Mastro wrote, 'We have requested that you immediately implement this new 15 mph speed limit for Citi Bike e-bikes, and you declined to do so.' Citi Bike agreed to the mandate, though previously voiced concerns. In 2021, e-bike injuries (1,170) and deaths (9) far outpaced those on pedal bikes (236 injuries, 2 deaths). The order follows a crash where a 3-year-old was struck by an e-bike in South Williamsburg. The city will collect public comments before finalizing the rule.

The redesign replaces two car lanes with 24/7 bus-only lanes and adds pedestrian islands. DOT officials said, 'almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles.' Since 2019, 55 people have been killed or severely injured in crashes along this stretch. The plan removes curbside parking and bans cars from bus lanes, aiming to speed up twelve bus routes and protect people on foot. Most residents in the area do not own cars and depend on slow buses. The proposal reflects a shift toward prioritizing vulnerable road users and addressing systemic danger on one of Brooklyn's busiest corridors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
