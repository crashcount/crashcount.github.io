The matter summary states, 'The proposal to extend New York City's speed camera program for another three years and expand it to run every day and around the clock easily passed.' Senator Andrew Gounardes sponsored the bill, saying, 'We are going to see a marked reduction in traffic violence on our streets at a time when traffic deaths are at their highest in a decade.' Simcha Felder, Democrat from District 44, voted against. The expansion targets off-hours, which account for 59% of traffic deaths. Speeding dropped 72% and deaths fell 55% where cameras operated. The city pushed for this as fatalities rose under Mayor Adams.

There is no evidence the bill would have improved safety for vulnerable road users. The city’s noise problem, and its threat to livable streets, remains unresolved.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Riders dodge chaos.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0045-2022 was introduced on February 24, 2022, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill, sponsored by David M. Carr (primary), with Farah N. Louis and Joseph C. Borelli as co-sponsors, sought to require the Department of Transportation to group new active transportation docking stations—bike, scooter, and e-mobility docks—within one city block of each other, unless contracts prevented it. The official summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring centralized siting of active transportation docking stations.' The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not advance. Without passage, the city’s docking stations remain scattered, leaving vulnerable road users to navigate a patchwork of locations and unpredictable street conditions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill aimed to establish an inter-borough advisory commission to recommend locations for active transportation parking hubs—secure spots for bikes, scooters, and similar devices. The measure’s title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to establishing an inter-borough planning and advisory commission for the siting of active transportation parking hubs in the city.' Council Members David M. Carr (primary sponsor), Robert F. Holden, and Joseph C. Borelli backed the bill.
