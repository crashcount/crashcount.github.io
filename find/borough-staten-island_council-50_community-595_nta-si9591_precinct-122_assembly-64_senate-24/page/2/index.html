The plan allows cameras on seven bridges and two tunnels, ticketing drivers who exceed speed limits. Fines start at $50 for a first offense, rising to $75 and $100 for repeat violations within 18 months. Governor Hochul's office called the program 'one more way the governor is working to improve safety on our roads and bridges for workers and travelers alike.' MTA Bridges and Tunnels President Catherine Sheridan said, 'We want to make sure that our maintenance workers and contractors are safe.' The program, part of the $254 billion state budget, will be reviewed again in 2031. The move targets driver speed, a key factor in crash severity, and signals a shift toward automated enforcement on major city crossings.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crash happened at Huguenot Ave. and Drumgoole Ave. West, Staten Island, after a precinct holiday party. Todaro admitted, "I had three or four drinks. My life is over." The impact triggered airbags and left her with a forehead gash. All three passengers, also officers, were placed on desk duty and may face charges for allowing Todaro to drive or being unfit for duty. The article notes this was one of three NYPD DWI arrests in four days, highlighting a pattern during holiday party season.
