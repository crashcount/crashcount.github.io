The pedestrian was crossing outside a signal or crosswalk. The listed driver error is Failure to Yield Right-of-Way, which put a person on foot in harm’s path.

They raced the M34 bus across 34th Street to expose slow bus speeds. The event asked: 'Is it faster to walk across town or take the bus?' Russo-Lennon and others backed bus improvements, highlighting how cars choke streets and trap riders. The demonstration drew support from Council Members Erik Bottcher and Keith Powers, and city officials. The safety analyst notes this was a demonstration, not a policy change, so it does not directly affect pedestrian or cyclist safety or system-wide outcomes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
