Since 2022, this small slice of Manhattan logged <strong>10 deaths and 1,397 injuries</strong> in 2,721 crashes. Pedestrians and cyclists carry the pain. SUVs and cars do most of the harm. The hours blur, but the damage peaks through the day and into the night.</p><h3 id=crosswalks-as-crime-scenes>Crosswalks as crime scenes</h3><ul><li>At 7th Avenue and West 36th, a driver going straight hit a 34‑year‑old man in the crosswalk.

The SUV had no listed damage. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City data records it</a>.</li><li>On Avenue of the Americas at West 58th, a Mazda SUV made a left and struck an 83‑year‑old woman crossing with the signal. She died. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The crash file shows it</a>.</li></ul><p>Six pedestrians have been killed here since 2022. Another 488 were hurt. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>The rollup is clear</a>. SUVs are tied to four pedestrian deaths.</p><blockquote><p>“Demand for curb space in the city is increasing, from trash collection and bike lanes to truck loading and parking.” <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/new-digital-parking-system-on-the-uws-implemented-in-dead-of-night-DG4954621>NYC DOT said</a>.

These tools match the failure modes listed: left turns, failure to yield, distraction.</li><li>Work the repeat hotspots weekly: Avenue of the Americas, West 51st, West 42nd, 7th Avenue. Keep counters on the ground until the injury numbers drop.</li><li>Trucks and buses cause fewer cases than cars here, but their strikes maim. Tighten turns and give buses protected approaches on the worst blocks.</li></ul><h3 id=the-citywide-brakes-we-still-dont-use>The citywide brakes we still don’t use</h3><p>Albany gave the city the keys to slow streets. The Council and Mayor can set <strong>20 mph</strong> on local roads. They haven’t used it. Our own page lays it out and gives you the numbers to call. <a href=/take_action/>Act on it here</a>.</p><p>The state is moving on repeat speeders. The Senate advanced the <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045)</strong> to force speed limiters on drivers who rack up points or camera tickets. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Committee votes passed</a>. The Assembly has a matching push. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>See A2299</a>. These are the drivers who turn people into names on a sheet.</p><blockquote><p>“We are taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection,” the city’s traffic chief said of Canal Street after two people were killed by a car going over 100 mph. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>The quote is here</a>. One street moved after two deaths. Midtown’s list is longer.</p></blockquote><h3 id=use-the-tools>Use the tools</h3><p>Lower the default speed. Install limiters on the worst repeat speeders. Daylight and harden every deadly turn. Then check the numbers. If they don’t fall, do more.</p><p>If you want this to stop, start with one call. <a href=/take_action/>Ask the city to set 20 mph and back the speed‑limiter bill</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
