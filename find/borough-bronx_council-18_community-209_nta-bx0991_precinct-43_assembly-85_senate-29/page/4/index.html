The law requires the Department of Transportation, in consultation with the Department for the Aging, to annually install at least one traffic calming device in each designated senior pedestrian zone, with a minimum of fifty devices citywide per year.

Measures target truck pollution, parks, and schools. Bronx leaders demand real protection, not more traffic. Mayor Adams backs the plan but wants justice for the Bronx.</p><p class=mb3>On March 27, 2023, the MTA announced a $130 million mitigation package to address air-quality impacts from congestion pricing, aiming to secure a 'No Significant Impact' ruling from the Federal Highway Administration. The plan, still under negotiation, includes electrifying trucks at Hunts Point Market, expanding clean truck programs, upgrading parks, and installing air filtration in schools. The MTA's memo responds to concerns from Bronx officials and Mayor Adams after projections showed possible pollution increases as drivers avoid Manhattan tolls. Rep. Ritchie Torres and Council Member Amanda Farias insist the Bronx must not become a dumping ground for truck traffic. Mayor Adams supports congestion pricing but prioritizes Bronx environmental justice. Advocates cautiously support the measures, calling them overdue.

The bill sought to amend city law by establishing a parking permit enforcement unit within the Department of Transportation. Its summary reads: 'This bill would require the Department of Transportation to create a parking permit enforcement unit that would be dedicated to the enforcement of laws and rules relating to misuse of city-issued parking permits.' The primary sponsor was Kristin Richardson Jordan, joined by Amanda Farías, Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, Julie Won, Rita C. Joseph, Crystal Hudson, Farah N. Louis, and Lincoln Restler. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, with no further action. No safety analyst assessed its impact on vulnerable road users. The city’s permit abuse problem remains unaddressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They demand action. Pollution already scars the borough. Officials call for cleaner fleets, new tolls, and urgent fixes. No more burdens. The city must protect its people.</p><p class=mb3>On August 15, 2022, council members and advocates responded to the MTA’s environmental assessment predicting up to 704 more trucks daily on the Cross Bronx Expressway due to Manhattan congestion pricing. Council Member Amanda Farias said, “I support it in principle. But it’s necessary for the city not to put another burden on the Bronx.” The policy statement, covered by Streetsblog NYC, urges city, state, and federal agencies to act fast. Officials want incentives for truck electrification, toll structures to cut truck diversion, and accelerated projects to cap or reimagine the Cross Bronx. Renae Reynolds added, “There are overall benefits... But we can’t ignore the challenges, and there should be assurance that there are solutions that mitigate those burdens.” The message: congestion pricing only works if it does not worsen the Bronx’s deadly air and traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
