Six seriously hurt.</strong> In Gravesend (West), the numbers do not tell the whole story, but they do not lie. Since 2022, cars and trucks have killed four people and left six with wounds that will not heal. Two of the dead were older New Yorkers, crossing with the light, doing nothing wrong. One was a 95-year-old woman, struck by a left-turning van as she walked with her aide. Her family remembered her as &ldquo;a very active lady&rdquo; and said, &ldquo;Everybody knows her&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/woman-who-survived-nazis-chernobyl-covid-killed-while-crossing-brooklyn-street-police-say>said her daughter</a>. The NYPD did not charge the driver. The street stayed the same.</p><p>A mother and her two daughters died on a sidewalk. The driver had a suspended license, over 90 violations, and a taste for speed. She bragged about it. &ldquo;She always talked about driving fast,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/03/31/us-news/miriam-yarimi-accused-of-killing-nyc-mom-2-kids-allegedly-bragged-about-speeding/>an acquaintance told the press</a>. The city let her keep driving. The law let her keep killing.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-behind-the-names>The Numbers Behind the Names</h3><p><strong>680 injured. 1,172 crashes.</strong> In three years, the streets of Gravesend (West) have become a gauntlet. Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians pay the price. Cars and trucks do most of the harm: all four deaths, all but one serious injury. Bikes and motorcycles are not the killers here. The danger comes in steel and glass, moving fast, turning left, not stopping.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-what-they-havent>What Leaders Have Done—and What They Haven&rsquo;t</h3><p>The city passed new laws. Speed cameras now run all day. The council can lower speed limits. But in Gravesend (West), the blood keeps flowing. Drivers with long records stay on the road. Police let killers walk. No statement from the council. No call from the board. No change at the corner where the old woman died.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-action-now><strong>Call to Action: Demand Action Now</strong></h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement. Demand streets where children and elders do not die for crossing with the light. Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Department of Transportation will fine violators $650 per incident, using in-road sensors to detect excess weight. Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "Overweight trucks cause wear and tear on our roadways and we all pay the price through expensive repairs to our infrastructure." The city issued over 3,000 warnings during a 90-day grace period. Similar enforcement on Queens-bound trucks led to a 60% drop in overweight vehicles. Albany has approved expanding this automated system to more city roadways. The BQE’s aging structure faces risk from trucks exceeding its design limits, raising safety and infrastructure concerns.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Assembly Member Robert Carroll authored the original Assembly version, stating, 'It is time we require delivery apps to take responsibility for keeping delivery workers and pedestrians safe.' Sen. Andrew Gounardes defended a related speed-limiting bill, but it was weakened.

The new design 'daylights' corners, using concrete, granite, and planters to keep cars back and create mini-protected bike lanes. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' The agency targeted intersections with a history of turning crashes—Ocean Avenue saw 79 crashes in 2024, injuring 75 people, including 15 pedestrians and 13 cyclists. Advocates praised the move but called for faster, broader use of hard infrastructure. The article notes that most pedestrian injuries and deaths in New York occur at intersections, and that keeping corners clear is standard in other states. DOT opposes removing parking without barriers, citing risks of faster, more dangerous turns.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Concrete islands promise safer crossings. Details remain thin. Cars may still block buses. The street could change. Pedestrians and riders wait. The city holds its breath.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC (2025-06-09) reports the Department of Transportation plans a center-running bus lane on Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn. The project aims to connect neighborhoods and calm traffic. DOT Assistant Director Dustin Khuu said the goal is a 'high performing transit priority street.' The plan includes concrete bus boarding islands and may reduce car lanes, giving more space to pedestrians and buses. However, the article notes gaps: 'DOT didn't share a block-by-block breakdown,' and curbside parking may remain, risking bus lane obstruction by double-parked vehicles. The city may physically protect the lane, but details are pending. The B41 bus, serving 28,000 daily trips, crawls at 4 mph during rush hour. The proposal highlights the need for clear enforcement and design to keep cars out of bus lanes and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city rejected Lyft’s plan to add speedometers, demanding immediate compliance. Deputy Mayor Mastro wrote, 'We have requested that you immediately implement this new 15 mph speed limit for Citi Bike e-bikes, and you declined to do so.' Citi Bike agreed to the mandate, though previously voiced concerns. In 2021, e-bike injuries (1,170) and deaths (9) far outpaced those on pedal bikes (236 injuries, 2 deaths). The order follows a crash where a 3-year-old was struck by an e-bike in South Williamsburg. The city will collect public comments before finalizing the rule.

The redesign replaces two car lanes with 24/7 bus-only lanes and adds pedestrian islands. DOT officials said, 'almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles.' Since 2019, 55 people have been killed or severely injured in crashes along this stretch. The plan removes curbside parking and bans cars from bus lanes, aiming to speed up twelve bus routes and protect people on foot. Most residents in the area do not own cars and depend on slow buses. The proposal reflects a shift toward prioritizing vulnerable road users and addressing systemic danger on one of Brooklyn's busiest corridors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
