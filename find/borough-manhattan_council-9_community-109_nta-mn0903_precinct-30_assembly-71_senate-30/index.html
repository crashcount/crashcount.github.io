Four seriously hurt.</strong> In Hamilton Heights-Sugar Hill, from 2022 to June 2025, the toll is steady and grim. <strong>Over 500 people injured</strong> in just three and a half years. The dead do not speak. Their absence is felt in empty chairs and quiet rooms.</p><p><strong>SUVs, sedans, bikes, vans.</strong> The machines change, the outcome does not. A cyclist struck by an SUV on St. Nicholas Avenue. A pedestrian killed at Riverside Drive. A moped rider left bleeding on W 145th. The numbers are not just numbers. They are people who did not come home.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h3><p>City leaders say the right things. They promise safer streets. They pass laws. But the work is slow. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> passed in Albany, letting the city lower speed limits. The city can act now. It has not. The clock runs. The streets do not wait.</p><p><strong>Speed cameras cut speeding by 63% where installed. Injuries drop 14%.</strong> But the law that keeps them running is always at risk. Each year, advocates must fight to keep them alive. Each year, the city hesitates. The cost is paid in blood.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>A family gets a bill for a police car after their son is killed. The city calls it policy. The family calls it cruelty. The <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/12/23/dirt-bikers-family-demands-attorney-general-charge-nypd-cop-deadly-uptown-collision/>Daily News reports</a> the NYPD has no comment. The silence is heavy.</p><blockquote><p>“Williams&rsquo; family is suing the NYPD and demanding criminal charges against the officer, identified as Perez.” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/12/23/dirt-bikers-family-demands-attorney-general-charge-nypd-cop-deadly-uptown-collision/>NY Daily News</a></p></blockquote><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Lower the speed limit.

The unicycle rider landed in the hospital. The cyclist, bruised, faced wrongful charges. Chaos thrives where speed meets congestion.</p><p class=mb3>West Side Spirit (2025-07-06) reports a crash on Central Park’s West Drive, near West 60th Street. An illegal electric unicycle hit a cyclist, sending its operator to the hospital in critical but stable condition. The cyclist, Carolyn Backus, was wrongly charged with leaving the scene, though she "remained on scene for about 45 minutes after the crash and waited for paramedics." The Manhattan D.A. dismissed the charge, noting Backus rode a non-motorized bike. The article highlights the risk of high-speed e-vehicles in crowded park zones, where "unpredictable congestion makes it the last place...anyone should be speeding."</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
