Three seriously hurt.</strong> Four hundred sixty-three injured. These are not numbers from a war zone. They are the toll of traffic violence in Todt Hill-Emerson Hill-Lighthouse Hill-Manor Heights since 2022. The dead do not come back. The injured carry scars. In the last year alone, 148 people were hurt in 262 crashes. One lost a limb. One never made it home.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>A 69-year-old man was killed by a bus on Platinum Avenue. He was crossing, not at an intersection. The bus turned left. The man died where he fell. No warning, no second chance. Data from <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a> confirms the toll.</p><p>A 39-year-old man lost his leg to a truck on Sparkhill Avenue. He was working in the road. The truck slowed, but not enough. The street did not forgive. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a> record is clear.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-silence>Leadership: Action and Silence</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have watched the blood run.</strong> They have also acted, but not always for the most vulnerable. In June 2025, Mayor Eric Adams stood in Staten Island and watched a bulldozer crush 200 illegal mopeds. He <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/nyc-officials-destroy-illegal-mopeds-nypd-06132025/>said New Yorkers have strong feelings about illegal mopeds and scooters, because we hear it all the time, especially when they are driving the wrong way down streets or sidewalks or in the dark without lights.</a> The city links these vehicles to crime and fear, but the crackdown swept up delivery workers and even a Citi Bike. Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/super-smash-nyc-destroys-mopeds-e-bikes-as-mayor-celebrates-illegal-vehicle-crackdown>said this morning is not just about crushing mopeds. It is about crushing the criminal activity and quality of life activities that come with them.</a></p><p>But the numbers show the main killers are still cars, trucks, and buses. The city can lower speed limits. It can redesign streets. It can protect the people who walk and ride. <strong>It has not done enough.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>No more waiting.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower speed limits, redesign deadly streets, and protect the vulnerable. Demand action before another name becomes a number. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The incident, reported by Barbara Russo-Lennon and Lloyd Mitchell, followed 'years of visible disrepair, foul smells and water leaks.' Council Member Lincoln Restler confirmed no timeline for reopening. The Department of Buildings cited the owners for 'Failure to maintain' and ordered demolition. DOB Commissioner James Oddo said engineers are inspecting a second awning showing 'poor maintenance.' The collapse put pedestrians in harm's way. As safety analysts note, such failures in busy areas raise the risk of injury or death for vulnerable road users and discourage walking, undermining city safety goals.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
