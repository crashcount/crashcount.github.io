Albany remains split. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On June 6, 2024, Governor Hochul announced a pause on congestion pricing, sparking confusion in Albany. The state-level response included a rejected proposal to raise the payroll mobility tax (PMT) on NYC businesses to fill the $15 billion gap in the MTA’s capital plan. State Sen. Liz Krueger said, 'Payroll mobility taxes are actually taxes on workers... I do not think we have an appetite for that in the Senate.' Assembly Member Stacey Pheffer Amato, who once voted for congestion pricing, now supports the pause, calling the original vote 'political blackmail.' The MTA’s future projects, including the Second Avenue Subway, are threatened, as federal matching funds require local dollars. Lawmakers remain divided. No clear alternative has emerged. Vulnerable road users are left exposed as transit funding falters.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They criticized the MTA for boosting express bus service in Brooklyn and Staten Island but not Queens, calling the exclusion "unacceptable." The lawmakers stressed that many southeast and northeast Queens residents lack subway access and rely on express buses to reach Midtown.
