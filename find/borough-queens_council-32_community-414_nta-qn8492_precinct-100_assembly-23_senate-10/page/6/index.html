Primary sponsor John Mannion led the push, joined by Joseph P. Addabbo Jr., Iwen Chu, and Pamela Helming. The bill aims to carve out protected zones for first responders and lower speed limits in those areas. The measure passed with broad support, reflecting urgency after repeated crashes near emergency scenes. The bill’s text and votes show lawmakers responding to the deadly toll of reckless driving near first responders. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, passengers, and responders—stand in harm’s way.

The city’s future hangs in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>The congestion pricing debate centers on a policy to toll drivers entering Manhattan’s core. The bill faces opposition from Council Members David Weprin, Joann Ariola, and Ari Kagan, who argue it will hurt small businesses and outer-borough residents. On May 22, 2023, Ari Kagan said, 'Congestion Pricing will hurt countless New Yorkers, small businesses, residents of so-called outer-boroughs & will create huge lines of parked cars right outside of Manhattan.' Yet, the MTA’s assessment shows only 5,200 city drivers commute by car from areas far from fast transit—just 1.2% of that population. Advocates like Felicia Park-Rogers counter, 'this policy has the potential to be utterly transformational for our city.' The plan includes exemptions for disabled and low-income drivers. Most New Yorkers stand to gain safer, better-funded transit and less congestion.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

This policy, supported by Queens Borough President Donovan Richards, State Senator James Sanders, Jr., Assembly Member Khaleel Anderson, and City Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, addresses a long-standing exclusion in the city's transit network.

Ariola stated, 'I think it’s necessary and I think that it would really benefit the communities.' Brooks-Powers emphasized the resolution as a priority for the Transportation Committee. The push comes as Mayor Adams advances the QueensWay park plan, raising concerns among transit advocates.

Her SUV racked up 27 school-zone speeding tickets. She calls cameras a burden. Critics see hypocrisy. The vote blocks a tool proven to slow drivers and protect people on foot and bike.</p><p class=mb3>On September 9, 2022, the New York City Council considered a 'home rule' message to let state lawmakers expand speed cameras to 24/7 operation. The matter summary: 'expanding New York's speed camera program.' Council Member Joann Ariola, representing southern Queens and the Rockaways, voted no. Ariola argued, 'these cameras add additional financial strain to New Yorkers,' and claimed repeat offenders with fake plates escape punishment. Ariola’s SUV has 48 violations since 2017, including 27 for speeding in school zones and two for running red lights. She insists her record did not influence her vote. Critics, like StreetsPAC’s Eric McClure, highlight the contradiction between her opposition to speed cameras and her stated concern for school safety. The vote denied a proven measure to slow traffic and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Councilmember Joann Ariola opposes the plan, claiming it will worsen city travel. Delays threaten $1 billion in MTA funding. Vulnerable road users wait as traffic and pollution persist. No relief in sight.</p><p class=mb3>On June 9, 2022, Councilmember Joann Ariola (District 32) joined critics in a policy debate over New York City's stalled congestion pricing plan. The measure, approved by state lawmakers three years ago, would charge drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street. The MTA faces hundreds of follow-up questions from the Federal Highway Administration, delaying the required environmental assessment. Ariola argued, 'I don’t believe it will work, in fact I believe it will make the city more unmanageable to travel through.' The plan is intended to reduce traffic, lower car pollution, and fund MTA capital improvements. Delays put $1 billion in annual funding at risk, threatening upgrades like accessible subway stations and zero-emission buses. As the debate drags on, vulnerable road users remain exposed to traffic and pollution hazards.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
