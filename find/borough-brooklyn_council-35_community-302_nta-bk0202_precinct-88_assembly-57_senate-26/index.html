Eighteen left with serious injuries.</strong> In the past twelve months, 572 crashes tore through Downtown Brooklyn-Dumbo-Boerum Hill. The wounded are not numbers. A four-year-old struck in the crosswalk. A 74-year-old ejected from his e-bike, dead on Tillary Street. A woman, right rear passenger, crushed in a stopped SUV on Flatbush Avenue. The city keeps moving. The bodies pile up.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the worst of it.</strong> Cars and SUVs caused the most harm—42 incidents left pedestrians injured or worse. Buses, trucks, bikes, and motorcycles all played their part. Most of the injured were just crossing with the light. Some never made it to the other side.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-sayand-what-they-do>What Leaders Say—and What They Do</h2><p>After a mother and her two daughters were killed by a driver with a suspended license and a record of violations, State Senator Andrew Gounardes <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-lawmakers-push-super-speeder-bill-after-brooklyn-crash-kills-mom-2-kids>said</a>, “It’s no longer simply enough to shake our heads in despair when these preventable tragedies occur—it’s time for us to act. The senselessness of this most recent crash is compounded by the fact that this car had dozens of speed and red light violations, and the driver had a suspended license.”</p><p>Assemblymember Emily Gallagher <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-lawmakers-push-super-speeder-bill-after-brooklyn-crash-kills-mom-2-kids>put it plain</a>: “A lot of what happens when it comes to getting a bill to the top of the list is really through a movement and folks fighting for the bill.”</p><p>The city has plans—<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/06/dot-proposes-protected-bike-lane-for-court-street-this-summer>protected bike lanes for Court Street</a>, narrower lanes to stop double parking. But the deaths keep coming. The bills stall. The cameras wait for reauthorization. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapses. The law lets the city lower speed limits, but the limit stays high.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day leaders delay, another family breaks. <strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras stay on.

Prosecutors say Pigford rear-ended Cifuni, then stopped two blocks away. When Cifuni approached, Pigford 'refused to roll down her window or speak,' then accelerated, striking and dragging Cifuni. The article quotes Assistant District Attorney Tara Kelly: 'The defendant floored the gas, instantly striking Tiffany, causing her body to become lodged beneath the vehicle.' Pigford then made an illegal turn and fled. The case highlights the lethal risk of hit-and-run driving and the dangers posed by unlicensed, reckless drivers operating stolen vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Sen. Andrew Gounardes praised the program, saying, 'speed cameras save lives and make our streets safer for everyone.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez credited advocates and lawmakers for the renewal. Amy Sohn supported the move. Safety analysts note that speed cameras reduce vehicle speeds and crashes, improving safety for pedestrians and cyclists without burdening them.

Assembly Member Robert Carroll authored the original Assembly version, stating, 'It is time we require delivery apps to take responsibility for keeping delivery workers and pedestrians safe.' Sen. Andrew Gounardes defended a related speed-limiting bill, but it was weakened.

The city’s deadliest keep rolling. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On June 11, 2025, the New York State Senate amended the Super Speeder Bill, sponsored by Sen. Andrew Gounardes (D-Bay Ridge). The bill originally required drivers with six or more speed or red-light camera tickets in a year to install speed-limiting devices. The Senate raised the threshold to sixteen speed-camera tickets, and removed red-light violations from the count. Streetsblog NYC reports, 'the state Senate moved to help more than 130,000 reckless drivers avoid accountability.' Gounardes defended the change, saying it would allow the program to grow slowly. Assembly Member Michaell Novakhov (R-Midwood) argued the threshold was too low. The amendment means only 17,000 drivers, not 150,000, will face restrictions. According to safety analysts, this move undermines deterrence, increases risk to pedestrians and cyclists, and signals that dangerous driving is tolerated. Vulnerable road users remain at risk. The bill’s status now sets a weaker standard for accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
