Over six hundred injured.</strong> That is the toll in Castle Hill-Unionport since 2022. The numbers do not bleed, but people do. A 64-year-old man, crossing at Bruckner and Castle Hill, struck by an SUV. A 19-year-old, dead on the Bruckner Expressway. A 62-year-old woman, killed in a crosswalk by a turning SUV. These are not accidents. They are collisions, each one a life ended or broken. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City data confirms it</a>.</p><p><strong>No one is spared.</strong> Children, elders, workers. In the last year alone, ninety people were injured on these streets. Not one serious injury was counted as &ldquo;preventable&rdquo;—but every one was. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the harm.</strong> Three of the four deaths came from SUVs or cars. Trucks, buses, and bikes trail far behind in the body count. The streets are built for speed and size, not for the people who walk them. The numbers are plain: cars and trucks are the threat. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The data is clear</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-absence>Leadership: Action or Absence?</h3><p><strong>What has changed?</strong> The city passed Sammy’s Law, allowing New York to lower speed limits to 20 mph. But in Castle Hill-Unionport, the pace of change is slow. The deaths keep coming. The silence from local leaders is louder than any promise. No new redesigns. No bold votes. No public reckoning. The streets remain the same.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by the city, by leaders, by those who set the rules and draw the lines. <strong>Call your council member. Demand lower speed limits. Demand street redesigns. Demand action.</strong> The dead cannot speak.

The bill, sponsored by Senator Shelley Mayer (District 37), creates a speed camera program around schools in White Plains, set to expire December 31, 2030. The committee passed the bill, with only one senator, Mario Mattera, voting no. The measure aims to catch drivers who speed near schools, a proven danger to children and families on foot. Mayer’s bill targets reckless driving at the source. The committee’s action marks a step toward streets that remember every crash and fight for every life.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
