Same ending.</p><ul><li><p>Since 2022, this neighborhood logged <strong>1,318 crashes, 729 injuries, 0 deaths</strong>. Six were serious injuries. Nights hit hard. From midnight to 1 a.m., injuries stack up, peaking again at the evening rush. The hour from <strong>5 p.m. to 7 p.m.</strong> brings the <strong>most injuries</strong>. Late night stays bloody too. The worst single hour: <strong>5 p.m. (56 injuries)</strong>, then <strong>6 p.m. (58)</strong> and <strong>7 p.m. (52)</strong>. That’s the rhythm here. It does not let up (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p></li><li><p>Drivers in cars and SUVs do most of the hurting. Pedestrians took 134 injuries. Cyclists 35. Occupants 534. Trucks and buses show up less often, but they still break bodies (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p></li></ul><p>Three corners. One fix.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Linden Boulevard</strong> leads the harm list. So does <strong>Sutter Avenue</strong> and <strong>Euclid Avenue</strong>. <strong>Conduit Boulevard</strong> is right behind. These are the places where people go down. These are the places that need daylighting, hardened turns, and real slowdowns now (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p></li><li><p>On Conduit at Forbell, a <strong>25‑year‑old pedestrian</strong> working on a car lost part of his leg. Police recorded “amputation.” The SUV driver was listed as unlicensed. A parked Tesla took the hit too. It was <strong>4:03 a.m.</strong> The wound won’t heal for him (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4694065</a>).</p></li><li><p>On Sutter at Doscher, <strong>10:30 p.m.</strong>, a <strong>16‑year‑old girl</strong> crossing at the intersection was crushed. Listed as “crush injuries.” She lived. She will carry it (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4712918</a>).</p></li></ul><p>Night after night.</p><ul><li><p>At Liberty and Crescent, <strong>1:47 p.m.</strong>, a <strong>17‑year‑old</strong> on a motorized device was ejected. Severe head cuts. He was conscious at the scene. The car had Florida plates. The other vehicle was “standing.” The form does not say why. It only records blood and metal (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4834459</a>).</p></li><li><p>Earlier, a <strong>22‑year‑old</strong> driver on Euclid hit parked cars before another sedan. Severe bleeding, head injury, <strong>4:14 a.m.</strong> Another file in a long stack (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4722036</a>).</p></li><li><p>The pattern is clear on the city’s own sheets: top factors here include “other,” distraction, unsafe speed, aggressive driving, and failure to yield. The names change. The causes repeat (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p></li></ul><p>Two bodies. A train. One hour apart.</p><ul><li>On the L at Sutter Avenue, around <strong>6 p.m.</strong>, a man fell onto the southbound tracks and was struck. EMS pronounced him dead. Police said, <strong>“No criminality is suspected”</strong> in that case or the one an hour earlier in Manhattan (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/10/two-people-killed-by-mta-trains-one-hour-apart-in-brooklyn-and-manhattan/>NY Daily News</a>). The platform stayed open. The train ran. The line moved on.</li></ul><p>Officials know what works — do they?</p><ul><li><p>Albany moved one piece. The Senate advanced the <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045)</strong> in committee. It would force <strong>repeat offenders</strong> to use speed limiters after a pattern of tickets or DMV points. Senator Roxanne Persaud voted yes in committee twice in May and June. The bill title says it all: <strong>“requiring the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices for repeated violation of maximum speed limits.”</strong> (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>).</p></li><li><p>City Council files keep stacking too. Some target commuter vans. Some put safety reminders on shared devices. But the street tells us where the blood pools: <strong>Linden. Sutter. Euclid. Conduit.</strong> Slow the cars. Protect the crossings (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>).</p></li></ul><p>Three fixes. Start today.</p><ul><li>Daylight every corner on the hot corridors. Give pedestrians a head start with LPIs. Harden the turns so drivers can’t cut the line.</li><li>Target the late‑day and late‑night hours when injuries spike. Put enforcement and calming where the harm is worst.</li><li>Push citywide speed cuts and rein in the worst drivers with mandated limiters. The tools exist.

Despite this, his administration 'put the brakes on a potentially life-saving road redesign,' favoring business interests. Attorney Peter Beadle notes, 'they had a plan ready to go and then it was pulled back.'

City Hall insists the reconfiguration is legal and claims the appeal delays 'easing the safety concerns plaguing Williamsburg parents.'
