The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to use of force incidents involving police department use of a motor vehicle," forces the NYPD to add 'use of a motor vehicle to gain control of a subject' as a specific reporting category in quarterly and annual use of force reports. Council Member Lincoln Restler leads as primary sponsor, joined by Hudson, Won, Hanif, Bottcher, Brewer, Avilés, Abreu, Ossé, Krishnan, Williams, Cabán, Nurse, Sanchez, and the Brooklyn Borough President. The bill targets a gap: current NYPD reports do not name motor vehicles as a means of force.

Council Member Gutiérrez demands action. Industrial zones draw crowds but lack lights, signs, transit. Politicians push for safety. Danger stalks dark streets. City must fix deadly gaps before more lives are lost.</p><p class=mb3>On August 4, 2023, Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez (District 34) led a call for increased nightlife safety in industrial areas after two men died near Brooklyn Mirage. The matter, titled 'After two bodies recovered from Newtown Creek, pols petition for more nightlife safety measures in industrial areas,' highlights the lack of lighting, signage, connectivity, and public transportation in the Industrial Business Zone (IBZ). Gutiérrez, joined by U.S. Rep. Nydia Velázquez, Assembly Members Maritz Davila and Emily Gallagher, and State Senator Julia Salazar, urged a full investigation and demanded urgent infrastructure upgrades. Gutiérrez said, 'We remain committed to enhancing public safety and ensuring that the nightlife community operates and maintains responsible practices.' The push centers vulnerable road users—pedestrians and nightlife patrons—who face systemic danger in neglected, poorly lit streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
