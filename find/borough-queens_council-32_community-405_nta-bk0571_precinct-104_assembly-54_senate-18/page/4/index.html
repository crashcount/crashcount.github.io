Police say Yarimi had over 99 traffic violations, including 21 for speeding and five for red-light running. Her license was suspended, yet she continued to drive. Advocates point to the lack of speed-limiting devices on vehicles with repeated violations, a measure pending in Albany. Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives said, "If Albany had passed this bill when it was first introduced, this vehicle would already have been speed limited and this crash would never have happened." The crash has renewed calls for urgent policy action to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary states, 'The final plan did not eliminate parking mandates citywide but divided the city into zones.' Council Member Crystal Hudson pushed to eliminate mandates in all her districts. Council Member Shahana Hanif opposed carve-outs. Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez called parking mandates 'a concession to cars that we don’t need and can’t afford.'
