Since January 2022, there have been 638 crashes. Three left victims with serious injuries. No one has been killed—yet. But 335 have been hurt. The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross the street. A 68-year-old man, incoherent and bleeding from the head, after a collision with an SUV. A 69-year-old cyclist, thrown and scraped, helmet cracked. A 19-year-old woman, her arm torn open after a left-turning SUV met her e-scooter. These are not numbers. These are lives, changed in a heartbeat.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hit>The Machines That Hit</h3><p>Cars and SUVs did most of the harm. Out of all pedestrian injuries, 53 came from cars and SUVs, 4 from trucks and buses, 1 from a bike, and 1 from a moped. The street is a gauntlet. The odds are not in your favor if you walk or ride.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-doand-dont>What Leaders Do—And Don’t</h3><p>Council Member Justin Brannan co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks—a move to clear sightlines and save lives.

It waits by the phone.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Call your council member. Call your assembly member. Tell them: lower the speed, clear the crosswalks, stop the repeat offenders. Do not wait for the first death.

Despite this, his administration 'put the brakes on a potentially life-saving road redesign,' favoring business interests.

The lane, shielded by parked cars, now waits for a court fight. Cyclists and advocates hold their ground.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News reported on July 15, 2025, that an appellate judge blocked New York City from removing the protected Bedford Ave bike lane in Williamsburg. The city planned to move cyclists next to car traffic, but the court granted an emergency restraining order after advocates appealed. Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives called the lane a 'critical safety project.' City Hall insists the reconfiguration is legal and claims the appeal delays 'easing the safety concerns plaguing Williamsburg parents.' The protected lane, installed in October 2024, separates cyclists from moving vehicles. The ruling highlights ongoing policy battles over street design and cyclist safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The new elevators mark the third Brooklyn station made accessible this year. Improved subway access encourages walking and cycling to transit, boosting safety for vulnerable users by increasing their numbers and visibility.
