Judge Ventura issued a restraining order after Transportation Alternatives and Baruch Herzfeld appealed the city’s move. The city had planned to start demolition after complaints from local leaders, but the court’s order blocks any changes until further review. Streetsblog quotes Ben Furnas: 'The Adams administration is going to have to spend their night preparing their legal case, not ripping out a critical safety project.' The article highlights weak enforcement of parking rules and the city’s reversal against its own DOT’s safety plan. The case underscores how political pressure and lax enforcement can threaten vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The court found the city may have acted "arbitrarily, capriciously, and illegally" by ordering the removal without proper legal notice. City law requires the Department of Transportation to notify local officials and allow time for public discussion, but, as the court papers state, "DOT did not provide the required notice." Plaintiffs argued that removing the lane would "irreparably" harm cyclists, especially children. The city claimed it would only shift the lane, not remove it, but advocates countered that any removal increases danger. The case highlights the need for transparent processes and the risks when safety infrastructure is hastily altered.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The lane faced opposition from some Hasidic leaders, citing children running into the lane from illegally parked cars and buses. Despite tweaks—school bus zones, daylighted corners, no standing areas—drivers kept parking illegally, blocking sightlines and endangering children. The city rarely removes protected lanes, but Adams acted after political pressure. Moving the lane to Classon Avenue, as some demand, would force cyclists onto a chaotic BQE ramp.
