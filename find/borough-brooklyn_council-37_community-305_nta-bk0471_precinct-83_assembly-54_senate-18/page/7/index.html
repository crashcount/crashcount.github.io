The penalty: $175 per violation, enforced through the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings. Civilians, except city employees, could file complaints and receive 25% of collected fines. The Department of Transportation would support this with a phased-in reporting program and annual public reports. Council Member Carlina Rivera led as primary sponsor, joined by over two dozen co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law.

Council Member Christopher Marte led as primary sponsor, joined by Restler, Brewer, Joseph, Nurse, Cabán, Avilés, Bottcher, Won, Ossé, and Richardson Jordan, plus the Brooklyn Borough President. The bill aimed to end a system that let private cars claim curb space, fueling illegal parking and danger for those on foot or bike.

The report found that the NYPD controls 145 vacant city-owned lots, with 73 underutilized lots in Brooklyn and the Bronx.

Council Member Sandy Nurse of District 37 criticized the city's policy, saying, "The city has been surrendering scarce, developable vacant land to the NYPD for purposes—including personal employee parking lots—that do not house our neighbors." Nurse called for the land to be used for affordable housing and community development, highlighting the injustice of prioritizing police parking over basic needs in poor, heavily policed neighborhoods. The Mayor's Office and NYPD did not respond. The report urges the city to act, stressing that public land should serve people, not cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Urgency grows. No more excuses.</p><p class=mb3>On May 2, 2022, the City Council’s Sanitation Committee, chaired by Council Member Sandy Nurse, held a hearing on the delayed implementation of commercial waste zones, a reform established by a 2019 law. The matter, titled 'Advocates Warn Against Further Delays on Commercial Waste Zones,' drew sharp criticism after the Department of Sanitation granted private carters a three-month extension to comply with new requirements. Nurse stated, 'Our communities cannot afford any more delays.' Advocates and Families for Safe Streets highlighted the deadly toll: reckless commercial haulers have killed more than two dozen people in recent years. The reform aims to cut truck traffic, reduce pollution, and require life-saving side guards on heavy trucks by 2024. Lauren Pine, a crash survivor, said, 'Commercial waste zone reform can not come fast enough.' The hearing underscored that every delay keeps vulnerable New Yorkers at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
