Danger lingers for all outside a car.</p><p class=mb3>"The governor is pointing an unloaded gun at us and asking to give her the ammunition to shoot us and our constituents." -- Julia Salazar</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2024, New York’s legislature ended its session without plugging the MTA’s multi-billion-dollar budget hole. The gap opened when Governor Hochul halted Manhattan’s congestion pricing. The bill, discussed but not passed, would have replaced lost revenue—$1 billion a year meant for transit upgrades. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, mentioned in the debate, said, 'Our conference is reticent to commit a billion dollars annually for the next 15 years without having some understanding in place as to how we're going to deal with congestion as well.' Lawmakers could not agree on new taxes or a legislative IOU. The inaction leaves critical MTA projects—like electric buses and accessible stations—at risk. Vulnerable road users lose most: less transit means more cars, more danger, and fewer safe options for those on foot, bike, or bus.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The group wrote to MTA chairman Janno Lieber, stating, "Express buses play a vital role in Queens’ public transit network and only stand to become even more pivotal in the near and distant future." They criticized the MTA for boosting express bus service in Brooklyn and Staten Island but not Queens, calling the exclusion "unacceptable." The lawmakers stressed that many southeast and northeast Queens residents lack subway access and rely on express buses to reach Midtown. They argued the 10 percent LIRR discount is no substitute for robust bus service. Salazar and her colleagues support congestion pricing but insist its success depends on expanded, equitable transit for all vulnerable riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
