In the past twelve months, <strong>236 people were hurt</strong> in crashes here. Five were left with serious injuries. The pain is not spread evenly. <strong>Children and young adults are among the wounded.</strong></p><p>Just last month, a 25-year-old moped rider was crushed at Metropolitan Avenue and Rene Court. In January, a 23-year-old cyclist’s leg was shattered at Gates Avenue and Fresh Pond Road. These are not isolated.

Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes trail far behind. The street is not a fair fight.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-and-silence>Leadership: Votes and Silence</h3><p>Assembly Member Claire Valdez co-sponsored a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters (<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">Open States</a>). State Senator Michael Gianaris voted yes on the same bill in committee (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>).
