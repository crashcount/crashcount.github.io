Primary sponsor Andrew Gounardes leads a slate of co-sponsors: Leroy Comrie, Michael Gianaris, Brad Hoylman-Sigal, Robert Jackson, Liz Krueger, Zellnor Myrie, Gustavo Rivera, Julia Salazar, Luis R. Sepúlveda, and Toby Ann Stavisky. The bill aims to expose the risk cars pose to people on foot. By making safety data public, it puts pressure on automakers and drivers alike.

Holden (District 30) criticized the exemption of top city officials from New York’s $9 congestion toll. The controversy centers on the MTA’s emergency vehicle exemption, which lets law enforcement vehicles—including those chauffeuring Mayor Eric Adams, Comptroller Brad Lander, and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams—avoid the toll. The bill’s matter summary highlights the hypocrisy: 'They shouldn’t be exempt from congestion pricing. They shouldn’t have chauffeurs. It’s disgusting,' Holden said. Lander and Williams previously celebrated the toll’s benefits for transit and air quality, but now face backlash for not paying it themselves. The measure’s status is controversial, with no direct safety analyst note, but critics argue the exemption undermines public trust and leaves the city’s most vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, and transit riders—bearing the burden.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
