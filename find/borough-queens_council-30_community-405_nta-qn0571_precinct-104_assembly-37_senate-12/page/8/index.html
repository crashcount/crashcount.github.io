The bill, now backed by a Council majority, would require all legal e-bikes and scooters to be registered and display license plates. The meeting opened with a standing ovation for Holden, but tensions rose when NYPD Deputy Inspector Erik Worobey praised deliveristas for safer riding. The crowd booed, voicing fear of fast e-vehicles. The E-VSA’s nine-point plan calls for reclassifying e-bikes as mopeds, ending a park e-bike pilot, and NYPD confiscation of e-vehicles on sidewalks, with a $500 retrieval fine. The group frames itself as victims of 'rogue' riders, though city statistics show drivers of larger vehicles cause far more injuries. The bill does not address mopeds or provide funding, and critics say it ignores the dangers faced by delivery workers, 26 of whom died between 2020 and 2022.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, covered on September 18, 2023, drew over 200 residents and was organized by Western Queens elected officials. The workshop addressed a 'significant increase in traffic-related deaths, including several high-profile fatalities involving cyclists and pedestrians.' Councilwoman Tiffany Cabán, State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, and Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani called the deaths preventable and demanded urgent changes. Cabán stated, 'If it saves lives, it’s worth doing.' DOT officials, including Queens Borough Commissioner Nicole Garcia and senior program manager Kyle Gorman, presented plans for 31st Avenue and collected resident feedback on dangerous driving, lack of protected bike lanes, and unsafe intersections. The DOT pledged to return with a proposal. No formal bill number or committee was cited; the event focused on immediate community engagement and systemic change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Holden wrote to DOT demanding action. Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez replied that the employee was identified and that 'appropriate action' was taken, but did not specify what that meant.

He commended DOT for swift action but transparency is lacking. Holden has opposed Citi Bike expansion and the Streets Master Plan, but supports NYPD enforcement against illegal parking and some safety improvements.

The plan, now under City Council review, would charge drivers up to $30 per month for curbside parking, with revenue aimed at funding the MTA. The proposal leaves key details—like reserving 20% of spaces for non-residents—to the Council. The bill’s summary claims it will reduce emissions and support transit. Senator Michael Gianaris supports the measure, but critics are blunt. Bike New York’s Jon Orcutt calls it a 'big nothingburger.' Donald Shoup says the $30 fee is a subsidy for cars. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives argues, 'public space should be used for transit, bike lanes, and green space, not car storage.' Studies show similar programs in other cities have failed to cut congestion or emissions, and may even increase car ownership. The Department of Transportation has testified against the plan, warning it entrenches private car storage at the expense of vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Speaker Adrienne Adams clarified the bills target commercial sellers, not workers. Shahana Hanif urged that policy must "keep workers" at the center. The Council and delivery workers’ union stressed that tech companies, not workers, should bear costs. The FDNY opposed the reporting bill over resource concerns.
