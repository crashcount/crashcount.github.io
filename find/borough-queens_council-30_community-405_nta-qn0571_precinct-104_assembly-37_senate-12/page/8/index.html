Holden (District 30) sponsored a bill to allow automated enforcement of alternate-side parking via cameras on street sweepers. The proposal, discussed on October 20, 2023, awaits state approval and has no active Albany bill yet. The measure, as described, would let sanitation staff review footage and issue tickets to cars blocking sweepers. The matter summary: 'New York's street sweepers should have cameras to ticket car owners who flout the city's alternate-side parking rules.' Holden said, 'Our goal is not to punish. Our goal is obviously to have cleaner streets.' The bill aims to clear blocked routes and improve sanitation. The proposal faces pushback from drivers but has support from city officials seeking cleaner, safer streets for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Holden and his colleagues push regulation, but critics say the bill ignores the real threats: narrow sidewalks, blocked crosswalks, and unsafe delivery work. The proposal would burden riders and discourage micromobility, while failing to address illegal mopeds or car dominance.

The bill, now backed by a Council majority, would require all legal e-bikes and scooters to be registered and display license plates. The meeting opened with a standing ovation for Holden, but tensions rose when NYPD Deputy Inspector Erik Worobey praised deliveristas for safer riding. The crowd booed, voicing fear of fast e-vehicles. The E-VSA’s nine-point plan calls for reclassifying e-bikes as mopeds, ending a park e-bike pilot, and NYPD confiscation of e-vehicles on sidewalks, with a $500 retrieval fine. The group frames itself as victims of 'rogue' riders, though city statistics show drivers of larger vehicles cause far more injuries. The bill does not address mopeds or provide funding, and critics say it ignores the dangers faced by delivery workers, 26 of whom died between 2020 and 2022.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The workshop addressed a 'significant increase in traffic-related deaths, including several high-profile fatalities involving cyclists and pedestrians.' Councilwoman Tiffany Cabán, State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, and Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani called the deaths preventable and demanded urgent changes. Cabán stated, 'If it saves lives, it’s worth doing.' DOT officials, including Queens Borough Commissioner Nicole Garcia and senior program manager Kyle Gorman, presented plans for 31st Avenue and collected resident feedback on dangerous driving, lack of protected bike lanes, and unsafe intersections. The DOT pledged to return with a proposal.

The proposal leaves key details—like reserving 20% of spaces for non-residents—to the Council. The bill’s summary claims it will reduce emissions and support transit. Senator Michael Gianaris supports the measure, but critics are blunt. Bike New York’s Jon Orcutt calls it a 'big nothingburger.' Donald Shoup says the $30 fee is a subsidy for cars. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives argues, 'public space should be used for transit, bike lanes, and green space, not car storage.' Studies show similar programs in other cities have failed to cut congestion or emissions, and may even increase car ownership. The Department of Transportation has testified against the plan, warning it entrenches private car storage at the expense of vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
