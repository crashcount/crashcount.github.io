The move comes weeks before new congestion tolls hit Manhattan. The matter, titled 'MTA plans fare hike as it OKs $1.27B train car purchase weeks before new congestion toll: ‘Keep the grift alive’,' drew fire from Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30), who called the fare and toll hikes a 'scam' and accused the MTA of mismanagement. Holden’s comments echo broader council criticism of the MTA’s spending and question the effectiveness of congestion pricing. MTA officials defend the investment, citing improved reliability and safety with the new R211 cars. No independent safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.

Advocacy groups, including Los Deliveristas Unidos and Open Plans, argue the bill would unfairly criminalize immigrants and delivery workers, and increase police stops for people of color.

The bill is named after Priscilla Loke, killed by an electric Citi Bike rider.

They warn it would create barriers to e-bike use and could lead to inconsistent rules across cities. Holden defends the bill as a push for 'accountability and safety.' Critics say it discourages e-bike use and risks police harassment, especially for immigrants. The city Law Department declined comment.

The bill, sponsored by Council Member Robert Holden, claims to address a 'public safety crisis.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez opposed the measure, stating, 'The administration already has the tools to enforce against illegal [cycling] behaviors; a license plate is not necessary for enforcement.' Rodriguez cited data: 105 pedestrians killed by cars this year, versus six by e-bikes, mopeds, and scooters combined. He argued that street redesigns, not new bureaucracy, cut deaths and injuries. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams echoed this, noting that registration backers often resist proven safety fixes like protected bike lanes. Rodriguez warned the bill would waste $19 million and slow adoption of sustainable transport. He called for holding delivery apps accountable and redesigning streets, not targeting vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Janet Schroeder, co-founder of the NYC E-Vehicle Safety Alliance, argued, 'This legislation will save lives and mitigate injuries for pedestrians, cyclists and e-bikers.'

Holden (District 30). The bill would require all electric bikes, scooters, and similar micromobility devices to be licensed and registered. The committee reviewed the proposal, which aims to regulate these vehicles and address their growing presence. The bill summary states: 'A bill requiring electric bikes, scooters, and other motorized vehicles to have license plates and be registered.' Holden, who sponsored the bill, argued it would help identify riders and discourage hit-and-runs. Critics countered that the measure diverts attention from drivers, who cause most injuries and deaths. Danny Harris, former Transportation Alternatives director, called for a holistic safety approach, including holding delivery apps accountable. The hearing also addressed battery fire risks, with 250 lithium-ion battery fires reported this year. The debate centers on whether registration improves safety for vulnerable road users or simply shifts blame.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill would force all e-bikes, including Citi Bikes, to register with the city and display license plates. The matter summary calls this a 'common sense way to address concerns about e-bike rider behavior.' Holden leads the charge, but critics, including Shabazz Stuart, call the bill 'flawed, impossible to enforce, unnecessary, and regressive.' They warn it will hit low-income and minority communities hardest, discourage e-bike use, and fail to improve safety. Stuart notes, 'Registration mandates are notoriously difficult to enforce at almost every level of government.' He argues that real safety comes from proven measures: protected bike lanes, road diets, and consistent enforcement of existing laws. The bill, he says, misses the mark and puts vulnerable road users at greater risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary reads: 'require the city Department of Transportation to create a registration system, and a newly created license plate, for all electric bikes.' Shabazz Stuart, writing in Streetsblog NYC, calls the bill 'flawed, impossible to enforce, unnecessary, and will not work.' He warns it will be expensive, difficult to implement, and lead to selective policing, especially against poorer and minority communities. Stuart notes registration schemes have failed elsewhere and that police already have tools to address reckless cycling. He concludes the bill would not improve safety, but instead create bureaucracy and enforcement challenges, with no benefit for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Holden writes, 'The argument for Priscilla’s Law is simple: We need to hold these riders accountable.' The law would require all e-mobility devices to be registered with the city’s Department of Transportation and carry license plates. Holden criticizes delivery apps and calls for companies to be held responsible for repeat offenders. He cites the 2023 death of Priscilla Loke as a catalyst.

The project, covered in committee and public statements, is described as 'transformative for so many New Yorkers.' Council Member Robert F.

The plan eliminates a dangerous section where trams would have mixed with cars, reducing exposure for pedestrians and cyclists. The MTA has issued a request for proposals to design the line and guide it through federal review.

Out-of-state plates show up in deadly crashes. The bill seeks stiffer penalties. The aim: stop the shell game, make streets safer for those on foot and bike.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0451-2024 sits with the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced June 6, 2024, by Council Member Robert F. Holden, the measure urges the State Legislature and Governor to 'introduce and pass... legislation increasing penalties on drivers who improperly register vehicles in another state.' The resolution cites data: 11,000 injuries and 62 deaths in 2021 crashes involving out-of-state cars. Out-of-state vehicles made up 19% of city crashes that year. Holden’s action targets drivers who skirt taxes, fees, and insurance, shifting costs and risks to New Yorkers. The bill is a call to close loopholes and hold reckless drivers accountable. No safety analyst note was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
