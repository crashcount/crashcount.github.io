The editorial, titled 'Hey, Donovan Richards: It’s actually way more racist to FAVOR congestion pricing,' criticized Queens Borough President Donovan Richards for labeling Holden’s opposition as racist. The piece argued, 'congestion pricing would be a disaster,' claiming it would harm diverse outer-borough residents and worsen air quality in The Bronx by diverting diesel trucks. The editorial cited MTA studies predicting only a 3.1% reduction in Manhattan traffic and framed the plan as an unfair tax on commerce. Holden’s stance reflects ongoing resistance to congestion pricing in the council, with equity and environmental impacts at the center of the debate.

Holden (District 30) and Queens Borough President Donovan Richards clashed publicly over the MTA's congestion pricing plan. The dispute, reported by nypost.com, began with Holden calling the plan 'another tax on hardworking New Yorkers' and demanding a referendum. Richards retweeted Holden, suggesting an 'actual Democrat' should replace him, and responded to a supporter with 'Yeah white supremacy.' The exchange escalated, drawing condemnation from other officials. The matter centered on the policy to charge motorists entering Manhattan below 60th Street. Holden joined a bipartisan press conference urging Governor Hochul to let voters decide. The spat revealed sharp divides over congestion pricing, with Holden opposing the plan and Richards defending it. No formal council bill or vote was involved, but the fight highlighted the political and racial tensions surrounding street safety and car use in New York City.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Holden (District 30) condemned the longstanding exemption shielding Governor Hochul’s state-owned SUVs from traffic camera enforcement. The matter, reported as 'Gov. Hochul’s SUVs are cloaked from traffic cameras,' reveals that these vehicles, used by Hochul and Lt. Governor Delgado, cannot be flagged by speed or red-light cameras—a security measure in place for fifty years. Holden called the exemption 'disgusting and disturbing,' highlighting the hypocrisy as Hochul champions camera expansion and congestion pricing for the public. The city’s Department of Transportation and other officials were unaware of the loophole. In contrast, Mayor Adams’ NYPD detail faces camera enforcement. StreetsPAC’s Eric McClure and other critics demand accountability for all officials. No safety analyst assessment was provided, but the lack of enforcement leaves vulnerable road users at risk while officials evade consequences.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Borelli (District 51) joined a bipartisan group at City Hall to oppose the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's congestion pricing plan. The rally, covered by Crain's New York, featured lawmakers including Robert Holden, Kalman Yeger, Nicole Malliotakis, and Ritchie Torres. The group argued the plan would 'disproportionately harm working- and middle-class New Yorkers, increase air pollution in outer boroughs, and raise costs for businesses and consumers.' Borelli called it 'bad policy for New York City.' The event did not advance a formal bill but marked a public stand against congestion pricing. The MTA and Governor Hochul support the plan to reduce traffic and fund transit. The Traffic Mobility Review Board continues to review feedback.

Holden (District 30) publicly criticized Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine for supporting policies to reduce car usage, including more bike lanes and congestion pricing. The matter, reported by the New York Post, highlights Levine’s history of 41 traffic violations, including speeding and blocking bike lanes. Holden said, “He’s the last person who should be advocating for more bike lanes, having been caught blocking one.” Despite the criticism, Levine continues to promote street redesigns and enforcement, aiming to convert a section of the West Side Highway into a bike lane and favor non-car owners in community board appointments. Levine’s spokesman stated that all tickets were paid promptly and steps have been taken to prevent future infractions. Street-safety groups back Levine’s agenda, which centers on protecting vulnerable road users by reducing car dominance.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident, which killed 74-year-old Be Tran at Myrtle and Seneca Avenues, triggered public outcry. Gianaris criticized the city’s process, saying, 'They have to wait until that happens to get the score high enough to realize that an intersection needs protection.' He joined activists from the Ridgewood Tenants Union and Transportation Alternatives, demanding new signals and better street design. Gianaris said he contacted the Department of Transportation a year earlier with no result. The city claims over 20 traffic control approvals in Ridgewood, but residents and advocates say it’s not enough.

Holden accused Ardila of hypocrisy, highlighting the gap between Ardila’s driving record and his policy positions. Despite this, StreetsPac, a safe streets advocacy group, endorsed Ardila, noting his support for 24/7 speed cameras and safer biking infrastructure. Ardila stated, 'We need to ensure that every New Yorker has the opportunity to bike and... reduce car culture within our communities.'

Bike lanes, busways, and bus lanes now trigger public notice. The Department of Transportation must alert community boards, offer presentations, and post updates online. The bill is filed, not law.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0251-2022, introduced April 28, 2022, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, sought to amend city law on community notification for major transportation projects. The bill, sponsored by Kalman Yeger (primary), with Inna Vernikov, Joseph C. Borelli, Kevin C. Riley, Shaun Abreu, and Robert F. Holden as co-sponsors, was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. The bill summary states: 'This bill would change the community board notification process for major transportation projects by defining the construction or removal of a bus lane, busway, or bike lane as a major transportation project, regardless of the number of consecutive blocks or consecutive feet of street that the project alters.' DOT would be required to notify and present plans to community boards, consider feedback, and post quarterly progress reports online. The bill aimed to increase transparency and community input on street changes that affect vulnerable road users, but did not become law.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
