She cited DOT's repeated failure to meet the 2019 Streets Master Plan benchmarks—50 miles of protected bike lanes and 30 miles of bus lanes each year. In 2024, DOT delivered only 5.3 miles of bus lanes and 25.7 miles of bike lanes. Brooks-Powers introduced Intro 1105, a bill requiring DOT to publish a tracker of its progress. She declared, "DOT gives us their word every hearing and we are not getting results." DOT First Deputy Commissioner Margaret Forgione objected, claiming the tracker would add paperwork and reduce community engagement. Brooks-Powers countered, "DOT needs to be more transparent about its project pipeline so we can identify bottlenecks." The committee signaled intent to advance the bill. The city’s failure leaves pedestrians, cyclists, and bus riders exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law expands notification and comment rights for firehouses and community boards, adding new steps before any street or lane changes.

The vote passed with strong support but faced opposition from several members. The bill’s summary reads: "Establishes a school speed zone camera demonstration program in the city of Schenectady; repeals authorization of program December 31, 2028." No formal safety analyst note was provided, but the measure targets driver speed in zones where children walk, bike, and cross.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move falls short of the original goal but marks the largest growth since 1994. Advocates say cameras save lives. Debate continues over equity and coverage.</p><p class=mb3>On June 6, 2024, the City Council passed a resolution urging the state to expand New York City's red light camera program from 150 to 600 intersections. The measure, led by Council Member Lincoln Restler, follows internal debate and negotiation, with some members pushing for 1,325 intersections and others preferring fewer. The final number represents a four-fold increase, covering about 4 percent of city intersections. The Council's resolution, described as a 'home rule' message, aims to prevent the program from sunsetting and to improve safety for all road users. Restler stated, 'This will expand it to about 4 percent of intersections, and it will make our city safer.' Assembly Member Jeff Dinowitz called the expansion a victory, while advocates like Sara Lind of Open Plans noted no deaths at camera-protected intersections since 1994. Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers highlighted the need to ensure cameras improve communities and street safety, raising concerns about fairness in enforcement. The Department of Transportation called the Council's action a critical step.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
