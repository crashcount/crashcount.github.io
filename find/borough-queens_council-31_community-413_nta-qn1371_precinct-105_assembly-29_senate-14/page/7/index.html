They claimed community harm, ignoring hard data. Bike lanes and safer streets faced political fire. DOT stood firm, citing lives saved and broad support. Vulnerable road users caught in the crossfire.</p><p class=mb3>On March 19, 2024, the City Council held an oversight hearing on DOT street safety projects and Streets Plan implementation. The hearing, led by Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers (D-Queens), Christopher Banks (D-Brooklyn), and Rafael Salamanca Jr. (D-Bronx), focused on the DOT's progress under the Streets Plan, which mandates annual targets for protected bike lanes and bus lanes. Brooks-Powers objected to the Seagirt Boulevard bike lane, claiming DOT ignored community wishes, despite previously calling for more investment. Banks demanded removal of new protected bike lanes in East New York, citing parking and safety issues, though data showed fewer crashes and injuries. Salamanca criticized a Bronx street redesign for congestion, despite lower crash rates. He also accused DOT of neglecting communities of color, though data shows these areas receive more redesigns. DOT officials defended their process, emphasizing community engagement and prioritizing high-need areas. The council's opposition stands in stark contrast to the projects' proven safety benefits for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Chi Ossé (District 36) was mentioned, but only six of 51 council members responded to DOT’s call for safety project suggestions. The matter centers on the DOT’s report and council inaction: 'Out of 51 City Council members, only six responded to a request from DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez for recommended locations where street safety improvements should be made in their districts.' Mayor Adams slashed DOT’s budget and weakened projects, while council leaders deflected responsibility. Advocates like Jon Orcutt and Elizabeth Adams demanded decisive action, warning that delays and excuses cost lives.

DOT promises effort, not results.</p><p class=mb3>On February 26, 2024, the Department of Transportation released its status report on the NYC Streets Plan, a law passed in 2019. The plan required 80 miles of protected bike lanes and 50 miles of protected bus lanes in the first two years of the Adams administration. DOT delivered only 58.2 miles of bike lanes (72%) and 9.6 miles of bus lanes (19%). Only 68 of 1,000 bus stop upgrades were completed. Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers said, "The Streets Plan is the law, and the Department of Transportation is still failing to fulfill its legal obligations." DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called the benchmarks "aggressive" but promised to keep trying. Mayor Adams has refused to be bound by the law’s targets. Riders Alliance demanded a real plan for bus lanes. The city’s failure leaves pedestrians, cyclists, and bus riders at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Brooks-Powers slammed the slow pace. Cyclist deaths hit a 21st-century high. Promises broken. Streets remain deadly. Progress stalls. Riders pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On February 25, 2024, the City Council, led by Transportation Committee Chair Selvena N. Brooks-Powers (District 31), publicly criticized the Department of Transportation for missing legal mandates on new bus and bike lane construction. The matter, titled 'Spinning wheels: Adams admin misses legal benchmarks for new bus, bike lanes for second year in a row, DOT data shows,' revealed DOT built only 31.9 miles of protected bike lanes and 5.2 miles of protected bus lanes in 2023—far short of the 50 and 30 miles required by the Streets Master Plan. Brooks-Powers stated, 'The Streets Plan is the law, and the Department of Transportation is still failing to fulfill its legal obligations.' She promised to hold DOT accountable at an upcoming budget hearing. The city also lagged on bus stop upgrades, completing just 54 out of 500 required. Cyclist fatalities soared to 30 in 2023, the highest this century. Advocates and council members warn that continued delays and weakened projects put vulnerable road users at greater risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Her family car racked up 25 tickets in 16 months—20 for speeding near schools. Critics call her actions hypocritical. Advocates say public trust and lives are at stake.</p><p class=mb3>On February 17, 2024, Councilwoman Selvena N. Brooks-Powers (District 31), chair of the City Council’s Transportation Committee, came under fire after media reports revealed her family car received 25 traffic tickets in 16 months, including 20 for speeding near schools. The controversy centers on officials’ personal compliance with traffic laws while publicly supporting measures like speed cameras and congestion pricing. Brooks-Powers, who has promoted speed cameras and legislation to reward reporting hit-and-run drivers, claims her husband was responsible for the violations and that she has not used the car in over a year. Councilman Robert Holden called her a 'hypocrite,' while safe streets advocate Adam White stressed, 'Public officials and their families need to abide by speed cameras and red lights... people’s lives are at risk.' The incident highlights the gap between public safety advocacy and personal conduct, raising questions about accountability and public trust.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill demands the city install pedestrian lighting in at least 500 commercial corridors per year, aiming for a minimum of 1 footcandle (11 lux) on every sidewalk. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to installation of pedestrian lighting fixtures.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers leads as primary sponsor, joined by Restler, Krishnan, Bottcher, and others. The committee has not yet voted.
