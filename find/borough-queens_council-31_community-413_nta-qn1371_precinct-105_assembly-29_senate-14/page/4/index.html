The Council and DOT hold the power. Advocates say language matters. Streets remain deadly. Action lags. Lives hang in balance.</p><p class=mb3>On May 8, 2024, Mayor Eric Adams publicly supported lowering speed limits after the passage of 'Sammy’s Law,' which allows New York City to reduce limits to 20 mph on most roads. The law, passed in the state budget, excludes wide, multi-lane roads in the outer boroughs. Adams said, 'I do believe as New Yorkers we need to slow down,' but repeatedly referred to preventable crashes as 'accidents,' a term advocates reject for removing driver responsibility. The City Council must legislate any citywide speed limit change, while the Department of Transportation (DOT) can adjust limits on specific streets after community input. Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers and Speaker Adrienne Adams pledged to 'collaborate and negotiate' with City Hall. Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi stressed the need for street redesign and legal reform, noting, 'This is not a problem that goes away on its own.' Despite new authority, the Adams administration has lagged on safe street infrastructure. The city faces its deadliest start to a year in the Vision Zero era, with 60 killed in the first quarter.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The fight for safer streets is not over.</p><p class=mb3>Sammy’s Law, passed on April 22, 2024, as part of New York’s $273-billion state budget, grants New York City the authority to set its own speed limits on most roads. The bill, long blocked by Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, finally moved forward under Governor Kathy Hochul’s push. The measure, described as 'a significant legislative achievement,' excludes roads outside Manhattan with three or more travel lanes in one direction—a concession to car-centric lawmakers. The law requires community board notification and comment, but their input is only advisory. Families of road violence victims and street safety advocates celebrated the win. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, Transportation Chair, conditioned her support on street redesigns in underserved neighborhoods. The law’s carve-out leaves many of the city’s deadliest roads unchanged, withholding proven safety benefits from major thoroughfares.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city, led by Mayor Adams, pushes a park-only project, funded by the U.S. Department of Transportation. Rick Horan, QueensLink’s executive director, argues the plan blocks a vital north-south rail corridor, denying disadvantaged communities access to jobs, education, and healthcare. The op-ed states: 'It is simply irresponsible to build a park on a viable transit right-of-way in the biggest city in America.' State Senators James Sanders, Jr. and Joe Addabbo, Assembly Member Stacey Amato, and Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers, JoAnn Ariola, and Bob Holden support studies and funding for the rails-and-trails QueensLink alternative. The mayor’s plan faces criticism for ignoring public input and environmental justice.

The hearing, led by Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers (D-Queens), Christopher Banks (D-Brooklyn), and Rafael Salamanca Jr. (D-Bronx), focused on the DOT's progress under the Streets Plan, which mandates annual targets for protected bike lanes and bus lanes. Brooks-Powers objected to the Seagirt Boulevard bike lane, claiming DOT ignored community wishes, despite previously calling for more investment. Banks demanded removal of new protected bike lanes in East New York, citing parking and safety issues, though data showed fewer crashes and injuries. Salamanca criticized a Bronx street redesign for congestion, despite lower crash rates. He also accused DOT of neglecting communities of color, though data shows these areas receive more redesigns.
