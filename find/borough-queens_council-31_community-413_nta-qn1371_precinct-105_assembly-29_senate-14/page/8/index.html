No one asks the people.</p><p class=mb3>This op-ed, published April 4, 2024, covers the battle over the unused Rockaway Beach Branch rail line in southeastern Queens. The city, led by Mayor Adams, pushes a park-only project, funded by the U.S. Department of Transportation. Rick Horan, QueensLink’s executive director, argues the plan blocks a vital north-south rail corridor, denying disadvantaged communities access to jobs, education, and healthcare. The op-ed states: 'It is simply irresponsible to build a park on a viable transit right-of-way in the biggest city in America.' State Senators James Sanders, Jr. and Joe Addabbo, Assembly Member Stacey Amato, and Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers, JoAnn Ariola, and Bob Holden support studies and funding for the rails-and-trails QueensLink alternative. The mayor’s plan faces criticism for ignoring public input and environmental justice.

The hearing, led by Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers (D-Queens), Christopher Banks (D-Brooklyn), and Rafael Salamanca Jr. (D-Bronx), focused on the DOT's progress under the Streets Plan, which mandates annual targets for protected bike lanes and bus lanes. Brooks-Powers objected to the Seagirt Boulevard bike lane, claiming DOT ignored community wishes, despite previously calling for more investment. Banks demanded removal of new protected bike lanes in East New York, citing parking and safety issues, though data showed fewer crashes and injuries. Salamanca criticized a Bronx street redesign for congestion, despite lower crash rates. He also accused DOT of neglecting communities of color, though data shows these areas receive more redesigns. DOT officials defended their process, emphasizing community engagement and prioritizing high-need areas.

Council Member Chi Ossé (District 36) was mentioned, but only six of 51 council members responded to DOT’s call for safety project suggestions. The matter centers on the DOT’s report and council inaction: 'Out of 51 City Council members, only six responded to a request from DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez for recommended locations where street safety improvements should be made in their districts.' Mayor Adams slashed DOT’s budget and weakened projects, while council leaders deflected responsibility. Advocates like Jon Orcutt and Elizabeth Adams demanded decisive action, warning that delays and excuses cost lives.
