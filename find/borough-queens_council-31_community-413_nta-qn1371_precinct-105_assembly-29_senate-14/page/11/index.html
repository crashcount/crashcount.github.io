The bill, non-binding and currently under committee review, seeks to revive 3.5 miles of the former Rockaway Beach Branch, extending the M train from Rego Park to the Rockaways. The matter title calls for 'a deeper study of the QueensLink proposal to reactivate an old rail line.' Ariola and Brooks-Powers, both representing southeastern Queens, argue the project would benefit communities with poor subway access and reduce car dependency. Ariola stated, 'I think it’s necessary and I think that it would really benefit the communities.' Brooks-Powers emphasized the resolution as a priority for the Transportation Committee. The push comes as Mayor Adams advances the QueensWay park plan, raising concerns among transit advocates. The MTA says a new study is unnecessary, but supporters insist a thorough review is needed before converting the corridor to parkland.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as 'banning the sale of toll-beating covers and requiring DOT to report cars evading red lights and speed cameras with unreadable license plates,' passed through the transportation and infrastructure committee. Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, chair of the committee and sponsor, stated, 'It’s a safety issue, it’s an issue in terms of [city] revenue, it’s an issue in terms of ensuring we have safe streets and holding people accountable.' The city has lost $19 million this year due to unreadable plates. The new laws aim to close loopholes and restore accountability, but the risk to pedestrians and cyclists from untraceable drivers remains high.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Northern Boulevard bus lane project, stalled for months after Council Member Francisco Moya lobbied against it, finally began installation. Council Members Nantasha Williams and Selvena Brooks-Powers opposed the busways, calling for their elimination and citing business concerns. Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and other local officials pushed for even shorter hours. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez defended the busways, saying, 'strong bus infrastructure is a necessity.' Despite opposition, the city kept some busway hours intact, but caved to business interests, reducing protection for bus riders and vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled “City Council oversight inquiry into DOT street safety implementation and data transparency,” highlights DOT’s lack of documentation and reliance on signal retiming over physical improvements.
