Council Member Justin Brannan, representing District 47, called the law a 'no-brainer,' saying, 'Some of our biggest victories have been getting a traffic signal installed near a busy intersection near a school – that shouldn't be some huge colossal victory.' The law aims to bypass restrictive federal guidelines that block safety fixes. Council members and residents blasted DOT for slow, arbitrary action and years of denied requests, sometimes only reversed after tragedy. The Adams administration promises to redesign 1,000 more intersections, but families and advocates demand faster, decisive protection for children.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Wilfredo Florentino, Brooklyn Community Board 5, says, “Just placing cameras ain't gonna cut it.” The analysis shows that dangerous, wide arterials in communities of color drive up traffic violence.

This data certainly proves what we've been saying all along,"" -- Donovan J. Richards</p><p class=mb3>On February 14, 2022, Council Member Adrienne Adams (District 28) was mentioned in a Streetsblog analysis titled, "New York’s Speed Cameras Aren’t Racist — But the City’s Road Design Is." The report, not tied to a specific bill, reviewed automated enforcement and street design. It found speed cameras are evenly distributed and reduce crashes, but dangerous road design still puts lives at risk. Adams and other leaders called for more cameras and urgent street redesigns, echoing the article’s summary: 'Cameras have led to fewer crashes, injuries, and fatalities, but high numbers of tickets in some neighborhoods are attributed to unsafe road design, not camera placement.' Community voices stressed that automated enforcement helps, but cannot replace permanent fixes to deadly streets. The Department of Transportation’s lack of transparency on camera locations remains a concern. Adams and others demand systemic change to protect vulnerable New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Queens Borough President Donovan Richards called the crash a wake-up call, saying, 'There is nothing more imperative than street safety.' Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, chair of the Transportation Committee, called the deaths 'senseless' and blamed years of underinvestment and neglect.

Transportation Alternatives demanded urgent action: reclaiming street space from cars, redesigning intersections, upgrading bike lanes, and more.

The matter summary states: 'Governor Kathy Hochul's executive budget includes several changes to New York's congestion pricing program, which is expected to provide crucial revenue for transit upgrades.' Senator James Skoufis, mentioned in the hearing, pushed for credits for certain drivers. The bill is supported by MTA spokesperson Eugene Resnick and Governor Hochul’s office, who say it will ensure fairness. The MTA reports $4 million lost annually to toll evaders.

She supports expanding protected bike lanes, bus lanes, open streets, and ferry access, but has mixed views on dedicated bus lanes due to local bottlenecks.

He pushed back against senators seeking discounts for suburban drivers and city workers. Comrie warned that opening the door to more exemptions would undermine the law’s intent and threaten revenue for transit.
