Mastro is known for opposing bike lanes and congestion pricing, having fought the Prospect Park West bike lane and represented New Jersey against congestion pricing. Council Members Sandy Nurse and Tiffany Caban voiced strong opposition, with Caban declaring, 'No way in hell I vote to confirm Randy Mastro.' Joe Borelli, a congestion pricing opponent, supported the move, saying, 'I want more people who think like me on congestion pricing in City Hall.' The appointment signals a car-first agenda. Council resistance is fierce. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, bus riders—face greater risk if Mastro’s priorities shape city policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Thirty-one organizations endorsed Brewer’s approach, calling Holden’s bill “ineffective, dangerous, expensive, short-sighted, and bureaucratically complicated.” Council Members Rita Joseph and Sandy Nurse also withdrew support.
