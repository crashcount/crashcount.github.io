The bill required the Department of Transportation to identify intersections with high pedestrian crash rates and install curb extensions—prohibiting parking within 15 feet of crosswalks—at a minimum of five such intersections in each borough per year. The measure was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. Curb extensions are designed to increase pedestrian visibility and reduce deadly conflicts at crossings, directly targeting systemic dangers faced by people on foot.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
