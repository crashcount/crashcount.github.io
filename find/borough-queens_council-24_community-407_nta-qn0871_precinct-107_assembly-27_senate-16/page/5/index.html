The bill, titled 'Council Bill Could Chill Citizen Reporting That Dramatically Boosted Idling Enforcement,' would give the city broad power to disqualify public participants from reporting idling, reduce fines for vehicles with anti-idling tech, and halve citizen bounties. It also allows school buses to idle up to 15 minutes and imposes a new code of conduct for enforcers. The Adams administration supports capping bounties but wants higher fines. Opponents, including the New York Clean Air Collective, say the bill 'weaponizes rules that chill participation' and will 'watch while companies like Con Ed, Verizon, and Amazon steal New York’s breath.'

In a letter to MTA CEO Janno Lieber, Liu wrote, 'I demand the MTA explain how this plan is overall an increase and expansion of bus service in Queens as opposed to an actually disguised cost reduction measure.' Liu highlighted the planned elimination of the QM3 bus and reductions to the QM5, warning of increased wait times and higher fares for commuters. He argued that rerouting and service cuts would isolate seniors, strand students, and hurt businesses. Liu’s stance: the redesign prioritizes cost-cutting over real improvements.

Mayor Adams stalls. Council Members Hudson and Joseph back the plan. Riders wait. Buses crawl. Working-class New Yorkers bear the brunt. The city delays. Streets stay dangerous. Justice deferred.</p><p class=mb3>On July 10, 2024, a coalition of transit advocates and labor unions renewed calls for a Flatbush Avenue bus lane. The campaign, not tied to a specific council bill, has drawn support from Council Members Crystal Hudson and Rita Joseph. The matter, described as a 'no-brainer solution,' highlights slow bus speeds—often under 5 mph—and the urgent need for safer, faster transit. Jolyse Race of Riders Alliance stressed the economic justice at stake, noting bus riders earn half as much as car owners. Mayor Eric Adams has withheld support, citing community engagement and raising concerns about gentrification. The Department of Transportation's plans have stalled under his administration. Healthcare workers and union leaders spoke of missed shifts and unreliable service. Advocates now plan to survey bus riders to show support. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the campaign centers the needs of vulnerable bus riders and pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, highlighted in the report 'Realm of Possibility,' aims to 'lift some of the bureaucratic and cost hurdles faced by the largely volunteer open streets groups.' Key elements include lowering or waiving liability insurance for small events, standardizing maintenance agreements, and launching a 'Public Space Academy' to train organizers. Jim Burke, organizer for 34th Avenue, called for removing barriers to make the program equitable. Gib Veconi of Prospect Heights Neighborhood Development Council and Jackson Chabot of Open Plans both praised the reforms, citing burdensome permit processes and high costs as threats to open streets. The proposal responds to advocates' warnings that city policies have stifled car-free spaces, risking the loss of vital corridors for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2024, the New York State legislative session ended without passing a replacement funding plan for the MTA after Governor Kathy Hochul paused congestion pricing. The matter, described as 'Albany pumps the brakes on MTA funding plan in rebuke of Hochul’s move to ditch congestion pricing,' left the MTA without the $1 billion annual revenue congestion pricing would have provided. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins announced the session’s close without a deal. Lawmakers including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris, State Sen. John Liu, Assemblyman Harvey Epstein, and Assemblyman Tony Simone criticized the governor’s decision and the proposed IOU bailout. Gounardes said, 'I cannot in good conscience ratify a decision that will eliminate a significant, dedicated revenue source for the MTA’s capital plan.' The pause leaves the city’s transit future—and the safety of those who rely on it—uncertain.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
