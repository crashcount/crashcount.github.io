Mandates linger in outer areas. Progress, but not full victory. Some districts carved out exceptions. Housing and parking no longer clash in core neighborhoods. Vulnerable road users still face cars in many places.</p><p class=mb3>On February 26, 2025, the City Council approved Mayor Adams's 'City of Yes' rezoning. The bill divided the city into zones: the Manhattan core, an inner transit zone with no parking mandates, an outer transit zone with reduced mandates, and areas beyond where mandates mostly remain. The matter summary states, 'The final plan did not eliminate parking mandates citywide but divided the city into zones.' Council Member Crystal Hudson pushed to eliminate mandates in all her districts. Council Member Shahana Hanif opposed carve-outs. Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez called parking mandates 'a concession to cars that we don’t need and can’t afford.' Council Member Sandy Nurse’s district saw mandates shaped by community board amendments, not her advocacy. Dan Garodnick, Department of City Planning chair, said, 'parking and housing are no longer coming into conflict in the parts of New York City that are well-served by transit.' The bill passed after compromises, leaving mandates in some areas and progress in others. No direct safety impact assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Its summary reads: 'Establishes in the city of New York a bicycle lane safety program to enforce certain restrictions on the use of bicycle lanes and/or protected bicycle lanes by means of bicycle lane photo devices.' Brad Hoylman-Sigal leads as primary sponsor, joined by Jabari Brisport, Kristen Gonzalez, Liz Krueger, Jessica Ramos, and Julia Salazar as co-sponsors. These lawmakers seek to use automated cameras to enforce bike lane rules, targeting drivers who endanger cyclists by blocking protected lanes. The bill does not blame victims.

The official summary calls for 'job creation, green industry development, and community benefits.' Nurse, a key sponsor, said, 'It’s really important that people understand this was a community-envisioned process.' She stressed the need for long-term careers and affordable living. The plan includes public space and streetscape improvements, aiming to boost pedestrian safety and accessibility.

The bill, titled 'Creates a pedestrian safety rating system for motor vehicles,' would require the Department of Motor Vehicles to post these ratings online. Primary sponsor Andrew Gounardes leads a slate of co-sponsors: Leroy Comrie, Michael Gianaris, Brad Hoylman-Sigal, Robert Jackson, Liz Krueger, Zellnor Myrie, Gustavo Rivera, Julia Salazar, Luis R. Sepúlveda, and Toby Ann Stavisky. The bill aims to expose the risk cars pose to people on foot. By making safety data public, it puts pressure on automakers and drivers alike. The measure has not yet moved to committee or received a vote.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danger lingers for all outside a car.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2024, New York’s legislature ended its session without plugging the MTA’s multi-billion-dollar budget hole. The gap opened when Governor Hochul halted Manhattan’s congestion pricing. The bill, discussed but not passed, would have replaced lost revenue—$1 billion a year meant for transit upgrades. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, mentioned in the debate, said, 'Our conference is reticent to commit a billion dollars annually for the next 15 years without having some understanding in place as to how we're going to deal with congestion as well.' Lawmakers could not agree on new taxes or a legislative IOU. The inaction leaves critical MTA projects—like electric buses and accessible stations—at risk. Vulnerable road users lose most: less transit means more cars, more danger, and fewer safe options for those on foot, bike, or bus.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
