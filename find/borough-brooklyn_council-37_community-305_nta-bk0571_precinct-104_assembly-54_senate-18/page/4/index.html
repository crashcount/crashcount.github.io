Police say Yarimi struck an Uber, flipped, and plowed into the family as they crossed the street. The boy remains in critical condition after losing a kidney. The article quotes City Comptroller Brad Lander: 'He is still in critical condition. He lost one kidney but they are hopeful about his prognosis.' Yarimi faces multiple counts of manslaughter and assault. The crash also injured an Uber driver and a second family.

The matter summary states, 'The final plan did not eliminate parking mandates citywide but divided the city into zones.' Council Member Crystal Hudson pushed to eliminate mandates in all her districts. Council Member Shahana Hanif opposed carve-outs. Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez called parking mandates 'a concession to cars that we don’t need and can’t afford.'
