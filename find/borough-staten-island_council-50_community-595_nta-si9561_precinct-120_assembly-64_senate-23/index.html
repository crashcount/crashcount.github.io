The Senate passed the measure 38-21; three city senators—Stephen Chan, Andrew Lanza, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton—voted no. The Assembly passed it 110-31, with nine city lawmakers—Alec Brook-Krasny, Lester Chang, Simcha Eichenstein, Michael Novakhov, Stacey Pheffer Amato, Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Reilly, David Weprin, Kalman Yeger—opposing. The Streetsblog NYC article, 'Ye Shall Know Their Names! Meet the Dirty Dozen City Pols Who Voted Against Speed Camera Program,' quotes lawmakers dismissing speed cameras as revenue grabs or burdens. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action, so no direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists can be assessed.'

Streets clear. Delays drop. Fewer cars mean more space for people. The city breathes. Vulnerable road users gain ground. Data shows real relief, not empty promises.</p><p class=mb3>On June 18, 2025, the Regional Plan Association released a report on congestion pricing’s impact. The study, covered by Barbara Russo-Lennon, found a 25% drop in Manhattan traffic jams, with smaller but real declines in the Bronx and New Jersey. The report states: 'Congestion pricing is delivering clear benefits, saving people time and the aggravation of being stuck in traffic.' Council Member Frank Morano and State Sen. Jessica Scarcella-Spanton criticized the program, citing Staten Island’s smaller gains and health concerns. MTA Chair Janno Lieber defended the policy, pointing to improved drive times and transit use. Safety analysts note congestion pricing reduces car traffic, lowers crash risk for pedestrians and cyclists, encourages mode shift, and supports safer, more equitable streets. The program’s future now rests with the federal courts.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move followed an alleged attempted rape and was justified by District Attorney Mike McMahon and Borough President Vito Fossella as a crime deterrent. The Alliance to Save Silver Lake Park and residents opposed the decision, calling it a 'baseless theory of crime prevention' and highlighting the loss of a protected bike lane and accessible space for people with disabilities. Council Member Kamillah Hanks, who first supported the return of cars, later suggested a weekend car-free compromise, acknowledging the community’s need for open space. Advocates pointed to Staten Island’s high crash rates and demanded better lighting and police, not more cars. The process was rushed, with no data backing safety claims.

The road has been car-free since the pandemic, serving as a haven for walkers and cyclists. The Parks Department, once supportive of a car-free park, agreed to the reopening after political pressure. The matter centers on whether car access improves safety after a recent attempted rape. Advocates, including Transportation Alternatives, argue, 'Allowing cars in Silver Lake is not about public safety; it's about driver convenience.' Locals warn that reintroducing cars endangers children and vulnerable users, undermining the park’s safety and purpose. A petition and rally oppose the move, highlighting that traffic violence poses a greater threat than rare park crimes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Violators face civil penalties up to $50. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams leads as primary sponsor, joined by Council Members Holden, Vernikov, Narcisse, Moya, Schulman, Louis, Hanks, Brannan, and Zhuang. The bill does not address the root causes of cyclist injuries: reckless drivers, speeding cars, and deadly streets. Instead, it shifts responsibility onto those most at risk, leaving the city’s dangerous roads unchanged.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Reinvent Albany called the measure 'contrary to notions of basic fairness' and a '$22 million handout' to a special interest. The Traffic Mobility Review Board had already rejected such exemptions. The group warned that multiple exemption bills could cost the public $100 million yearly and force higher tolls for everyone else. Neither Pheffer Amato nor Scarcella-Spanton commented.

Brown questioned new railcars for the borough after lawmakers opposed congestion pricing. Officials call his stance bureaucratic ignorance. The fight spotlights power struggles over transit and rider needs.</p><p class=mb3>On August 3, 2024, seven Staten Island officials, including Council Minority Leader Joseph Borelli (District 51), called for the removal of MTA board member Norman Brown. Their letter to Governor Hochul followed Brown’s June comments suggesting Staten Island lose its promised 75 new R211S railcars because local lawmakers opposed congestion pricing. The letter, signed by Assemblymen Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Tannousis, Michael Reilly, Borough President Vito Fossella, State Senator Andrew Lanza, Councilman David Carr, and Borelli, called Brown’s remarks 'a masterclass in bureaucratic ignorance.' Brown said he would welcome removal. The new railcars would replace aging trains from the 1970s. The matter exposes deep rifts over transit funding and priorities, with Staten Island riders caught in the crossfire.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
