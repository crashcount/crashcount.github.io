The article asks, 'But does he care? No.' Carr, representing District 50, opposes speed cameras, red light cameras, and bus lane enforcement. When confronted, he shrugged and drove off. Safety analysts warn: when elected officials ignore repeated violations, they undermine safety laws and embolden reckless drivers. This keeps streets perilous for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Their votes keep streets exposed. Pedestrians and cyclists lose a shield. Reckless drivers win. The city’s most basic defense—rejected. The toll will be measured in blood, not words.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13 and June 17, 2025, the New York State Senate and Assembly voted on reauthorizing New York City's school zone speed camera program. The Senate passed the measure 38-21; three city senators—Stephen Chan, Andrew Lanza, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton—voted no. The Assembly passed it 110-31, with nine city lawmakers—Alec Brook-Krasny, Lester Chang, Simcha Eichenstein, Michael Novakhov, Stacey Pheffer Amato, Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Reilly, David Weprin, Kalman Yeger—opposing. The Streetsblog NYC article, 'Ye Shall Know Their Names! Meet the Dirty Dozen City Pols Who Voted Against Speed Camera Program,' quotes lawmakers dismissing speed cameras as revenue grabs or burdens. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action, so no direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists can be assessed.' Still, the votes signal disregard for proven tools that protect those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The study, covered by Barbara Russo-Lennon, found a 25% drop in Manhattan traffic jams, with smaller but real declines in the Bronx and New Jersey. The report states: 'Congestion pricing is delivering clear benefits, saving people time and the aggravation of being stuck in traffic.' Council Member Frank Morano and State Sen. Jessica Scarcella-Spanton criticized the program, citing Staten Island’s smaller gains and health concerns. MTA Chair Janno Lieber defended the policy, pointing to improved drive times and transit use. Safety analysts note congestion pricing reduces car traffic, lowers crash risk for pedestrians and cyclists, encourages mode shift, and supports safer, more equitable streets. The program’s future now rests with the federal courts.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan allows cameras on seven bridges and two tunnels, ticketing drivers who exceed speed limits. Fines start at $50 for a first offense, rising to $75 and $100 for repeat violations within 18 months. Governor Hochul's office called the program 'one more way the governor is working to improve safety on our roads and bridges for workers and travelers alike.' MTA Bridges and Tunnels President Catherine Sheridan said, 'We want to make sure that our maintenance workers and contractors are safe.' The program, part of the $254 billion state budget, will be reviewed again in 2031.

The matter centers on whether car access improves safety after a recent attempted rape.

It aims to repeal congestion pricing, expand the MTA board from sixteen to seventeen members, and require a forensic audit of the authority. The matter title reads: 'Relates to repealing congestion pricing (Part A); commissioning an independent audit of the metropolitan transportation authority (Part B); and conducting an environmental impact study (Part C).' Scarcella-Spanton is the primary sponsor. The bill’s text does not address the safety of pedestrians, cyclists, or other vulnerable road users. No safety analyst has assessed its impact. The city’s most at-risk remain unprotected.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They warned it would drain funds, raise tolls, and reward special interests over public safety.</p><p class=mb3>On January 16, 2025, Reinvent Albany, a good government watchdog, issued a statement opposing a bill from Assembly Member Stacey Pheffer Amato and Senator Jessica Scarcella-Spanton. The bill seeks to exempt NYPD officers, even off-duty, from paying congestion pricing tolls in Manhattan’s central business district. Reinvent Albany called the measure 'contrary to notions of basic fairness' and a '$22 million handout' to a special interest. The Traffic Mobility Review Board had already rejected such exemptions. The group warned that multiple exemption bills could cost the public $100 million yearly and force higher tolls for everyone else. Neither Pheffer Amato nor Scarcella-Spanton commented. The watchdog urged lawmakers to serve the many, not the powerful few.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets paid.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News (2024-12-16) reports that NYPD Officer Diana Todaro was arrested for driving while intoxicated after crashing her car with three colleagues as passengers. The crash happened at Huguenot Ave. and Drumgoole Ave. West, Staten Island, after a precinct holiday party. Todaro admitted, "I had three or four drinks. My life is over." The impact triggered airbags and left her with a forehead gash. All three passengers, also officers, were placed on desk duty and may face charges for allowing Todaro to drive or being unfit for duty. The article notes this was one of three NYPD DWI arrests in four days, highlighting a pattern during holiday party season. The incident raises questions about internal discipline and the risks posed by impaired driving, even among law enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
