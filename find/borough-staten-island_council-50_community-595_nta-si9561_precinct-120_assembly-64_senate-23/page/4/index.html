Danger remains for those on foot and bike.</p><p class=mb3>Int 1142-2023 was introduced in the Committee on Public Safety on August 3, 2023. The bill required the NYPD to run tow pound facilities with enough capacity to deter illegal parking and traffic violations. It also mandated annual public reports on tow pound use and enforcement, disaggregated by precinct. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to police department tow pound capacity.' Council Members Kamillah Hanks (primary sponsor), Oswald Feliz, Sandra Ung, Lincoln Restler, Shaun Abreu, Farah N. Louis, Mercedes Narcisse, and Amanda Farías sponsored the bill. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, with no further action. No safety analyst assessed the impact for vulnerable road users. The city’s failure to expand towing leaves illegal cars on sidewalks and crosswalks. Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable road users face more risk as drivers dodge tolls and gridlock deepens.</p><p class=mb3>On July 29, 2023, Councilwoman Kamillah Hanks (District 49) joined Staten Island’s push against the MTA’s congestion pricing plan. The matter, titled 'Staten Island’s congestion-pricing fight spurs new push to leave NYC,' centers on legal action and renewed secession talk. Hanks, a centrist Democrat, opposes the plan, citing 'costs, traffic problems and pollution.' She said, 'Historically, Staten Island gets the short end of the stick.' Rep. Nicole Malliotakis and Council Minority Leader Joe Borelli plan to sue the MTA, aiming to block the $23 toll for drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street. Councilwoman Diana Ayala echoed concerns about exclusion from decision-making. No safety analyst has formally assessed the impact, but officials warn that increased traffic and pollution could endanger pedestrians and cyclists as drivers seek toll-free routes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

NYPD Transportation Bureau’s Michael Pilecki reported arrests for forged plates fell 11 percent from last year, while summonses rose just 0.6 percent. The hearing spotlighted two bills from Council Member Oswald Feliz to raise fines for using or selling fake plates, both widely supported, including by the NYPD. The matter summary: 'NYPD claims it has stepped up its efforts to summons and arrest car drivers who cover or deface their plate, or drive with a fake temporary tag, but its own statistics show that the effort has not continued into this year.' Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers and Kamillah Hanks did not comment. Activists and officials noted DOT’s automated cameras failed to bill 1.2 million violations last year due to temp tags, leaving dangerous drivers unaccountable. The city’s weak enforcement leaves vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill aimed to amend city law to require the Department of Transportation to finish all street resurfacing work within two weeks. If more time was needed, the department would have to notify the community, stating the reason and new timeline. The matter summary reads: 'ensure that all work associated with the resurfacing of any street is finalized within 2 weeks from the start of work.' Council Member Diana I. Ayala sponsored the bill, joined by thirty other members. The bill was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023, without a vote. No safety analyst reviewed the impact, but torn-up streets are a known threat to pedestrians and cyclists. The bill is dead. The hazard lives on.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
