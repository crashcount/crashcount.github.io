The Council has a bill to ban standing or parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and to build daylighting barriers at scale; it’s laid over in committee, but it would clear the sight lines that keep people alive. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Bill details</a>. Add leading pedestrian intervals and concrete at the worst spots on <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>19 Avenue</a> and <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Bay Parkway</a>.

The city can make side streets 20 mph. Every mile per hour matters when steel meets flesh. Use it. And stop the repeat offenders. A state bill, <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>, would force drivers who rack up violations to install speed‑limiting devices. Senator Steve Chan voted yes in committee. This is how you keep the worst drivers from killing again. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Committee vote</a>.</p><h3 id=voices-from-the-record>Voices from the record</h3><p>“Criminal charges for him were still pending,” police told <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-investigating-separate-collisions-that-left-2-dead-teen-critical-early-tuesday>Gothamist</a> after a driver hit a moped and killed the rider in Brooklyn.

Despite this, his administration 'put the brakes on a potentially life-saving road redesign,' favoring business interests. Attorney Peter Beadle notes, 'they had a plan ready to go and then it was pulled back.'
