The incident, reported by Streetsblog NYC, left the area between Four Winds Playground and the Kissena Velodrome stripped and scarred. The Kissena Park Connector, part of the Destination Greenways plan, is a vital east-west bike route. Volunteers, who planted the saplings since 2022, found ATV tracks at the scene. Council Member Sandra Ung, a supporter of the greenway and volunteer efforts, urged witnesses to report vandalism. She told NY1, 'Anyone witnessing any vandalism should report it.' The NYPD and Parks Department have investigated but offered no comment. The destruction leaves greenway users—cyclists and pedestrians—more exposed, stripping away natural protection and undermining years of community effort.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
