The bill sits in committee, awaiting further action. Complete streets mean curb cuts, protected lanes, and clear crossings. The measure targets the deadly status quo. It puts people before speed.

Riders, mostly Black, women, and low-income, suffer slow, unreliable service. Delays cost jobs and wages. The city’s inaction keeps streets dangerous and buses crawling.</p><p class=mb3>On December 12, 2024, advocates released a report on Flatbush Avenue bus lanes. The report, from Riders Alliance and Pratt Center, surveyed 1,800 riders. It found nearly 70 percent use the bus to shop, eat, or seek entertainment. The matter highlights that 'bus service is a boon for business.' Council Member actions are not directly cited, but Mayor Adams faces criticism for failing to deliver on bus lane promises. DOT spokesperson Vin Barone said redesigning Flatbush could 'speed up bus service...while also enhancing pedestrian safety.' The report exposes how slow buses hurt working-class, Black, and female riders—many lose pay or jobs due to delays. Business opposition to bus lanes remains, despite evidence that most shoppers arrive by transit or foot. The city’s phased approach leaves much of Flatbush waiting, while riders pay the price in time and safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The analysis, covered by Streetsblog NYC, finds that open streets—car-free corridors—have about half the vacant storefronts of car-filled streets. The report states: 'vibrant public spaces are key to the success of local businesses.' City officials like Ya-Ting Liu, chief public realm officer, and volunteers such as Alex Morano and Brent Bovenzi, praised the program's impact. Bovenzi noted, 'the program is shrinking because too much of the burden falls upon volunteer labor.' The Open Streets program, now permanent, covers over 130 locations but relies heavily on volunteers. Advocates urge the city to invest more, as the data shows people-centric design drives economic recovery and safer, more vibrant neighborhoods.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, sponsored by Council Member Erik Bottcher (District 3), passed through committee and aims to address neglected, broken, and obstructive newspaper boxes. The bill summary states it will 'establish clear guidelines and help ensure that our local publications get to maintain their newsracks while also helping to alleviate sidewalk congestion.' Bottcher’s action brings new requirements: owners must display contact information, and the Department of Transportation gains authority to set size, shape, and material standards. Sandra Ung, another council member, noted that without oversight, newsracks become a blight. The law seeks to reduce sidewalk clutter, making streets less hazardous for pedestrians and other vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The MTA board is set to vote on the $9 toll to enter Manhattan’s business district, effective January 5. The matter, described as 'NYC congestion toll would hit neighborhoods with some of worst vacancy rates in city,' has drawn fire from both Republicans and Democrats. Rozic said, 'Affordability is really the most important thing that voters, that constituents, that people on the street, talk to us about... keep the pause.' Opponents argue the toll will worsen economic pain in areas with high storefront vacancy. Despite the uproar, the policy’s impact on pedestrian and cyclist safety remains unaddressed in this debate. Vulnerable road users are left out of the political crossfire.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
