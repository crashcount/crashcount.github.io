Prosecutors said Pena was drunk, high on cocaine and marijuana, and driving 83 mph in a 25 mph zone when he ran a red light and struck Diaz’s BMW. Surveillance footage showed the Mercedes 'barreled through an East Elmhurst intersection' at 4:15 a.m. Diaz, headed to work at LaGuardia, died at the scene. Pena refused a breath test; a blood draw later confirmed drug use. He was charged with vehicular manslaughter, DWI, and refusal to submit to testing, but posted $50,000 bail. The article highlights family grief and outrage at bail laws, quoting Diaz’s brother: 'Pena will walk the streets for a $50,000 bail... Justin will never walk the streets again.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crash killed 23-year-old Justin Diaz. Surveillance video showed Pena's Mercedes plowing into Diaz's BMW, which then struck a parked minivan. Pena refused a breath test and was uninjured. Two Mercedes passengers were hospitalized. The article notes, 'The FDNY stated Pena will be suspended without pay for 28 days during the investigation.' Video evidence indicated Diaz entered the intersection legally, with the pedestrian signal allowing crossing.

The bill was introduced on September 12, 2024, and referred to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure the same day. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting the operation of shared electric scooter systems on certain streets in the Borough of Queens.' Council Members Lynn C. Schulman (District 29, primary sponsor) and Sandra Ung (District 20, co-sponsor) back the measure. The bill would stop shared e-scooter organizations from operating in a dense, contested part of Queens. No safety analysis was provided. The legislation draws a hard line on who can move—and how—on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the improvement and maintenance of medians through the planting of vegetation or use in stormwater management," requires the city to improve at least one mile of paved medians every two years until 2046. The Department of Transportation, Parks, and Environmental Protection must add planted medians, tree beds, or stormwater infrastructure, focusing on high-priority investment areas. Council Member Shekar Krishnan sponsored the bill, joined by Feliz, Avilés, Nurse, Banks, Restler, Ung, Schulman, Holden, Hudson, and Yeger. The Council passed the bill with broad support, though the mayor returned it unsigned. The law mandates annual progress reports and public tracking of improved medians and responsible agencies.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Riders see only risk.</p><p class=mb3>On July 22, 2024, State Senator John Liu, representing District 16 and serving on the Senate's transportation committee, publicly opposed the MTA’s pending redesign of Queens bus routes. In a letter to MTA CEO Janno Lieber, Liu wrote, 'I demand the MTA explain how this plan is overall an increase and expansion of bus service in Queens as opposed to an actually disguised cost reduction measure.' Liu highlighted the planned elimination of the QM3 bus and reductions to the QM5, warning of increased wait times and higher fares for commuters. He argued that rerouting and service cuts would isolate seniors, strand students, and hurt businesses. Liu’s stance: the redesign prioritizes cost-cutting over real improvements. The MTA insists the plan means more and faster service, but Liu and local riders remain unconvinced.

The Parks Department has not started work on nine segments, despite six being fully funded. Council Member Sandra Ung has prioritized funding for her district’s portion, stating, 'I am proud that today nearly the entire greenway through District 20 is fully funded.' Advocates like John Kelly and Joby Jacob push for transparency and urgency, warning, 'Now is the time to ensure that this great work isn't watered down or indefinitely delayed.' The Parks Department cites multi-agency involvement for the holdup. Meanwhile, existing paths crumble, forcing cyclists and pedestrians into traffic. The lack of progress leaves vulnerable road users exposed and the promise of safe passage unfulfilled.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
