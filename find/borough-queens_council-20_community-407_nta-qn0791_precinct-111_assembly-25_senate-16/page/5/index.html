Despite camera enforcement, violations remain rampant. Council Member Peter Koo opposed the Flushing busway, but it survived legal and political attacks.

The MTA has not taken a side.</p><p class=mb3>On September 24, 2023, Council Member Christopher Marte joined eight other elected officials in urging the MTA to exempt dollar vans from the upcoming congestion pricing plan. The letter, signed by Marte and state legislators, was sent to the Traffic Mobility Review Board. The officials wrote, 'Commuter vans offer the Chinese communities in Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn a much-needed service that is not being provided by other forms of public transportation: safe, language-accessible, and culturally competent means for people to access jobs, resources, and family.' They argue that tolling these vans—serving Flatbush Avenue, eastern Queens, and the city’s Chinatowns—would raise fares and cut off vital connections for Asian New Yorkers. Assembly Member Grace Lee said, 'They should be exempt from tolls under the congestion pricing plan.' The MTA has not taken a position on the exemption.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
