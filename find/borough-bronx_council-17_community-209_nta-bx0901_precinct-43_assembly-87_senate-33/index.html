A 71-year-old woman driving the sedan was injured, with chest pain noted; other occupants were listed with unspecified injuries. According to the police report, the contributing factor was “Driver Inattention/Distraction.” That driver error appears across the involved parties and undercuts any safe passage at this intersection. No other contributing factors were listed. The impact points—SUV left front bumper into the sedan’s right front quarter and doors—show a hard lateral hit.

Residents left waiting.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News (2025-07-18) reports thirteen Bronx officials urged Governor Hochul and the state DOT to boost community input on the Cross Bronx Expressway redesign. The state may build a connecting road across the Bronx River to keep traffic moving during bridge repairs. Critics, including environmental and transit groups, say this would widen the expressway, bringing more traffic and pollution. The officials' letter asks the state to 'fully consider' options without the new road. DOT spokesman Rolando Infante said no decision has been made. The $900 million project includes capping sections with parks and green space.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
