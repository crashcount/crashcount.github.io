The dead do not get a second chance. The living carry scars.</p><p>Luis Cruz, 49, stepped out of his car on India Street.

E-bikes killed one. Cars and SUVs left a trail of broken bodies—twelve moderate injuries, none fatal this year, but the threat is constant. Motorcycles and mopeds add to the toll. The street does not care what you drive. It only takes.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-failed-to-do>What Leaders Have Done—and Failed to Do</h3><p>The city has tools. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets New York lower speed limits to 20 mph. The council could act. They have not. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. The mayor says, &ldquo;one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.&rdquo; The numbers say otherwise. The silence from local leaders is louder than any promise.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day of delay is another chance for death. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets that put people first.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another body in the road.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Pedestrians and cyclists reclaim space.</p><p class=mb3>On June 24, 2025, NYPD and the 84th Precinct enforced a sweep against illegal placard parking under the Brooklyn Queens Expressway at Tillary and Navy streets. The action, coordinated with Council Member Lincoln Restler, followed community complaints. Officers issued 40 summonses and towed 10 vehicles. The NYPD stated, "Following community complaints about illegal parking... the NYPD Transportation Bureau and Council Member Lincoln Restler coordinated... to address the parking condition and clear the area." Council Members Restler and Crystal Hudson represent the district but did not claim credit. The crackdown targets city employees who abused parking privileges for years. Safety analysts note: "Cracking down on placard abuse reduces illegal parking, especially in bike lanes, crosswalks, and sidewalks, improving safety and accessibility for pedestrians and cyclists by reclaiming public space and reducing driver entitlement."</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal, discussed at a heated community board meeting, remains active and is set for installation after summer repaving. Council Member Tiffany Caban, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, and Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas endorsed the plan in a letter, stating it would 'protect pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers while making our streets safer and less congested.' DOT spokesman Will Livingston said the design improves safety and supports local businesses. Despite opposition from some business owners, the plan moves forward. Safety analysts note: 'Protected bike lanes are proven to reduce injuries and fatalities for cyclists and pedestrians, encourage mode shift, and improve street equity by reallocating space from cars to vulnerable users.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city cannot touch the lane until August. Cyclists and pedestrians keep their lifeline. The fight for safe streets holds, for now.</p><p class=mb3>On June 18, 2025, Judge Carolyn Walker-Dialo issued a judicial order halting the removal of the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane. The case, reported by Kirstyn Brendlen in Brooklyn Paper, centers on the city's attempt to replace the parking-protected lane with an unprotected painted lane. The matter states: 'The city is enjoined and restrained from implementing and commencing/performing any construction or other acts related to the Removal at least until a hearing scheduled for August.' Council Member Lincoln Restler said he was not notified of the plans. Transportation Alternatives and Baruch Herzfeld filed the lawsuit, arguing the city failed to analyze the effects or consult the community. Transportation Alternatives called the city's plan illegal and praised the court's decision. Preventing the removal preserves safe infrastructure for cyclists and encourages active transportation, supporting mode shift and safety in numbers for vulnerable road users. The next hearing is set for August.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

This action followed a lawsuit by cycling advocates and residents, as reported by BKReader. The matter states: 'A judge issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) blocking New York City from removing portions of a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue.' Council Member Lincoln Restler supported the TRO, submitting an affidavit and stressing the legal requirement for community notification. Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives called the removal 'unwarranted, unlawful, reckless.' Safety analysts warn that removing the bike lane strips away vital protection, discourages cycling, and exposes both cyclists and pedestrians to more danger from cars. The TRO stands until a court hearing later this summer, keeping the safety improvements in place for now.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The case, covered by Streetsblog NYC, cites City Administrative Code Section 19-101.2, which requires proper notice before removing a bike lane. The matter summary states, "Plaintiffs, including Transportation Alternatives and Williamsburg resident Baruch Herzfeld, seek a temporary restraining order, claiming that cyclists would be irreparably harmed by the loss of a safe route." Council Member Lincoln Restler, author of the notification law, filed an affidavit supporting the plaintiffs. The Department of Transportation claims the lane will shift, not disappear. The safety analyst notes: "The event text describes a legal threat but does not specify any policy or legislative action, so its direct impact on pedestrian and cyclist safety cannot be determined." The case is pending a judicial ruling.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move followed requests from Williamsburg residents and came after a recent town hall. The mayor’s statement read: 'he is taking away the bike lane on Bedford Avenue... to better reflect community feedback.' Council Member Lincoln Restler condemned the decision, calling it 'purely a political decision' and warning it would 'lead to more tragic crashes.' No council bill number or committee was involved; Adams acted alone. Removing the protected bike lane reduces safety for cyclists, discourages cycling, and undermines street equity.

The crash left the cyclist injured and exposed the ongoing risks faced by those outside a car’s steel shell.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill, titled “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to a discounted bike share rate for public school students aged 16 or older,” would require the Department of Transportation to set a discounted rate for eligible students. Council Member Christopher Marte leads as primary sponsor, joined by Gale A. Brewer, Shahana K. Hanif, Sandy Nurse, Linda Lee, Keith Powers, Lincoln Restler, Chi A. Ossé, Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, Althea V. Stevens, and Farah N. Louis. The measure aims to make cycling more accessible for youth, but the city must ensure safe streets as more young riders join traffic. The bill remains under committee review.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No bill number or committee was cited. The matter: 'The Bedford Avenue protected bike lane is facing opposition from key figures in the Brooklyn Democratic machine.' Council Members Lincoln Restler and Chi Oss support the lane. Former Adams chief of staff Frank Carone and Brooklyn party chair Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn lead the opposition. Mayor Eric Adams calls for listening to bike lane critics. Challenger Sabrina Gates wants the lane rerouted. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez defends the lane’s safety record. A safety analyst warns: 'Threats to protected bike lanes undermine safe infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians, potentially reducing mode shift and safety in numbers while increasing risk for vulnerable road users.' The fight is not just political. It is life and death for those outside a car.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, reported by Streetsblog NYC, was not a bill or vote but a personal shift. Sohn said, 'It disconnects you from the life of the city.' She praised Albany’s walkability and called car ownership a hassle. Governor Hochul also spoke on the need for walkable cities and announced a $400-million downtown plan. No committee, bill number, or formal legislative action is tied to this event. According to safety analysts, this is an individual choice and a vague policy gesture; without concrete legislative changes, there is no measurable system-wide safety impact for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Bill forces reckless drivers to install speed limiters. Lawmakers act after years of carnage. Streets remain perilous for walkers and riders until the law takes hold.</p><p class=mb3>On May 21, 2025, the Senate Transportation Committee advanced bill S4045B, known as the Stop Super Speeders bill. The measure passed with just two 'no' votes out of 13. The bill requires speed-limiting devices in cars of drivers with six or more camera-issued speeding tickets in a year. Streetsblog NYC reports, 'A bill that would prevent the most-reckless drivers from speeding easily moved forward on Tuesday.' Senator Andrew Gounardes sponsors the bill, emphasizing it targets the most dangerous drivers. Assembly sponsor Emily Gallagher raised concerns about cost and judicial bias, but stressed that speeding endangers everyone. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins backs the bill's safety focus. According to safety analysts, restricting repeat speeders directly tackles a major threat to pedestrians and cyclists, likely reducing crashes and making streets safer citywide.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
