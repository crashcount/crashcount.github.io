The bill, discussed in May 2022, aims to allow 24/7 automated enforcement and add penalties for repeat offenders, including registration suspensions. The matter summary: 'DOT officials said they’re negotiating amendments to Gounardes’ bill that would further crack down on reckless drivers, including a provision to let the city install cameras to ticket cars in bike lanes.' Gounardes stressed urgency: 'We cannot leave Albany without reauthorizing the speed cameras.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez’s late push for home rule caused confusion, risking the program’s renewal. The bill is under negotiation as the legislative session nears its end. Eleven people died on city streets that week, underscoring the stakes for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as 'home rule for the city on speed cameras,' stalled after City Hall did not send a formal request. Gounardes, shifting focus, now pushes to renew and expand the city’s automated enforcement before cameras go dark in July. Assembly Member William Magnarelli, chair of the Transportation Committee, blamed City Hall for inaction. Mayor Eric Adams and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez voiced support for home rule, but Albany holds the power. Advocates and victims’ families decry the repeated need to beg for basic safety tools. The Crash Victim Rights and Safety Act, including Sammy’s Law for lower speed limits, remains in limbo. Without home rule, New York City’s most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, children—face continued risk from political delays.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No more excuses.</p><p class=mb3>On May 2, 2022, the City Council’s Sanitation Committee, chaired by Council Member Sandy Nurse, held a hearing on the delayed implementation of commercial waste zones, a reform established by a 2019 law. The matter, titled 'Advocates Warn Against Further Delays on Commercial Waste Zones,' drew sharp criticism after the Department of Sanitation granted private carters a three-month extension to comply with new requirements. Nurse stated, 'Our communities cannot afford any more delays.' Advocates and Families for Safe Streets highlighted the deadly toll: reckless commercial haulers have killed more than two dozen people in recent years. The reform aims to cut truck traffic, reduce pollution, and require life-saving side guards on heavy trucks by 2024. Lauren Pine, a crash survivor, said, 'Commercial waste zone reform can not come fast enough.' The hearing underscored that every delay keeps vulnerable New Yorkers at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The toolkit, described as a guide for 'city approvals needed for plazas, sidewalk furniture, parklets, open streets and other amenities that enable successful pedestrianization and placemaking,' calls for unified permits, sliding fees, and an inter-agency Public Realm Working Group. Matthew Clarke, executive director, said, 'Public spaces and the small businesses that define them are critical for the livelihood of our neighborhoods.' Jackson Chabot of Open Plans added, 'These systemic changes will foster safe streets, commerce, and community.' The report highlights decades of city neglect, favoring car storage over people.

Adams called for meetings with precincts and targeting dangerous intersections. But he gave no specifics on enforcement, legislative changes, or expanding the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program. Advocates like Eric McClure (StreetsPAC) and Sara Lind (Open Plans) welcomed the words but demanded concrete action, especially from the NYPD.

The plan, part of the 'Great Streets' project, keeps eight car lanes and installs only lightly protected bike lanes with mountable curbs. Samuel Santaella, the author, writes: 'the department has discriminated against thousands of bikers and 13,630 pre-pandemic daily bus riders in order to privilege the needs of 40,000 daily motorists.' Santaella opposes the current DOT plan and urges a redesign: reduce car lanes to four, add center-running bus lanes, fully separated bikeways, and wider sidewalks. He warns that mountable curbs let drivers invade bike lanes, putting cyclists at risk. Bus riders see little benefit, still stuck behind double-parked cars. The piece demands the city stop favoring drivers and start protecting vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Lincoln Restler of District 33, a member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, praised the move as 'a very clear commitment to addressing street safety across the five boroughs.' The proposal supports the Streets Master Plan, which mandates 250 miles of protected bike lanes and 150 miles of protected bus lanes in five years. Restler emphasized that the funding will harden bike lanes, replacing paint with physical barriers to keep cars out and protect cyclists. The Council had requested $3.1 billion, but Restler called the $900 million a dramatic investment.

Mayor Adams, in a statement, called his commitment to the program 'steadfast.' The announcement pledges up to $20,000 per site for non-profits to cover costs like barriers and signage. The program, launched during the pandemic, lets residents walk and gather in streets closed to cars. Council action is not specified, but the mayor's office leads. The city promises to focus on underserved neighborhoods, aiming for equity. Still, most operations rely on volunteers, not city workers. Car owners protest the loss of parking. The Horticultural Society of New York will assist with management and upkeep. The city’s support is real but limited. Vulnerable road users get space, but the system leans on unpaid labor.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Gounardes also pushed to keep speed cameras active. Advocates like Jon Orcutt acknowledged progress, such as the MTA’s bike strategy and new greenway funding, but stressed the need for stronger laws.

The report, titled 'Study: Car Ownership Doesn’t Always Cut Black Workers’ Commutes,' finds that despite an increase in car ownership among Black workers—from 76% in 1980 to 85% in 2019—average commute times grew longer, not shorter. The study states, 'it may not be possible to speed up city commutes with automotive strategies alone.' The gap in commute times between Black and White workers persists, especially in large, segregated cities. The article warns that subsidizing driving will make streets more polluted and dangerous, with the heaviest toll on communities of color. It calls for investment in bus rapid transit, trains, and active transportation, and for building communities where jobs and housing are close.
