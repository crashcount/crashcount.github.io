Local power denied.</p><p class=mb3>State Senator Andrew Gounardes’s bill S5602 sought to grant New York City control over its speed and red-light camera programs. The effort failed this session. The matter, described as 'home rule for the city on speed cameras,' stalled after City Hall did not send a formal request. Gounardes, shifting focus, now pushes to renew and expand the city’s automated enforcement before cameras go dark in July. Assembly Member William Magnarelli, chair of the Transportation Committee, blamed City Hall for inaction. Mayor Eric Adams and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez voiced support for home rule, but Albany holds the power. Advocates and victims’ families decry the repeated need to beg for basic safety tools. The Crash Victim Rights and Safety Act, including Sammy’s Law for lower speed limits, remains in limbo. Without home rule, New York City’s most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, children—face continued risk from political delays.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He announced a $904 million budget for safety improvements and said, 'We need to find them proactively, and get them off the streets.' Adams called for meetings with precincts and targeting dangerous intersections. But he gave no specifics on enforcement, legislative changes, or expanding the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program. Advocates like Eric McClure (StreetsPAC) and Sara Lind (Open Plans) welcomed the words but demanded concrete action, especially from the NYPD. The city’s current laws limit its power to remove dangerous drivers. Pending state bills could help, but for now, the mayor’s promise remains just that—words, not protection for those most at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

State Sen. Andrew Gounardes called the grade unacceptable, urging passage of his road-sharing training bill and support for Sen. Brad Hoylman’s bill to lower speed limits. Gounardes also pushed to keep speed cameras active. Advocates like Jon Orcutt acknowledged progress, such as the MTA’s bike strategy and new greenway funding, but stressed the need for stronger laws. The League’s summary: 'New York received high marks for infrastructure and funding, and education and encouragement, but got an F+ in traffic laws and practices.'

The event targeted New York City’s sluggish bus service and the high cost of MTA fares. The rally demanded Mayor Adams speed up bus commutes, install at least 30 miles of new bus lanes in 2022, and expand the Fair Fares program for low-income riders. Marte declared, 'It shouldn't just be a vote to get 30 miles of additional bus lanes. That should be the minimum.' The rally pressed the city to prioritize bus lanes, bike lanes, and pedestrian-oriented streets, echoing the Streets Master Plan. No formal bill was under consideration, but the council and advocates pushed for $3.1 billion in funding for these changes. The action highlights the urgent need for safer, faster, and more affordable transit for vulnerable New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Carroll called the requirement "reasonable." Stephen Walling, president of the New York State Association of Professional Driving Schools, said the bill would "go a long way towards keeping all New Yorkers safer on our roads."

State Senator Andrew Gounardes, district 26, echoed Adams: 'It makes no sense that the city cannot control its own destiny on these streets.' Adams admitted NYPD traffic enforcement lags, with summonses down by more than half since 2019. Twenty-seven pedestrians have died so far this year—three more than last year.

Advocates want $500 million yearly to keep subways and buses moving. Riders face fare hikes and service cuts if lawmakers stall. The fight is urgent. Riders wait. Cars kill. Transit saves lives.</p><p class=mb3>This funding debate centers on Gov. Hochul’s Fiscal Year 2023 budget, which allocates $6.6 billion in operating aid for the MTA but lacks new dedicated revenue. The proposal, discussed on January 28, 2022, has not advanced to a formal committee or bill stage. The matter: 'Who Wants To Give The MTA Half A Billion Dollars?' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes backs progressive funding, saying, 'Funding high-ridership bus routes and the subway such that transit options would be arriving every six minutes is something we need to be pushing for.' Comptroller Brad Lander and advocates like the Riders Alliance demand $500 million per year to avoid fare hikes and boost service. The push is clear: more frequent, affordable transit keeps vulnerable New Yorkers out of harm’s way. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the stakes for pedestrians and riders are life and death.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
