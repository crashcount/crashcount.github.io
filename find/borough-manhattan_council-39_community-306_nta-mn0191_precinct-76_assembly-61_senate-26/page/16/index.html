The plan, now entering a 60-day public review, sets a $15 daytime toll for drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street. The matter, titled 'Don’t expect changes to MTA's congestion pricing even after final public review,' underscores the board's resistance to major changes. MTA Chair Janno Lieber said, 'If you change one aspect – the whole thing starts to unravel or fall apart.' Council Member Robert F. Holden was mentioned in the discussion. The board is reconsidering tolls on school buses, but most exemptions are opposed. Lawsuits from New Jersey officials threaten delays. The plan’s fate hangs on legal and public scrutiny, but for now, the structure stands.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On November 16, 2023, the Portland City Council unanimously passed a resolution targeting the Gorham Connector highway project. The matter, described as a call to 'stop its work on the highway until rapid transit options have been properly examined,' urges the Maine Turnpike Authority to pause construction. Council members cited climate change and Maine’s emissions goals, demanding transit and land-use reforms come first. The council’s action follows a 2012 study warning that new roads alone won’t fix traffic. Local groups like GrowSmart Maine and businesses such as Smiling Hill Farm oppose the project, fearing it will worsen sprawl and pollution. Despite council opposition and federal funding for transit studies, the Turnpike Authority continues land acquisition and environmental reviews. Vulnerable road users face increased risk if the highway moves forward without transit alternatives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Riders wait. Promises break. Advocates demand real bus rapid transit: center lanes, fast boarding, tough enforcement. Without action, the city’s buses crawl. Vulnerable riders pay the price in time and danger.</p><p class=mb3>This Streetsblog NYC analysis, published November 13, 2023, examines New York’s failure to deliver true Bus Rapid Transit (BRT). The article, titled 'Want More Rapid Bus Transit? Build Real Bus Rapid Transit,' criticizes Mayor Adams for not following through on campaign pledges to expand bus lanes and implement full BRT. Advocates like Annie Weinstock and JP Patafio argue that dedicated center-running lanes, off-board fare collection, and strict enforcement are needed to speed up buses and protect riders. The piece notes, 'Current bus lanes, like on Utica [Avenue], really it’s almost like a parking lot, because they cover the plates and there’s no enforcement.' The report highlights that without strong leadership and commitment, bus riders—often the city’s most vulnerable—remain exposed to slow service and street danger. No council bill number or committee is attached; this is a policy analysis and advocacy call to action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She said, 'time and time again, older adults are the majority of deaths in disasters.' The episode detailed how, from Hurricane Katrina to the Lahaina wildfires, seniors bear the brunt of heat, floods, and storms. Host Jeff Wood pressed on the need for policy that protects the vulnerable. The discussion made clear: the system ignores the predictable, mounting toll on older adults. No council bill or vote was involved, but the call for action was urgent.

He stated, 'The Bedford Avenue bike lane has been unacceptably dangerous since it was first laid, and for years, the people of my district have been promised that it would be protected.' Advocacy groups, including Transportation Alternatives, echoed his frustration, citing record cyclist deaths and urgent need for safety. The DOT has not responded to requests for comment.

In a closed-door meeting with the Department of Transportation, Adams said, "My legacy is not how many bike miles I do. My legacy is not how many bus lanes I do." He signaled a shift from measurable safety benchmarks to a focus on community input, a move DOT staffers called "extremely micromanaged." Adams’s administration has failed to meet even the minimum legal standards for new lanes. A mayoral spokesman claimed the city still delivers "safe, efficient streets," but advocates say Adams’s approach relies on vague metrics and lacks accountability. No council members are directly involved; this is a mayoral policy stance.

Past proposals to extend the M22 or restore the B71 with a Manhattan extension were dismissed over cost and logistics.

Cars bobbed in oily rivers. Pedestrians waded through chaos. Council Member Lincoln Restler called out the city’s slow response. Vulnerable New Yorkers paid the price. Leadership stayed silent. Danger surged.</p><p class=mb3>On September 29, 2023, Council Member Lincoln Restler (District 33) spotlighted the devastation as extreme flooding crippled New York City’s transit. The event, titled 'Extreme weather event (flooding) impacts on NYC transportation,' showed buses stranded, subways flooded, and streets impassable. Restler was mentioned as a key voice demanding action. The article’s summary reads: 'We Have the 'End of Days' Flooding Pics You Need Right Now.' The city’s emergency response faltered. The MTA and DOT failed to protect riders and walkers. Streets and drainage buckled. Leadership, including the mayor, stayed out of sight. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, transit riders, and cyclists—faced the brunt of systemic neglect. No safety analyst weighed in, but the images and accounts show a city unprepared for crisis.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The suit targets retaliation against civilians reporting traffic misconduct.</p><p class=mb3>On September 19, 2023, attorney Adam White filed a federal lawsuit against the NYPD, seven officers, and the City of New York. The case stems from a November 11, 2022 arrest after White removed a plastic cover from a license plate he believed was obscured to dodge traffic cameras. The complaint, citing false arrest and retaliation, states: "Mr. White now brings this suit seeking redress for the violations of his own rights, as well as seeking changes to Defendant City's policies and practices around responding appropriately, and without retaliation, to civilian complaints about illegal 'ghost cars,' 'ghost plates,' and other traffic misconduct." The suit names Sholem Klein, head of the Rockaway Nassau Safety Patrol, as the complainant who called police. The Brooklyn DA later dropped charges against White. The lawsuit seeks damages and policy reforms to protect civilians who report illegal traffic activity.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Senator Gounardes called for tougher laws and real consequences for reckless drivers. He slammed weak enforcement. Streets remain deadly. Calls for redesign and accountability echo. The system failed again.</p><p class=mb3>On September 19, 2023, after a deadly crash in Bath Beach, State Senator Andrew Gounardes demanded action. The driver, Faheem Shabazz, had a record of speeding violations. Gounardes, a safe streets advocate, said, 'That's really what this conversation should be about—how are we holding people accountable when they have violations to their record and zero consequences for it.' He supports lowering speed limits and tougher penalties but stressed that enforcement is lacking. Senator Iwen Chu urged the NYC DOT to study the area for safety upgrades, stating, 'We must recognize that our streets need to be designed with safety in mind.' The DOT is reviewing the intersection. The call is clear: repeat offenders face little consequence, and street design still puts pedestrians at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
