The article does not detail injuries or the cause of the crash. The presence of hazardous cargo in a crash raises questions about vehicle safety checks and enforcement. Storing large amounts of propane in a van on city streets exposes bystanders and road users to hidden risks.

The complaint, reported by Streetsblog NYC, claims the NYPD's Community Response Team operated as a rogue unit, answerable only to City Hall, with Deputy Mayor Kaz Daughtry allowing reckless pursuits. Donlon cites deaths and injuries, including cyclist Amanda Servedio. The suit alleges 398 crashes and 315 injuries in 2024—a 47% jump. Donlon's allegations highlight how high-speed chases increase risk to pedestrians and cyclists, introducing unpredictable, dangerous driving and eroding public trust in safe, equitable enforcement.

Quemuel Arroyo, MTA’s chief accessibility officer, called it 'a crucial connection.' The new elevators mark the third Brooklyn station made accessible this year.

Human drivers will control the cars. State law blocks full autonomy. Officials stress safety. Waymo pushes for legal change. The city weighs risk. Streets wait for the next move.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News reported on June 18, 2025, that Waymo will soon test its driverless taxi technology in New York City. The vehicles will not operate autonomously; human drivers will remain behind the wheel, as state law forbids fully driverless cars. Waymo is lobbying for a law change to allow autonomous operation, but the effort has stalled in the State Assembly. Mayoral spokeswoman Sophia Askari said, "Public safety is our first priority, which is why we have strong guardrails and requirements in place on any sort of autonomous vehicles." The city’s Department of Transportation is reviewing Waymo’s permit application, the first under the new Autonomous Vehicle Demonstration or Testing Permit Program. The article highlights the tension between technological ambition and regulatory caution, with policy decisions pending and no driverless operation allowed yet.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
