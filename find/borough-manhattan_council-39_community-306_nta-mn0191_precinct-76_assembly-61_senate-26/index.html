Reporter Kirstyn Brendlen covered the findings. No council members sponsored or voted, but the review shows the casino could bring thousands of cars daily.

The busway, which restricts cars, may become permanent. No crash or injury data is cited, but the focus is on systemic street changes, not individual driver actions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
