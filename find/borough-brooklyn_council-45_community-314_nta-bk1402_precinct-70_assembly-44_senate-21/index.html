Last week, a speeding driver ran a red light, killing two pedestrians. The article quotes Adams, who once called Third Avenue 'extremely intimidating' and said it 'must be at the top of our list.' Despite this, his administration 'put the brakes on a potentially life-saving road redesign,' favoring business interests. Attorney Peter Beadle notes, 'they had a plan ready to go and then it was pulled back.'

DoorDash lobbied hard. Cyclists and walkers left exposed. No coverage. Profits protected. Safety denied.</p><p class=mb3>Bill to require app companies to provide $50,000 insurance for delivery workers, pedestrians, and cyclists was introduced by Assembly Member Robert Carroll. It passed the Senate but died in the Assembly on June 30, 2025, after DoorDash called it 'costly.' Amy Sohn reported the defeat. The bill aimed to cover injuries from crashes and bar retaliation against workers filing claims. DoorDash lobbied against it, backing a weaker bill. The safety analyst notes this defeat reduces accountability and weakens protections for pedestrians and cyclists. Corporate pressure won. Vulnerable road users lost.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
