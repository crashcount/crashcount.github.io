Kennedy International Airport: Jan 1, 2022 - Jun 17, 2025</h2><h3 id=broken-bodies-silent-roads>Broken Bodies, Silent Roads</h3><p>No one died here this year. But the numbers do not comfort. In the last twelve months, 34 people were hurt in 46 crashes on the roads around JFK. Not one serious injury, not one fatality. Still, the wounds add up: whiplash, concussions, broken arms, a knee torn open. The pain lingers long after the sirens fade.</p><p>The roads do not forgive. A 57-year-old man lost control of his SUV on the Belt Parkway and struck a tree. He died before help could arrive. Police said he &ldquo;failed to navigate the roadway and struck a tree&rdquo; <a href=https://qns.com/2025/04/brooklyn-motorist-killed-belt-parkway-ozone-park/>according to The Brooklyn Paper</a>. No arrests. No answers. Just another name lost to the highway.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p>The city says it wants zero deaths.

They passed Sammy’s Law. They can lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit still stands at 25. The cameras that catch speeders could go dark if Albany stalls.</p><p>The work is not done. The city built new crosswalks, added bike lanes, and claimed progress. But the crashes keep coming. The pain keeps coming. The silence from leaders is louder than the traffic.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-action-or-more-names>What Comes Next: Action or More Names</h3><p>Every crash is a warning. Every injury is a call for change. The city has the power. The council can lower the speed limit. Albany can keep the cameras on. But nothing changes unless you demand it.</p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to use the laws they passed. Lower the speed. Keep the cameras.

The Department of Transportation has not selected a vendor, despite plans to add 500 secure spots by next month. Councilmembers urged action, calling the program potentially 'as transformative and impactful as our (Citi Bike) share program.' Jon Orcutt of Bike New York said, 'The Adams administration seems to be flubbing it, or failing it, or just letting it sort of slide through the cracks.' The delay leaves cyclists, especially delivery workers, exposed to theft and lacking safe storage. The city’s inaction stands in contrast to London, where secure bike parking has boosted cycling rates.

Forty badly hurt. The Conduit slices through Queens and Brooklyn, fast and wide. DOT will study a fix. Borough presidents called for urgent change. The city will listen to neighbors. The old highway’s days are numbered. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>""The current state of the Conduit falls significantly short of meeting the needs of drivers, cyclists and pedestrians alike. It's confusing, it's poorly designed ... and we know the lack of sufficient pedestrian and bike infrastructure makes it even more dangerous for the neighbors of Queens and Brooklyn."" -- Donovan J. Richards</p><p class=mb3>On May 13, 2025, the Department of Transportation (DOT) announced a city-funded public engagement process for a major safety redesign of Conduit Boulevard, a three-mile corridor linking Atlantic Avenue to the Belt Parkway and JFK Airport. The project follows urgent requests in 2023 from Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "Brooklyn and Queens deserve a Conduit Boulevard that improves daily life, not a roadway that puts pedestrians and drivers at risk and physically divides entire neighborhoods." The corridor has seen five deaths and 40 severe injuries in five years. The median’s dirt paths show heavy pedestrian use, but only 15 crosswalks span the stretch. The public process begins in June and may run into 2026. The redesign aims to end decades of danger for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The policy, supported by Mayor Adams and Police Commissioner Tisch, escalates minor cycling infractions to criminal court summonses. The article, titled 'As NYPD’s Criminal Crackdown on Cyclists Expands, It Grows More Absurd: Victims,' details complaints of overzealous, inconsistent enforcement and alleged entrapment. Council Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers questioned the need for criminal court involvement, while Comptroller Brad Lander called the crackdown 'performative' and dangerous. The safety analyst notes: 'Policies that empower discretionary or punitive enforcement against cyclists can deter active transportation, increase fear and mistrust, and shift responsibility away from systemic safety improvements, ultimately undermining population-level safety for vulnerable road users.' The crackdown draws widespread criticism for endangering those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The policy, backed by Mayor Adams and Police Commissioner Tisch, claims to target 'quality of life' offenses. Cyclists report tickets for minor or fabricated infractions, including headphone use and stopping ahead of painted lines. Comptroller and mayoral candidate Brad Lander called the crackdown 'performative,' urging alternatives like the Idaho Stop and stricter delivery app regulation. Council Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers questioned the need for criminal court involvement and signaled interest in a hearing. The article notes e-bike riders cause few pedestrian injuries. The City Council previously limited criminal summonses for minor infractions over racial profiling concerns.

On Woodhaven Boulevard, Rosen struck McField from behind, ran him over, and continued driving, dragging the motorcycle until it caught fire. Rosen then hit another car before stopping at a lamp post. McField died from severe trauma. District Attorney Melinda Katz stated, "Our roadways are not the place to settle disputes."

The department banned bikes from a major stretch of the Rockaway Boardwalk, closed parts of the Hudson River Greenway, and allowed cars back into Silver Lake Park. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, speaking for local families, condemned the boardwalk ban: "It was about the children that take advantage of biking on the boardwalk...We’re now shifting them into the street." Residents and advocates argue these moves ignore years of complaints about poor maintenance and lack of coordination with DOT. They highlight that car-free conditions in Silver Lake Park improved safety, especially for children. Advocates call for shifting road maintenance from Parks to DOT and demand structural changes. The Parks Department’s focus on recreation, not transportation, leaves vulnerable road users exposed and frustrated.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, still in committee, follows the 2023 law that limited outdoor dining to April through November.

Restler, who voted against the seasonal restriction, now seeks broader support. Council Member Chi Ossé (D-Bedford-Stuyvesant) and Carlina Rivera (Lower East Side) also back the change, though both previously supported the seasonal law to keep some form of the program alive. Committee chair Selvena Brooks-Powers (D-Queens) is open to the idea, while Council Member Julie Menin (D-Upper East Side) criticizes DOT's management, urging a shift to the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection. Lawmakers and advocates agree: high costs, bureaucracy, and seasonality block participation and hurt street life.
