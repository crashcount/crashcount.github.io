Pedestrians took 444 injuries and one death; cyclists 94 injuries.

The injuries spike from school let‑out into the commute: 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. is the heavy band, with a peak at 5 p.m. (130 injuries) and another surge in the 8 a.m. hour <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hourly distribution</a>.

No arrests were made that day <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/police-investigate-hit-run-death-springfield-gardens-queens-john-kennedy-international-airport/17524816/>ABC7</a>.

A jury convicted him this June. At sentencing, Queens DA Melinda Katz said, “Joseph Lee terrorized other drivers.” Lee told police he entered the highway wrong‑way “because I wanted to hurt people” and felt “liberated.” He also said, “You want to fight?” He got eight years <a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY</a>.</p><p>Streets that keep taking</p><p>Crashes in this neighborhood rose this year.

The Senate bill to force speed‑limiters on repeat violators advanced in June.

The path and the asks are laid out here: <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</p><p>What remains is simple and hard: slow the cars, harden the crossings, stop the repeat offenders.</p><p>One more name on Hillside is one too many.</p><p>Action</p><ul><li>Tell your council member and the mayor to use the powers they have.

The suit claims the redesign would "jeopardize" safety and hinder emergency access, despite DOT data showing 190 injuries and two deaths in the area since 2020. DOT says the project targets "unpredictable vehicle movements" and double parking, with design elements "found on streets across the city." The agency says it incorporated feedback from 90% of local businesses. The legal fight spotlights tension between safety improvements and business concerns, as the corridor ranks among Queens' most crash-prone.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
