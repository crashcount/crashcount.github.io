No council members were involved. Instead, advocates like Zohran Mamdani, Brad Lander, Zellnor Myrie, Adrienne Adams, Michael Blake, and Scott Stringer ranked candidates based on their records and promises for safer streets. Streetsblog made no endorsements. According to safety analysts, this event did not create any policy or legislative change for pedestrian or cyclist safety.

The article states: "The car is driven by multiple people, all of whom have been reminded to obey the speed limit, and there are no outstanding tickets." Cuomo’s spokesperson, Esther Jensen, noted his past support for speed cameras. Mayoral rival Brad Lander and Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani criticized Cuomo’s record, calling his driving 'reckless and unlawful.' Zellnor Myrie’s spokesperson, Julia Rose, said Cuomo acts above the law.

Lawmakers tout support for the injured. But insurance comes after the hit. Speeders keep driving. Danger stays on the street. Prevention takes a back seat.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13, 2025, the New York State Senate passed a bill requiring food delivery apps to provide insurance for delivery workers, pedestrians, and cyclists. The bill, sponsored by Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger, mandates up to $50,000 per person for basic economic loss, regardless of citizenship or employment status. Assembly Member Robert Carroll authored the original Assembly version, stating, 'It is time we require delivery apps to take responsibility for keeping delivery workers and pedestrians safe.' Sen. Andrew Gounardes defended a related speed-limiting bill, but it was weakened. Safety analysts warn: 'Focusing on insurance rather than speed limits shifts responsibility away from prevention and system design, failing to reduce crash risk and potentially discouraging mode shift by not addressing the root causes of danger for pedestrians and cyclists.' Lawmakers back insurance, but leave the streets risky.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

This comes as Tisch’s department intensifies enforcement against cyclists. Streetsblog NYC reported, 'Both Brad Lander and Zellnor Myrie, mayoral candidates, have reiterated their pledge to retain NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch if elected, despite concerns over her crackdown on cyclists.' Lander’s spokesperson, Kat Capossela, said Lander trusts Tisch to implement his policies, including cracking down on reckless drivers, even as Tisch currently targets cyclists. Myrie’s campaign promised to keep streets safe without unnecessary enforcement. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and former Comptroller Scott Stringer also weighed in, but stopped short of firm commitments. A safety analyst notes: Retaining a commissioner known for crackdowns on cyclists likely perpetuates enforcement-focused approaches that burden vulnerable road users, discouraging cycling and undermining mode shift and street equity.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, featured Scott Stringer, Zellnor Myrie, Jessica Ramos, Brad Lander, Zohran Mamdani, and Whitney Tilson. Stringer demanded 'massive expansion of protected bike lanes.' Myrie backed S1047, a bill for 50-percent e-bike rebates. Ramos called for safe bike lanes and clear signage for all riders. Lander pushed for stricter rules on heavy e-bikes and a crackdown on illegal sales, saying, 'I support stricter regulations for the heaviest e-bikes, which can travel at higher speeds and are more likely to injure both riders and pedestrians.' Mamdani supported e-bike subsidies with safety checks. Tilson urged a 20 mph cap and mandatory registration for delivery e-bikes. All agreed: safer streets need better design, strong enforcement, and real protections for workers and vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan would cut traffic lanes and add protected bike lanes on Third Avenue, a corridor marked by high injury and fatality rates. The Department of Transportation delays the project, likely until after the mayoral election. The matter summary states: 'a plan to improve street safety is on ice until NYC mayoral election.' Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and other Democratic mayoral candidates back the redesign. Brad Lander and Zellnor Myrie criticize the delay, calling out the Adams administration for broken promises. Local business leaders are split. DOT claims to be gathering feedback.

The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, featured Scott Stringer, Zellnor Myrie, Jessica Ramos, Brad Lander, Zohran Mamdani, and Whitney Tilson. Stringer pledged to move the city away from car dependence and build infrastructure for biking and transit. Myrie called for removing parking mandates to boost housing and speed up buses. Ramos supported repurposing parking for safer streets and green space. Lander pushed for eliminating parking minimums citywide and dynamic curbside management. Mamdani criticized the vast space given to cars. Only Tilson promised to preserve free street parking. The candidates’ stances show a clear divide: most want to reclaim streets for people, not vehicles. The debate signals a shift toward policies that could reduce car dominance and improve safety for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill would require 16- and 17-year-olds riding Class 1 or 2 e-bikes, including Citi Bikes, to wear helmets. Committee Chair William Magnarelli (D-Syracuse) defended the bill, stating, "My only concern is the safety of the people riding the bike." The bill summary notes, 'studies have shown [helmet mandates] can dramatically reduce ridership of the city’s bike share system.' Experts warn such laws lead to fewer cyclists and open the door to discriminatory enforcement, especially against youth of color. Seattle dropped its helmet law in 2022 for these reasons. Despite evidence that helmet laws hurt vulnerable road users, the committee advanced the bill without addressing these harms.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The forum, hosted by Streetsblog NYC, asked candidates how they would address reckless driving. Scott Stringer said, 'The best way to curtail reckless driving is to make less room for reckless drivers on the road.' Zellnor Myrie promised 'physically separated bus lanes' and expanded automated enforcement. Jessica Ramos called for 'a citywide strategy that prioritizes safety through design.' Zohran Mamdani wants to move traffic enforcement from NYPD to DOT, ending biased stops. Whitney Tilson supports more police and cameras. The candidates back protected bike lanes, busways, daylighting, and automated enforcement. Their plans center on street redesign and accountability, not blaming victims.
