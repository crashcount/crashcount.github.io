Five serious injuries. 631 people hurt.</strong> That is the toll of traffic violence in Forest Hills since 2022. These are not just numbers—they are bodies broken, lives changed. In the last year alone, 212 people were injured here. Four suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same again. No one died in the last twelve months, but luck will not hold.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> An 18-year-old was killed by an SUV on the Long Island Expressway. A 16-year-old girl, crossing with the light, was struck by a bus on Yellowstone Boulevard. A cyclist’s face was torn open in a crash with a van on 108th Street. These are not rare events—they are the drumbeat of daily life in Forest Hills. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the data</a>.</p><h3 id=the-vehicles-that-wound-and-kill>The Vehicles That Wound and Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs, sedans, trucks, buses, bikes, mopeds.</strong> In Forest Hills, SUVs and cars caused the only death and most serious injuries. Trucks and buses left two people with life-altering wounds. Bikes and mopeds hurt others. The street does not forgive mistakes, and the biggest machines do the most harm.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn’t</h3><p><strong>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero.</strong> The city touts new speed limits, more cameras, and intersection redesigns. But in Forest Hills, the carnage continues. The numbers do not move fast enough. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not used it here. Cameras catch speeders, but only where they are installed. The rest of the streets are left to chance.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every injury, every death, is preventable. Demand more. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower the speed limit, build real protection for people on foot and bike, and keep the cameras running.

Police allege Peña was 'drunk and high on cocaine and marijuana' and speeding at 83 mph when he 'ran a red light and T-boned a car driven by 24-year-old Justin Diaz.' The crash happened at Northern Boulevard and East 107th Street as Diaz drove to work. Prosecutors cited Peña’s firing from the FDNY and prior legal issues to argue for remand, but the appellate court released him with minimal bail conditions. Peña faces manslaughter and other charges, with a possible 15-year sentence if convicted. The case highlights the lethal risk of impaired, reckless driving and the limits of pretrial detention policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The girl was crossing with the light when the right front bumper hit her leg, causing severe lacerations and significant bleeding. The report states, 'The driver never saw her.' The contributing factor listed is 'Driver Inattention/Distraction.' The pedestrian's actions—crossing with the signal at the intersection—are noted, but the primary cause identified is the bus driver's failure to pay attention while turning. No vehicle damage was reported. The incident underscores the danger posed by inattentive driving, especially when large vehicles turn through crosswalks occupied by people with the right of way.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
