Council Member Shekar Krishnan sponsored the bill, joined by Stevens, Hanif, Avilés, and others. The bill required a permit process, a site safety plan, and compliance with local rules. It was filed at session's end on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst weighed in. The bill died, leaving streets unchanged for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
