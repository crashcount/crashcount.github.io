A cyclist rides home. A child crosses the street. In Harlem (South), the street does not forgive. <strong>One person killed. Nine left with serious injuries.</strong> In three and a half years, 1,157 crashes. <strong>598 people hurt.</strong></p><p>The numbers do not bleed, but people do. <strong>Pedestrians, cyclists, children.</strong> In the last year alone, two suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Five children hurt. The oldest victim: 75. The youngest: under 18. No one is spared.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs strike most often.</strong> They account for the bulk of injuries and serious harm. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>SUVs and sedans</a> left 33 with moderate injuries, two with life-changing wounds.

But the weight of steel and speed falls heaviest from behind a wheel.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p><strong>The city talks of Vision Zero.</strong> They tout new laws, like Sammy’s Law, letting New York set its own speed limits. But in Harlem (South), the pace of change is slow. <strong>No new protected bike lanes. No major redesigns.</strong> The council and community board have not forced the issue. The silence is loud. Each day without action is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Lower the speed limit. Build real protection for walkers and riders. Enforce the laws that matter. <strong>Call your council member.

Prosecutors say Ali drank for nearly six hours at three Manhattan bars, reaching a blood alcohol content of .158, almost twice the legal limit. After hitting Esiyok, Ali continued, injuring a cyclist, two more pedestrians, and crashing into a van. The family’s lawsuit cites New York’s Dram Shop Act, which holds bars liable for serving visibly drunk patrons who later cause harm. The article quotes the family’s lawyer: “The family is devastated. They’re still in disbelief.” The case highlights failures in both driver responsibility and alcohol-serving oversight.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
