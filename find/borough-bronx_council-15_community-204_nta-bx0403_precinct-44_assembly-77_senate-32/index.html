Eight seriously hurt.</strong> In the last three and a half years, Mount Eden-Claremont (West) has seen 922 crashes. Five hundred eleven people left those scenes with injuries. Some limped away. Some did not walk again. Some did not walk away at all.</p><p>The dead are not numbers. They are fathers, sons, neighbors. <strong>No children died here this year. But children were hurt.</strong> Sixteen under 18 were injured in the last twelve months. One was hit by a bus. Another by a turning SUV. The street does not care how old you are.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>Kelvin Mitchell was crossing Webster Avenue. A Mercedes came fast in the bus lane. It did not stop. Kelvin did not make it home. His sister <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/11/sister-of-bronx-man-killed-by-hit-and-run-mercedes-driver-has-faith-driver-will-be-caught/>said, “Everybody is missing Kelvin. It’s not gonna be the same over here without him.”</a> The driver kept going. The police could not say if they were chasing the car. His mother stood at the memorial and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/14/police-chase-linked-to-fatal-hit-and-run-in-bronx>said, “They killed my son. I need justice for my son.”</a></p><p><strong>No arrests. No answers.</strong></p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They say every life matters. They say speed cameras work. They say they are redesigning streets. But here, the numbers do not move fast enough. Last year, one person died. This year, none—so far. But injuries are up 40% over last year. Crashes keep coming.</p><p><strong>Local leaders have the power to act.</strong> Sammy’s Law lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph. The Council can do it now. The Mayor can push. The DOT can build more protected space. But every day they wait, the street stays the same.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets where children can walk and come home.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
