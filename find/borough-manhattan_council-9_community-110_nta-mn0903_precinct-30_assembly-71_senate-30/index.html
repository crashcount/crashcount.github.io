The blood doesn’t.</h1></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>Hamilton Heights-Sugar Hill: Jan 1, 2022 - Sep 3, 2025</h2><p>A man on a bike went down at W 155th and St. Nicholas just before 11 PM on Nov 2, 2024. An SUV hit him. The record lists driver inattention and unsafe speed. He died (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash records</a>).</p><p>He was one of <strong>3 people killed</strong> in Hamilton Heights–Sugar Hill since Jan 1, 2022. In that same span, <strong>572 people were injured</strong> in 1,199 crashes here (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash records</a>).</p><p>The city already said why speed matters. “The city&rsquo;s ability to control the speed limits on its streets plays a crucial role in delivering traffic safety,” said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez last year (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/05/24/city-council-poised-to-pass-home-rule-message-for-sammys-law-on-thursday>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><h3 id=nights-take-the-worst>Nights take the worst</h3><p>The deaths here stack up after dark. The deadliest hours cluster at <strong>2 AM</strong> and <strong>10 PM</strong> in this neighborhood’s crash log (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash records</a>).</p><p>Speed shows up. So does distraction. “Unsafe Speed” appears as a factor alongside “Driver Inattention/Distraction” in local injury records, including the W 155th fatal crash and other cases logged on Amsterdam and Broadway (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash records</a>).</p><p>A second death sits on Riverside Drive near W 147th. A pedestrian was struck at about 2:42 AM on Sep 4, 2022. He did not survive (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash records</a>).</p><h3 id=corners-that-dont-forgive>Corners that don’t forgive</h3><p>Crashes pile up on the long, fast runs: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Henry Hudson Parkway</a>. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Amsterdam Avenue</a>. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>West 145th Street</a>. The city’s own entries tie injuries here to speed and inattention—things design can blunt and enforcement can catch (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash records</a>).</p><p>Simple fixes exist: daylight the crosswalks so drivers can see; harden left turns; give people a head start on the signal. Council Member Shaun Abreu co‑sponsors a bill to ban parking at crosswalks to open sightlines (<a href=#>Int 1138‑2024</a> noted in Council records). Use it. Aim it at these blocks.</p><h3 id=hold-the-line-on-speed>Hold the line on speed</h3><p>Albany handed New York City the tool to set safer limits. The city’s own leaders backed it. “The city&rsquo;s ability to control the speed limits on its streets plays a crucial role in delivering traffic safety,” said DOT’s Rodriguez when the Council advanced the home‑rule message for Sammy’s Law (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/05/24/city-council-poised-to-pass-home-rule-message-for-sammys-law-on-thursday>Streetsblog NYC</a>). The charge now is simple: make 20 the norm on residential streets. Start on Amsterdam and 145th. Then keep going.</p><p>There’s another lever for the worst repeat offenders. In Albany, the <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act</strong> would require speed‑limiting tech for drivers who rack up offenses. State Senator <a href=/senate-district/30/>Cordell Cleare</a> co‑sponsored and voted yes in committee on the Senate bill <strong>S 4045</strong> in June 2025 (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>).

The matter urges, "the city to redesign Canal Street to be less car-centric after decades of studies and delays." Duggan, joined by advocates and politicians, calls for lane reductions, speed cuts, and pedestrian-first changes. The Department of Transportation faces a 30-day deadline to release plans. The safety analyst notes the event text is too vague for a clear safety impact, as no concrete intervention is described.
