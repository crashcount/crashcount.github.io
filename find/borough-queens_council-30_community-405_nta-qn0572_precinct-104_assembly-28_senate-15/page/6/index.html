The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting the operation of electric scooters and bicycles with electric assist in parks,' sought to ban e-scooters and e-bikes from all parks under city jurisdiction. Council Members Robert F. Holden (primary sponsor), Vickie Paladino, Joann Ariola, and Ari Kagan backed the measure. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote or enactment. The summary reads: 'This bill would prohibit the operation of electric scooters and bicycles with electric assist in any park under the jurisdiction of the department of parks and recreation.' No safety analyst assessed the bill’s impact on vulnerable road users. The measure targeted micro-mobility, not the cars that kill.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He claims it will curb chaos and hit-and-runs. Critics say it shifts blame from drivers and ignores deeper street dangers.</p><p class=mb3>On December 6, 2023, Councilmember Robert F. Holden (District 30) led a push for his bill requiring license plates and registration for all e-bikes, e-scooters, and similar vehicles. The bill, introduced last year, has 31 co-sponsors and awaits a hearing in the Council's transportation committee. Holden said, 'Let’s find out who they are,' targeting e-bike riders and citing safety concerns. The bill summary states it would require 'license plates and vehicle registrations for any electric bike, scooter or other motorized vehicle.' At a City Hall rally, Holden and supporters pointed to injuries and deaths from lithium-ion battery fires. Pamela Manasse, a crash survivor, called e-vehicles a danger. Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives criticized the bill, saying it shifts blame from drivers and ignores the need for safer street design and better regulation of e-bike sales and batteries. The debate follows Mayor Adams' pilot for public e-bike charging stations.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Council Member Robert Holden, claims to restore 'civility' to chaotic streets. Council Member Rita Joseph, district 40, is mentioned in the debate. The bill drew a bipartisan supermajority of co-sponsors, but two have since withdrawn. Cycling groups, including Transportation Alternatives and Los Deliveristas Unidos, call the bill 'ineffective, dangerous, expensive, short-sighted, and bureaucratically complicated.' They warn it will discourage e-bike use, push people toward cars, and lead to racially targeted police enforcement. Supporters cite rising injuries and deaths involving e-vehicles.

The bill, before the Transportation Committee, would require licensing and visible plates for all e-bikes, scooters, and legal motorized vehicles not already registered with the DMV. The board opposed the measure, passing a resolution 21-15 (with five abstentions), calling it 'overly broad and ineffective at addressing safety concerns.' The matter summary reads: 'Require registration and licensing for all e-bikes and legal motorized vehicles.' Board members Brian Van Nieuwenhoven and Jason Froimowitz criticized the bill as incomplete and unrealistic, noting it would not solve dangerous operation or enforcement issues. Holden dismissed the board’s opposition as unrepresentative. The board also passed a separate resolution supporting daylighting at intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, backed by a council majority, aims to regulate e-bikes but, as the article notes, 'does nothing to rectify the fundamental issues of inadequate space and dangerous workplace practices.' Holden’s action—pushing for licensing—was met with calls for wider sidewalks, protected bike lanes, and fairer delivery work standards instead. The piece warns that Holden’s approach would create a bureaucratic burden for riders while failing to protect pedestrians. It urges the council to focus on infrastructure, not over-policing or flat fines, and highlights the need for equitable, safe streets for all vulnerable users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter’s summary states: 'Holden's bill does nothing to rectify the fundamental issues of inadequate space and dangerous workplace practices.' Holden and his colleagues push regulation, but critics say the bill ignores the real threats: narrow sidewalks, blocked crosswalks, and unsafe delivery work. The proposal would burden riders and discourage micromobility, while failing to address illegal mopeds or car dominance. State Senator Brad Hoylman’s employer-provided ID plan is cited as a better alternative. The opinion calls for protected bike lanes, wider sidewalks, and fair enforcement, not more bureaucracy.

The bill, now backed by a Council majority, would require all legal e-bikes and scooters to be registered and display license plates. The meeting opened with a standing ovation for Holden, but tensions rose when NYPD Deputy Inspector Erik Worobey praised deliveristas for safer riding. The crowd booed, voicing fear of fast e-vehicles. The E-VSA’s nine-point plan calls for reclassifying e-bikes as mopeds, ending a park e-bike pilot, and NYPD confiscation of e-vehicles on sidewalks, with a $500 retrieval fine. The group frames itself as victims of 'rogue' riders, though city statistics show drivers of larger vehicles cause far more injuries. The bill does not address mopeds or provide funding, and critics say it ignores the dangers faced by delivery workers, 26 of whom died between 2020 and 2022.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Holden with co-sponsors including Ariola, Riley, Yeger, Restler, Brooks-Powers, Hanks, Borelli, Carr, Kagan, Vernikov, and Paladino. The bill’s title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code... requiring the department of transportation to consult with the fire department prior to approving open street applications and certain bicycle lane projects and to notify affected firehouses...” It requires DOT to consult FDNY and notify firehouses before approving open streets, bike lanes, or major transportation projects that remove car or parking lanes. DOT must certify this consultation. The bill does not apply to emergency projects. While it aims to protect emergency access, advocates warn it could delay or block street redesigns that save lives for people walking and biking.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Holden wrote to DOT demanding action. Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez replied that the employee was identified and that 'appropriate action' was taken, but did not specify what that meant. The city car involved has five enforcement camera tickets since 2018. Holden stated, 'the DOT should expect nothing less than exemplary behavior from its personnel.' He commended DOT for swift action but transparency is lacking. Holden has opposed Citi Bike expansion and the Streets Master Plan, but supports NYPD enforcement against illegal parking and some safety improvements. The lack of detail on discipline leaves questions about accountability and the safety of pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Keith Powers introduced the buy-back bill, which creates a citywide program for defective or uncertified batteries. Powers said, "We don't want to penalize businesses and workers without thinking about this strategically." The Council also moved bills from Oswald Feliz, Gale Brewer, Alexa Avilés, and Robert Holden. These measures ban uncertified batteries, require fireproof charging containers, mandate public education, and order FDNY reporting on battery fires. Speaker Adrienne Adams clarified the bills target commercial sellers, not workers. Shahana Hanif urged that policy must "keep workers" at the center. The Council and delivery workers’ union stressed that tech companies, not workers, should bear costs. The FDNY opposed the reporting bill over resource concerns. The legislation aims to curb battery fires while protecting delivery workers who depend on e-bikes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The official summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to conducting a study of the impact that truck and delivery traffic generated by last mile facilities have on local communities and infrastructure.' The bill required the Department of Transportation to report on delivery vehicle volumes, parking, congestion, collisions, and pedestrian injuries near these hubs. It called for identifying the most affected streets and estimating the costs and possible fixes. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without passage.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
