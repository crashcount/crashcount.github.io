Prosecutors said Pena was drunk, high on cocaine and marijuana, and driving 83 mph in a 25 mph zone when he ran a red light and struck Diaz’s BMW. Surveillance footage showed the Mercedes 'barreled through an East Elmhurst intersection' at 4:15 a.m. Diaz, headed to work at LaGuardia, died at the scene. Pena refused a breath test; a blood draw later confirmed drug use. He was charged with vehicular manslaughter, DWI, and refusal to submit to testing, but posted $50,000 bail. The article highlights family grief and outrage at bail laws, quoting Diaz’s brother: 'Pena will walk the streets for a $50,000 bail...

The U.S. Department of Transportation revoked federal approval for the Central Business District Tolling Program, which charged vehicles to enter Manhattan below 60th Street. The matter summary states the program was called 'a slap in the face to working-class Americans and small business owners.' Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30) praised the federal intervention, calling congestion pricing 'unfair and burdensome for working families.' The MTA, Governor Hochul, and transit advocates condemned the move and pledged legal action.

The crash threw Berney from his car, killing him at the scene. The other driver was injured. Vennitti, unlicensed, abandoned his Mercedes and fled on foot. Police arrested him a year later. A grand jury indicted Vennitti for leaving the scene of a fatal crash and driving without a license. The case highlights the lethal risk of unlicensed driving and the dangers of stopped vehicles on high-speed roads.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Holden (District 30) welcomed reports that the Trump Administration may halt New York City’s congestion pricing plan. The policy, effective since January 5, charges drivers $9 to enter Manhattan below 60th Street. The matter, titled 'New York officials, orgs denounce reports of Trump move to halt congestion pricing,' drew sharp lines. Holden called the toll a 'scam' and hoped the federal government would end it. Transit advocates and city officials, including MTA CEO Janno Lieber and Comptroller Brad Lander, warned that stopping the program would mean more traffic, dirtier air, and worse transit. Lieber said, 'Better bus service, faster drive times and safer streets are good for all New Yorkers.' The debate now centers on whether to keep or kill a measure credited with reducing cars and making streets safer for those outside vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The controversy centers on the MTA’s emergency vehicle exemption, which lets law enforcement vehicles—including those chauffeuring Mayor Eric Adams, Comptroller Brad Lander, and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams—avoid the toll. The bill’s matter summary highlights the hypocrisy: 'They shouldn’t be exempt from congestion pricing. They shouldn’t have chauffeurs. It’s disgusting,' Holden said. Lander and Williams previously celebrated the toll’s benefits for transit and air quality, but now face backlash for not paying it themselves. The measure’s status is controversial, with no direct safety analyst note, but critics argue the exemption undermines public trust and leaves the city’s most vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, and transit riders—bearing the burden.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
