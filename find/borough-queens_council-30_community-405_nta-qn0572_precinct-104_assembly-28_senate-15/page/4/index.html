On February 10, 2024, Vennitti allegedly rear-ended David Berney, 43, after Berney and another driver stopped in the middle lane following a minor collision. The crash threw Berney from his car, killing him at the scene. The other driver was injured. Vennitti, unlicensed, abandoned his Mercedes and fled on foot. Police arrested him a year later. A grand jury indicted Vennitti for leaving the scene of a fatal crash and driving without a license.

The bill’s summary states it aims to increase accountability for e-bike riders after fatal crashes. Holden, the sponsor, cited dangers from unregulated e-vehicles and hit-and-runs. Advocacy groups, including Los Deliveristas Unidos and Open Plans, argue the bill would unfairly criminalize immigrants and delivery workers, and increase police stops for people of color.

The bill is named after Priscilla Loke, killed by an electric Citi Bike rider. Legal experts Daniel Flanzig, Peter Beadle, and Brandon Chamberlin argue the bill violates state law, which bars cities from imposing fees that restrict the 'free use' of bicycles. They warn it would create barriers to e-bike use and could lead to inconsistent rules across cities. Holden defends the bill as a push for 'accountability and safety.' Critics say it discourages e-bike use and risks police harassment, especially for immigrants. The city Law Department declined comment.

Pedestrians now cross anywhere, any time. No summons. Law strips drivers of excuses. Streets shift. Power tilts to people on foot.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0346-2024, now enacted, rewrites New York’s pedestrian rules. The bill, heard by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, passed on September 26, 2024, and became law on October 26, 2024. Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers. It shifts blame from people on foot to the system and those behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
