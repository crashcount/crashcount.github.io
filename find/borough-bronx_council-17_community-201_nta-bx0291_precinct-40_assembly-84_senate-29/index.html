Reporter Elle McLogan notes the plan has stirred debate, with some residents supporting safer passage for cyclists and others expressing concern about traffic changes. The article highlights the ongoing tension between car dominance and the need for protected space for vulnerable road users. While no specific crash or driver error is cited, the coverage underscores the systemic risks faced by cyclists and pedestrians on streets designed for vehicles.

Prosecutors allege Peña was drunk, high, and speeding at 83 mph—three times the limit—when he ran a red light and T-boned 23-year-old Justin Diaz’s car. Surveillance and body camera footage show Peña admitting to running the light. Five hours after the crash, tests confirmed intoxication by alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine. Peña’s record includes prior arrests and 25 school zone speeding tickets. He also drove an unregistered vehicle with an obstructed plate and tinted windshield. The victim, Diaz, was headed to work and had just graduated college. The case highlights repeated driver violations and systemic failures in enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
