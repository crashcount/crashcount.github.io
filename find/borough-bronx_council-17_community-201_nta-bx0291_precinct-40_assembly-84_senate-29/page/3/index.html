The bill advanced through committee and received broad support in both chambers. By exempting these large complexes, the law weakens traffic enforcement where thousands live. This move increases risk to pedestrians and cyclists, stripping away protections that save lives. Vulnerable road users lose another layer of safety in dense city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Witnesses and video show a police van chasing a speeding Mercedes before the crash, raising questions about NYPD pursuit policy. The article notes, 'A police van was in pursuit of the speeding Mercedes, according to video obtained by Streetsblog.' The NYPD’s policy restricts chases to serious crimes and discourages them in residential areas, yet the pursuit occurred near homes and a bodega. The department declined to comment. The crash highlights risks from high-speed chases and inconsistent enforcement of pursuit guidelines.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Starting May 18, the north outer roadway becomes bike-only, while the south outer roadway, once for vehicles, opens to pedestrians. The article notes, “Advocates have fought to open a separate pedestrian path, citing dangerous overcrowding that has led to conflicts among cyclists, pedestrians and micromobility users.” The bridge was the last city-owned East River crossing without split paths. Manhattan Community Board 6 urged the city to act, pressing DOT to open the path despite construction delays. The change doubles space for non-drivers and removes a vehicle lane, addressing years of systemic risk from forced mixing of vulnerable users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
