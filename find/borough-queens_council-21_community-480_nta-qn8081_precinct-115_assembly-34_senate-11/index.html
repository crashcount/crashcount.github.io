Streets stay a little safer for kids.</p><p class=mb3>Bill S 8344, titled 'Extends provisions and makes technical corrections to school speed zones in NYC; repealer,' moved through the Senate and Assembly in June 2025. Sponsored by Senator Andrew Gounardes, the bill passed Senate votes on June 12 and June 13, and cleared the Assembly on June 17. The measure extends and corrects school speed zone laws in New York City, repealing outdated provisions. Gounardes led the push, with strong support from most Senate Democrats and a split Assembly. The bill's technical fixes aim to keep protections in place for children and other vulnerable road users near schools.

The city streets stayed deadly.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News (June 13, 2025) reports two fatal crashes in New York City within 24 hours. Eric Wexler, 74, was hit by a 2017 Chevy Tahoe while crossing Northern Blvd. in Queens. Police said the Tahoe had 'six speeding and one red light violation,' though it was unclear who drove during those incidents. The driver stayed at the scene; no charges were filed. Less than a day later, Rino El-Saieh, 42, was killed when a 17-year-old BMW driver struck his moped during a left turn in Brooklyn. The BMW then crashed into parked cars. The teen also remained at the scene and faced no immediate charges. Both crashes highlight persistent dangers for pedestrians and riders, and raise questions about enforcement and vehicle histories.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
