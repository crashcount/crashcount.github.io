Ten seriously hurt.</strong> In just over three years, the streets of University Heights (North)-Fordham have claimed five lives and left ten more with wounds that do not heal. <strong>822 people have been injured</strong> in 1,365 crashes since 2022, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. Each number is a body. Each injury, a story cut short.</p><h3 id=recent-wounds-fresh-grief>Recent Wounds, Fresh Grief</h3><p>The pain is not old. <strong>Two people have died and one suffered life-altering injury in the past year.</strong> A 65-year-old man was killed crossing with the signal at University Avenue and West Kingsbridge Road. A van turned right. He did not make it home. A 15-year-old girl died as a passenger on a moped, thrown and broken on West 192nd Street. A four-year-old boy, riding on a moped, died on Bailey Avenue. No warning. No second chance.</p><h3 id=the-voices-on-the-street>The Voices on the Street</h3><p>After a crash at Bartow Avenue, a witness <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/op-city-crash-multiple-people-injured-including-1-critically-bronx/17075710/>described</a>, &ldquo;I saw one lady was out on the ground. They was giving her medical attention, checking her body. She was laid out.&rdquo; Another neighbor <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/op-city-crash-multiple-people-injured-including-1-critically-bronx/17075710/>recalled</a>, &ldquo;It was a terrible sound &ndash; it was a terrible incident that happened.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>Council Member Pierina Sanchez</strong> backed new bus lanes and safer street designs, but <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/07/29/fordham-rd-still-hell-for-bus-riders-after-mayor-adams-scrubbed-a-better-road-design>Mayor Adams killed the Fordham Road redesign</a>. Buses still crawl. Riders still wait. Enforcement comes and goes, but the danger stays. <strong>State Senator Robert Jackson</strong> <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes on bills to curb repeat speeders and extend school speed zones</a>. <strong>Assembly Member George Alvarez</strong> <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">co-sponsored speed limiter bills</a>, but missed key votes on school speed zones. The work is not done. The streets are not safe.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a failure of will. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real street redesigns, not more ticketing of the powerless. <strong>Do not wait for another child to die.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
