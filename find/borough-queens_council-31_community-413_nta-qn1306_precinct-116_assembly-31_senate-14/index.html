Since 2022, <strong>twelve people have died</strong> here in crashes. <strong>Twenty more were left with serious injuries</strong>. The number of people hurt—<strong>1,390</strong>—is a wound that never closes. Each number is a body, a family, a life changed.</p><p>Just this year, the carnage continues. Two more dead.

The cause was simple: <strong>unsafe speed</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>A few weeks before, a 23-year-old man was killed crossing North Conduit Avenue.
