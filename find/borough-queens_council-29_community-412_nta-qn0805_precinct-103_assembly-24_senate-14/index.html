Six seriously hurt.</strong> In Jamaica Hills-Briarwood, the years grind on and the bodies keep coming. Since 2022, there have been <strong>1,048 crashes</strong>. <strong>617 people injured</strong>. <strong>Two killed.</strong> The numbers do not flinch. They do not pause for grief.

The luck will not hold.</p><h3 id=the-faces-behind-the-numbers>The Faces Behind the Numbers</h3><p>A 20-year-old cyclist, dead on 164th Street. A 19-year-old, gone in a crash with a truck. A six-year-old, her head cut open in the back seat. These are not accidents. They are the price paid for speed, for inaction, for streets built for cars, not people.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p><strong>The city talks of Vision Zero.</strong> Speed cameras now run all day and night. The law lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph, but the limit still stands higher on most streets. Intersections have been redesigned, but not enough. The city says one death is too many. The city keeps counting.</p><p><strong>Local leaders have tools.</strong> They can push for lower speed limits. They can demand more cameras, more protected crossings, more space for people. They can fight for every inch of safety. Or they can wait for the next crash.</p><h3 id=the-call-that-cannot-wait>The Call That Cannot Wait</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. <strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets for people, not just cars.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list.
