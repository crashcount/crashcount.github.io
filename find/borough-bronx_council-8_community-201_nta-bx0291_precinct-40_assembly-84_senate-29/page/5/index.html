Advocates vow to watch.</p><p class=mb3>On May 30, 2024, the New York City Council and Mayor Adams' administration agreed to pursue regulation of last-mile delivery warehouses. The deal emerged during negotiations over the 'City of Yes for Economic Opportunity' zoning plan, which the Council approved. The matter summary notes, 'the administration has pledged to support future legislation to cut pollution from these warehouses and propose rules to restrict new facilities.' Councilmember Alexa Avilés (District 38) and 28 colleagues sent a letter demanding stricter oversight. Avilés and advocates want special permits and environmental reviews to protect neighborhoods from traffic, pollution, and safety hazards. Deputy Mayor Maria Torres-Springer promised a bill empowering the Department of Environmental Protection to regulate warehouse vehicle emissions. Councilmember Rafael Salamanca Jr. stressed the Council’s leverage: 'It gets to a point where you have to use your power of voting to get the attention of the city.' The City Planning Commission and Council must vote again before rules take effect. Advocates and councilmembers will monitor the administration’s follow-through.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable road users caught in the crossfire.</p><p class=mb3>On March 19, 2024, the City Council held an oversight hearing on DOT street safety projects and Streets Plan implementation. The hearing, led by Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers (D-Queens), Christopher Banks (D-Brooklyn), and Rafael Salamanca Jr. (D-Bronx), focused on the DOT's progress under the Streets Plan, which mandates annual targets for protected bike lanes and bus lanes. Brooks-Powers objected to the Seagirt Boulevard bike lane, claiming DOT ignored community wishes, despite previously calling for more investment. Banks demanded removal of new protected bike lanes in East New York, citing parking and safety issues, though data showed fewer crashes and injuries. Salamanca criticized a Bronx street redesign for congestion, despite lower crash rates. He also accused DOT of neglecting communities of color, though data shows these areas receive more redesigns. DOT officials defended their process, emphasizing community engagement and prioritizing high-need areas. The council's opposition stands in stark contrast to the projects' proven safety benefits for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
