Eric Wexler, 74, was hit by a 2017 Chevy Tahoe while crossing Northern Blvd. in Queens. Police said the Tahoe had 'six speeding and one red light violation,' though it was unclear who drove during those incidents. The driver stayed at the scene; no charges were filed. Less than a day later, Rino El-Saieh, 42, was killed when a 17-year-old BMW driver struck his moped during a left turn in Brooklyn. The BMW then crashed into parked cars. The teen also remained at the scene and faced no immediate charges. Both crashes highlight persistent dangers for pedestrians and riders, and raise questions about enforcement and vehicle histories.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, backed by the Economic Development Corporation and Council Member Rafael Salamanca, aims to move food by boat and e-cargo trike instead of trucks. The matter summary states: 'Replacing truck trips with boat trips and cargo bikes is a key feature of the city's urgent push to shift cargo trips out of big trucks.' EDC President Andrew Kimball said, 'The goal is, over time, to move more and more of this food out of Hunts Point not by truck, but by water with e-cargo trikes.' The dock will remove one thousand trucks per month from South Bronx streets. Officials plan to expand docks citywide. The bill’s status is an active infrastructure rollout, not a legislative vote.
