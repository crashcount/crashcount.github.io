The announcement, made at One Police Plaza, highlighted the bill sponsored by Simon and Sen. John Liu. The matter summary states, 'Officials called on Albany to pass legislation to lower the BAC threshold to .05%, arguing it would reduce DWI fatalities by about 10% and align with other countries.' Simon declared, 'Lowering the BAC limit from .08% to .05% is desperately needed to adequately tackle this epidemic of traffic violence.' NYPD Chief Kim Royster and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez echoed the urgency. The bill awaits action in Albany. No formal safety analyst note was provided, but officials cite 43 NYC DWI deaths in 2021 and say 30% of state crashes involve alcohol.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The message: don’t drink and drive.</p><p class=mb3>On February 7, 2023, Queens State Senator John Liu, representing District 16, publicly supported a bill in the State Legislature to lower the legal blood alcohol concentration (BAC) limit for drivers from 0.08 to 0.05. The bill’s summary states, 'The 0.05 BAC simply says, don’t drink and drive.' Liu, as the bill’s primary sponsor, emphasized that anyone found with a BAC over 0.05 would be charged with DWI. City Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez joined the push, warning, 'Whether they are at 0.06 or 0.12 or 0.20, the consequences can be deadly.' Drunk driving caused 307 deaths in New York State in 2019, nearly a third of all fatal crashes. Utah’s adoption of a 0.05 BAC limit led to a 20% drop in fatal crashes in its first year. The bill is part of a broader effort to protect pedestrians, cyclists, and passengers from impaired drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No safety review for pedestrians or cyclists was made public.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0627-2022 was introduced on August 11, 2022, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill required agencies to notify council members, community boards, and business districts before removing a traffic lane or parking for 500 feet or three blocks for at least a week. The matter summary reads: 'providing notice and an opportunity for comment before implementing a major traffic change.' Council Members Kalman Yeger (primary sponsor), Francisco P. Moya, Sandra Ung, and Pierina Ana Sanchez backed the bill. It was filed at the end of session, never enacted. The bill would have given local officials ten days to respond to proposed changes, but exempted urgent safety actions. No safety analyst assessed the impact on vulnerable road users. The bill’s fate leaves the status quo: agencies can still act without local input.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by Rivera, Marte, Yeger, Sanchez, Won, Restler, Joseph, Gutiérrez, Ung, Louis, Abreu, and Hanif.
