Deaths outside cars now make up 36 percent of all road fatalities. Regulators tout small gains, but the bloodshed for vulnerable users deepens. Hit-and-runs surge. Systemic failure persists.</p><p class=mb3>On April 2, 2024, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration released final 2022 and preliminary 2023 traffic fatality numbers. The agency’s summary highlights a modest dip in overall deaths, but the details are stark: 'drivers had killed more cyclists (1,105) than they had in any single year in the entire history of the reporting system—and pedestrian deaths (7,522) were the highest since 1981.' Vulnerable road users now account for 36 percent of all fatalities, up from 20 percent in 1996. Hit-and-run deaths and serious injuries for pedestrians and cyclists both rose 11 percent. Tami Friedrich of the Truck Safety Coalition demanded urgent federal action, stating, 'No one else needs to die because of bureaucratic inaction.' Advocates and Vision Zero supporters call for systemic reforms—speed limiters, automatic braking, safer trucks, and better infrastructure.

Car crashes kill thousands, but get shrugs. The system blames individuals, not failures in design. The toll is steady, silent, and ignored. Urgency is missing. Vulnerable lives pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>This March 28, 2024, Streetsblog commentary highlights the stark difference in national response between the Baltimore Key Bridge collapse and routine car crashes. The article asks, 'What if we treated our national epidemic of car crashes with that same degree of urgency—not to mention that same holistic approach to saving lives?' No council bill number or committee applies; this is a media analysis, not legislation. The piece criticizes how officials and media leap into action for rare infrastructure disasters, but ignore the daily, deadly toll of car violence. It notes that highway expansion is prioritized over repair, and that systemic failures—not individual mistakes—drive the crisis. The commentary urges a shift to a Safe System Approach, demanding the same scrutiny and coordinated action for traffic violence as for headline-grabbing catastrophes. Vulnerable road users remain at risk while the system looks away.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Sanitation (DSNY) will launch only one zone in central Queens after September 3, 2024. The oversight task force has not met in two years. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, who authored the law as a Council member, called DSNY’s rollout a 'missed opportunity' for clarity and accountability. Justin Wood of New York Lawyers for the Public Interest warned, 'The system cannot achieve transformational change if it is treated as a limited pilot program.' The city’s goal to cut truck miles falls short of original promises. Action Carting, whose driver killed a cyclist in 2017, secured contracts for 14 zones. Advocates say the lack of outreach, oversight, and clear safety benchmarks leaves vulnerable road users at risk. No safety analyst assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No points. No suspensions. Gianaris backs a bill to yank registrations after five violations. Victims’ families and DOT demand action. The loophole leaves reckless drivers free to kill.</p><p class=mb3>Queens Senator Michael Gianaris, with Assemblymember William Magnarelli, introduced a bill to suspend vehicle registrations after five speed or red light camera violations in one year. The measure remains in committee. The bill responds to a fatal flaw: 'We have no mechanism right now, under law, to crack down on extremely reckless drivers,' said Brooklyn State Sen. Andrew Gounardes. The current law lets drivers rack up dozens of camera tickets and keep driving, since no points are added to licenses. Gianaris’s bill aims to close this loophole. DOT and crash victims’ families, including Juliane Williams, whose daughter was killed by a speeding driver, press for stronger penalties and expansion of the red light camera program. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program expired with little effect. The city’s vulnerable road users remain at risk while repeat offenders face few real consequences.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Adams criticized the mayor for failing to meet these benchmarks and for cutting funding to vital services. She said, 'Our duty is to turn these ideas into effective laws and to conduct oversight... But laws and policies are only as good as their implementation.' Adams also proposed using city land for affordable housing and expressed conditional support for zoning reforms, insisting on deeper affordability.

This legislation will be extremely harmful if it becomes law—likely cutting e-bike use, increasing motorcycle and car emissions and traffic, and forfeiting economic benefits associated with micro-mobility.' Holden’s push aligns with car-centric policy, drawing sharp criticism from safety advocates.

Only elected officials, disabled drivers, and union contracts keep parking perks. Streets may clear. Danger shifts. Committee weighs next step.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0411-2024 sits with the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure after its February 28, 2024 introduction. The bill, sponsored by Julie Won, Lincoln Restler, Gale Brewer, Christopher Marte, Erik Bottcher, Alexa Avilés, and the Brooklyn Borough President, aims to 'prohibit any city agency from issuing parking permits to private vehicles that do not have an elected official license plate, and would provide for the revocation of such parking permits.' Exemptions remain for people with disabilities and collective bargaining agreements. The bill seeks to cut back on private car privileges, a move that could reshape curb space and city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
