The proposal, part of the council’s response to the mayor’s $98.5 billion preliminary budget, seeks to expand protected bike lanes to 500 miles, bus lanes to 500 miles, and add 38 million feet of pedestrian space. The council’s plan also introduces 40 miles of car-free busways, a benchmark not found in the mayor’s plan or previous legislation. Adams and other council leaders argue this funding is vital, stating, 'To secure an equitable recovery for our city and improve public safety, we must focus on robust investments.'

The article states, 'By replacing car trips, e-bikes can simultaneously lower emissions, improve street safety, and boost riders' health.' John MacArthur, a transportation program manager, notes that local and state lawmakers now lead with rebates and incentives. Council members and legislators in Vermont, Colorado, California, Washington, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Oklahoma have introduced or supported bills for e-bike rebates. Despite the momentum, no current state proposal pairs incentives with new bike infrastructure.

Adams admitted NYPD traffic enforcement lags, with summonses down by more than half since 2019. Twenty-seven pedestrians have died so far this year—three more than last year.

The plans include painted bus lanes, a partial car-free busway, and a full car-free busway between Morris and Webster avenues. DOT aims to finalize designs by early fall and implement changes by mid-fall 2022. The matter summary states, 'Bus speeds are among the slowest in the city.' Council members are not named, but transit advocates like Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance and Juan Restrepo of Transportation Alternatives support the full busway, citing faster buses and safer streets for the majority who walk or ride.

Phil Koopman, an autonomous vehicle expert, said, “Basically, Tesla is programming its cars to break laws.” The report highlights a regulatory gap: U.S. law punishes drivers, not manufacturers.
