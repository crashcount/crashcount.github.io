He fell. His head struck the curb. He died at the hospital. The pedestrian suffered minor injuries. The crash happened at a crosswalk near 96th Street. The case is under investigation.</p><p class=mb3>ABC7 reported on June 19, 2025, that Salvador Nico-Garcia, 43, died after colliding with a pedestrian while riding an e-bike in Central Park. According to police, Nico-Garcia swerved to avoid a 41-year-old pedestrian crossing at the crosswalk near 96th Street and East Drive. He fell, struck his head on the curb, and was pronounced dead at Mount Sinai Morningside Hospital. The pedestrian sustained minor abrasions. ABC7 notes, 'Officials say Nico-Garcia was on an e-bike and was not wearing a helmet at the time he was thrown.' New York City does not require cyclists over 14 to wear helmets. In Central Park, pedestrians have the right of way at all times. The incident remains under investigation, highlighting ongoing risks at crosswalks and the lack of helmet mandates for adult cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
