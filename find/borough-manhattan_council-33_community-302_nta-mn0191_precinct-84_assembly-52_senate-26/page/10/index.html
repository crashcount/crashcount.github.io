Critics called the vision incomplete.</p><p class=mb3>On January 26, 2023, Mayor Adams delivered his State of the City address, outlining new transportation and public space plans. The speech promised a $375-million investment in public spaces, permanent open streets, and a push for zero-emission for-hire vehicles by 2030. Adams also highlighted bills targeting reckless drivers and announced a new Director of the Public Realm. The mayor said, 'We will require the 100,000-plus high-volume for-hire vehicles to be zero-emissions by 2030.' Council Member Andrew Gounardes praised the ROADS Act, saying it 'could save hundreds of lives each year.' But advocates like Open Plans and Betsy Plum criticized the lack of action on transit equity, parking reform, and access for low-income New Yorkers. The address left out bus lane expansion, Fair Fares growth, and city fleet reduction, drawing fire for missing bold, systemic change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Grief, outrage, no justice.</p><p class=mb3>On January 4, 2023, Norman Fruchter was struck and killed by a reversing driver at 68th Street and Bliss Terrace in Council District 47. The intersection lacked a pedestrian crosswalk. Council Member Justin Brannan attended the vigil and tweeted, 'Confronting traffic violence also means taking personal responsibility [and] safe driving habits. It will take all of us.' The driver remained at the scene but faced no charges. Fruchter’s son Lev condemned the New York Automobile Insurance Plan for letting dangerous drivers stay insured. Community leaders, including NYC Comptroller Brad Lander and State Senator Andrew Gounardes, joined in mourning and frustration. Fruchter’s wife Rachel was also killed by a reckless driver in 1997, a tragedy that helped spark Vision Zero. Nearly three decades later, traffic laws remain weak. No systemic change. Vulnerable road users still pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The study aims to address congestion and improve safety for pedestrians and cyclists. Council Member Christopher Marte, quoted as saying, 'this can't be the end as it has been in the past,' called for wider sidewalks and a bike lane.

The bill remains in committee. The measure would give whistleblowers 25% of the ticket, up to $75. The matter targets drivers who obscure or remove plates to dodge automated enforcement. As city and state agencies rely more on cameras to catch speeders and red-light runners, more drivers hide their plates. The Department of Transportation says cameras failed to ticket over 4% of violators last fall, up from 1% in 2019. Advocates accuse police of lax enforcement and even breaking the law themselves.

Streets choke. Danger grows.</p><p class=mb3>On August 8, 2022, Council Member Christopher Marte responded to the Straphangers Campaign’s report naming Manhattan’s M102 as the city’s slowest major bus line. The report, titled 'Slow in the City: Straphangers Campaign reveals the most dawdling, unreliable NYC bus lines,' highlighted severe congestion and unreliable service. Marte urged the city to replicate the 14th Street busway model across Manhattan, stating, 'We don’t have to wait until congestion pricing to take action. We know what works.' The mayor pledged 150 miles of new bus lanes over four years. The MTA and DOT officials acknowledged the need for better enforcement and safer, more efficient bus infrastructure. The push for bus priority lanes and congestion pricing aims to clear streets, speed up transit, and protect vulnerable road users from the daily hazards of traffic and delay.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city is reviewing the plan.</p><p class=mb3>On August 2, 2022, Council Member Christopher Marte backed a proposal for a protected bike lane on the West Side Highway. The plan, led by Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine, calls for closing a car lane and building a two-way bike lane along Manhattan’s western edge. Levine said, 'This solution would make this route safer for everybody.' Marte called the current Greenway 'an accident waiting to happen.' The proposal aims to relieve congestion on the Greenway and give e-bikes a safe, legal path. The city’s transportation department is reviewing the idea, but the New York State Department of Transportation, which controls the highway, has not commented. The plan draws inspiration from the Brooklyn Bridge bike lane, which Levine says improved safety there.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable lives get a fighting chance.</p><p class=mb3>On August 1, 2022, a new law took effect expanding New York City’s speed camera program to operate 24/7. The bill, sponsored in the State Senate by Andrew Gounardes, passed in Albany and was signed by Governor Hochul in June. The measure extends the program for three years and ends the old rule that shut cameras off overnight and on weekends. The Department of Transportation has installed about 2,000 cameras in 750 school zones. The bill’s summary: 'expands the safety technology around the clock.' Gounardes said, 'Your right to speed does not supersede anyone’s rights to live on the streets safely.' Mayor Eric Adams joined advocates to celebrate, stating, 'A city that never sleeps deserves a camera system that won’t take a nap.' DOT data shows 59% of traffic deaths happened during off hours. The expansion aims to close that deadly gap.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The intersection, despite a history of crashes, has not been redesigned. No charges were filed against the driver, even though evidence suggested a failure to yield. Days earlier, Monica Chen, a pedestrian, was killed by a turning driver in Bay Ridge. Again, no charges. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and City Council Member Justin Brannan expressed outrage, stating, "We are both outraged that the epidemic of traffic violence continues and as a result, a 67 year old woman is dead." They pledged to press the Department of Transportation for more safety measures. The NYPD declined comment. The Bronx faces a surge in road deaths. Vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, championed by State Senator Andrew Gounardes, requires pre-licensing courses and written exams to include instruction on the dangers faced by cyclists and pedestrians. The bill's summary states it aims to 'educate drivers about the dangers faced by cyclists and pedestrians and will create a thoughtful road culture going forward.' Gounardes sponsored the bill, which takes effect in January. Until now, the driver's manual offered only a single page on sharing the road.
