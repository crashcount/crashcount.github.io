The city's Department of Health is investigating. The incident reignited calls for Ryder's Law, which would phase out horse-drawn carriages. Councilman Marte said, "We have animals dying because they're being overworked in the heat." The union claims horses pass annual vet checks and follow temperature rules, but critics dispute this.
