Reporter Kirstyn Brendlen covered the findings. No council members sponsored or voted, but the review shows the casino could bring thousands of cars daily.

The agency will lower the speed limit from 35 to 20 mph, narrow two travel lanes, and install concrete barriers after a driver killed a cyclist and pedestrian. David Meyer reported the announcement. No council member sponsored or voted. DOT says it will fast-track community engagement for a full redesign. Lowering speed limits reduces crash severity and likelihood, especially for pedestrians and cyclists near busy bridge exits, and follows best safety practices.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Wilson urges the U.S. to learn from Canada but notes political barriers. No council bill or vote is attached.
