A cyclist rounds a bend. A horse breaks loose. The city calls it a park, but the numbers say otherwise. <strong>In the last twelve months, 35 people were injured here. One was seriously hurt.</strong> No one died, this time. But the tally grows.</p><p>A crash between two horse-drawn carriages sent both drivers to the hospital. The police said the operators would recover. The horses, too. But the scars run deeper. The animal advocacy group NY Class used the moment to demand a ban on carriage horses. The city has not answered. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/collision-between-horse-drawn-carriages-central-park-sends-operators-hospital/16559383/>Police say the operators are expected to be okay, and the horses were not severely injured.</a></p><p>A week before, a horse ran wild through the park. Pedestrians jumped fences. Cyclists shouted warnings. Hayley was there: <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/19/us-news/central-park-horse-runs-wild-without-driver-in-shocking-video/>&ldquo;I was there with my friend walking on the sidewalk and almost got trampled by the poor horse. It was so terrifying.&rdquo;</a></p><h2 id=the-numbers-dont-lie>The Numbers Don’t Lie</h2><p><strong>From 2022 to now, 217 people have been injured in 383 crashes in Central Park. Six were seriously hurt. One died.</strong> The deadliest machines are not the ones you expect. Trucks killed. Cars and SUVs maimed. Bikes and mopeds left blood on the pavement. The young are not spared. Four children were hurt in the last year alone.</p><h2 id=leadership-words-not-deeds>Leadership: Words, Not Deeds</h2><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. It talks about safety. But the park remains a gauntlet. No new laws. No new protections. The horses run. The cars speed. The people bleed. The silence from City Hall is louder than the sirens.</p><h2 id=what-now>What Now?</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand lower speeds. Demand real protection for people, not cars. Demand an end to the slow violence. Don’t wait for the next name to be carved into stone.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Committee review underway.</p><p class=mb3>Int 1304-2025, now in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, was introduced on June 11, 2025. The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring micromobility share system operators to display rules of the road for safe operation," requires all bike and scooter share operators to show city and state road rules on their apps and at every station. Users must review these rules at least once a year before unlocking a device. Operators cannot charge for the time spent reviewing. Council Members Selvena N. Brooks-Powers (primary sponsor), Shahana K. Hanif, Gale A. Brewer, and Lincoln Restler back the measure. The bill aims to make the rules clear and visible, stripping away excuses and confusion for all riders.

The bill is 'Laid Over in Committee.' Its title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting standing or parking a vehicle within 20 feet of a crosswalk at an intersection.' Council Member Erik D. Bottcher is the primary sponsor, joined by Julie Won, Jumaane Williams, and others. The bill prohibits standing or parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and mandates the Department of Transportation to install daylighting barriers at a minimum of 1,000 intersections per year. The law also requires citywide outreach and reporting. This measure aims to keep sightlines clear at crossings, a known danger zone for people on foot and bike. The bill has not yet received a vote.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Committee on Consumer Affairs advanced the bills, with Council Member Gale Brewer introducing both. The laws allow FDNY to close retailers who breach Local Law 39 three times in three years. The official matter summary states: 'The city can now forcibly close repeat offender shops that sell illegal lithium-ion batteries and micromobility devices.' Department of Consumer and Worker Protection Commissioner Vera Mayuga called the issue urgent. Baruch Herzfeld, CEO of Pop Wheels, backed the law but urged more incentives for certified batteries and safe charging. While fires have dropped since last year, uncertified batteries still pose danger. The city has inspected over 650 shops and issued 275 violations, but online sales remain a loophole.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brewer, speaking at an E-Vehicle Safety Alliance town hall, said, "I will sign on to that bill. That's not an issue." She attributes her change to the existence of state bills and constituent pressure, but refuses to back Council Member Bob Holden's city bill. Julie Menin also endorsed strict registration and park bans. Critics, including advocacy groups, warn these measures will hit low-wage, immigrant delivery workers hardest and undermine efforts to reduce car use.

The project, not tied to a specific bill number, is led by the Department of Transportation and replaces a traffic lane in each direction between West End Avenue and 2nd Avenue. The matter aims to 'speed up crosstown buses like the M96 and M106.' Council Member Gale A. Brewer, representing District 6, has sided with residents opposing the change, though she did not comment for the record. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez claims the new lane will make commutes 'faster, more reliable, and safer for everyone.' The bus lane will operate 24/7, except for a short eastbound stretch. DOT notes that 74% of 96th Street residents do not own cars, and most commute by transit, bike, or foot.

DOT officials countered that the redesign will reduce congestion and retain curb access. The project includes dedicated bus lanes, left-turn bays, and treatments to slow drivers.
