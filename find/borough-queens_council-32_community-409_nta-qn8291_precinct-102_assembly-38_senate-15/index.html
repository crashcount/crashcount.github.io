Since 2022, five people have died here. Three more suffered injuries so grave they will not forget. <strong>Cars and SUVs killed two. A motorcycle killed one. No one died on a bicycle.</strong></p><p>In the last twelve months, two people died. One was young—just 18 to 24. Another was in the prime of life, 25 to 34. <strong>A teenager crossing with the signal was crushed by an SUV turning left.</strong> She lived, but her leg did not. The numbers are not just numbers. They are lives, broken and ended.</p><h3 id=the-crashes-keep-coming>The Crashes Keep Coming</h3><p>Crashes do not pause for policy. On October 22, a 17-year-old girl was hit in the crosswalk by a turning SUV. She was crossing with the light. The driver was not cited for speeding. The street stayed the same.</p><p>On April 25, a 23-year-old woman was killed at the intersection of Woodhaven Blvd. and 83rd. She was crossing. A motorcycle hit her. She died at the scene. The city moved on.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have voted for safety, but the work is unfinished.</strong> State Senator Joe Addabbo voted yes to curb repeat speeders with mandatory speed-limiting tech. Assembly Member Jenifer Rajkumar called the situation &ldquo;traffic violence,&rdquo; and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/02/23/dot-commish-promises-safety-improvements-at-queens-intersection-where-pedestrian-was-run-over-three-times>demanded stronger city control over speed limits and cameras</a>.</p><p>But Council Member Joann Ariola <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/09/queens-pol-voted-against-speed-cameras-and-has-27-speeding-tickets>voted against expanding speed cameras, even as her own car racked up 27 speeding tickets</a>. She said, &ldquo;these cameras add additional financial strain to New Yorkers.&rdquo; The strain is heavier for the families who bury their dead.</p><h3 id=the-call-no-more-waiting>The Call: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay means another body on the street.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph citywide speed limit. Demand speed cameras on every deadly block. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The original proposal called for 2,775 homes and limited parking. Now, density drops by 27 percent. Empire State Development claims compromise, but the statement is aspirational and lacks concrete safety measures for pedestrians or cyclists. Vulnerable road users remain exposed.

The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, saw candidates who championed 'the importance of bike lanes, public transit, and open streets' win across the city. Council members Lincoln Restler, Shahana Hanif, Shekar Krishnan, Chi Oss, Crystal Hudson, and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams all prevailed on platforms supporting safer streets. Mark Levine, who called for bold highway changes, won the Comptroller race. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text is a vague statement of support for livable streets but does not describe a specific policy action or legislative change, so its direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists cannot be determined.' The victories signal a mandate for people-first streets, but concrete safety gains depend on future action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

After a crash on the Van Wyck Expressway, Augustin assaulted Jasmer Singh, using slurs and violence. Prosecutors said Augustin yelled, 'No police, no police,' and called Singh 'turban man' before punching him. Singh died from the assault. Police were initially slow to pursue hate crime charges, but a grand jury and community pressure led to a harsher indictment. Augustin pleaded guilty to second-degree assault as a hate crime, avoiding a possible manslaughter conviction.
