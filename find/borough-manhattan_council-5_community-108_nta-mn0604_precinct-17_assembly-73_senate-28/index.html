An 83-year-old crushed by a truck turning left on 2nd Avenue. Cyclists thrown and bleeding on the pavement. In the last twelve months, <strong>one person killed, five seriously injured, 196 hurt</strong> in 314 crashes in East Midtown-Turtle Bay. The dead are mostly old. The injured, every age.

Trucks and buses caused three serious injuries. Bikes and mopeds, too, but the weight of steel and speed of engines do most of the harm. The street is a gauntlet. No one is spared.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>The city boasts of new laws. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> lets New York lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit stands, unchanged, while leaders wait. Speed cameras slash speeding by 63% where installed, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk of expiring. Promises are made. Streets remain the same. The city says one death is too many, but the numbers do not lie. <a href=../../take_action/>demand action</a></p><h3 id=the-work-left-undone>The Work Left Undone</h3><p><strong>One death. Five lives changed forever.</strong> Hundreds more scarred. Each crash is a choice, not fate. Each delay is a risk. The city can act. The council can vote. The mayor can sign. The time for waiting is over.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand speed cameras stay on.

Prevention takes a back seat.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13, 2025, the New York State Senate passed a bill requiring food delivery apps to provide insurance for delivery workers, pedestrians, and cyclists. The bill, sponsored by Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger, mandates up to $50,000 per person for basic economic loss, regardless of citizenship or employment status. Assembly Member Robert Carroll authored the original Assembly version, stating, 'It is time we require delivery apps to take responsibility for keeping delivery workers and pedestrians safe.' Sen. Andrew Gounardes defended a related speed-limiting bill, but it was weakened. Safety analysts warn: 'Focusing on insurance rather than speed limits shifts responsibility away from prevention and system design, failing to reduce crash risk and potentially discouraging mode shift by not addressing the root causes of danger for pedestrians and cyclists.'

No bill number or committee is listed, but the $2-million program stems from a 2023 bill by Council Member Keith Powers. Streetsblog NYC reports: 'The Adams administration is both cracking down on e-bikes and providing safer e-bikes to workers.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'This is not just about protecting delivery workers. It’s about protecting them, their families, their neighbors, and all New Yorkers from deadly fires.' Delivery worker William Medina praised the program, but called for expansion. The program lets workers trade uncertified bikes or illegal mopeds for certified e-bikes, but covers only a fraction of the city’s 80,000 delivery workers. The safety analyst notes: Cracking down may burden vulnerable users, while safer bikes help; mixed signals mean no clear safety gain.

Danger remains for riders and neighbors.</p><p class=mb3>West Side Spirit (2025-06-12) reports New York City’s new e-bike trade-in program, part of the Charge Safe, Ride Safe plan, after deadly lithium-ion battery fires. In February 2024, journalist Fazil Khan died in a Harlem apartment fire started by a charging battery; 22 others were injured. The article notes, 'Fires from unregulated e-bike batteries have already caused too much harm, including tragic loss of life.' The city’s $2 million pilot lets delivery workers exchange uncertified e-bikes and batteries for certified, UL-standard models. The program also requires a safety course. While battery-related fires rose slightly from 268 in 2023 to 277 in 2024, fatalities fell from 18 to 6. The article highlights ongoing risks from uncertified batteries and the city’s push for safer equipment.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, as reported by Streetsblog NYC, reads: 'Manhattan Community Board 6 overwhelmingly supported by a vote of 31-5 the DOT's plans to install a busway on 34th Street, passing a resolution that urged the city to prioritize its installation.' Council Members Erik Bottcher and Keith Powers, who represent the corridor, both support the measure. The resolution urges the city to prioritize the busway, which would ban through traffic by private cars between Third and Ninth avenues. Leadership from Community Boards 4 and 5 also joined the call. DOT plans to implement the busway in summer or fall 2025.

The measure, discussed in the Council but not yet assigned a bill number or committee, comes as Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch launches a crackdown on cyclists. Powers said, "I am interested in all measures that might address keeping our street experience here in the city feeling much safer and slowing down any vehicle or device or instrument that could hurt someone." Despite state authority to lower car speed limits, neither the mayor nor the Council act to curb car speeds citywide. Advocates and some officials slam the focus on e-bikes, pointing to data: cars and trucks cause nearly all pedestrian injuries. The safety analyst notes no direct safety impact for vulnerable users, as no specific policy change is enacted.
