The bill, not yet passed, would require every e-bike in New York City to be registered with the Department of Transportation. Brewer stated, “I do not believe a blanket e-bike registration rule will make streets safer, nor is NYC DOT equipped to establish, manage or enforce it.” She instead sponsors Intro. 1168, mandating safe lithium-ion batteries for delivery workers, and Intro. 1163, requiring worker training and identification. Thirty-one organizations endorsed Brewer’s approach, calling Holden’s bill “ineffective, dangerous, expensive, short-sighted, and bureaucratically complicated.” Council Members Rita Joseph and Sandy Nurse also withdrew support. Opponents argue the registration bill could suppress e-bike use, increase police stops in communities of color, and worsen traffic violence. Holden dismissed these concerns, insisting his bill is vital for safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The MTA declined comment. The Board will soon set final toll rates and rules. The federal government has approved the congestion pricing plan, with tolls for cars expected between $9 and $23.

Council Member Jen Gutierrez carried the resolution; Selvena Brooks-Powers later signed on. The bill targets corridors like Bushwick Avenue, Laurelton Parkway, and East Gun Hill Road—sites of hundreds of crashes and dozens killed or maimed since 2019. The matter summary states: 'Because people are dying and being maimed on New York's most-dangerous 25-mile-per-hour streets.' Supporters, including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, cite the science: lower speeds mean less force, fewer deaths. Research shows 20 mph zones cut crashes by 60 percent. The bill does not mandate, but allows, lower limits where carnage is highest. The council’s action centers the lives of pedestrians and cyclists, demanding the city act before more are lost.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, discussed in the Council’s Committee on Sanitation led by Council Member Sandy Nurse, aims to shift waste from bags to containers. The matter summary warns: 'New York City's already crowded sidewalks could get even more clogged.' Christine Berthet, founder of CHEKPEDS, opposes sidewalk bins, saying, 'We'll now be surrounded not just on one side, but on two sides by garbage and containers.' Nurse did not endorse street placement, but said, 'New Yorkers are going to have to make some hard decisions, do they want parking spaces or do they want their trash in a container.' The Department will hold a virtual hearing.
