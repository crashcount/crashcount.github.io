The bill, not yet passed, would require every e-bike in New York City to be registered with the Department of Transportation. Brewer stated, “I do not believe a blanket e-bike registration rule will make streets safer, nor is NYC DOT equipped to establish, manage or enforce it.” She instead sponsors Intro. 1168, mandating safe lithium-ion batteries for delivery workers, and Intro. 1163, requiring worker training and identification. Thirty-one organizations endorsed Brewer’s approach, calling Holden’s bill “ineffective, dangerous, expensive, short-sighted, and bureaucratically complicated.” Council Members Rita Joseph and Sandy Nurse also withdrew support. Opponents argue the registration bill could suppress e-bike use, increase police stops in communities of color, and worsen traffic violence. Holden dismissed these concerns, insisting his bill is vital for safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary states: 'require the NYC Department of Transportation to register all legal electric bikes, stand-up scooters, and other legal motorized vehicles, and issue license plates for them.' David Carr is mentioned in connection with the bill. Major advocacy groups, including StreetsPAC, Open Plans, and Transportation Alternatives, strongly oppose the measure, warning it would hinder Citi Bike use, block sustainable commuting, and target nonwhite delivery workers.

The bill, introduced on September 1, 2023, has support from council members often hostile to cycling infrastructure. The matter summary states the bill targets 'all legal electric bikes, stand-up scooters, and other legal motorized vehicles.' Holden leads the push, while Council Member Sandy Nurse supports debate but not the bill itself. Major advocacy groups—StreetsPAC, Open Plans, and Transportation Alternatives—oppose the measure, warning it would 'sabotage mode shift while targeting nonwhite delivery workers' and 'create additional hurdles for low-income New Yorkers.' The bill does not address illegal mopeds, lacks funding, and omits enforcement details. DOT is reviewing the proposal. Critics say it will reduce cycling, worsen equity, and undermine safety for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Gutiérrez, joined by U.S. Rep. Nydia Velázquez, Assembly Members Maritz Davila and Emily Gallagher, and State Senator Julia Salazar, urged a full investigation and demanded urgent infrastructure upgrades.

The bill died at session’s end. Cyclists remain exposed. The city’s pace stays slow. The streets stay dangerous. The need remains.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0965-2023 was introduced on March 16, 2023, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill required the Department of Transportation to install at least 100 miles of protected bicycle lanes annually until 2029. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the installation of protected bicycle lanes.' Lincoln Restler led as primary sponsor, joined by Sandy Nurse, Erik D. Bottcher, Jennifer Gutiérrez, Kristin Richardson Jordan, Shekar Krishnan, Julie Won, Chi A. Ossé, Tiffany Cabán, Christopher Marte, Crystal Hudson, and Rita C. Joseph. The bill was filed at the end of session, never enacted. The city’s protected bike lane network remains incomplete. Cyclists and other vulnerable road users still face daily risk from cars and trucks. The bill’s failure leaves the city’s most exposed travelers in harm’s way.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
