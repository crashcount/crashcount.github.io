Streets wait for relief.</p><p class=mb3>On February 8, 2024, State Senator Michael Gianaris and Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani called for $90 million to expand MTA bus service before the $15 congestion pricing toll begins. Their proposal seeks $45 million in this year’s budget to boost bus frequency, with another $45 million to triple free buses citywide. The lawmakers’ push follows a successful fare-free pilot, which Mamdani says increased ridership by over 20%. Gianaris admitted, 'It should have been done sooner.' Critics argue the move is too late, as congestion pricing was approved in 2019. Some unions warn of possible driver shortages, but Mamdani insists existing buses and operators can handle the expansion. The funding proposal comes as the congestion toll faces lawsuits and could launch by mid-June. No formal safety analysis was provided for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
