Riders lined up at the Q12 stop on Northern Boulevard. No chaos. No crashes. Just buses and bodies in the heat. Fewer cars, safer streets for all.</p><p class=mb3>On June 29, 2025, the Queens bus network redesign launched, marking the first major overhaul since the 1950s. The event, covered by AMNY, saw new routes and stops, including changes to the Q12 and Q13. Assembly Member Claire Valdez praised the redesign, calling buses a 'critical lifeline.' Transit advocates split: Riders Alliance applauded the move, while Passengers United warned of harm to vulnerable riders. A safety analyst noted, 'Bus network redesigns that improve transit access can encourage mode shift away from private vehicles, reducing traffic volumes and crash risk for pedestrians and cyclists while supporting street equity.' The redesign aims to shift trips from cars to buses, making streets less deadly for those outside vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

TLC Commissioner David Do said, “We made that today. It is the most accessible fleet in the entire country.” This achievement follows a decade-long push by disability advocates and a 2013 settlement requiring half the medallion fleet to be accessible. The transition faced delays, including the COVID-19 pandemic and medallion owner financial struggles. Policy changes, such as alternating accessible vehicles and funding support, drove the shift. The article highlights systemic progress, not individual driver actions, and underscores the impact of sustained advocacy and regulatory pressure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, not a council bill but a city action, drew sharp criticism from U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, who opposed removing a vehicle lane for pedestrians and cyclists. The article states: 'forcing pedestrians and cyclists in both directions to share a single lane on a bridge with nine lanes for car drivers was unsafe.'

The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative change, so there is no direct impact on pedestrian or cyclist safety to assess.'

The legislature dropped a mandate for daylighting—banning parking at corners near elementary schools—deferring instead to New York City, where Council Member Julie Won’s universal daylighting bill faces opposition from the Department of Transportation. Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, herself a crash survivor, vowed to keep fighting for daylighting, saying, 'I think daylighting would have helped me.' Hochul’s proposals to let the city set lower bike lane speed limits and to reclassify heavy e-bikes as mopeds were also cut. Critics argued these would not address core safety issues. The Adams administration opposes a City Council bill for e-bike registration and plates, while State Sen. Jenifer Rajkumar’s state version would shift licensing to the DMV. As Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives put it, 'A daylighting requirement would have made intersections safer around elementary schools, and it’s disappointing that this provision was cut from the New York State budget.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Prosecutors allege Peña was drunk, high, and speeding at 83 mph—three times the limit—when he ran a red light and T-boned 23-year-old Justin Diaz’s car. Surveillance and body camera footage show Peña admitting to running the light. Five hours after the crash, tests confirmed intoxication by alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine. Peña’s record includes prior arrests and 25 school zone speeding tickets. He also drove an unregistered vehicle with an obstructed plate and tinted windshield. The victim, Diaz, was headed to work and had just graduated college. The case highlights repeated driver violations and systemic failures in enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The discussion, reported by nydailynews.com, centered on Valdez's support for measures like a Vehicle-miles Traveled fee and charging for on-street parking. The article quotes, 'Her op-ed is filled with proposals/ideas for how to make drivers pay for subway improvements.' Letters from readers, including Thomas Murawski and Thomas Bower, accused Valdez of unfairly targeting drivers and ignoring the needs of workers without transit options. Valdez was mentioned, not directly quoted, in the backlash. No formal council bill or vote was involved. There is no available safety analyst assessment of the impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Faster boarding slashes dwell times. Riders save time. Streets get safer, air gets cleaner. The city must weigh the cost—and the gains.</p><p class=mb3>On April 14, 2025, a policy analysis by Charles Komanoff examined the impact of fare-free buses in New York City. The report, covered by Streetsblog NYC, found that eliminating fares would cut bus trip times by 12 percent and boost annual ridership by 169 million, a 23 percent jump. The study states: 'Each dollar of city government support would produce more than two dollars worth of benefits for residents, primarily by removing the burden of fare payments while providing faster and more reliable bus service.' Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and State Senator Michael Gianaris, both of Queens, have pushed the MTA to consider free buses. Komanoff’s analysis shows that faster buses mean less time waiting, cleaner air, fewer crashes, and a small but real drop in car trips. The report adds fuel to the debate over city funding for free bus service.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
