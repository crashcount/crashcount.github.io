The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee had advanced the bill, but Speaker Adrienne Adams held it back from a full vote, citing ongoing debate. The bill’s summary: ending NYPD tickets for crossing outside crosswalks, a practice disproportionately enforced against New Yorkers of color. Councilmember Tiffany Cabán, a sponsor, condemned the law’s discriminatory impact and its failure to reduce traffic violence. After lawmakers amended the bill to shield drivers from liability in pedestrian crashes, advocates like Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives withdrew support, insisting the law should 'clearly protect [pedestrians’] right to safety and security.' The latest version still exposes jaywalkers to civil suits and mandates a city safety education campaign. The bill’s future is uncertain.

The matter, covered by the New York Post, states: 'Cabán—who was elected to office on a platform advocating less car use and cracking down on dangerous driving—received four tickets in the past 13 months for speeding her vehicle in school zones.' Ariola, joined by Councilman Robert Holden, accused Cabán of hypocrisy, highlighting the disconnect between Cabán’s advocacy for street safety and her own driving record. Cabán’s policy platform includes converting 25% of city roadways for people, building 1,000 miles of car-free streets, and expanding bus and bike lanes. No formal council bill or committee action is attached to this event, but the public dispute underscores tensions in the city’s push for safer, less car-dominated streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'On Jackson Heights’ open street, NYC’s ‘moped crisis’ is in full throttle,' drew city officials, including DOT and Mayor Adams, who backed enforcement and moped registration. Krishnan slammed DOT’s reliance on signage, pushing instead for a dedicated micromobility lane. Delivery worker advocates opposed criminalization, demanding labor protections and safe infrastructure.

At a 'Moped Crisis' town hall, Krishnan called the area a 'moped highway' and said, 'The biggest problem that we have is poor design by the DOT.' He demanded a redesign that separates speeding vehicles from people and creates safe corridors for mopeds away from recreational spaces. Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas echoed the call for engineering solutions, stating, 'We must design the roads to ensure that mopeds are not getting on [Paseo Park], and are not driving recklessly.' DOT staff highlighted enforcement efforts, but Krishnan and others insisted that design, not enforcement, must come first.

Vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2024, state lawmakers, led by Senate Deputy Majority Leader Michael Gianaris, responded to Governor Hochul’s sudden suspension of Manhattan’s congestion pricing plan. The Legislature rejected Hochul’s push for a payroll tax hike, then considered a vague $1 billion IOU for the MTA, with no funding source. Gianaris told reporters the proposal would simply promise a billion dollars for the next year’s budget, but offered no details. The bill has not been introduced or assigned to committee. Betsy Plum of the Riders Alliance warned, 'The proposal on the table will not fix the subway. A billion dollar IOU is not nearly enough money nor is it nearly secure enough to build trust and rebuild our critical infrastructure.' With no new revenue, the MTA’s ability to fund repairs and upgrades remains in doubt. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, transit riders—face continued danger as safe, reliable alternatives to driving are left unfunded.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as 'Albany pumps the brakes on MTA funding plan in rebuke of Hochul’s move to ditch congestion pricing,' left the MTA without the $1 billion annual revenue congestion pricing would have provided. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins announced the session’s close without a deal. Lawmakers including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris, State Sen. John Liu, Assemblyman Harvey Epstein, and Assemblyman Tony Simone criticized the governor’s decision and the proposed IOU bailout. Gounardes said, 'I cannot in good conscience ratify a decision that will eliminate a significant, dedicated revenue source for the MTA’s capital plan.'

The future stays uncertain.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2024, Albany lawmakers responded to Governor Hochul’s cancellation of NYC congestion pricing. The proposed measure, still without a bill number or final language, would guarantee $1 billion annually for the MTA over 15 years. State Senate Deputy Majority Leader Michael Gianaris explained, “It’s very simply something that just says there will be a billion dollars for the MTA in the following year’s budget, but without any specifics as to what that means.” Gianaris and others are working with Hochul and the MTA to keep capital projects alive. The bill’s fate is unclear, with some lawmakers already planning to vote no. No safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users. The measure’s details and its effect on street safety remain unknown.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
