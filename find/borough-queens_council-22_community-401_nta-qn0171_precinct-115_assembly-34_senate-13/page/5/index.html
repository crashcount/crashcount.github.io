The toll stirs anger, hope, and a fight over who pays and who breathes.</p><p class=mb3>On January 3, 2025, congestion pricing (no bill number cited) will begin in Manhattan after a federal judge allowed the toll to proceed. The policy charges most drivers $9 to enter south of 60th Street during peak hours. The matter, titled 'Congestion pricing set to begin at midnight Sunday as federal judge clears path for Manhattan toll,' has drawn sharp lines. Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30, Queens) opposes the toll, warning, 'I don't know how my district is going to be impacted.' He fears more cars parking in Queens and unclear pollution risks. Council Member Kristy Marmorato (Bronx) calls it a 'cash grab.' In contrast, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez and Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas support the measure, citing cleaner air, safer streets, and transit upgrades. González-Rojas says, 'Congestion pricing isn't about penalizing anyone—it's about modernizing our transportation system and tackling climate change.' The judge ordered further study on environmental impacts, but the toll begins as scheduled.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article, published October 28, 2024, details community outrage after a cyclist’s death and repeated injuries. NYPD policy says chases should end when risk outweighs reward, but enforcement fails. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program, which once forced repeat offenders into safety courses, has expired. Comptroller Brad Lander says, 'Drivers who are repeatedly caught by speed and red-light cameras currently face no consequences other than a fine in the mail. Repeat reckless drivers must be held to account.' State Senator Michael Gianaris calls for stronger penalties, including suspending registrations. The NYPD has not adopted reforms.

The article states: “If the governor wants to do the MTA and riders a favor, she should use the money she finds to instead boost MTA operations.” Author Samuel Santaella criticizes Hochul’s move, arguing it jeopardizes service for working-class New Yorkers. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and State Senator Michael Gianaris are cited as proponents of fare-free buses, while Riders Alliance pushes for six-minute service. The piece urges Hochul to reject highway expansions and instead invest in frequent, affordable transit.

In its place: a wide, gentle slope. Pedestrians, cyclists, wheelchair users now cross safely. The upgrade, forced by a 2021 law, marks progress. But other bridges still leave vulnerable users stranded. Advocates demand more.</p><p class=mb3>On September 25, 2024, the MTA completed a major upgrade to the Cross Bay Bridge, replacing its hazardous Rockaway-side ramp with a wider, ADA-compliant path. This action fulfills a mandate from the 2021 MTA Bike Access bill. Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, who sponsored the law, said, "I'm excited about the ADA-accessible ramp on the Cross Bay Bridge and that cyclists and pedestrians can access this space... because we passed my legislation." The MTA also announced similar improvements for the Henry Hudson and Triboro Bridges. However, plans for the Verrazzano, Gil Hodges-Marine Parkway, Bronx-Whitestone, and Throgs Neck bridges remain uncertain. Cycling advocates praised the MTA’s progress but criticized its reluctance to consider lane conversions for safer, broader access. The new ramp removes a deadly barrier, but the fight for safe passage on all city bridges continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, under review in committee, aimed to end NYPD enforcement that disproportionately targets people of color. The bill’s summary states, 'NYPD issues hundreds of jaywalking tickets a year. Vast majority go to people of color.' Cabán, a key sponsor, argued police use jaywalking as a pretext for stop-and-frisk, calling the law archaic and motorist-centered. Advocates raised concerns that the bill’s language might let drivers escape liability for hitting pedestrians, prompting its withdrawal. The law’s enforcement remains unequal, leaving vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, covered by the New York Post, states: 'Cabán—who was elected to office on a platform advocating less car use and cracking down on dangerous driving—received four tickets in the past 13 months for speeding her vehicle in school zones.' Ariola, joined by Councilman Robert Holden, accused Cabán of hypocrisy, highlighting the disconnect between Cabán’s advocacy for street safety and her own driving record. Cabán’s policy platform includes converting 25% of city roadways for people, building 1,000 miles of car-free streets, and expanding bus and bike lanes. No formal council bill or committee action is attached to this event, but the public dispute underscores tensions in the city’s push for safer, less car-dominated streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He demanded a redesign that separates speeding vehicles from people and creates safe corridors for mopeds away from recreational spaces.
