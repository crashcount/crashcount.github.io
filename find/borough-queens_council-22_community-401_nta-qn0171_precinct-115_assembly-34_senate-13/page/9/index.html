The stakes are high.</p><p class=mb3>On February 6, 2023, during a legislative hearing on MTA funding and fare policy, MTA Chair Janno Lieber testified that the agency needs $350 million more each year to prevent subway and bus fare hikes. The hearing, part of the state budget process, saw Lieber defend Governor Hochul’s proposed 5.5-percent fare increase as a return to regular hikes paused during the pandemic. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and colleagues pushed the 'Fix the MTA' package to freeze fares, boost service, and make buses free. Mamdani argued, 'It is simply not acceptable to put the cost of a basic public good on the backs of working class New Yorkers.' Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris criticized Lieber for insisting on fare hikes while dismissing other budget solutions. Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas opposed making her constituents pay more. Lieber expressed concern about free buses, preferring targeted affordability programs. The hearing highlighted a sharp divide: lawmakers want to protect riders; the MTA wants stable funding. No direct safety impact for vulnerable road users was assessed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The package, introduced by Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and Senator Mike Gianaris, includes eight bills: funding for six-minute off-peak subway and bus service, four years of free bus rides, and closing the MTA's fiscal gap. Council Member Amanda Farías introduced a resolution backing six-minute service. The letter states, 'Just as fund libraries and schools, we must fund transit—a public good that creates access to opportunities in life.' Cabán called the push a 'critical public safety initiative,' linking frequent, reliable transit to safer streets. The council's action signals a unified demand for robust, equitable transit funding.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The street, a DOT truck route, lacks bike lanes. Kao was the fourth cyclist killed in western Queens in under three years. Former Councilmember Costa Constantinides called the area a 'serious safety risk' and urged the DOT to study improvements and reroute trucks. Cabán called the crash 'devastating' and pressed city agencies for action. DOT spokesman Vin Barone promised immediate steps at the crash site and talks on protected bike lanes. Less than 1.5 percent of streets in Council District 22 have protected bike paths. Residents say the city prioritizes highway access over safety.

Despite Borough President Donovan Richards' support for the rezoning, citing cycling and EV promotion, the application faces strong local resistance.
