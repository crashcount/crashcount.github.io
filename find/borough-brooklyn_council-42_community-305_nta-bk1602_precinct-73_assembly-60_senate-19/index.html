Fifteen seriously hurt.</strong> That’s the count in Brownsville since 2022. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about hope or habit. They only rise. In the past twelve months, four people lost their lives here. Three were between 25 and 34. One was over 65. <strong>Children are not spared:</strong> 37 injured in the last year alone.</p><p>Just last month, a cyclist was crushed at Newport Street and Rockaway Avenue. A 40-year-old man, hip and leg broken, pinned by a car. The week before, a child was hit on Herzl Street. The driver was distracted. The child bled on the pavement. <strong>Every week, another family waits in the ER.</strong></p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage.</strong> Since 2022, they have killed one person and injured 169 more on Brownsville’s streets. Trucks and buses hit 14. Motorcycles and mopeds, two. Bikes, three. The numbers are plain. The pain is not.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Some leaders have moved. Council Member Darlene Mealy co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks. It could save lives, if enforced. State Senator Jabari Brisport voted yes to extend school speed zones. He also backed a bill to force repeat speeders to install limiters on their cars (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>File S 4045</a>). But the streets are still not safe. <strong>The deaths keep coming.</strong></p><p>Neighbors see it. After a hit-and-run killed two men in Brooklyn, a local said, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>&ldquo;drivers speed on that stretch of roadway.&rdquo;</a> The city knows. The numbers do not lie.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. <strong>Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras.

The suit alleges Dram Shop Act violations and city liability. No council bill or policy change is involved.

The fight over safety and street space continues. Cyclists and pedestrians wait as legal battles stall change.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC reported on July 15, 2025, that an appellate judge halted Mayor Adams’s plan to remove a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue. Judge Ventura issued a restraining order after Transportation Alternatives and Baruch Herzfeld appealed the city’s move. The city had planned to start demolition after complaints from local leaders, but the court’s order blocks any changes until further review. Streetsblog quotes Ben Furnas: 'The Adams administration is going to have to spend their night preparing their legal case, not ripping out a critical safety project.' The article highlights weak enforcement of parking rules and the city’s reversal against its own DOT’s safety plan. The case underscores how political pressure and lax enforcement can threaten vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city’s own Department of Transportation found the protected lane cut crashes and injuries by 47 percent, but the judge called the change 'only a modification.' She wrote, 'Modification of the bike lane is not a major transportation project.' Critics, including Council Member Lincoln Restler, say the removal endangers vulnerable road users and bypasses public input. The decision highlights gaps in notification laws and the risk of reverting to unprotected lanes on a Vision Zero priority corridor.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
