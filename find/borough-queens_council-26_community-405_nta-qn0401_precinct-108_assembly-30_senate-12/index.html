Over one thousand injured.</strong> These are not just numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. In the last twelve months alone, <strong>one person died and 297 were hurt</strong> in 566 crashes. One was a child. One was someone’s parent. The street does not care who you are.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians take the worst of it.</strong> Trucks, SUVs, bikes, mopeds—each has left bodies broken or dead. A 43-year-old woman, crossing with the light, was killed by a turning dump truck on 80th Street. A 75-year-old man died after a bike hit him at Broadway and Roosevelt. A 78-year-old woman was struck by a moped in a crosswalk. A man was crushed by an SUV on Broadway.

But the deaths keep coming. The city has new powers under Sammy’s Law to lower speed limits to 20 mph. The law is on the books. The streets are not yet safer. <strong>Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt.</strong> Each delay is another risk, another family left to mourn.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>The most vulnerable pay first.</strong> In Elmhurst, the old and the young are hit hardest. Cars and trucks killed and maimed. Bikes and mopeds, too. The street is a gauntlet. The city counts the bodies. The politicians count the votes.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every crash is preventable. Every death is a failure. <strong>Call your council member. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that put people first.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
