The group’s ranks swell with each tragedy. No specific bill or committee is named in this event. Kuntzman’s statement underscores the relentless danger faced by pedestrians and cyclists. The safety analyst notes: the event describes a new member joining an advocacy group, which does not directly affect pedestrian or cyclist safety at the population level.

The article states, "Forcing horses to pound the pavement with heavy carriages in Midtown, where they compete with motor vehicles, bicyclists and pedestrians, is inhumane." Seventeen council members, led by Robert Holden (bill sponsor) and Erik Bottcher (district includes stables), support the ban. Speaker Adrienne Adams has blocked a hearing and vote. The piece highlights recent incidents where bolting horses injured at least four people, including a pedicab driver. Despite the vivid danger, the safety analyst notes: "The event text does not describe any policy or legislative change affecting pedestrians or cyclists, so there is no direct impact on their safety." The bill remains stalled in committee, with no relief for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, first announced under former Mayor Bill de Blasio, faced delays after Mayor Eric Adams took office. The north outer roadway is now for cyclists, the south for pedestrians. State Senate Deputy Majority Leader Michael Gianaris, District 12, praised the completion, saying, 'After years of advocacy, many of us were excited to see [the city's Department of Transportation] complete the work to open new, dedicated pedestrian paths on the Queensboro Bridge.' Gianaris also criticized the unexplained delays. The plan ends years of conflict and danger for vulnerable road users forced to share a narrow lane.

The city must weigh the cost—and the gains.</p><p class=mb3>On April 14, 2025, a policy analysis by Charles Komanoff examined the impact of fare-free buses in New York City. The report, covered by Streetsblog NYC, found that eliminating fares would cut bus trip times by 12 percent and boost annual ridership by 169 million, a 23 percent jump. The study states: 'Each dollar of city government support would produce more than two dollars worth of benefits for residents, primarily by removing the burden of fare payments while providing faster and more reliable bus service.' Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and State Senator Michael Gianaris, both of Queens, have pushed the MTA to consider free buses. Komanoff’s analysis shows that faster buses mean less time waiting, cleaner air, fewer crashes, and a small but real drop in car trips. The report adds fuel to the debate over city funding for free bus service.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The study, covered by Streetsblog, found that eliminating fares would speed up bus trips by 12 percent and increase annual ridership by 169 million—up 20 percent. The report states: "Fare-free buses would juice bus speeds and ridership while also bringing economic benefits to bus riders themselves." State Senator Michael Gianaris, representing District 12, is mentioned as a supporter. The analysis, led by Charles Komanoff, shows that removing fares slashes dwell times and makes service faster and more reliable. While the shift from cars to buses is modest, the benefits for bus riders are clear: less waiting, more access, and safer streets. The debate over funding and implementation continues in the council.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They warned, 'Any further delays to this project that is otherwise ready to open will unnecessarily put at risk the thousands of New Yorkers who cycle and walk the current shared path every day.' The project, in the works since at least 2017, remains stalled. Cyclists and pedestrians are forced to share a cramped, hazardous lane.

Other lawmakers and advocates echoed frustration, questioning MTA management and calling for state responsibility. Despite heated criticism, council members did not strongly oppose the request in session.
