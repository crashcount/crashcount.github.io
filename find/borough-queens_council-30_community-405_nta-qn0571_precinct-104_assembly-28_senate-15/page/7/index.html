The legal action, filed by Lower East Side residents, business owners, and elected officials, claims the toll will create a traffic nightmare and worsen pollution by diverting cars to the FDR Drive. The suit argues the MTA and federal government failed to conduct an adequate environmental review and did not consider impacts on local businesses or vulnerable residents. The matter summary reads: 'Lower East Side residents sue MTA over $15 congestion toll, claiming it will create a traffic nightmare.' Holden’s involvement signals council opposition. The MTA maintains the program, approved in 2019, will cut congestion and fund transit upgrades.

Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, Lincoln Restler (primary sponsor), Amanda Farías, and others led the charge. The law aims to expose patterns in police stops and holds officers to account.

Holden (District 30) published an op-ed opposing his own bill to require registration and licensing for e-bikes and e-scooters. The bill, introduced in the New York City Council, would impact the city’s 65,000 app-based delivery workers. The op-ed warns: 'What might sound benign at first would actually lead to a substantial increase in state surveillance and regulation of New York City's 65,000 app-based delivery workers.' Holden’s action—introducing the bill—has drawn sharp criticism for enabling more NYPD stops and fines, especially against Black, Latine, and immigrant riders. The piece details how similar enforcement has led to racial profiling and financial hardship for those least able to bear it. No safety analyst assessment was provided, but the op-ed makes clear: more policing means more danger for the city’s most vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

NYPD tickets rise, but repeat offenders dodge tolls and cameras. Advocates warn: weak enforcement means more cheating, less safety, and crowded streets. The city cracks down, but loopholes remain.</p><p class=mb3>Bill action centers on license plate enforcement as congestion pricing approaches. On December 11, 2023, Councilmember Robert F. Holden (District 30) supported raising fines for drivers using fake or obscured plates. The matter, reported by Gothamist, highlights a surge in 'ghost cars'—vehicles with covered, defaced, or phony plates—dodging tolls and speed cameras. Holden stated, "If somebody can save a lot of money by obscuring their plates, they'll do it." The NYPD has increased enforcement, but many offenders remain undeterred. Advocates and experts, including Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives, warn that without strict enforcement, congestion pricing goals and street safety will suffer. The city has banned camera-blocking covers and encourages public reporting, but unresolved complaints and repeat violations persist. Holden's push aims to make penalties outweigh the savings from toll evasion, seeking legislative action to protect the program's integrity.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Holden (District 30) led a push for his bill requiring license plates and registration for all e-bikes, e-scooters, and similar vehicles. The bill, introduced last year, has 31 co-sponsors and awaits a hearing in the Council's transportation committee. Holden said, 'Let’s find out who they are,' targeting e-bike riders and citing safety concerns. The bill summary states it would require 'license plates and vehicle registrations for any electric bike, scooter or other motorized vehicle.' At a City Hall rally, Holden and supporters pointed to injuries and deaths from lithium-ion battery fires. Pamela Manasse, a crash survivor, called e-vehicles a danger. Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives criticized the bill, saying it shifts blame from drivers and ignores the need for safer street design and better regulation of e-bike sales and batteries.

GOP figures like Nicole Malliotakis and Michael Lawler call it a 'burdensome tax' and 'outrageous cash grab.' Mayor Eric Adams seeks exemptions for medical trips.

The meeting opened with a standing ovation for Holden, but tensions rose when NYPD Deputy Inspector Erik Worobey praised deliveristas for safer riding.

The E-VSA’s nine-point plan calls for reclassifying e-bikes as mopeds, ending a park e-bike pilot, and NYPD confiscation of e-vehicles on sidewalks, with a $500 retrieval fine. The group frames itself as victims of 'rogue' riders, though city statistics show drivers of larger vehicles cause far more injuries. The bill does not address mopeds or provide funding, and critics say it ignores the dangers faced by delivery workers, 26 of whom died between 2020 and 2022.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
