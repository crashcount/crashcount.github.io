Holden (District 30) welcomed reports that the Trump Administration may halt New York City’s congestion pricing plan. The policy, effective since January 5, charges drivers $9 to enter Manhattan below 60th Street. The matter, titled 'New York officials, orgs denounce reports of Trump move to halt congestion pricing,' drew sharp lines. Holden called the toll a 'scam' and hoped the federal government would end it. Transit advocates and city officials, including MTA CEO Janno Lieber and Comptroller Brad Lander, warned that stopping the program would mean more traffic, dirtier air, and worse transit. Lieber said, 'Better bus service, faster drive times and safer streets are good for all New Yorkers.' The debate now centers on whether to keep or kill a measure credited with reducing cars and making streets safer for those outside vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Holden (District 30) criticized the exemption of top city officials from New York’s $9 congestion toll. The controversy centers on the MTA’s emergency vehicle exemption, which lets law enforcement vehicles—including those chauffeuring Mayor Eric Adams, Comptroller Brad Lander, and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams—avoid the toll. The bill’s matter summary highlights the hypocrisy: 'They shouldn’t be exempt from congestion pricing. They shouldn’t have chauffeurs. It’s disgusting,' Holden said. Lander and Williams previously celebrated the toll’s benefits for transit and air quality, but now face backlash for not paying it themselves. The measure’s status is controversial, with no direct safety analyst note, but critics argue the exemption undermines public trust and leaves the city’s most vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, and transit riders—bearing the burden.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
