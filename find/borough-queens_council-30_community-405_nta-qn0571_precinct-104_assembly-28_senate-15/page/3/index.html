Danger meets concrete.</p><p class=mb3>On August 23, 2024, the Department of Transportation announced a project to install protected bike lanes and new sidewalks along Cypress Avenue, connecting to Ridgewood Reservoir. The plan, presented to Queens Community Board 5 in June, calls for a two-way cycle path protected by jersey barriers and sidewalk expansions between Cooper Avenue and Cypress Hills Street. The matter summary states: 'Protected bike lanes and built-out sidewalks are coming to Cypress Avenue to provide a safe connection to Highland Park.' Council Member Bob Holden, usually a cycling skeptic, supports the project. His spokesperson said, 'This particular lane benefits those biking to and from the Ridgewood Reservoir and addresses a broader quality of life issue along Cypress Avenue.' Advocates like Bree Mobley of Ridgewood Riders back the plan, citing the area's crash history—166 crashes, 99 injuries in three years. The project targets a corridor marked by high injury and death rates, aiming to shield vulnerable road users from relentless traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, covered by the New York Post, states: 'Cabán—who was elected to office on a platform advocating less car use and cracking down on dangerous driving—received four tickets in the past 13 months for speeding her vehicle in school zones.' Ariola, joined by Councilman Robert Holden, accused Cabán of hypocrisy, highlighting the disconnect between Cabán’s advocacy for street safety and her own driving record. Cabán’s policy platform includes converting 25% of city roadways for people, building 1,000 miles of car-free streets, and expanding bus and bike lanes. No formal council bill or committee action is attached to this event, but the public dispute underscores tensions in the city’s push for safer, less car-dominated streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brannan (primary sponsor, District 47) and Robert F. Holden (co-sponsor, District 30) lead the push. The bill targets drivers who cover or deface plates to evade speed, red-light, and bus-lane cameras. Data shows unreadable plates rose from 3.98% to 4.66% in one year. The city lost up to $38.7 million in unissued tickets between 2019 and 2022. The resolution calls for higher fines, confiscation of plate coverings, and registration suspensions.

Introduced June 6, 2024, by Council Member Robert F. Holden, the measure urges the State Legislature and Governor to 'introduce and pass... legislation increasing penalties on drivers who improperly register vehicles in another state.' The resolution cites data: 11,000 injuries and 62 deaths in 2021 crashes involving out-of-state cars. Out-of-state vehicles made up 19% of city crashes that year. Holden’s action targets drivers who skirt taxes, fees, and insurance, shifting costs and risks to New Yorkers. The bill is a call to close loopholes and hold reckless drivers accountable.

Lee warned, 'The congestion toll will really hurt our economy, really hurt our recovery.' Holden called the toll 'insane' and argued it would drive up costs for businesses and consumers. The MTA defended the plan, citing a 4,000-page environmental assessment and promising less traffic, safer streets, and cleaner air.

Low curbs mean water floods sidewalks. Pedestrians wade through puddles. Property owners get fined. Ariola leads, Holden, Paladino, Vernikov back her. Committee reviews. No action yet. Streets stay risky.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0603-2024 sits in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure since March 7, 2024. The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring that the department of transportation maintain curb heights following street construction,' targets a simple failure: after street work, curbs often vanish, water pools, and property owners get fined for city mistakes. Council Member Joann Ariola sponsors, joined by Holden, Paladino, and Vernikov. The bill orders DOT to restore curbs to proper height after any street, sidewalk, or gutter work. The committee has not voted. The bill aims to stop flooding and fines, but leaves the daily hazard for walkers and wheelchair users unaddressed until passed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
