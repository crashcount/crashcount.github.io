Despite support for measures like speed camera reauthorization, most bills to protect pedestrians and cyclists died in committee or never reached the floor. Assembly Member Amy Sohn and others criticized the lack of action. The only major win was extending the city’s speed camera program. A safety analyst notes: 'Failure to advance livable streets policies likely maintains the status quo, which typically prioritizes car-centric infrastructure and neglects the safety and needs of pedestrians and cyclists.'

The case, covered by Streetsblog NYC, cites City Administrative Code Section 19-101.2, which requires proper notice before removing a bike lane. The matter summary states, "Plaintiffs, including Transportation Alternatives and Williamsburg resident Baruch Herzfeld, seek a temporary restraining order, claiming that cyclists would be irreparably harmed by the loss of a safe route." Council Member Lincoln Restler, author of the notification law, filed an affidavit supporting the plaintiffs. The Department of Transportation claims the lane will shift, not disappear. The safety analyst notes: "The event text describes a legal threat but does not specify any policy or legislative action, so its direct impact on pedestrian and cyclist safety cannot be determined." The case is pending a judicial ruling.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move followed requests from Williamsburg residents and came after a recent town hall. The mayor’s statement read: 'he is taking away the bike lane on Bedford Avenue... to better reflect community feedback.' Council Member Lincoln Restler condemned the decision, calling it 'purely a political decision' and warning it would 'lead to more tragic crashes.' No council bill number or committee was involved; Adams acted alone. Removing the protected bike lane reduces safety for cyclists, discourages cycling, and undermines street equity.

Streetsblog NYC reported: 'A protected bike lane that was installed last year to calm a notoriously dangerous Brooklyn corridor will be removed by the Adams administration, making the roadway less safe.' Council Members Lincoln Restler and Chi Ossé condemned the move, calling it reckless and political. Brad Lander and Zohran Mamdani joined in opposition. No council bill or committee review occurred; this was a unilateral mayoral action. Removing the lane eliminates a proven safety intervention, increasing risk for cyclists and pedestrians and discouraging active transportation, which undermines safety in numbers and equitable street access.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Lincoln Restler condemned the move, calling it 'a purely political decision to rip out a bike lane with no alternative.' Transportation Alternatives noted pedestrian injuries fell 10% and driver injuries 42% after the lane was installed. The safety analyst warns: 'Removing a parking-protected bike lane and replacing it with a painted lane reduces physical protection for cyclists, likely decreasing safety and discouraging cycling, especially on a hazardous stretch.'

The push follows a fatal crash at Monitor and Driggs, where a driver killed 73-year-old cyclist Teddy Orzechowski.

The project aims to connect neighborhoods and calm traffic. DOT Assistant Director Dustin Khuu said the goal is a 'high performing transit priority street.' The plan includes concrete bus boarding islands and may reduce car lanes, giving more space to pedestrians and buses. However, the article notes gaps: 'DOT didn't share a block-by-block breakdown,' and curbside parking may remain, risking bus lane obstruction by double-parked vehicles. The city may physically protect the lane, but details are pending. The B41 bus, serving 28,000 daily trips, crawls at 4 mph during rush hour. The proposal highlights the need for clear enforcement and design to keep cars out of bus lanes and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Gallagher expressed frustration, warning that every delay means preventable crashes and lives lost.
