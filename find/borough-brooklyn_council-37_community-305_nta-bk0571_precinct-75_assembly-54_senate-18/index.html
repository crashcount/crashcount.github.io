Streetsblog NYC reports: 'renewing calls from advocates for the city to redesign the dangerous street.' Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez, State Sen. Julia Salazar, and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher back the push. Advocates want a protected bike lane, mid-block crossings, and safer loading zones. Despite meetings and official letters, the city has not acted. The safety analyst notes: advocacy alone brings no immediate safety change, but it could spark future improvements. The danger remains until the city moves.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Council passed the bill with a veto-proof majority. Council Member Sandy Nurse, the sponsor, called out Adams for breaking his 2022 promise to raise pay standards. The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection backed the bill, saying it would close gaps in pay protections. According to safety analysts, this event concerns labor protections and does not directly affect street safety or infrastructure for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Eighteen caucus members back the bill, aiming to force a vote this year. The matter: 'eliminate parking within 20 feet of an intersection.' Council Member Sandy Nurse called daylighting 'a proven, effective way to make our streets safer.' DOT raised doubts about non-hardened daylighting, but safety analysts say restricting parking near intersections improves visibility, reduces collisions, and protects people on foot and bike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter reads: 'Establishes a school speed zone camera demonstration program in the city of White Plains; repeals authorization of program December 31, 2030.' Mayer led the push. Most senators and assembly members voted yes. The bill aims to catch speeding drivers near schools, a known threat to children and families.

The bill carves out large Mitchell-Lama housing from bus traffic rules. Lawmakers voted yes. The carve-out weakens enforcement. Streets grow less safe for people on foot and bike.</p><p class=mb3>Bill S 7785, titled 'Relates to bus operation-related traffic regulations,' passed the Senate and Assembly in June 2025. The measure, sponsored by Senator Jamaal Bailey, excludes violations in cooperative housing developments with at least 10,000 Mitchell-Lama units from bus operation traffic regulations. The bill advanced through committee and received broad support in both chambers. By exempting these large complexes, the law weakens traffic enforcement where thousands live. This move increases risk to pedestrians and cyclists, stripping away protections that save lives. Vulnerable road users lose another layer of safety in dense city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A cyclist strikes. Bedford Avenue’s protected bike lane will vanish. City listens to complaints, not data. Streets stay dangerous. Cyclists and children caught in the crossfire. Policy shifts, safety left behind.</p><p class=mb3>CBS New York reported on June 14, 2025, that Mayor Eric Adams will remove three blocks of the protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn after several crashes, including one involving a child exiting a school bus. The mayor cited 'community concerns' and stated, 'After several incidents—including some involving children...we decided to adjust the current design.' City Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized the move, calling it 'pure politics' and warning, 'He is going to make this area less safe for pedestrians, for cyclists.' The article highlights tension between local complaints and street safety policy. No driver error is cited; the crash involved a cyclist and a child. The decision raises questions about how New York responds to vulnerable road users and whether removing infrastructure addresses underlying dangers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
