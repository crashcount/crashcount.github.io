Saada and her daughters, ages 8 and 5, died; her 4-year-old son was critically injured. Yarimi was driving with a suspended license and now faces manslaughter charges.

A driver with a suspended license crashed, then hit the family in a crosswalk. The youngest son survived after surgery. Nine others were hurt. The street ran red with grief.</p><p class=mb3>According to the New York Post (March 29, 2025), a suspended driver with a record of '15 school zone speeding and red-light tickets in the last 12 months' collided with an Uber and struck a family crossing Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch called it 'a horrific tragedy caused by someone who shouldn’t have been on the road.' The crash killed Natasha Saada, 35, and her daughters, Diana, 7, and Debra, 5. A four-year-old son was critically injured but survived surgery. The Audi driver, Miriam Yarimi, was arrested at the scene. Policy gaps loom: Yarimi’s history of fines and violations did not keep her off the road. Both drivers were to be tested for impairment. The incident highlights systemic failures in keeping dangerous drivers away from city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
