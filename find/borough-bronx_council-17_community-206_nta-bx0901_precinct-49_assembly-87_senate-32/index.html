A 71-year-old woman driving the sedan was injured, with chest pain noted; other occupants were listed with unspecified injuries. According to the police report, the contributing factor was “Driver Inattention/Distraction.” That driver error appears across the involved parties and undercuts any safe passage at this intersection. No other contributing factors were listed. The impact points—SUV left front bumper into the sedan’s right front quarter and doors—show a hard lateral hit.
