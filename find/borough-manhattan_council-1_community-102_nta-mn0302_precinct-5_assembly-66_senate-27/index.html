Fifteen left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong> In just over three years, the Lower East Side has seen 1,627 crashes. Cars, trucks, bikes, and mopeds—steel against skin. <strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong></p><p>A pickup truck on Water Street crushed four people on July 4, 2024. Three women and a man, all pedestrians, died where they stood. An eleven-year-old boy survived with his face torn open. No warning. No time to run. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash data from NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>A city worker, fixing a street sign at dawn, was slashed by a delivery cyclist after a near miss. &ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t even in the bike lane, they were parked on the corner, fixing the light or the sign or something,&rdquo; a witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/electric-biker-slashes-city-worker-nearly-crash-lower-manhattan/>said</a>.

The bill sits in committee, waiting. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Council records on Legistar</a>.</p><p>Senator Kavanagh voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed-limiting devices. The law targets the worst offenders, but the carnage continues while the process drags on. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Bill details on Open States</a>.</p><p>On Canal Street, Council Member Marte <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/03/09/opinion-its-time-for-immediate-action-on-canal-street>said</a>, &ldquo;The time is long overdue to take action in response to the dire conditions of Canal Street. He pledged his support to take action.&rdquo;</p><p>Political solutions must be citywide, not local gestures. New York must lower its default speed limit across the city and require speed-limiters (intelligent speed assistance) for habitual speeders. The Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045) pushes speed-limiter tech for repeat offenders; implementing citywide lower limits plus targeted speed-limiter requirements would cut kinetic force and save lives.</p><h2 id=the-cost-of-waiting>The Cost of Waiting</h2><p><strong>Every delay is another body on the pavement.</strong> The city has started daylighting intersections and lowering speed limits, but the pace is glacial. The Fifth Avenue redesign cut bike and bus lanes to keep car lanes wide. &ldquo;We want a real solution to the bike and pedestrian safety issue,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/14/civic-panel-dings-adams-for-cutting-bike-and-bus-lanes-out-of-fifth-av-redesign>said a community board leader</a>.</p><p>The dead cannot wait.</p><p>Concrete steps the city and local leaders should implement now:</p><ul><li>Install Leading Pedestrian Intervals (LPIs) and hardened curb turns at dangerous crossings.</li><li>Expand daylighting and daylighting enforcement near crosswalks; ban curbside parking that blocks visibility.</li><li>Deploy targeted enforcement and traffic-calming on corridors with high severe-injury and truck involvement.</li></ul><p><strong>Call your council member.

Construction timelines are missing. Parks Commissioner Iris Rodriguez-Rosa says it maps "strengths and weaknesses." The Midtown Greenway showcase still leaves the East Side gap.

Seven hours in the heat. The driver shook the reins. The horse did not rise. The city watched. The jury acquitted. The street stayed silent.</p><p class=mb3>Patch reported on July 21, 2025, that a New York City carriage driver was acquitted after his horse, Ryder, collapsed and later died on W. 45th St. in 2022. Prosecutors said the horse was outside for over seven hours. Video showed the driver shaking the reins as Ryder lay on the street. Councilman Holden, citing the horse's age, called the incident 'cruelty.' The case renewed calls to ban horse carriages. The jury found the driver not guilty after a five-day trial.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Manhattan D.A. dismissed the charge, noting Backus rode a non-motorized bike.
