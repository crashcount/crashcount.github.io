Since January 2022, 420 people have been injured and 15 seriously hurt in traffic crashes in Upper East Side-Carnegie Hill. One person is dead. The bodies are not just numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. A 16-year-old cyclist, cut open in the gut by a passing car. An 81-year-old woman, her head split by an SUV while she tried to cross behind a parked car. The street does not forgive.</p><p>Just last month, eight people were sent to the hospital when a car and SUV slammed into scaffolding on Madison Avenue. The news reported, &ldquo;Eight people were hurt in the crash. All of the injuries are believed to be non-life-threatening,&rdquo; according to <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/2-vehicle-crash-upper-east-side-scaffolding-injures-8-people-manhattan/17376667/>ABC7</a>. No word on charges. No word on why. Only the sound of sirens and the scrape of metal.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p>The old and the young take the brunt. In the last 12 months, 13 people over 75 were hurt. Four children under 18. The street is not safe for anyone, but it is cruelest to those with the least armor. Cars and SUVs do most of the damage—107 injuries to pedestrians from these vehicles alone. Trucks, buses, bikes, mopeds—they all play a part, but the big machines do the worst.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>The city talks of safety. Council Member Keith Powers backed a bill to ban parking near crosswalks. Assembly Member Alex Bores pushed for moped registration and better crash data. Senator Liz Krueger voted to extend school speed zones and co-sponsored a bill for speed limiters on repeat offenders. But the pace is slow. Congestion pricing, a proven way to cut traffic and save lives, was paused. Powers said, &ldquo;[The state] certainly should take advantage of this very expensive infrastructure in Midtown&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/us-news/gov-hochul-mta-lack-plan-b-for-nyc-congestion-pricing-infrastructure/>NY Post</a>. The machines sit idle. The danger does not.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p>No more waiting. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand the city use every tool—speed cameras, street redesign, real enforcement. Every day of delay is another body in the street.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

They raced the M34 bus across 34th Street to expose slow bus speeds. The event asked: 'Is it faster to walk across town or take the bus?' Russo-Lennon and others backed bus improvements, highlighting how cars choke streets and trap riders. The demonstration drew support from Council Members Erik Bottcher and Keith Powers, and city officials. The safety analyst notes this was a demonstration, not a policy change, so it does not directly affect pedestrian or cyclist safety or system-wide outcomes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan aims for a 'complete street'—space for pedestrians, cyclists, transit, and limited cars. The article notes, 'Their (mostly) shared goal is to make 14th into what's often called a complete street.' The study will assess traffic flow and street dynamics. The busway, which restricts cars, may become permanent. No crash or injury data is cited, but the focus is on systemic street changes, not individual driver actions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Chaos thrives where speed meets congestion.</p><p class=mb3>West Side Spirit (2025-07-06) reports a crash on Central Park’s West Drive, near West 60th Street. An illegal electric unicycle hit a cyclist, sending its operator to the hospital in critical but stable condition. The cyclist, Carolyn Backus, was wrongly charged with leaving the scene, though she "remained on scene for about 45 minutes after the crash and waited for paramedics." The Manhattan D.A. dismissed the charge, noting Backus rode a non-motorized bike. The article highlights the risk of high-speed e-vehicles in crowded park zones, where "unpredictable congestion makes it the last place...anyone should be speeding."</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Safety and equity stalled.</p><p class=mb3>""The 14th Street busway is a great example of what happens when you do deep public engagement but also remain committed to the goal of speeding up bus service. Elected officials representing this area have come out in support of it. We have a great example from 14th Street that proves out this kind of project, and we do not want to find out another example from this administration of them making last minute decisions to pull important projects without consulting with the elected officials or giving us an alternative plan."" -- Keith Powers</p><p class=mb3>On July 3, 2025, the Adams administration paused the 34th Street busway project, as reported by Streetsblog NYC. The matter, described as a 'highly-anticipated 34th Street busway,' had support from Council Members Erik Bottcher, Keith Powers, and others. Bottcher called it 'transformative,' promising fewer crashes and faster buses. Powers slammed the last-minute reversal. Safety analysts warn: canceling the busway preserves car dominance, discourages transit, and keeps streets unsafe for pedestrians and cyclists. The project’s future is uncertain. Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
