Six seriously hurt. Seventy-six injured.</strong> These are not numbers from a war zone. They are the toll of traffic violence in Riverdale-Spuyten Duyvil since 2022. No one under 18 has died, but the old are not spared. A 99-year-old woman was killed crossing at West 235th and Oxford. She was struck by an SUV making a left turn. She died in the crosswalk. The driver failed to yield. The glare did not kill her.

In the last year alone, 74 crashes left 30 people hurt. One was left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Pedestrians, cyclists, children—none are safe. SUVs and sedans do most of the damage. The numbers show it. <strong>SUVs killed. SUVs maimed.</strong></p><p>A bus nearly plunged off the Henry Hudson Parkway overpass in January. The driver swerved to avoid a double-parked car. The wall gave way. The bus hung over the edge. No one died, but the street was littered with debris and fear. &ldquo;We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it. Thankfully, nobody was hurt,&rdquo; <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/public-safety/2025/01/17/mta-bus-rescued-after-partially-driving-off-bronx-overpass->said Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz</a>.</p><h3 id=leaders-speak-streets-stay-dangerous>Leaders Speak. Streets Stay Dangerous.</h3><p>After the bus crash, Councilman Eric Dinowitz said, &ldquo;That’s a very big bus, so even going very slowly, it can do a lot of damage. I think it speaks to the importance of enforcing our parking rules because it was going around a double-parked car. And we’re seeing all over the city parking regulations not being enforced.&rdquo; <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/public-safety/2025/01/17/mta-bus-rescued-after-partially-driving-off-bronx-overpass->NY1</a></p><p>The words are true. The action is slow. The wall is still broken. The cars are still double-parked. The next crash waits.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits. It can build safer crossings. It can enforce the law. But it will not move unless you force it. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement. Demand streets where no one dies for crossing the road. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Riders and pedestrians face the same old risks.</p><p class=mb3>West Side Spirit reported on June 19, 2025, that New York City is considering a 15 MPH speed limit for e-bikes, but implementation faces legal and bureaucratic delays. Mayor Eric Adams said, "there’s going to be a whole rule making process to make sure that we comply and follow the laws." Critics argue the plan singles out e-bikes while ignoring faster, heavier vehicles. Ben Furans of Transportation Alternatives called it "half-baked and ill-conceived," noting that "bikes and cars sharing the same road would be subject to different speed limits and consequences." Janet Schroeder of the E-Bike Safety Alliance doubts the rule will matter without real enforcement. The NYPD already issues thousands of criminal summonses to cyclists for minor violations, raising questions about fair and effective policy. No new enforcement methods or crash data were cited.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Four new elevators will rise. Three Harlem Line stops in the Bronx will open to all. The city’s transit spine grows stronger for those left waiting longest.</p><p class=mb3>On June 18, 2025, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced a sweeping accessibility project for three Metro-North Harlem Line stations in the Bronx: Williams Bridge, Woodlawn, and Botanical Garden. According to the MTA, crews will completely rebuild Williams Bridge and Woodlawn, installing four new elevators—two at each station—to ensure full accessibility. The matter summary states: 'comprehensive renovation and accessibility project at three Metro-North Railroad Harlem Line stations in the Bronx.' Christian Murray reported the announcement. No council bill number or committee applies, as this is an agency initiative, not legislation. The upgrades promise to open transit to riders long shut out by stairs and barriers. Improving station accessibility encourages more walking and cycling to transit, supports mode shift away from driving, and benefits vulnerable users by making the built environment more inclusive and safer.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
