The project, promised by the previous mayor for completion by the end of 2022, was pushed back at least a year. Won, whose district covers the bridge’s eastern approaches, led a walkthrough with DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and staff from Council Members Julie Menin and Selvena Brooks-Powers. Won said, “They kept saying they can’t give the south outer roadway to pedestrians because there would be traffic. Well, I don’t care about the congestion!” She forced the commissioner to stand in the cramped lane, showing how unsafe it is for both cyclists and pedestrians. DOT offered only minor adjustments, like repainting lines, which Won dismissed as “missing the point.” The agency promised lawmakers data to justify keeping five car lanes, but Won insisted the delay puts lives at risk and called for immediate action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident, which killed 74-year-old Be Tran at Myrtle and Seneca Avenues, triggered public outcry. Gianaris criticized the city’s process, saying, 'They have to wait until that happens to get the score high enough to realize that an intersection needs protection.' He joined activists from the Ridgewood Tenants Union and Transportation Alternatives, demanding new signals and better street design. Gianaris said he contacted the Department of Transportation a year earlier with no result. The city claims over 20 traffic control approvals in Ridgewood, but residents and advocates say it’s not enough.

The Department of Transportation (DOT) delayed the conversion of the South Outer Roadway to a full-time pedestrian path until at least the end of 2023, citing ongoing bridge repairs. The shared path, only 11 feet wide, is far below DOT’s own safety standards. Injuries have increased as usage soars—nine cyclists hurt in three years, up from three. Julie Won said, "People walking or biking on the shared path are paying with bloody pavement and broken bones, all so the DOT can promote car travel for the few." DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez claims the project is a priority, but the city’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed. Nine lanes for cars, half a lane each for people.

No law.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0556-2022 was introduced in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on June 16, 2022. The bill required owners of commercial buildings over 500,000 square feet to submit and carry out delivery and servicing plans. The matter summary reads: 'creating an office of sustainable delivery systems and requiring large generator of truck traffic buildings to produce and implement a delivery and servicing plan.' Council Member Gale A. Brewer sponsored the bill, joined by Rivera, Gutiérrez, Restler, Won, Sanchez, and Cabán. The bill called for on-site loading, delivery reservations, and off-peak scheduling to cut truck traffic and street loading. It would have created a new city office to oversee compliance and penalize violators. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023.

Riders in transit deserts face long waits, missed trains, and crowded platforms. The resolution highlights gaps in service that strand working New Yorkers far from Manhattan.</p><p class=mb3>Res 0110-2022 was filed by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The resolution, introduced April 14, 2022, and filed at session's end on December 31, 2023, urges the MTA to 'adjust schedules for distant subway terminal lines to include more peak-direction rush hour trains for commuters to travel to central economic hubs.' Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by Brooks-Powers, Hanif, Bottcher, and others. The bill responds to service gaps hitting outer boroughs, end-of-line stations, and transit deserts—areas where 600,000 New Yorkers live with poor transit access. The council points to pandemic-era staffing shortages and train cancellations that left riders stranded. The measure aims to push the MTA to close these gaps and connect more New Yorkers to jobs and opportunity.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
