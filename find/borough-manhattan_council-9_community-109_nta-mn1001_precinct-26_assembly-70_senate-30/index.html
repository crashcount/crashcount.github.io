Nine left with life-changing wounds.</strong> In Harlem (South), the numbers do not tell the whole story, but they do not lie. Since 2022, cars, SUVs, trucks, bikes, and mopeds have crashed 1,225 times. <strong>Pedestrians and cyclists bear the brunt.</strong> In the last year alone, 159 people were injured—one a child, left with a serious injury. The street does not care about age. It takes the young and the old, the walker and the rider.</p><p>A 67-year-old cyclist was left incoherent and bleeding after a taxi struck him on 8th Avenue. The crash report lists only two words: &ldquo;Driver Inattention.&rdquo; No one else paid the price. (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash report</a>)</p><p>On West 125th, a pedestrian was slashed across the face by a passing e-bike. The record says &ldquo;severe lacerations.&rdquo; The street remembers the blood, not the reason.

She also backed the extension of <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>school speed zones</a>, a small shield for children crossing the street. Council Member Yusef Salaam sponsored a <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>pilot for high-visibility pavement markings</a>, demanding the city mark the places where blood has already been spilled.</p><p>But the work is slow. The pain is not. <strong>&ldquo;We want a real solution to the bike and pedestrian safety issue,&rdquo;</strong> said <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/14/civic-panel-dings-adams-for-cutting-bike-and-bus-lanes-out-of-fifth-av-redesign>CB 5 Vice Chair Samir Lavingia</a>. <strong>&ldquo;We need to do something to make sure bicyclists feel safer.&rdquo;</strong></p><h3 id=the-street-remembers-what-we-forget>The Street Remembers What We Forget</h3><p><strong>SUVs, sedans, taxis, bikes, trucks, mopeds—each leaves its mark.</strong> The city counts the wounds. It does not count the fear. The sidewalk is not safe. The crosswalk is not safe. The bike lane is not safe. The only thing that changes is who bleeds next.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people, not just promises.</strong> The street will not wait. Why should you?</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
