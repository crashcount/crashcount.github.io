Cleare also backed a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters, aiming to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>curb repeat dangerous driving</a>.</p><p>But the street is still a gauntlet.

Every day of delay is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=the-call-demand-more-demand-now>The Call: Demand More, Demand Now</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call your council member.
