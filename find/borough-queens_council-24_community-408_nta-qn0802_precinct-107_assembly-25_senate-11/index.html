But the blood did not stop. Ninety-eight people were hurt. Two were left with serious injuries. In three and a half years, there have been 335 injuries and five serious injuries in this small corner of Queens. The pain is spread out, but it is relentless. It comes for the young and the old. Five children under 18 were hurt in the last year. Ten people over 65. No one is spared. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>injury data</a></p><h3 id=the-pattern-crosswalks-and-corners>The Pattern: Crosswalks and Corners</h3><p>Pedestrians crossing with the signal are still struck. On Union Turnpike and 175th Street, a 23-year-old man was hit by a sedan while crossing with the light. He survived, but with a bleeding head. On Jewel Avenue and 164th Street, a 64-year-old woman was hit the same way. She lived. She bled. Both drivers failed to yield. The law says pedestrians have the right of way. The street says otherwise.</p><p>Cyclists are not safe either. On Union Turnpike and 164th Street, a 42-year-old man on a bike collided with an MTA bus. He left the scene with a torn scalp. The bus kept going straight. The cyclist was changing lanes. The road does not forgive mistakes. It does not care who is right.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h3><p>No deaths is not victory. It is luck, or the slow grind of fate. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so here. Cameras catch speeders, but only where they are installed. The council and the mayor have the tools. They have not used them all. The numbers are down, but the risk is not gone.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not over. The next crash waits at the next corner. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that do not bleed.</p><p>Do not wait for the first death.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
