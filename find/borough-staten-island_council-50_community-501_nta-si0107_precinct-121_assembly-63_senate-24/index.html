This year through Sep 5: <strong>211 crashes, 110 injuries</strong>, compared to <strong>190 crashes, 106 injuries</strong> at this point last year; two people were killed by this time last year, none so far this year (CrashCount analysis of city data).</p><p>Routines break at the curb. A 73‑year‑old man was killed by a turning van at Forest Ave and South Ave on Nov 21, 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data, CrashID 4583662</a>). Forest Ave shows up again and again in the records. So does Richmond Ter.</p><p>Forest Ave, Union Ave, South Ave. The records say left turns, inattention, and bad merges. At <strong>5 PM, injuries peak</strong> in this dataset, the worst hour on the clock here (CrashCount analysis of city data). Trucks and vans are in the log too, including the case above where a van killed a pedestrian (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data, CrashID 4583662</a>).</p><p>“That&rsquo;s one accident every four days where somebody perhaps unwittingly thinks they must turn from the middle lane,” Staten Island Borough President Vito Fossella said of confusing bus‑lane rules on Hylan Blvd — different corridor, same borough — after tallying crashes tied to bad signs (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/bus-lanes-staten-island-hylan-boulevard/>amNY</a>). Signs matter. So do turns.</p><p>Where the street fails</p><ul><li>Forest Ave at Union Ave needs slower turns and clearer priority. Daylighting and hardened corners can keep turning drivers off people in the crosswalk. A leading pedestrian interval would give walkers a head start (CrashCount analysis of city data).</li><li>South Ave at Richmond Ter is a freight route. Tighten radii at turns and add truck‑safe signal timing to cut conflicts (CrashCount analysis of city data).</li></ul><p>Speed is the wound that never closes</p><p>Citywide tools exist. The Senate’s <strong><a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a></strong> would force repeat speeders to use speed‑limiting tech. State Sen. <a href=/senate-district/23/>Jessica Scarcella‑Spanton</a> voted yes in committee on June 12, 2025 (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). Assembly Member <a href=/assembly-district/63/>Sam Pirozzolo</a> voted no on a separate school speed‑zone bill; State Sen. Scarcella‑Spanton also voted no on that measure (timeline records). Council Member <a href=/council-district/49/>Kamillah Hanks</a> co‑sponsors <strong><a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1339-2025</a></strong> to let ambulettes use and block bus lanes — a change that pushes people into traffic (timeline records).</p><p>A safer default speed is on the table. New Yorkers can press the city to lower the limit on local streets, and to back the repeat‑speeder bill that would keep the worst offenders from roaring through crosswalks. The next move is public.</p><p>Act</p><ul><li>Tell City Hall and Albany to slow cars and stop repeat speeders.

Pedestrians and cyclists get overdue protection. Full redesign still lags.</p><p class=mb3>On August 8, 2025, the NYC DOT announced new safety measures at the Manhattan Bridge's Canal Street terminus. The agency will lower the speed limit from 35 to 20 mph, narrow two travel lanes, and install concrete barriers after a driver killed a cyclist and pedestrian. David Meyer reported the announcement. No council member sponsored or voted. DOT says it will fast-track community engagement for a full redesign. Lowering speed limits reduces crash severity and likelihood, especially for pedestrians and cyclists near busy bridge exits, and follows best safety practices.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The piece, 'Northern Disclosure: Canada’s Road Laws Could Help Save U.S. Lives,' reviews a study showing Canada’s enforcement—like speed cameras and seat belt laws—cuts road deaths. Wilson urges the U.S. to learn from Canada but notes political barriers. No council bill or vote is attached. The statement is too vague to assess specific safety impacts, as it does not identify which Canadian roadway laws would be implemented or how they would affect pedestrians and cyclists.

Drivers turn from the wrong lane. Collisions mount. Bus lane rules shift by the hour. The street stays dangerous for those on foot and bike.</p><p class=mb3>According to amny (2025-08-05), collisions on Hylan Boulevard have risen due to unclear DOT signage about bus lane hours. Borough President Vito Fossella noted, “That’s one accident every four days where somebody perhaps unwittingly thinks they must turn from the middle lane.” The article reports 32 crashes in 2025 tied to drivers making right turns from the middle lane instead of the curb-side bus lane. Some signs list hours, others only say 'Bus Corridor Photo,' confusing drivers. The lack of clear, consistent information leaves intersections hazardous, especially for vulnerable road users. The report highlights a pressing need for better signage and clearer policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Donlon cites deaths and injuries, including cyclist Amanda Servedio. The suit alleges 398 crashes and 315 injuries in 2024—a 47% jump. Donlon's allegations highlight how high-speed chases increase risk to pedestrians and cyclists, introducing unpredictable, dangerous driving and eroding public trust in safe, equitable enforcement.
