The matter summary states: 'State lawmakers proposed spending $90 million this year to improve bus service frequency and expand the scope of the MTA's free bus pilot.' The proposal, supported by Sen. Michael Gianaris and Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, also adopts the FARES Act, extending half-price MetroCards to commuter rail, and funds new discounts for seniors and people with disabilities. Lawmakers back the QueensLink rail project and recommend subway improvements. They reject tougher toll enforcement, instead supporting the Toll Payer Protection Act.

Riders in every borough stand to gain.</p><p class=mb3>Bill proposals in the New York State Assembly and Senate, introduced in February 2024 by State Sen. Michael Gianaris and Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani, seek $90 million for increased bus service and 15 more free bus routes. These measures, part of the 'Get Congestion Pricing Right' package, appear in both houses’ 'one-house' budgets as of March 12, 2024. The matter summary states: 'City buses would run more frequently under new proposals from state legislators in Albany, who included increased bus services and new fare discounts in budget proposals.' Mamdani and Gianaris led the push, citing the need for better transit before congestion pricing launches this summer. Their plan includes expanded Fair Fares, new discounts for seniors and disabled riders, and a weekly CityTicket for unlimited intracity rail travel. Advocates and lawmakers argue these steps are critical for equity and access, especially as the city prepares to charge drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street. The proposals now enter negotiations with Governor Hochul.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, now before the legislature, seeks to expand New York City's fare-free bus pilot from five to fifteen lines, with three in each borough. The measure promises $45 million for better bus reliability and frequency, targeting low-income and disadvantaged communities. The bill summary states: 'expand and extend New York City's fare-free bus pilot program.' Gianaris, as sponsor, aims to boost mass transit before congestion pricing takes effect. Supporters, including Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, Riders Alliance, and the Transport Workers Union, stress that affordable, frequent buses are vital for safety and equity. MTA Chair Janno Lieber backs more service but warns that bus lanes lag behind. The bill focuses on routes that can handle more buses without new infrastructure, aiming to make public transit a real alternative to cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Mamdani accused Adams of 'incompetence' and violating the Streets Master Plan law, which requires 30 miles of new bus lanes each year. Reporters pressed for answers on mayoral compliance. MTA CEO Janno Lieber praised Adams's past promises but noted the lack of progress. The mayor's spokesperson defended the administration, but data shows bus speeds have dropped since Adams took office.
