Advocates noted the Department of Transportation failed to expand bike and bus lanes as required last year.

Committee: Requested by Council Member Chi Ossé. The IBO estimates, “the annual cost to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) associated with eliminating local bus fares ... would be $652 million if fares were waived for all riders.” Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani, a supporter of 'Fix the MTA,' cited the report as validation: 'if you allocate the money that we have asked for you'd absolutely be able to make buses free.' MTA CEO Janno Lieber warned of 'unintended consequences,' but the IBO counters, noting most subway trips will continue due to speed and frequency. The report also details costs for targeted fare-free programs. No direct safety impact assessment for vulnerable road users was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, covered by amny.com, called for a $300 million boost to the governor's plan, aiming to cut subway headways to six minutes, make buses free, and avoid fare hikes. The coalition, including the Riders Alliance and TWU Local 100, argued that current service leaves riders waiting over ten minutes and crawling on slow buses. Mamdani, prime sponsor of the Fix the MTA package, said, 'They are at risk of being priced out of one of their most basic human rights, the right to go around their city.' He pushed for higher corporate taxes to fund these improvements. TWU Local 100 president Richard Davis and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams also spoke out against service cuts. The governor's office did not endorse Mamdani's tax proposal.

Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris criticized Lieber for insisting on fare hikes while dismissing other budget solutions.
