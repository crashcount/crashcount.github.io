The forum, hosted by Streetsblog NYC, asked candidates how they would address reckless driving. Scott Stringer said, 'The best way to curtail reckless driving is to make less room for reckless drivers on the road.' Zellnor Myrie promised 'physically separated bus lanes' and expanded automated enforcement. Jessica Ramos called for 'a citywide strategy that prioritizes safety through design.' Zohran Mamdani wants to move traffic enforcement from NYPD to DOT, ending biased stops. Whitney Tilson supports more police and cameras. The candidates back protected bike lanes, busways, daylighting, and automated enforcement. Their plans center on street redesign and accountability, not blaming victims.

The candidates—Brad Lander, Jessica Ramos, Scott Stringer, Whitney Tilson, Zellnor Myrie, and Zohran Mamdani—support more dedicated bus lanes, stronger enforcement, and faster boarding. Scott Stringer calls for 'dedicated bus lanes, more enforcement, more shelters, better curbs, more transit signal priority, all-door boarding, and more frequent off-peak services.' Ramos blasts DOT for building only 23 of 150 mandated bus miles. Myrie pledges to exceed the city’s 30-mile annual target. Lander wants immediate all-door boarding and new busways. Mamdani promises rapid expansion and free buses. Each candidate frames bus reform as urgent, with vulnerable riders suffering most from delays and car dominance.

Brad Lander, Jessica Ramos, Scott Stringer, Whitney Tilson, Zellnor Myrie, and Zohran Mamdani answered. They called for more bus lanes, stronger enforcement, and faster service. No council bill was introduced; this was a public policy test, not legislation. According to the safety analyst, the event discussed bus speeds but did not specify any policy action affecting pedestrians or cyclists, so no direct safety impact can be assessed. The debate showed urgency but left vulnerable road users waiting for real change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Members Yusef Salaam, Tiffany Caban, and Lincoln Restler pressed NYPD Director Joshua Levin about stark racial disparities. The matter: 'Council members criticized NYPD leadership over racial disparities in traffic enforcement after the department refused to acknowledge evidence of bias.' Restler called the disparity 'extreme.' Caban said, 'Black and brown people are being beaten up, searched, arrested, 10 times more than white people.' The NYPD claimed disparities stem from policing high-crime areas. Lawmakers rejected this, citing data showing Black and Latinx drivers are disproportionately stopped, searched, and arrested. The hearing referenced the city’s long record of racially biased enforcement, including jaywalking laws once used to target Black and Latinx New Yorkers. Experts, including the NYCLU, say the Adams administration’s surge in traffic stops continues a pattern of racist policing.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city debates the next step.</p><p class=mb3>On April 14, 2025, a policy analysis highlighted the impact of fare-free buses in New York City. The study, covered by Streetsblog, found that eliminating fares would speed up bus trips by 12 percent and increase annual ridership by 169 million—up 20 percent. The report states: "Fare-free buses would juice bus speeds and ridership while also bringing economic benefits to bus riders themselves." State Senator Michael Gianaris, representing District 12, is mentioned as a supporter. The analysis, led by Charles Komanoff, shows that removing fares slashes dwell times and makes service faster and more reliable. While the shift from cars to buses is modest, the benefits for bus riders are clear: less waiting, more access, and safer streets. The debate over funding and implementation continues in the council.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On April 9, 2025, seven elected officials—including Council Members Julie Won and Julie Menin—sent a public letter demanding Mayor Adams open the long-promised Queensboro Bridge pedestrian path. The Department of Transportation had planned to open the dedicated walkway on March 16, but the mayor's office intervened, citing the need for a briefing. The lawmakers wrote, 'The reasons given for this delay are not satisfactory, as all communications from the DOT have indicated that the project is complete and ready to open to the public.' They warned, 'Any further delays to this project that is otherwise ready to open will unnecessarily put at risk the thousands of New Yorkers who cycle and walk the current shared path every day.' The project, in the works since at least 2017, remains stalled. Cyclists and pedestrians are forced to share a cramped, hazardous lane. City Hall insists on more review, while advocates plan a protest ribbon-cutting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The poll surveyed 854 likely voters. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani, who has championed free bus service since 2020, celebrated the results, saying, 'We know from our historic pilot program that free buses work: more riders, safer trips, cleaner air.' The MTA previously ran free bus pilots, reporting increased ridership and fewer operator assaults, though the agency questioned whether new riders joined. Danielle Deiseroth, Executive Director of Data for Progress, noted, 'People love free stuff.' The poll’s strong bipartisan support signals growing momentum for fare-free transit.

Surveillance footage showed Pena’s Mercedes striking Diaz’s BMW at high speed, sending it skidding down the street. Diaz, 23, died. Pena admitted at the scene, 'I hit him. I ran the red light. And I'm a firefighter.' The FDNY cited conduct rules in his dismissal. The article highlights Pena’s failure to render aid and notes his attempt to invoke his firefighter status. The case raises questions about accountability for city employees and the dangers of impaired, reckless driving on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
