The matter: 'Advocates and legislators raced up the stairs...to press their case for Gov. Hochul to do more to fill the MTA's fiscal gap.' Hochul’s plan stabilizes finances but does not boost service or halt fare hikes. Mamdani and Gounardes called for six-minute off-peak trains and new taxes on the wealthy. Gounardes said, 'We all know that we need better service and we need more service.' The proposal remains under negotiation.

Didi Barrett leads as primary sponsor, joined by Rebecca Seawright, Amy Paulin, Carrie Woerner, and many others as co-sponsors. The bill compels agencies to consider complete street design—meaning streets built for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users, not just drivers.

The centerpiece: advancing the Brooklyn-to-Queens Interborough Express light rail, described as 'better access to jobs, education and economic opportunities for some 900,000 New Yorkers.' Hochul also backed city control of speed limits, expanded CityTicket, and transit-oriented development. Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, representing District 36, criticized Hochul for omitting a concrete plan to address the MTA’s financial crisis, warning 'fare hikes and service cuts remain possible.' The speech left the MTA’s future in limbo. No safety analyst assessment was provided for vulnerable road users.

The event, covered in 'Hochul punts on new MTA revenue source amid threat of big fare hikes,' saw Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani (District 36) publicly criticize the lack of specifics, warning, 'In her silence on addressing the MTA’s operating deficit, Gov. Hochul leaves the possibility of fare hikes and service cuts on the table.' The MTA faces steep fare increases and possible service cuts if new funding is not secured. Hochul announced plans to rezone for more housing near transit to boost ridership, but offered no immediate relief. The absence of a concrete funding plan leaves vulnerable riders—those who depend on transit—at risk.

The street, a DOT truck route, lacks bike lanes. Kao was the fourth cyclist killed in western Queens in under three years. Former Councilmember Costa Constantinides called the area a 'serious safety risk' and urged the DOT to study improvements and reroute trucks. Cabán called the crash 'devastating' and pressed city agencies for action. DOT spokesman Vin Barone promised immediate steps at the crash site and talks on protected bike lanes. Less than 1.5 percent of streets in Council District 22 have protected bike paths. Residents say the city prioritizes highway access over safety.

New York City Transit President Richard Davey explained that peak hour service would be trimmed, with modest increases in wait times, while some weekend service would expand. Transit advocates and union leaders, including Richard Davis, condemned the cuts, warning of increased rider frustration and assaults on workers. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani urged passage of bills to freeze fares and fill the MTA’s fiscal gap, stating, "We have to fix the rot at the heart of the transit system."
