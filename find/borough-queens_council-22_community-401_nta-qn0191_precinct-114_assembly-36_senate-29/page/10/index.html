The numbers tell another story. Promised miles not built. Bus speeds drop. Riders stranded. Assembly Member Mamdani calls out broken promises. The city stalls. Streets stay dangerous for those outside cars.</p><p class=mb3>On February 6, 2024, Mayor Adams declared his administration had done an 'amazing job' building bus lanes. The facts cut through the claim. In 2022, only 12.9 miles of bus lanes were built out of a required 20. In 2023, just 13.3 miles out of a required 30. The Department of Transportation missed legal targets both years. The matter, as reported, states: 'Mayor Adams claimed... his administration has done an "amazing job" building bus lanes... despite missing legally required targets.' Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani, representing District 36, slammed the mayor for scrapping key projects and failing bus riders. Mamdani said, '49 percent of bus riders are dissatisfied with wait times... instead he's made 1.4 million daily bus riders take the slowest buses in the country.' Riders Alliance joined the criticism, demanding a real plan for the 130 miles of overdue bus lanes. The city’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed, with no clear agenda for safer, faster streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The compromise left two car lanes in each direction during the day. Elected officials—U.S. Rep. Nydia Velázquez, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, and Council Member Lincoln Restler—sent a letter urging DOT to restore the full safety plan, writing, “Nothing has been done to improve conditions for pedestrians.” Advocates say the new design increases crossing distances and leaves cyclists and pedestrians exposed.

Lawmakers, including State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez (District 59), call for strict regulation of emissions from last-mile e-commerce warehouses. The bill would require environmental reviews for warehouses over 50,000 square feet, mandate plans to cut air pollution, and push for zero-emission delivery vehicles. Gonzalez said, 'The unchecked growth of large warehouses in neighborhoods across NYC has worsened air quality, noise pollution, and traffic safety for everyday New Yorkers.' Assembly Member Marcela Mitaynes, a co-sponsor, highlighted the link between warehouse traffic, pollution, and traffic violence. The Red Hook Business Alliance and community advocates back the bill, citing heavy truck traffic, poor air, and threats to safety in working-class neighborhoods. The legislation aims to hold warehouse operators accountable and protect residents from the mounting toll of delivery-driven pollution and danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The MTA pushes fare enforcement. Lawmakers and labor say focus on service, not punishment. Riders, mostly working class, depend on these buses to survive.</p><p class=mb3>This policy debate, highlighted on November 16, 2023, centers on bus fare evasion, free bus pilot expansion, and transit funding. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani (D-Astoria) leads the charge, arguing, "We are hitting numbers that we are not recognizing, because our focus has been on fares." The MTA claims fare compliance is vital, but Mamdani and union voices like JP Patafio of TWU Local 100 urge investment in service and affordability. The matter underscores the working-class reliance on buses and the stalled rollout of OMNY, which limits all-door boarding. The debate pits fare enforcement against calls for free or reduced fares, with advocates demanding progressive taxation to fund transit. No formal council bill or vote is attached, but the stakes for vulnerable riders are clear: service, not policing, keeps them moving.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No formal council bill number is listed, but the Transportation Committee of Community Board 1 passed a resolution urging DOT to daylight all intersections. The matter, described as 'community advocacy for street safety and bike infrastructure,' drew over 150 residents to a public workshop. Council Member Zohran Kwame Mamdani attended, stating, 'Astorians showed up last night for pedestrian + bike safety.' Online organizing, especially on the MicromobilityNYC subreddit, brought new voices to the table and pressured NYPD to take traffic enforcement seriously. The area lacks protected bike lanes—only 3 percent of streets have them—while most residents do not own cars and rely on walking, biking, or transit.

The pilot, part of a state budget deal, makes one route per borough fare-free for up to a year. The official summary states: 'One MTA bus route will be free in each New York City borough starting Sunday.' Queens Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, mentioned in the coverage, said, 'Getting more New Yorkers on to public transit must be at the forefront of our plan for a greener NY.' The pilot covers the B60 in Brooklyn, M116 in Manhattan, Q4 in Queens, S46/S96 in Staten Island, and BX18 in the Bronx. About 44,000 weekday riders are affected. The MTA will monitor ridership and study the impact. Progressive lawmakers back the move to help low-income New Yorkers.

The Department of Transportation will install curbside protected bike lanes and reduce car lanes from two to one in each direction on most of the strip. However, north of Calyer Street, two lanes for cars will remain open during weekdays, reverting to parking lanes at night and on weekends. The plan, shaped after lobbying by business interests and mayoral adviser Ingrid Lewis-Martin, mixes two previous DOT proposals. Mayoral spokesman Charles Lutvak said, 'Traffic safety is a key priority for Mayor Adams, and we are delivering with a redesign of McGuinness Boulevard that will make this corridor safer for all road users.' Local officials, including Council Member Lincoln Restler, called it a 'critical step' but noted it lacks key safety elements. The compromise leaves gaps. Since 2021, 62 people have been injured on this stretch. The carnage continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The officials oppose credits for bridge and tunnel crossings.
