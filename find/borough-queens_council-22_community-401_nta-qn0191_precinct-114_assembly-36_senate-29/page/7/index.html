Manel was charged with failure to yield and failure to exercise due care. Nassau Avenue, a two-way street used by cyclists, lacks protective infrastructure. Following the crash, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, Council Member Lincoln Restler, and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velázquez called for passage of two state bills: one requiring repeat speeding offenders to install intelligent speed assistance devices, and Sammy's Law, which would let the City Council lower speed limits. They also urged the Department of Transportation to install raised crosswalks and daylighting at intersections. Their statement reads: “Lowering the speed limit and enforcing real accountability for dangerous drivers are urgent steps we must take to protect New Yorkers.”</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Mike Gianaris and Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani announced a $90-million proposal to expand bus service and the MTA's free bus pilot. The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, became a public reckoning for Mayor Adams's transportation record. The matter: 'a proposal in Albany to increase bus service before congestion pricing begins.' Mamdani accused Adams of 'incompetence' and violating the Streets Master Plan law, which requires 30 miles of new bus lanes each year. Reporters pressed for answers on mayoral compliance. MTA CEO Janno Lieber praised Adams's past promises but noted the lack of progress. The mayor's spokesperson defended the administration, but data shows bus speeds have dropped since Adams took office. No safety analyst has formally assessed the impact, but the lack of bus lanes leaves vulnerable road users exposed to traffic danger and slow, unreliable transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The lawmakers’ push follows a successful fare-free pilot, which Mamdani says increased ridership by over 20%. Gianaris admitted, 'It should have been done sooner.' Critics argue the move is too late, as congestion pricing was approved in 2019. Some unions warn of possible driver shortages, but Mamdani insists existing buses and operators can handle the expansion. The funding proposal comes as the congestion toll faces lawsuits and could launch by mid-June.
