The proposal aims to increase housing near transit, allow mixed-use zoning, and eliminate parking mandates. Council Members Joann Ariola and Vicki Paladino led opposition, calling the plan an 'unmitigated disaster' and disputing housing data. Ariola argued, 'That's what they bought in the suburbs for.' Other Queens officials and residents echoed fears for single-family homeowners and suburban 'character.' In contrast, Borough President Donovan Richards's spokesperson and some residents supported the reforms, citing the city's affordability crisis. The majority of public testimony favored the proposal, but entrenched opposition from Queens officials remains strong.

The state-level response included a rejected proposal to raise the payroll mobility tax (PMT) on NYC businesses to fill the $15 billion gap in the MTA’s capital plan. State Sen. Liz Krueger said, 'Payroll mobility taxes are actually taxes on workers... I do not think we have an appetite for that in the Senate.' Assembly Member Stacey Pheffer Amato, who once voted for congestion pricing, now supports the pause, calling the original vote 'political blackmail.' The MTA’s future projects, including the Second Avenue Subway, are threatened, as federal matching funds require local dollars. Lawmakers remain divided. No clear alternative has emerged.

The city, led by Mayor Adams, pushes a park-only project, funded by the U.S. Department of Transportation. Rick Horan, QueensLink’s executive director, argues the plan blocks a vital north-south rail corridor, denying disadvantaged communities access to jobs, education, and healthcare. The op-ed states: 'It is simply irresponsible to build a park on a viable transit right-of-way in the biggest city in America.' State Senators James Sanders, Jr. and Joe Addabbo, Assembly Member Stacey Amato, and Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers, JoAnn Ariola, and Bob Holden support studies and funding for the rails-and-trails QueensLink alternative.
