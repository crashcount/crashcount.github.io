Officers, following new NYPD pursuit rules, did not chase but instead set a roadblock. According to NYPD Chief John Chell, 'We didn't pursue the vehicle, we strategically radioed ahead to shut down traffic.' The driver, Jumaane Wright, swerved toward officers, nearly striking a lieutenant, who fired a single shot. Wright crashed a mile later and died at the hospital. The Attorney General's investigation is standard for such incidents. The case highlights risks in high-speed police interventions and the ongoing challenge of balancing pursuit policies with public safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, covered by nypost.com, followed a fatal stabbing and NYPD data showing felony assaults up 9% this year. Ariola warned, 'Forcing more New Yorkers underground with this ridiculous congestion pricing scheme is going to put more people into contact with the dangerously unwell.' She called the subway the city's 'de facto mental institution and homeless shelter.' The policy, supported by Governor Hochul, has increased subway and bus ridership by 6% and 9%. Ariola’s stance: congestion pricing endangers vulnerable riders, forcing them into unsafe conditions. The city has responded with more police and outreach, but many riders remain fearful.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
