Ten seriously hurt.</strong> In just over three years, the streets of University Heights (North)-Fordham have claimed five lives and left ten more with wounds that do not heal. <strong>822 people have been injured</strong> in 1,365 crashes since 2022, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.

Each injury, a story cut short.</p><h3 id=recent-wounds-fresh-grief>Recent Wounds, Fresh Grief</h3><p>The pain is not old. <strong>Two people have died and one suffered life-altering injury in the past year.</strong> A 65-year-old man was killed crossing with the signal at University Avenue and West Kingsbridge Road. A van turned right. He did not make it home. A 15-year-old girl died as a passenger on a moped, thrown and broken on West 192nd Street. A four-year-old boy, riding on a moped, died on Bailey Avenue.

Screams echoed. Blood on the sidewalk. Police hunt for suspects. Steel and flesh collided. No arrests.</p><p class=mb3>ABC7 reported on July 3, 2025, that a Ford Mustang struck six pedestrians after mounting the curb and crashing into scaffolding at East 149th Street and Courtlandt Avenue in the Bronx. The driver, stopped at a turn, accelerated into a crosswalk where 'people in the crosswalk had the right of way.' Witnesses described panic and pain. The suspects abandoned the damaged car and fled. All victims were hospitalized with minor injuries. The incident highlights risks at busy intersections and the danger when drivers disregard pedestrian priority.
