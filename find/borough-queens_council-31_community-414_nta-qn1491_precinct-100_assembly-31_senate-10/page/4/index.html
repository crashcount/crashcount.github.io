Toxicology reports showed alcohol, cocaine, and marijuana in his system, with a blood-alcohol level well above the legal limit five hours after the crash. Surveillance footage captured the collision.

Both bills require the Department of Transportation (DOT) to create public trackers for capital projects tied to the Streets Master Plan. Intro 1105, sponsored by Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, mandates a tracker for projects that count toward safety benchmarks. Intro 1114, sponsored by Council Member Julie Won, calls for a broader capital projects tracker. The bills respond to the Adams administration's failure to meet legal targets for bus and bike lanes. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams said, 'Today’s legislation will advance greater transparency.' DOT officials pushed back, arguing project work is not linear and trackers have limited use. Won countered, 'It is [the DOT's] responsibility to take their capital plan and implement it.' Advocates and council members agree: tracking is only a first step.

At a community meeting, Brooks-Powers said, "We’ve been trying to get [the bike lane] removed for three years. It wasn’t supported by the community. ... In effect it’s not a bike lane quite honestly; no one uses it, they [drivers] park there. We would like to see the hard infrastructure removed." Instead of demanding enforcement against illegal parking, she wants the lane ripped out, returning the street to a more dangerous state for cyclists and pedestrians. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez replied that building safe bike lanes requires support from local leaders. DOT spokesperson Will Livingston said the agency remains committed to safety and will explore hardening the lane and increasing enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

In 2024, DOT delivered only 5.3 miles of bus lanes and 25.7 miles of bike lanes. Brooks-Powers introduced Intro 1105, a bill requiring DOT to publish a tracker of its progress. She declared, "DOT gives us their word every hearing and we are not getting results." DOT First Deputy Commissioner Margaret Forgione objected, claiming the tracker would add paperwork and reduce community engagement. Brooks-Powers countered, "DOT needs to be more transparent about its project pipeline so we can identify bottlenecks." The committee signaled intent to advance the bill.
