Ariola argued, 'these cameras add additional financial strain to New Yorkers,' and claimed repeat offenders with fake plates escape punishment. Ariola’s SUV has 48 violations since 2017, including 27 for speeding in school zones and two for running red lights. She insists her record did not influence her vote.

The project, not a council bill but a city action, follows years of neglect and repeated crashes. DOT will cut traffic lanes from six to two, add a parking-protected bike lane, and expand pedestrian space. The plan also includes daylighting at intersections and improved markings. According to DOT, 'the project will improve safety for all users, providing connections to existing bike infrastructure and the reduction of a vehicle lane encouraging safer speeds.' Queens Borough President Donovan Richards praised the move, saying, 'Far too many people are killed and injured on our city’s streets, especially people of color, who are disproportionately impacted by traffic violence.' Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives added, 'DOT's move to turn car space into protected bike lanes on Seagirt Boulevard, while shortening crossings and expanding median space, will prevent speeding and make it safer to walk, bike, and take transit.'

The letter criticizes the MTA’s previous cost estimates and compares QueensLink’s need to the state-backed Interborough Express.

The Department of Transportation (DOT) launched the one-year, 24/7 busway pilot to speed up commutes for over 250,000 daily bus riders. Williams called her district a 'car community' and argued, 'there's only one metric of success for the bus lane and not looking comprehensively at how it's actually impacting the community.' Brooks-Powers claimed, 'People cannot access our local businesses.' Both members urged the city to end or shorten the pilot, citing business and driver complaints. DOT and transit advocates countered that bus speeds improved. The DOT plans to continue the pilot and survey businesses and riders at its end. No safety analyst assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and Mayor Adams announced the deal, but neither mentioned street safety in their press conference.

The measure, approved by state lawmakers three years ago, would charge drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street. The MTA faces hundreds of follow-up questions from the Federal Highway Administration, delaying the required environmental assessment. Ariola argued, 'I don’t believe it will work, in fact I believe it will make the city more unmanageable to travel through.' The plan is intended to reduce traffic, lower car pollution, and fund MTA capital improvements. Delays put $1 billion in annual funding at risk, threatening upgrades like accessible subway stations and zero-emission buses.
