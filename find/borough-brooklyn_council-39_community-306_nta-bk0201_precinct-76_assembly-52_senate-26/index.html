The MTA’s $68.4 billion capital plan for 2025-2029 funds the project. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes said, “With elevators coming to the Smith-9th Street station, that’s finally going to change.” Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon praised the MTA for prioritizing accessibility. The upgrades follow a court settlement requiring 95% ADA-accessible stations by 2055. Safety analysts note: elevator installation boosts access for people with mobility challenges but does not directly impact street safety for pedestrians or cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Sunset Park stands up. Residents, officials, and advocates demand the city end delays. No fixes yet. Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>""Here we are, once again gathering to mourn another preventable tragedy on our streets. But it doesn't have to be this way,"" -- Andrew Gounardes</p><p class=mb3>On July 24, 2025, Sunset Park residents, Council Member Alexa Avilés, Assemblymember Marcela Mitaynes, Senator Andrew Gounardes, and advocates rallied for urgent street safety fixes on Third Avenue. BKReader reports: 'Fatalities on Third Avenue...are preventable with safety upgrades.' The Department of Transportation's plan has stalled for two years. Avilés called the corridor 'persistently dangerous.' Gounardes said, 'We know how to fix it: safer street design.' No council bill or committee is listed. The event shows strong community demand, but no policy action has been taken. As of now, there is no direct impact on pedestrian or cyclist safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
