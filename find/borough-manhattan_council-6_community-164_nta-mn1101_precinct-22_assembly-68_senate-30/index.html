Eleven left with serious injuries.</strong> Eight hundred thirty-nine hurt since 2022. The dead include a child, an elderly woman, a cyclist, a pedestrian at a crosswalk. The living carry scars. The street does not care who you are. It takes the young and the old, the walker and the rider.</p><p><strong>Cars and trucks killed. Motorcycles killed. Bikes killed.</strong> No one is spared. A sedan strikes a child. A moped hits an elderly woman at the intersection. A cyclist dies at the hands of a truck. The numbers are not just numbers. They are names, faces, and families left behind.</p><h3 id=the-leaders-and-their-words>The Leaders and Their Words</h3><p><strong>Local leaders talk. The street keeps taking.</strong> In the last year, city officials have pointed to new laws and programs. Speed cameras now run all day and night. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the pace is slow. The carnage is not.</p><p>&ldquo;NYPD officers will be highly visible on New York City roadways… to deter unsafe driving and, when necessary, to take appropriate enforcement action,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/cyclist-fell-hit-head-swerving-avoid-pedestrian-central-park-has-died/16785901/>said Police Commissioner Edward Caban</a>.

The numbers say more than words.</p><h3 id=the-slow-march-of-change>The Slow March of Change</h3><p><strong>Crashes are not fate. They are the result of choices.</strong> The city has redesigned intersections, built bike lanes, and expanded pedestrian space. But the work is not done. The deaths keep coming. The injuries do not stop. <strong>Speed kills. Delay kills.</strong></p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Do not wait for another body in the road.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit.

Jonathan Rivera, who fatally shot Allan Feliz, unarmed, during a 2019 Bronx traffic stop. Judge Maldonado found Rivera's use of deadly force unjustified, writing it 'requires more than the mere possibility of danger.' Tisch disagreed, citing a 'split-second decision' and risk to another officer. The stop began over a seatbelt. Feliz tried to flee; Rivera fired once, killing him. Tisch's decision echoes the state attorney general, who declined charges.

Yu ordered, 'Get out of the car and show some ID,' and later, 'Get in the car! You're not going anywhere!' The woman was placed in the back seat of Yu’s vehicle. The arrest was later voided. The Attorney General’s office stated, 'OAG is investigating this matter internally and will not have further comment at this time.'

Cyclists using the Hudson River greenway must share space with highway-bound vehicles. The $150-million project includes only a painted, unprotected lane. DOT official Colleen Chattergoon said, "With the space that we have, we cannot accommodate a protected bike lane in that area." The city has not acted on a 2019 resolution calling for real protection. Community members and advocates question the safety of the design, especially for children. Officials promised to review the resolution but gave no timeline or details. The plan leaves cyclists exposed to fast-moving traffic, highlighting ongoing policy gaps in street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Residents fear traffic will flood side streets. Bus riders crawl at five miles an hour. Officials tout safety gains from 14th Street. Tension rises between speed, safety, and neighborhood calm.</p><p class=mb3>The New York Post (2025-06-08) reports that the city proposes restricting cars on 34th Street to create a busway between 3rd and 9th Avenues. Residents worry rerouted vehicles will jam local streets and worsen safety. Jessica Lavoie of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association warns, "diverting traffic from this critical corridor onto narrow residential streets would lead to increased congestion, safety hazards, and diminished quality of life." The Department of Transportation aims to replicate the 14th Street busway, which "reduced congestion, sped up bus travel and curbed accidents." The article highlights the ongoing struggle to balance efficient transit, tunnel access, and neighborhood safety. No specific driver errors are cited, but the plan underscores the systemic risks of shifting car traffic onto residential blocks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
