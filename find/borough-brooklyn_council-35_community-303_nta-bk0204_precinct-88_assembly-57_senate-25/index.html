Time stamp: May 17, 2025, 12:21 a.m. The impact was the right front bumper. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC’s crash record</a> shows the death and the body crushed.</li><li>A 33‑year‑old on a Vespa was ejected at Classon and Clifton and died.

The pattern is not subtle.</li></ul><p>On July 8, 2025, at 470 Vanderbilt, a Mini sedan hit a 28‑year‑old bicyclist. The file says the driver was inattentive. The rider was listed with “severe lacerations.” He was conscious. He wore a helmet. The sedan kept straight. The bike tried to avoid an object. The quarter panel tells the story. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The city file is blunt</a>.</p><p>“Apparent Death.” “Severe Lacerations.” The forms don’t scream. They don’t have to.</p><h3 id=where-the-street-breaks-you>Where the street breaks you</h3><p>The worst bodies stack on the same lines. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Brooklyn‑Queens Expressway</a> is a top hotspot for injuries and death tied to this neighborhood. So is <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Classon Avenue</a>. Fulton Street and Washington Avenue follow.</p><p>The clock tells its own truth. Injuries spike at school and commute hours: 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. carry dozens of hurt. Mid‑afternoon is worse. At 3 p.m., sixty‑eight injuries. At 2 p.m. and 1 p.m., near fifty each. Deaths show up at 1 p.m. and 4 p.m. The hours are stamped in the ledger. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The city’s counts don’t flinch</a>.</p><h3 id=what-causes-the-hurt>What causes the hurt</h3><p>The numbers point at hands on wheels. “Driver inattention/distraction.” “Failure to yield.” “Aggressive driving.” “Unsafe speed.” Mechanical failure barely registers. In these years, pedestrians took 91 injuries and one death. Cyclists took 115 injuries. SUV and car fronts do most of the damage. That is all in the city’s rollup. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open data lays it out</a>.</p><p>A state dataset shows the dead by age. Two people 55–64 died in the first half of this year in this area. Total crashes are up more than 60% year‑over‑year to 233 by mid‑June. Injuries up more than 50%. These are not curves. They are people. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The period stats are public</a>.</p><h3 id=police-van-red-light-a-man-dragged>Police van. Red light. A man dragged.</h3><p>On Eastern Parkway in 2022, an NYPD van sped, ran a red, and hit Ronald Smith. The van dragged him 35 to 40 feet. The state Attorney General released the video. His sister spoke after. “These officers drove an NYPD van so fast and recklessly&mldr; they dragged my brother&mldr; and had no regard for my brother’s life.” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/12/19/video-shows-cop-speeding-in-nypd-van-and-suggests-he-was-watching-a-soccer-game-before-fatal-crash>Read the AG release coverage</a>.

The city has the cameras running all day. Survivors keep pleading. The action items are not secrets. Our own guide shows how to push your council member and the mayor to set safer speeds and back limits on repeat speeders. <a href=/take_action/>Take action here</a>.</p><p>“Repeat speeders keep killing people in our district,” say sponsors of a bill to force speed limiters on the worst drivers. The Senate version moved in June. State Sen. Jabari Brisport voted yes in committee. The Assembly version lists local co‑sponsors. The bill would require speed‑limiting tech for drivers with a record of tickets or points. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Read the Senate file</a> and the <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">Assembly file</a>.</p><h3 id=a-last-thing-you-cant-unsee>A last thing you can’t unsee</h3><p>At 470 Vanderbilt, the injury note reads “Severe Lacerations.” At Fulton and Washington, the note reads “Crush Injuries.” The forms are short. The pain is not. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The files stay up</a>.</p><p>—</p><p>Bold steps save lives. Lower the default speed. Stop the super speeders.
