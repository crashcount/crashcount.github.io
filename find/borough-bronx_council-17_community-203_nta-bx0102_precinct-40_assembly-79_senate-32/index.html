So does <a href=#>Melrose Avenue</a>. These are not one‑offs. They are patterns. The dataset lists them as top sites by injuries.</p><p>Dead is precise. So are the case files. On April 2, 2025, an SUV going straight on 149th hit a 52‑year‑old pedestrian midblock. He died. Three SUVs were involved. The record is <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4803347</a>. On June 25, 2024, a taxi on East 149th struck a 61‑year‑old man crossing without a signal. He died too. That is <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4735638</a>.

Narrow the lanes.</p><h3 id=the-wider-frame>The wider frame</h3><p>Speed is the lever. Citywide, the tools exist. Albany passed Sammy’s Law; the city can set lower limits. Advocates are pushing for a default 20 mph. Our own coverage lays it out and cites the numbers on repeat offenders. The state is also moving on speed limiters for the worst drivers. The Senate bill S 4045 advanced in June; local senators voted yes in committee. Those devices cap speed to the limit plus five for drivers with long violation records.</p><ul><li>The push to drop speeds and stop repeat speeders is detailed in our <a href=/take_action/>action guide</a>, including the data on how a small group of drivers cause outsized harm.</li><li>State bill S 4045 drew yes votes in committee from Senators in this area; see the file and vote records <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>here</a>.</li></ul><h3 id=voices-from-the-aftermath>Voices from the aftermath</h3><p>“Two people were killed. He was drunk,” said a sister after a Bronx parkway crash that took two young riders. She asked why he walked free. “How could they let him go?” The case is not in Melrose, but it is in the Bronx, and it is now. The names were Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19, and Enrique Martinez, 21. Police charged the driver with vehicular manslaughter and DWI. The family’s words stand. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>NY Daily News</a> and <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Gothamist</a> reported them.</p><p>This is not numbers.

The plan aims for a 'complete street'—space for pedestrians, cyclists, transit, and limited cars. The article notes, 'Their (mostly) shared goal is to make 14th into what's often called a complete street.' The study will assess traffic flow and street dynamics. The busway, which restricts cars, may become permanent. No crash or injury data is cited, but the focus is on systemic street changes, not individual driver actions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
