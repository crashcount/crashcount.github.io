An 82-year-old, dead on 60th Street, struck by a motorcycle. A 67-year-old cyclist, ejected and killed on 53rd Street. A 70-year-old woman, crossing with the signal at 7th Avenue and 44th Street, struck by a turning sedan. In three and a half years, four people killed in Sunset Park (Central). Four more left with serious injuries. Behind each number, a family waits for news that will not get better.

In the last year alone, 2 killed, 1 seriously hurt, 142 injured. The dead are old and young. The injured are mothers, fathers, children. The street does not care. The numbers do not stop.

They are the weapon in most deaths and injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds take lives too. Bikes leave bodies broken, but not dead. The risk is not shared. The risk is forced onto those outside the steel shell.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The state passed Sammy’s Law, letting New York City lower speed limits. But in Sunset Park (Central), the blood dries faster than the laws change. No local leader has stepped forward to claim this crisis. No bold redesign. No surge of enforcement. The silence is loud. The street stays the same.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Every crash is a choice made by leaders who refuse to act. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand that the city use the power it has.

The Senate passed the measure 38-21; three city senators—Stephen Chan, Andrew Lanza, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton—voted no. The Assembly passed it 110-31, with nine city lawmakers—Alec Brook-Krasny, Lester Chang, Simcha Eichenstein, Michael Novakhov, Stacey Pheffer Amato, Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Reilly, David Weprin, Kalman Yeger—opposing. The Streetsblog NYC article, 'Ye Shall Know Their Names! Meet the Dirty Dozen City Pols Who Voted Against Speed Camera Program,' quotes lawmakers dismissing speed cameras as revenue grabs or burdens. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action, so no direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists can be assessed.'

The city issued over 3,000 warnings during a 90-day grace period. Similar enforcement on Queens-bound trucks led to a 60% drop in overweight vehicles.

The new design 'daylights' corners, using concrete, granite, and planters to keep cars back and create mini-protected bike lanes. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' The agency targeted intersections with a history of turning crashes—Ocean Avenue saw 79 crashes in 2024, injuring 75 people, including 15 pedestrians and 13 cyclists. Advocates praised the move but called for faster, broader use of hard infrastructure. The article notes that most pedestrian injuries and deaths in New York occur at intersections, and that keeping corners clear is standard in other states.

The department claims it is responding to e-bike complaints, but has offered no data. Council Member Alexa Avilés (D-Sunset Park) condemned the policy, saying, 'contact with the NYPD is a premise for the deportation pipeline.' She accused Mayor Adams of political maneuvering and failing to address street safety equitably. Lawyers warn that criminal charges can derail immigration cases, exposing workers to ICE. App companies like Uber Eats oppose criminalization, while GrubHub urges legal compliance. Transportation Alternatives launched a petition against the crackdown. The Adams administration also leaked a draft bill to regulate delivery apps, but it has stalled. The new enforcement targets the city’s most vulnerable road users—immigrant cyclists—putting their safety and futures at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
