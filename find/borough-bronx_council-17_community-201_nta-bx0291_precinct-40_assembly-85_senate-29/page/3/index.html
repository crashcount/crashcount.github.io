One thousand trucks a month will vanish from Bronx streets. Boats and cargo bikes will haul food across the city. Less diesel. Fewer big rigs. The city shifts freight off the road, onto water.</p><p class=mb3>On April 23, 2025, city officials and Con Agg Global announced a new floating freight dock at the Hunts Point Food Distribution Center. The project, backed by the Economic Development Corporation and Council Member Rafael Salamanca, aims to move food by boat and e-cargo trike instead of trucks. The matter summary states: 'Replacing truck trips with boat trips and cargo bikes is a key feature of the city's urgent push to shift cargo trips out of big trucks.' EDC President Andrew Kimball said, 'The goal is, over time, to move more and more of this food out of Hunts Point not by truck, but by water with e-cargo trikes.' The dock will remove one thousand trucks per month from South Bronx streets. Officials plan to expand docks citywide. The bill’s status is an active infrastructure rollout, not a legislative vote. No direct safety analyst assessment was provided, but the shift promises fewer trucks where people walk and ride.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Rahimi, the driver, said, "We were driving right off here. Something fell off the train, damaging the windshield." Passenger Malnick described, "A bolt hit and then right away just the sound of glass exploding and glass all over me." The incident echoes previous cases: in 2019, falling debris from elevated tracks struck vehicles three times in a month. The MTA responded then by intensifying inspections, but the problem persists. The agency now says it is investigating and will inspect the area. The repeated incidents highlight ongoing risks from aging infrastructure above city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
