The suit claims the redesign would "jeopardize" safety and hinder emergency access, despite DOT data showing 190 injuries and two deaths in the area since 2020. DOT says the project targets "unpredictable vehicle movements" and double parking, with design elements "found on streets across the city." The agency says it incorporated feedback from 90% of local businesses. The legal fight spotlights tension between safety improvements and business concerns, as the corridor ranks among Queens' most crash-prone.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
