Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights.

The Department of Transportation, Parks, and Environmental Protection must add planted medians, tree beds, or stormwater infrastructure, focusing on high-priority investment areas. Council Member Shekar Krishnan sponsored the bill, joined by Feliz, Avilés, Nurse, Banks, Restler, Ung, Schulman, Holden, Hudson, and Yeger.
