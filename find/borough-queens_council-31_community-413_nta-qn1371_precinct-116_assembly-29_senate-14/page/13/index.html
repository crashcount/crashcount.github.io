The matter, described as a call for a moratorium on car-related development, pits housing needs against car infrastructure. Council Member Julie Won supported the board, stating, "It should be a neighborhood rezoning instead of spot rezoning... we need to make it safer and more liveable." Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas also opposed the dealership, urging the space be used for affordable housing and highlighting dangerous driving by existing dealerships. Despite Borough President Donovan Richards' support for the rezoning, citing cycling and EV promotion, the application faces strong local resistance. The City Planning Commission now reviews the case, with a City Council vote possible. The board and electeds argue more cars mean more risk for pedestrians and cyclists on a deadly stretch.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The dispute, reported by nypost.com, began with Holden calling the plan 'another tax on hardworking New Yorkers' and demanding a referendum. Richards retweeted Holden, suggesting an 'actual Democrat' should replace him, and responded to a supporter with 'Yeah white supremacy.' The exchange escalated, drawing condemnation from other officials. The matter centered on the policy to charge motorists entering Manhattan below 60th Street. Holden joined a bipartisan press conference urging Governor Hochul to let voters decide. The spat revealed sharp divides over congestion pricing, with Holden opposing the plan and Richards defending it. No formal council bill or vote was involved, but the fight highlighted the political and racial tensions surrounding street safety and car use in New York City.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The legislation, championed by Council Member Carlina Rivera and supported by Transportation Committee Chair Selvena N.

The bill focuses on low-income and underserved neighborhoods, with a final plan due by December 2024 and updates every five years. Rivera said, 'All of us are here today because we believe in a future where New Yorkers of all backgrounds... can safely access active transportation.' Brooks-Powers called it 'a real opportunity... to make a profound impact.' Advocates like Jon Orcutt of Bike New York praised the move, urging the city to build 'real infrastructure for cycling.'

Brewer questioned DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez’s assertion that 750 of 1,000 intersections were redesigned, citing public data showing fewer than 400. Brewer said, “I love the idea of using her committee's investigatory power to explore whether the Adams administration has indeed redesigned 750 of the promised 1,000 intersections... or whether it done fewer than that, as the agency's own public data shows.” She confirmed her intent to use committee investigators and hold an oversight hearing. The matter, titled “City Council oversight inquiry into DOT street safety implementation and data transparency,” highlights DOT’s lack of documentation and reliance on signal retiming over physical improvements. Advocates and Brewer demand full transparency and real progress. Road deaths remain high, and the city lags on legal mandates for bus and bike lanes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The first phase includes $5 million for environmental review and $30 million for the Metropolitan Hub. The matter summary states: 'converting a defunct LIRR branch into a Highline-style park in Queens.' Council Member Lynn Schulman supports the park, calling it 'shovel-ready.' Borough President Donovan Richards and Assembly Members Jenifer Rajkumar and David Weprin back both the park and the QueensLink transit proposal. Richards said, 'We need to do both when it comes to making sure that we can enhance our public transportation and also ensuring that our communities have access to open space.' Transit advocates warn the park blocks future rail service, cutting off faster commutes and cleaner air for southern Queens. The MTA previously cited high costs for transit reactivation.

The project, promised by the previous mayor for completion by the end of 2022, was pushed back at least a year. Won, whose district covers the bridge’s eastern approaches, led a walkthrough with DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and staff from Council Members Julie Menin and Selvena Brooks-Powers. Won said, “They kept saying they can’t give the south outer roadway to pedestrians because there would be traffic. Well, I don’t care about the congestion!” She forced the commissioner to stand in the cramped lane, showing how unsafe it is for both cyclists and pedestrians. DOT offered only minor adjustments, like repainting lines, which Won dismissed as “missing the point.” The agency promised lawmakers data to justify keeping five car lanes, but Won insisted the delay puts lives at risk and called for immediate action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They wrote to Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, stating, 'Every year, we see how much New Yorkers enjoy the car-free street and associated activities, and we are writing to ask you to bring this beloved event to our respective boroughs in 2023.' The Department of Transportation said it would review the request. Advocates like Juan Restrepo and Jackson Chabot joined the call, demanding more hours and borough-wide access. Community groups stressed the benefits for families and children. The program is described as cost-effective, crime-free, and vital for community building. No formal council bill or vote yet, but the push is clear: open streets for all, not just Manhattan.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, not a council bill but a city action, follows years of neglect and repeated crashes. DOT will cut traffic lanes from six to two, add a parking-protected bike lane, and expand pedestrian space. The plan also includes daylighting at intersections and improved markings. According to DOT, 'the project will improve safety for all users, providing connections to existing bike infrastructure and the reduction of a vehicle lane encouraging safer speeds.' Queens Borough President Donovan Richards praised the move, saying, 'Far too many people are killed and injured on our city’s streets, especially people of color, who are disproportionately impacted by traffic violence.' Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives added, 'DOT's move to turn car space into protected bike lanes on Seagirt Boulevard, while shortening crossings and expanding median space, will prevent speeding and make it safer to walk, bike, and take transit.' The redesign targets a stretch with 222 crashes and 87 injuries since 2019, aiming to end the long-standing danger for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
