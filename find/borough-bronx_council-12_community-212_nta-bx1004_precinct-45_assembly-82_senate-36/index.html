Teenagers, faces broken, after a police pursuit ended in a crash. <strong>No one is spared.</strong></p><h3 id=road-rage-gunfire-and-the-price-of-inaction>Road Rage, Gunfire, and the Price of Inaction</h3><p>On a June night, a minor crash. Words. Then gunfire. <strong>Keino Campbell, 27, a Navy veteran, shot dead in his car.</strong> His mother, Suzette Thomas, said, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/u-s-navy-veteran-killed-road-rage-arrest-nyc/>&ldquo;I want people to remember my son as a humble person, one to do the best for the world.&rdquo;</a> His father <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bronx-road-rage-arrest-made-navy-veteran-keino-campbell-shot-killed-dispute/16766460/>pleaded</a>, &ldquo;Stop jumping out of car and shooting people, guys. Use your insurance. That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s for.&rdquo;</p><p>This is not just a story of cars and speed. It is a story of lives ended for nothing. Of families left with empty chairs and words that cannot be unsaid.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-the-waiting>Leadership: Promises and the Waiting</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. Of lower speed limits. Of cameras that catch the reckless. But in Co-Op City, the grind continues. <strong>No new laws or redesigns have come to these corners.</strong> The numbers do not lie: 477 crashes, 1 death, 242 injuries. The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has the power to harden crosswalks and protect the old and the young. <strong>It has not used it here.</strong></p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand action, not words.</strong></p><p>Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home. The city will not save you unless you force its hand. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter summary states: 'comprehensive renovation and accessibility project at three Metro-North Railroad Harlem Line stations in the Bronx.' Christian Murray reported the announcement. No council bill number or committee applies, as this is an agency initiative, not legislation. The upgrades promise to open transit to riders long shut out by stairs and barriers. Improving station accessibility encourages more walking and cycling to transit, supports mode shift away from driving, and benefits vulnerable users by making the built environment more inclusive and safer.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
