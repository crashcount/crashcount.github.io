The lane, installed in October, had reduced crashes, according to DOT data. Plaintiffs argued removal would increase danger and violated city rules on public notice. The city’s lawyers dismissed its own safety data, claiming it was unreliable. Alexa Sledge of Transportation Alternatives warned, “Mayor Adams is exposing the City of New York...to significant financial and legal liability.” Attorney Peter Beadle urged Adams to let DOT implement safer alternatives. The decision highlights how political pressure can override proven safety measures.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'before this bike lane from 2018 to 2022 this is the area that had the second largest numbers of pedestrian fatalities and crashes in the city.' The lane faced opposition from some Hasidic leaders, citing children running into the lane from illegally parked cars and buses. Despite tweaks—school bus zones, daylighted corners, no standing areas—drivers kept parking illegally, blocking sightlines and endangering children. The city rarely removes protected lanes, but Adams acted after political pressure. Moving the lane to Classon Avenue, as some demand, would force cyclists onto a chaotic BQE ramp.
