In the last twelve months, 224 people were hurt in crashes here. Three were left with serious injuries. Children, elders, men and women—no one is spared. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crashes come day and night</a>. A 71-year-old woman, crossing with the signal, was struck and left unconscious at Jerome and Burnside. A man’s leg crushed, a head split open, a life changed in seconds. The numbers pile up. The pain does not end.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hurt-us>The Machines That Hurt Us</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage.</strong> In three years, they caused 32 pedestrian injuries, including four serious ones. Motorcycles and mopeds hit 13, leaving one with a serious injury. Bikes hurt two. Trucks, buses, and even an ambulance added to the count. No one walks these streets without risk.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p><strong>The city talks of Vision Zero.</strong> They say the streets are safer. They point to new laws, like Sammy’s Law, that let the city lower speed limits. But in Mount Hope, the danger remains. The city has the power to set a 20 mph limit. They have not used it. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. Promises are made. Action is slow. The bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. Every injury is a choice made by leaders who delay, who wait, who do not act. <strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that do not bleed.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter summary states: 'require app-based delivery companies to provide their workers with certified e-bikes or underwrite their access.' The law covers all delivery apps and sets targets by company size. Workers cannot be deactivated for lacking compliant bikes.

Critics like Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives call the proposal 'half-baked and ill-conceived,' arguing it unfairly targets cyclists while drivers face lesser consequences for greater harm. Janet Schroeder of the NYC E-Bike Safety Alliance doubts the limit will matter without enforcement: 'The 15 mph speed limit does nothing.'

Officers left the scene unreported. Family demands answers. Two investigations run. Streets stay dangerous. System failed to protect. The dead remain silent.</p><p class=mb3>CBS New York reported on April 27, 2025, that Francisco Andres Guzman Parra, 31, died after crashing a stolen vehicle on Dyckman Street in Manhattan following an NYPD pursuit. The article states, "NYPD sources said the two officers in pursuit returned to their stationhouse without reporting the crash." The FDNY later found Guzman Parra dead in the burning car. Patrick Hendry of the Police Benevolent Association claimed officers "lost sight of the car and did not know it crashed," but the family's attorney, Jeremy Feigenbaum, said their investigation "has not corroborated the officers' claim." The officers remain on leave as both the NYPD and the New York attorney general's office investigate. The case raises questions about police pursuit protocols and reporting failures.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
