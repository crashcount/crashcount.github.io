That’s one clock that won’t stop.</p><p>On July 12, a 13‑year‑old on an e‑bike was crushed at 163rd Ave and Cross Bay Boulevard. The SUV was stopped in traffic.

Lawmakers split. In June, nine city Assembly Members voted no on the renewal, including Stacey Pheffer Amato of this area (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>At City Hall in 2022, Council Member Joann Ariola opposed expanding speed cameras; her vehicle racked up dozens of violations, including school‑zone speeding and red‑light tickets, as reported then (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/09/queens-pol-voted-against-speed-cameras-and-has-27-speeding-tickets>Streetsblog NYC, 2022</a>).

The original proposal called for 2,775 homes and limited parking. Now, density drops by 27 percent. Empire State Development claims compromise, but the statement is aspirational and lacks concrete safety measures for pedestrians or cyclists. Vulnerable road users remain exposed.
