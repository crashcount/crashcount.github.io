But the wounds are many. Twenty-three people were injured in the past twelve months—one left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The years before were quieter, but not safe. The pain is steady. It does not leave.</p><p>Crashes come in waves. In the last year, there were 34 crashes. Five people were hurt in just the first half of 2025. The year before, three. The numbers rise and fall, but the risk never leaves. Each crash is a life changed, a family waiting in a hospital, a scar that does not heal.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-harm>The Machines That Harm</h3><p>Cars and trucks do the damage here. No bikes, no mopeds, no motorcycles caused deaths or serious injuries to pedestrians in this time. The threat is heavy, fast, and metal. It does not yield.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Local leaders have tools. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. Cameras can catch speeders day and night. But the pace is slow. Promises are made, but the street stays the same. The law is passed, but the limit is not lowered. The cameras are threatened by politics. The clock ticks. The danger waits.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Every crash is preventable. Every injury is a choice made by someone in power. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras stay on. Demand streets that do not bleed.</p><p>Do not wait for the next siren.
