The Car Had the Last Word.</h1><p class="byline f6 silver">Written June 4, 2025 <em>(Revised July 10, 2025 – Updated period stats)</em></p></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>East Flatbush-Rugby: Jan 1, 2022 - Jun 4, 2025</h2><h3 id=the-toll-in-flesh-and-bone>The Toll in Flesh and Bone</h3><p>A woman steps into the crosswalk. The light says walk. A Mercedes turns left. She does not make it across. Her name was Maurette Lafleur. She was 68. The driver stayed. No charges. The street is quiet again, but the loss is not. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/16/fridays-headlines-east-flatbush-tragedy-edition>“The lady spin around and sped through,”</a> said a witness. “I heard the van run over her and her bones crunching.”</p><p>In the last year, <strong>2 people died and 312 were injured</strong> on these streets. Six suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. In three years, <strong>over 1,000 people have been hurt</strong> in East Flatbush-Rugby. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-weight>Who Bears the Weight</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do the killing.</strong> Sedans, SUVs, vans, trucks—these are the weapons. In the last three years, cars and SUVs killed two, trucks and buses killed one. No bikes, no mopeds, no motorcycles took a life here. The dead and broken are mostly on foot.</p><p>A 14-year-old girl, crossing with the signal, struck by a turning truck. A 75-year-old man, hit by a distracted driver. A principal, drunk, flips his car near a school (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/06/gregory-jackson-dwi-arrest-flipped-over-brownsville-collaborative-middle-school/>principal flips his car</a>). The pattern is simple. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They build some new crosswalks. They add a few bike lanes. They say, “one life lost to traffic violence is one life too many.” But the speed limit is still too high. The cameras that catch speeders are at risk of going dark. The law to force repeat dangerous drivers into safety courses has lapsed.</p><p>A witness said, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/16/fridays-headlines-east-flatbush-tragedy-edition>“The government should do something, like when people are walking, no cars should be moving.”</a> The government has not done enough.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never shut off. Demand streets where walking is not a gamble. Every day of delay is another family broken. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Seddio claims the lane will only shift location and disputes the safety benefits, arguing, 'The bike lane will still exist, but merely shift to an alternative location in the road.' He also questions crash data, citing seasonal differences: 'The change in accident and injury rates is better explained by seasonal weather patterns.' Streetsblog notes that after the redesign, crashes dropped by 18–19% and injuries by 25–26%. The case highlights ongoing tension between local political power, city notification procedures, and efforts to protect cyclists and pedestrians through street design.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC reported on June 17, 2025, that activists and residents sued the city to stop the removal of the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane. Plaintiffs argue the city violated Administrative Code Section 19-101.2, which requires advance notice and community input before removing bike lanes. The Department of Transportation skipped this step, announcing the removal on social media after consulting only select community members. The article quotes the lawsuit: the city acted "improperly, irrationally, without proper legal notice and in an abuse of discretion." Data cited in the suit show the upgraded lane improved safety for all road users. Councilman Lincoln Restler supported the legal action, seeking a restraining order to keep the lane. The case highlights failures in city process and the risks posed when safe infrastructure is abruptly erased.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article states: "The car is driven by multiple people, all of whom have been reminded to obey the speed limit, and there are no outstanding tickets." Cuomo’s spokesperson, Esther Jensen, noted his past support for speed cameras. Mayoral rival Brad Lander and Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani criticized Cuomo’s record, calling his driving 'reckless and unlawful.' Zellnor Myrie’s spokesperson, Julia Rose, said Cuomo acts above the law.

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'before this bike lane from 2018 to 2022 this is the area that had the second largest numbers of pedestrian fatalities and crashes in the city.' The lane faced opposition from some Hasidic leaders, citing children running into the lane from illegally parked cars and buses. Despite tweaks—school bus zones, daylighted corners, no standing areas—drivers kept parking illegally, blocking sightlines and endangering children. The city rarely removes protected lanes, but Adams acted after political pressure. Moving the lane to Classon Avenue, as some demand, would force cyclists onto a chaotic BQE ramp.

The plan uses 'hardened daylighting'—physical barriers, granite blocks, and planters—to stop cars from parking near corners. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' Nearly half of city traffic deaths happen at intersections, often due to blocked sightlines and turning vehicles.

The project aims to connect neighborhoods and calm traffic. DOT Assistant Director Dustin Khuu said the goal is a 'high performing transit priority street.' The plan includes concrete bus boarding islands and may reduce car lanes, giving more space to pedestrians and buses. However, the article notes gaps: 'DOT didn't share a block-by-block breakdown,' and curbside parking may remain, risking bus lane obstruction by double-parked vehicles. The city may physically protect the lane, but details are pending. The B41 bus, serving 28,000 daily trips, crawls at 4 mph during rush hour.

Lander’s spokesperson, Kat Capossela, said Lander trusts Tisch to implement his policies, including cracking down on reckless drivers, even as Tisch currently targets cyclists. Myrie’s campaign promised to keep streets safe without unnecessary enforcement. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and former Comptroller Scott Stringer also weighed in, but stopped short of firm commitments. A safety analyst notes: Retaining a commissioner known for crackdowns on cyclists likely perpetuates enforcement-focused approaches that burden vulnerable road users, discouraging cycling and undermining mode shift and street equity.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
