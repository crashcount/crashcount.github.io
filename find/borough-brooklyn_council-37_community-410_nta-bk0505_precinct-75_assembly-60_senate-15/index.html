Same ending.</p><ul><li><p>Since 2022, this neighborhood logged <strong>1,318 crashes, 729 injuries, 0 deaths</strong>. Six were serious injuries. Nights hit hard. From midnight to 1 a.m., injuries stack up, peaking again at the evening rush. The hour from <strong>5 p.m. to 7 p.m.</strong> brings the <strong>most injuries</strong>. Late night stays bloody too. The worst single hour: <strong>5 p.m. (56 injuries)</strong>, then <strong>6 p.m. (58)</strong> and <strong>7 p.m. (52)</strong>. That’s the rhythm here. It does not let up (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p></li><li><p>Drivers in cars and SUVs do most of the hurting. Pedestrians took 134 injuries. Cyclists 35. Occupants 534. Trucks and buses show up less often, but they still break bodies (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p></li></ul><p>Three corners. One fix.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Linden Boulevard</strong> leads the harm list. So does <strong>Sutter Avenue</strong> and <strong>Euclid Avenue</strong>. <strong>Conduit Boulevard</strong> is right behind. These are the places where people go down. These are the places that need daylighting, hardened turns, and real slowdowns now (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p></li><li><p>On Conduit at Forbell, a <strong>25‑year‑old pedestrian</strong> working on a car lost part of his leg. Police recorded “amputation.” The SUV driver was listed as unlicensed. A parked Tesla took the hit too. It was <strong>4:03 a.m.</strong> The wound won’t heal for him (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4694065</a>).</p></li><li><p>On Sutter at Doscher, <strong>10:30 p.m.</strong>, a <strong>16‑year‑old girl</strong> crossing at the intersection was crushed. Listed as “crush injuries.” She lived. She will carry it (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4712918</a>).</p></li></ul><p>Night after night.</p><ul><li><p>At Liberty and Crescent, <strong>1:47 p.m.</strong>, a <strong>17‑year‑old</strong> on a motorized device was ejected. Severe head cuts. He was conscious at the scene. The car had Florida plates. The other vehicle was “standing.” The form does not say why. It only records blood and metal (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4834459</a>).</p></li><li><p>Earlier, a <strong>22‑year‑old</strong> driver on Euclid hit parked cars before another sedan. Severe bleeding, head injury, <strong>4:14 a.m.</strong> Another file in a long stack (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4722036</a>).</p></li><li><p>The pattern is clear on the city’s own sheets: top factors here include “other,” distraction, unsafe speed, aggressive driving, and failure to yield. The names change. The causes repeat (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p></li></ul><p>Two bodies. A train. One hour apart.</p><ul><li>On the L at Sutter Avenue, around <strong>6 p.m.</strong>, a man fell onto the southbound tracks and was struck. EMS pronounced him dead. Police said, <strong>“No criminality is suspected”</strong> in that case or the one an hour earlier in Manhattan (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/10/two-people-killed-by-mta-trains-one-hour-apart-in-brooklyn-and-manhattan/>NY Daily News</a>). The platform stayed open. The train ran. The line moved on.</li></ul><p>Officials know what works — do they?</p><ul><li><p>Albany moved one piece. The Senate advanced the <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045)</strong> in committee. It would force <strong>repeat offenders</strong> to use speed limiters after a pattern of tickets or DMV points. Senator Roxanne Persaud voted yes in committee twice in May and June. The bill title says it all: <strong>“requiring the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices for repeated violation of maximum speed limits.”</strong> (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>).</p></li><li><p>City Council files keep stacking too. Some target commuter vans. Some put safety reminders on shared devices. But the street tells us where the blood pools: <strong>Linden. Sutter. Euclid. Conduit.</strong> Slow the cars. Protect the crossings (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>).</p></li></ul><p>Three fixes. Start today.</p><ul><li>Daylight every corner on the hot corridors. Give pedestrians a head start with LPIs. Harden the turns so drivers can’t cut the line.</li><li>Target the late‑day and late‑night hours when injuries spike. Put enforcement and calming where the harm is worst.</li><li>Push citywide speed cuts and rein in the worst drivers with mandated limiters. The tools exist. Use them.</li></ul><p>The names become numbers here. The numbers become a map. We know the spots. We know the hours. <strong>Lower speeds. Stop the repeats.</strong></p><p>For how to press City Hall and Albany, see our <a href=/take_action/>take action</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Police say the driver "sped through a red light" and fled. Since 2018, drivers have killed or seriously injured 80 people on this two-mile stretch. A redesign with protected bike lanes was approved but stalled. State Sen. Gounardes criticized the city's response: "We should all be offended... the response... is a sign that says: 'be careful.'"

The lane, built after five pedestrian crashes, stays for now. Streets wait. Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>NY1 reported on July 1, 2025, that a judge halted the city's move to remove a three-block section of the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane. The city acted after 'incidents of children exiting school buses, crossing into the lane, and being hit by bikes.' The lane, stretching over two miles, was installed in 2024 following 'years of advocacy and five pedestrian incidents.' The hearing highlights ongoing conflict between street safety for cyclists and pedestrians, and the city's rapid policy shifts in response to crashes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
