The car flipped, crushing them as they crossed. Three died. One child clings to life. The driver had a long record of violations. The street stayed silent.</p><p class=mb3>According to the New York Post (March 30, 2025), Miriam Yarimi, whose license was suspended, drove an Audi into a Brooklyn family, killing Natasha Saada and her two daughters. Dashcam footage 'shows the overturned Audi mowing down the family as they crossed the road.' Yarimi's car had over 93 violations, including 20 speeding tickets and five red-light violations since August 2023. Police said the car 'smashed into an Uber and went careening onto the sidewalk, striking victims.' Yarimi refused to speak to police, asking only for a lawyer. The crash exposes gaps in enforcement against repeat traffic offenders and raises questions about how suspended drivers remain on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist reported on March 23, 2025, that Luis Cruz, 49, died after an e-bike delivery worker "sped through a stop sign" and struck him as he exited his double-parked car in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Witness Jack Collins said, "He died basically on the spot." The e-bike rider remained at the scene. No arrests were made. The article notes this intersection is known for frequent stop sign violations: "It's not a unicorn incident. It's happened a lot." The piece highlights systemic issues, including delivery app pressures and gaps in e-bike regulation. City data shows e-bikes account for less than 2% of traffic deaths, but the policy debate continues. Lawmakers have called for tighter rules, as delivery workers face incentives to rush.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
