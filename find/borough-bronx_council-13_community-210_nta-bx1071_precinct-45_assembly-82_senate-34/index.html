Police charged Michael Aracena, 20, with murder, manslaughter, and criminal possession of a weapon. The article describes the incident as an 'alleged road rage' shooting but does not detail the events leading up to the violence. Campbell was shot three times in the chest while sitting in his gray 2012 Infiniti sedan. His mother, Suzette Thomas, said, 'I want people to remember my son as a humble person, one to do the best for the world.' The case highlights the lethal risk of violent escalation on city streets and the ongoing threat to vulnerable road users from armed drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
