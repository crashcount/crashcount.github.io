City leaders say the next step is lower speeds and stopping chronic speeders. That is already our fight. Sammy’s Law lets New York City set lower limits, and bills in Albany would force the worst repeat offenders to install speed limiters. The Senate bill is S 4045. It moved in June with yes votes from local Senators, per the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>official file</a>.</p><p>Citywide changes sit on the table.
