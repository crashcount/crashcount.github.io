Five left with life-changing wounds.</strong> In the last twelve months, Parkchester saw 105 crashes. Fifty-seven people were hurt. One did not come home. One more was marked with a serious injury, the kind that does not heal with time. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p><strong>Children are not spared.</strong> Five under 18 were injured in crashes this year.

The numbers do not lie: the violence is steady, unbroken, and it finds the young as well as the old.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the hit.</strong> In the last year, cars and SUVs caused most of the pain. Motorcycles and mopeds added to the toll. Bikes were not the killers, but their riders bled too. The street is a field of risk for anyone not behind a windshield.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p><strong>The city talks of Vision Zero.</strong> They count the dead and the wounded. They promise safer streets, lower speed limits, more cameras. But in Parkchester, the numbers do not move fast enough. One death is too many. One family waits for a call that never comes. The city has the power to lower speed limits now. They have the tools to slow the cars. The question is not what they can do. The question is why they have not done it yet.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by the city, by the state, by those who hold the levers. The violence will not stop until they act. <strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets where children can walk and live.</strong> Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
