The matter summary states the act 'will prohibit right-on-reds except at designated intersections.' Council Member Christina Henderson acknowledged the controversy, highlighting that 'the vast majority of [traffic violence] incidents are occurring in communities of color.' Advocates and council members argue the ban will reduce deadly 'right-hook' crashes, especially as large vehicles create blind zones.

The Staten Island Chamber of Commerce received a $3,500 grant for the project, which uses bins from CITIBIN, a Brooklyn-based woman-owned business. DSNY spokesman Vincent Gragnani said, 'Use of bins in these two different locations...will improve quality of life in these locations, while helping us learn more about containerized trash in a variety of New York City settings.' The program also repurposes curbside space for public use—like loading zones and parklets—instead of private car storage, freeing up sidewalks for pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danny Pearlstein demanded faster action on bus lanes. Michael Kaess highlighted the Bronx’s lack of progress.

The report states, 'sales of gas-guzzling pickups and SUVs are also surging. This other face of the market subverts electric cars’ carbon-cutting progress.' No council bill number or committee is attached, as this is a policy report, not legislation. The analysis highlights that regulatory loopholes and weaker standards for larger vehicles allow automakers to offset EV gains by selling more polluting trucks and SUVs. The author urges tightening greenhouse gas standards, especially for large gasoline-powered vehicles, and closing loopholes that let automakers evade meaningful carbon cuts. The report warns that unless regulators act, excessive emissions from pickups and SUVs will harm the climate and city air for years, stalling the benefits of electric vehicles for all road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, discussed in committee, would cap siren volume at 90 decibels and encourage use of vibrating, low-frequency siren technology. The matter title calls for 'mandating the use of hi-lo, "two-tone" sirens by emergency response vehicles.' Brewer wrote, 'the city should mandate that emergency responders use hi-lo as their default siren and cap sirens at 90 decibels—as required by the proposed legislation—and scale up their use of vibrating siren technology.' The bill seeks to cut the health harms of constant siren noise, which studies link to hypertension and heart disease.

Murray calls out the hypocrisy of congestion pricing opponents who ignore the needs of transit-dependent New Yorkers.
