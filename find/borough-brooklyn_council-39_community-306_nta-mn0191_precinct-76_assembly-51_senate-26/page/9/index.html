The matter, titled 'Atlantic Avenue upgrade: Locals celebrate major safety fixes coming to dangerous corridor,' highlights years of advocacy after repeated crashes. Restler, who has long pushed for these changes, praised the progress: 'Atlantic Avenue has been extremely dangerous my whole life. I'm excited by the progress we're making in partnership with DOT to expand mid-block crossings and other smart interventions to slow down cars and advance safety in our community.' The announcement follows a deadly crash last spring and is part of the city’s Vision Zero push.

Other Albany leaders, including Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and Senate President Andrea Stewart-Cousins, have offered little response. Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger called Hochul’s move illegal.

Brannan and economist James Parrott wrote, 'By expanding the reach of Fair Fares, we can ensure that all New Yorkers—particularly those who are already struggling during a crisis of affordability—can fully participate in the economic, social, and cultural opportunities of our city.'

Some locals protest lost parking.</p><p class=mb3>On June 24, 2024, the NYC Department of Transportation (DOT) announced plans to install protected bike lanes on Seventh Avenue in Dyker Heights, Brooklyn. The project, pitched as a school safety upgrade, will replace painted bike lanes with a two-way protected lane, add sidewalk extensions, and close two slip lanes. DOT cited 110 injury crashes and one fatality in four years along the corridor. The redesign also includes concrete bus boarding islands and pedestrian improvements near schools and hospitals. DOT staffer Alex Ussery said, 'We’ve received some concerns from the community and various elected officials specifically regarding safety around students.' Community board attendees voiced anger over the loss of 28 parking spots, but some residents and advocates praised the safety upgrades, calling them 'desperately needed.' Installation will begin this summer and finish in the fall. No council member directly sponsored or voted on this DOT action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Introduced June 20, 2024, it urges Albany to pass S.2447/A.5234. The measure’s title: 'increase the penalties for purposefully obstructed license plates.' Council Members Justin L. Brannan (primary sponsor, District 47) and Robert F. Holden (co-sponsor, District 30) lead the push. The bill targets drivers who cover or deface plates to evade speed, red-light, and bus-lane cameras. Data shows unreadable plates rose from 3.98% to 4.66% in one year. The city lost up to $38.7 million in unissued tickets between 2019 and 2022. The resolution calls for higher fines, confiscation of plate coverings, and registration suspensions. Lawmakers say this crackdown is needed to keep dangerous drivers from slipping through the cracks and to make streets safer for everyone.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Members Pierina Sanchez and Oswald Feliz, who represent the area, expressed cautious optimism and called for community engagement. Committee Chair Lucia Deng reported, 'There was zero pushback on the concept of busways or bus lanes.' The committee even pushed for a longer route.

The matter, described as a move to 'indefinitely delay' tolls, drew criticism for its timing and impact. Hochul’s action, punctuated by a speech echoing toll critics, left the policy in limbo. Political consultants and union leaders, including @TwuSamuelsen, noted the decision failed to win votes or resolve the issue. The MTA confirmed the program’s pause in court.
