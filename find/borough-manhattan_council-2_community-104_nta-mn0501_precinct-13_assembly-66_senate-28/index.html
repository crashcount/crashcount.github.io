Twenty-one seriously hurt.</strong> That is the price Midtown South-Flatiron-Union Square has paid since 2022. The numbers do not flinch. In the last twelve months alone, <strong>one person died and eight more suffered serious injuries</strong>. Cyclists, pedestrians, workers—no one is spared.</p><p>Just last month, a 21-year-old cyclist was left with severe head wounds after colliding with a parked sedan on Fifth Avenue. In April, four pedestrians were crushed and bleeding after a taxi and sedan tangled on 5th Avenue near 17th Street. The sidewalk ran red.</p><h2 id=the-voices-in-the-aftermath>The Voices in the Aftermath</h2><p>The city’s wounds are not silent. After another crash, a resident <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said, &ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time.&rdquo;</a> The crowding and the signals are broken.

The danger is routine.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough.</strong> Assembly Member Tony Simone has <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7997&amp;term=2025">co-sponsored bills to expand speed camera enforcement</a> and <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>hold reckless drivers accountable</a>. State Senator Liz Krueger <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted to require speed limiters for repeat speeders</a>. Council Member Erik Bottcher <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/09/pols-demand-adams-open-queensboro-bridge-pedestrian-path>sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks</a>. These are steps, not leaps. The blood keeps coming.</p><p>But the city drags its feet on lowering the speed limit to 20 mph, even though the law now allows it. Cameras catch speeders, but the worst repeat offenders keep driving. The city’s hands are not tied. They are idle.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit.

Russo-Lennon and others backed bus improvements, highlighting how cars choke streets and trap riders. The demonstration drew support from Council Members Erik Bottcher and Keith Powers, and city officials.
