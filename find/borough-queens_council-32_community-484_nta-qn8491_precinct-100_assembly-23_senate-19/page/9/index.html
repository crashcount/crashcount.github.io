The hearing, led by Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, questioned whether Mayor Adams is honoring his pledge to end road violence. The matter focused on the administration’s failure to meet Council-mandated benchmarks in the NYC Streets Plan, especially protected bike lanes and bus lanes. Brooks-Powers stated, 'No New Yorker should have to fear for their life while crossing or using our streets.' She stressed that enforcement alone is not enough, demanding equitable infrastructure in neglected neighborhoods. Advocacy leaders like Elizabeth Adams and Sara Lind echoed the call for physical changes and accountability. The hearing marked a rare moment of scrutiny, with advocates welcoming the Council’s push for real safety measures for all road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brooks-Powers (District 31) announced a forthcoming NYC Council hearing on obscured license plates and enforcement. The hearing, date not yet set, follows mounting evidence that drivers—including law enforcement—deface or cover plates to evade speed and toll cameras. The matter, described as a public safety issue, exposes a gap in city enforcement. Brooks-Powers’s action responds to calls for accountability, as highlighted in the article: 'there will be a hearing on obscured plates.' Despite City Hall’s claim that 'obscuring and defacing license plates is against the law' and that enforcement is increasing, the streets tell a different story. Unreadable plates let reckless drivers escape detection. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, passengers—face greater risk. The city’s failure to act leaves them exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The hearing, not yet scheduled, follows months of reporting by Gersh Kuntzman, who documented widespread plate defacement by drivers—including law enforcement and public officials—to evade speed and toll cameras. The article quotes Brooks-Powers: 'there will be a hearing on obscured plates.' Kuntzman urges expansion of Council Member Lincoln Restler’s Intro 501, which would let the public report illegal plates via 311. City Hall claims it is 'strengthening enforcement,' but Kuntzman’s reporting shows little follow-through. The lack of action lets reckless drivers escape accountability, undermining automated enforcement and endangering vulnerable road users.

The law, named after Carlos Moncayo, aims to curb a surge in construction worker deaths—22 in the past year, the highest in five years. State Sen. Jessica Ramos, representing District 13, called the law 'critically needed' as thousands of migrants enter non-union construction jobs lacking basic safety protections. Ramos and other lawmakers supported the bill, but advocates and union officials warn that without strong enforcement and education for new arrivals, deaths and injuries will persist. The law passed after years of advocacy, but the minimum fine was removed, and nonprofits struggle to train the influx of new workers.

The bill, titled “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the installation of bollards at reconstructed sidewalks, curb extensions and pedestrian ramps,” was sponsored by Council Members Brooks-Powers, Krishnan (primary), Stevens, Hanif, Hudson, Richardson Jordan, Riley, and the Manhattan Borough President. The bill requires the Department of Transportation to install bollards at reconstructed sidewalks, curb extensions, and pedestrian ramps, especially where accessibility upgrades are made. It mandates a study on bollard effectiveness in high pedestrian areas and demands annual reporting on installations and requests. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, with no enactment.

Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers did not comment. Adams claims fiscal discipline is key, despite calling Fair Fares 'transformative.' The program’s strict eligibility leaves out many struggling New Yorkers. As subway fares rise, the city’s refusal to expand Fair Fares keeps transit out of reach for thousands.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brooks-Powers led a resolution supporting commuter vans and spoke on transportation equity, but did not advance key street safety or Vision Zero legislation. The committee failed to hold the Adams administration accountable for missing protected bike and bus lane benchmarks. Advocates and council members voiced frustration at the lack of progress on urgent issues like traffic violence and the Streets Master Plan. The committee’s approach prioritized car-dependent communities and lagged behind previous leadership on safety reforms.

Ariola stated, 'I think it’s necessary and I think that it would really benefit the communities.' Brooks-Powers emphasized the resolution as a priority for the Transportation Committee. The push comes as Mayor Adams advances the QueensWay park plan, raising concerns among transit advocates.

She called the agency’s excuses garbage. Cyclists and walkers remain squeezed into a narrow, dangerous path. DOT’s delays keep vulnerable road users at risk.</p><p class=mb3>On September 15, 2022, Council Member Julie Won publicly criticized the Department of Transportation for delaying the conversion of the Queensboro Bridge’s south outer roadway into a pedestrian-only lane. The project, promised by the previous mayor for completion by the end of 2022, was pushed back at least a year. Won, whose district covers the bridge’s eastern approaches, led a walkthrough with DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and staff from Council Members Julie Menin and Selvena Brooks-Powers. Won said, “They kept saying they can’t give the south outer roadway to pedestrians because there would be traffic. Well, I don’t care about the congestion!” She forced the commissioner to stand in the cramped lane, showing how unsafe it is for both cyclists and pedestrians. DOT offered only minor adjustments, like repainting lines, which Won dismissed as “missing the point.” The agency promised lawmakers data to justify keeping five car lanes, but Won insisted the delay puts lives at risk and called for immediate action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
