She cited DOT's repeated failure to meet the 2019 Streets Master Plan benchmarks—50 miles of protected bike lanes and 30 miles of bus lanes each year. In 2024, DOT delivered only 5.3 miles of bus lanes and 25.7 miles of bike lanes. Brooks-Powers introduced Intro 1105, a bill requiring DOT to publish a tracker of its progress. She declared, "DOT gives us their word every hearing and we are not getting results." DOT First Deputy Commissioner Margaret Forgione objected, claiming the tracker would add paperwork and reduce community engagement. Brooks-Powers countered, "DOT needs to be more transparent about its project pipeline so we can identify bottlenecks." The committee signaled intent to advance the bill.

Reinvent Albany called the measure 'contrary to notions of basic fairness' and a '$22 million handout' to a special interest. The Traffic Mobility Review Board had already rejected such exemptions. The group warned that multiple exemption bills could cost the public $100 million yearly and force higher tolls for everyone else. Neither Pheffer Amato nor Scarcella-Spanton commented.

The MTA claimed, 'There is less traffic and quicker streets,' citing a 16% drop in Midtown traffic and faster bus times. Ariola dismissed the data as 'fugazi.' The plan, imposed by the state, began January 5 with a $9 toll per car. Critics, including Ariola, Staten Island Borough President Vito Fossella, and Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, questioned the numbers and economic impact. Susan Lee of New Yorkers Against Congestion Taxes noted, 'January is usually the slowest month,' and warned that some areas saw more congestion as drivers dodged tolls.

Change comes fast.</p><p class=mb3>On December 31, 2024, New York announced new transportation laws for 2025. Senator James Sanders sponsored a ban on car lease turn-in fees, stating, "The legislation prohibits charging a turn-in fee at the expiration of the term of a vehicle lease, the basis of which is solely for administrative, handling or clerical charges." Governor Kathy Hochul signed this and other safety bills into law. Charter bus passengers ages 8 to 16 must now wear seatbelts, a response to a fatal crash in Orange County. Sammy's Law, enacted in 2024, lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph, and even 10 mph on redesigned streets. The Department of Transportation will target 250 locations, focusing on school zones. The MTA launches congestion pricing in Manhattan, with funds set for transit upgrades. Hochul said, "These enhancements to our roads and bridges will improve mobility for motorists, pedestrians and cyclists alike."</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Council Member Joann Ariola, claims residents need notice before losing parking. But DOT and street safety advocates slam the measure as a bureaucratic drag on urgent safety fixes. Council Member Lincoln Restler calls it 'additional hoops and hurdles' for street safety. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso says, 'I don’t know why we entertain any effort to stop or slow-roll safe street design.' Open Plans and StreetsPAC argue the bill props up car dominance and blocks safer, more sustainable streets. The bill could make it harder to move bike infrastructure off sidewalks, risking more sidewalk riding and fewer safe crossings for pedestrians. Similar bills (Intro 606, Intro 104) face the same criticism.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
