The FDNY supported four out of five bills, including bans on second-use and non-certified batteries, a public safety campaign, and safety information for delivery workers. The FDNY expressed concern about resource demands for detailed annual fire reporting. The matter summary states the bills aim to address the rise of deadly fires from faulty batteries, often used by delivery workers. Council Member Joann Ariola urged the FDNY to consider international solutions and invest in safe charging infrastructure. Hildalyn Colón Hernández of Los Deliveristas Unidos opposed the bans, arguing they punish low-income workers and miss root causes. The city recently abandoned a proposal to ban e-bikes on NYCHA property and is working on new charging stations.

The piece argued, 'congestion pricing would be a disaster,' claiming it would harm diverse outer-borough residents and worsen air quality in The Bronx by diverting diesel trucks. The editorial cited MTA studies predicting only a 3.1% reduction in Manhattan traffic and framed the plan as an unfair tax on commerce.

The bill’s summary: it allows residents to ticket drivers who block bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or fire hydrants within 1,320 feet of a school, creating a $175 fine and a civilian complaint protocol. Restler and Brooks-Powers are refining the process to avoid the pitfalls of the city’s anti-idling law, which discourages participation. The NYPD and DOT oppose the bill, citing concerns about neighbor conflict. Advocates support it, highlighting NYPD’s failure to protect vulnerable road users.

The matter, described as a call for a moratorium on car-related development, pits housing needs against car infrastructure. Council Member Julie Won supported the board, stating, "It should be a neighborhood rezoning instead of spot rezoning... we need to make it safer and more liveable." Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas also opposed the dealership, urging the space be used for affordable housing and highlighting dangerous driving by existing dealerships. Despite Borough President Donovan Richards' support for the rezoning, citing cycling and EV promotion, the application faces strong local resistance. The City Planning Commission now reviews the case, with a City Council vote possible.

The discussion, reported by nypost.com, focused on rising fire deaths and slower FDNY response times. The matter summary reads: 'Rising NYC fire deaths, response times blamed on traffic measures.' Councilmember Joann Ariola (District 32) argued that open street programs, bike lanes, and traffic islands hinder emergency vehicles, especially when illegal parking blocks access. She called for better enforcement. Other voices, including union leaders, echoed her concerns. However, Councilmember Shekar Krishnan defended new street designs, stating they were built with emergency input. The Department of Transportation said all projects include emergency routes and are monitored. FDNY officials attributed delays to increased post-pandemic traffic, not street safety measures. The debate highlights the ongoing conflict between car-free streets for vulnerable users and emergency vehicle access.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Rivera said, 'All of us are here today because we believe in a future where New Yorkers of all backgrounds... can safely access active transportation.' Brooks-Powers called it 'a real opportunity... to make a profound impact.' Advocates like Jon Orcutt of Bike New York praised the move, urging the city to build 'real infrastructure for cycling.'

Brewer questioned DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez’s assertion that 750 of 1,000 intersections were redesigned, citing public data showing fewer than 400. Brewer said, “I love the idea of using her committee's investigatory power to explore whether the Adams administration has indeed redesigned 750 of the promised 1,000 intersections... or whether it done fewer than that, as the agency's own public data shows.” She confirmed her intent to use committee investigators and hold an oversight hearing. The matter, titled “City Council oversight inquiry into DOT street safety implementation and data transparency,” highlights DOT’s lack of documentation and reliance on signal retiming over physical improvements. Advocates and Brewer demand full transparency and real progress.

Well, I don’t care about the congestion!” She forced the commissioner to stand in the cramped lane, showing how unsafe it is for both cyclists and pedestrians. DOT offered only minor adjustments, like repainting lines, which Won dismissed as “missing the point.” The agency promised lawmakers data to justify keeping five car lanes, but Won insisted the delay puts lives at risk and called for immediate action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
