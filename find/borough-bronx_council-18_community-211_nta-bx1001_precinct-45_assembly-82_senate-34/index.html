Three with injuries that will not heal.</strong> In the last twelve months, Westchester Square saw 114 crashes. Seventy-seven people hurt. Two did not walk away. One was a child. One was barely grown. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p><strong>The young pay most.</strong> Twenty-six people under 24 were injured.

A pedestrian hit by a speeding car on Halperin Ave in February. A distracted driver, a turning bus, a moped thrown. The list grows. The names fade. The pain stays.</p><p><strong>Most injuries come from cars and trucks.</strong> No one was killed by a bike. No one was killed by a bus. The danger is steel and speed.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-done-what-has-not>What Has Been Done, What Has Not</h3><p><strong>The city talks of Vision Zero.</strong> They count deaths. They promise lower speed limits. They install cameras. But in Westchester Square, the bodies keep coming. The council has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. They have not used it. The state can keep speed cameras running. They let the law hang by a thread.</p><p><strong>No leader here has stood up to say: enough.</strong> No new bills. No bold votes. No public stand for the dead or the living. The silence is louder than the sirens.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand cameras that never sleep.
