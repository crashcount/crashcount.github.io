No new bills. No public fight for safer crossings. No push for lower speed limits here. The city has the power to set 20 mph limits after Sammy’s Law. They have not used it.

They have not.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-the-choice-is-yours>What Comes Next: The Choice Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day leaders wait, another family risks the call. <strong>Demand action.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower the speed limit.
