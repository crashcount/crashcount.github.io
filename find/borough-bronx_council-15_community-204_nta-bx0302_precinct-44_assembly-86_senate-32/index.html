Trucks broke bones and left a pedestrian with a crushed body. SUVs, taxis, bikes, mopeds—all played their part. The street does not forgive. The machines do not care.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city passed Sammy’s Law. Now, the speed limit can drop to 20 mph. But the limit has not dropped. The council has not acted. The mayor has not acted. The blood dries on the crosswalk while leaders wait.</p><p><strong>Speed cameras work.</strong> Where installed, speeding drops. But the law that keeps them running is always at risk. Each year, Albany must vote to keep them alive. Each year, the clock runs out for someone.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone with power. The council can lower the speed limit. The mayor can demand safer streets. Albany can keep the cameras on. They have the tools. They need the will.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand 20 mph. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets where children can cross and come home.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another body in the road. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
