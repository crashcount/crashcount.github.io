The Department of Transportation has not selected a vendor, despite plans to add 500 secure spots by next month. Councilmembers urged action, calling the program potentially 'as transformative and impactful as our (Citi Bike) share program.' Jon Orcutt of Bike New York said, 'The Adams administration seems to be flubbing it, or failing it, or just letting it sort of slide through the cracks.' The delay leaves cyclists, especially delivery workers, exposed to theft and lacking safe storage. The city’s inaction stands in contrast to London, where secure bike parking has boosted cycling rates. Policy inertia and slow procurement keep New Yorkers vulnerable and city streets less safe for those on two wheels.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, not a council bill but a city action, drew sharp criticism from U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, who opposed removing a vehicle lane for pedestrians and cyclists. The article states: 'forcing pedestrians and cyclists in both directions to share a single lane on a bridge with nine lanes for car drivers was unsafe.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, Queens Borough President Donovan Richards, and Council Member Julie Won attended the opening.

The plan, discussed at a community board meeting, would have barred cyclists from Beach 108th to Beach 73rd Street during summer months. Council Member Joann Ariola, representing District 32, expressed relief at the reversal, stating, 'I’m glad that the Parks Department is going to continue allowing Rockaway residents to enjoy their bikes on the boardwalk this summer, but now we need real enforcement.' Instead of a ban, the Parks Department will increase signage and enforcement, especially near concessions. The community board voted 30-1 for new signs and called for marked bike lanes, an 8 mph speed limit, and clearer right-of-way rules. Board chair Dolores Orr stressed these safety improvements have been needed since the boardwalk’s post-Sandy rebuild.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project follows urgent requests in 2023 from Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "Brooklyn and Queens deserve a Conduit Boulevard that improves daily life, not a roadway that puts pedestrians and drivers at risk and physically divides entire neighborhoods." The corridor has seen five deaths and 40 severe injuries in five years. The median’s dirt paths show heavy pedestrian use, but only 15 crosswalks span the stretch. The public process begins in June and may run into 2026. The redesign aims to end decades of danger for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The policy, supported by Mayor Adams and Police Commissioner Tisch, escalates minor cycling infractions to criminal court summonses. The article, titled 'As NYPD’s Criminal Crackdown on Cyclists Expands, It Grows More Absurd: Victims,' details complaints of overzealous, inconsistent enforcement and alleged entrapment. Council Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers questioned the need for criminal court involvement, while Comptroller Brad Lander called the crackdown 'performative' and dangerous. The safety analyst notes: 'Policies that empower discretionary or punitive enforcement against cyclists can deter active transportation, increase fear and mistrust, and shift responsibility away from systemic safety improvements, ultimately undermining population-level safety for vulnerable road users.'

The policy, backed by Mayor Adams and Police Commissioner Tisch, claims to target 'quality of life' offenses. Cyclists report tickets for minor or fabricated infractions, including headphone use and stopping ahead of painted lines.

The event, covered by nypost.com, followed a fatal stabbing and NYPD data showing felony assaults up 9% this year. Ariola warned, 'Forcing more New Yorkers underground with this ridiculous congestion pricing scheme is going to put more people into contact with the dangerously unwell.' She called the subway the city's 'de facto mental institution and homeless shelter.' The policy, supported by Governor Hochul, has increased subway and bus ridership by 6% and 9%. Ariola’s stance: congestion pricing endangers vulnerable riders, forcing them into unsafe conditions.

The department banned bikes from a major stretch of the Rockaway Boardwalk, closed parts of the Hudson River Greenway, and allowed cars back into Silver Lake Park. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, speaking for local families, condemned the boardwalk ban: "It was about the children that take advantage of biking on the boardwalk...We’re now shifting them into the street." Residents and advocates argue these moves ignore years of complaints about poor maintenance and lack of coordination with DOT. They highlight that car-free conditions in Silver Lake Park improved safety, especially for children. Advocates call for shifting road maintenance from Parks to DOT and demand structural changes.
