They warned, 'The limited funding and decreases in funding that have occurred over the years jeopardize the continuity and future of the program—funding pressure is already leading to downsizing and the disappearance of Open Streets programs.' The groups seek $48 million over three years, separate from the city’s $30 million contract with the Horticultural Society. Current grants max out at $20,000 per year, forcing cutbacks. Speaker Adrienne Adams and Mayor Adams are starting budget talks. Council spokesperson Julia Agos called Open Streets 'critical components of our city's public realm.' The Department of Transportation said suggestions will be reviewed.

The bill, not yet numbered, would raise fines from $115 to $1,000 and allow 311 video submissions for automatic summonses. Ariola said, 'We have seen two fires in the past week that have resulted in fatalities where the firefighters were unable to access the closest fire hydrant.' The measure responds to a surge in complaints—over 134,000 in 2023—about blocked hydrants. Ariola’s office blamed lost parking to DOT bike lanes and racks, but the DOT countered, calling protected bike lanes a proven safety tool. FDNY Commissioner Robert S. Tucker said blocked hydrants slowed firefighting in a recent fatal fire.

In 2024, DOT delivered only 5.3 miles of bus lanes and 25.7 miles of bike lanes. Brooks-Powers introduced Intro 1105, a bill requiring DOT to publish a tracker of its progress. She declared, "DOT gives us their word every hearing and we are not getting results." DOT First Deputy Commissioner Margaret Forgione objected, claiming the tracker would add paperwork and reduce community engagement. Brooks-Powers countered, "DOT needs to be more transparent about its project pipeline so we can identify bottlenecks." The committee signaled intent to advance the bill.
