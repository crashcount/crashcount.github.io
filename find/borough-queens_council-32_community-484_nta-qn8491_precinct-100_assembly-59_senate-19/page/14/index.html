Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers (D-Queens), committee chair, sponsored the bill. The measure requires the Department of Transportation to study daylighting—removing parking near corners to improve visibility—and then install it at 100 intersections each year starting in 2025. The bill’s matter title: 'The Department of Transportation must study the safety benefits of 'daylighting' and implement the street safety measure that helps improve visibility at a minimum of 100 intersections each year.' Brooks-Powers said, 'Daylighting is a proven safety measure that expands sight lines at intersections, where traffic violence often seems to take place.' The Council voted 40-7. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez initially objected, citing concerns about driver speed, but supported the amended bill requiring physical barriers. The law comes after the death of 7-year-old Dolma Naadhun at a non-daylighted intersection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The hubs will be chosen for proximity to bike lanes, truck routes, and transit, with community input. Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine and Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers backed the plan, citing the need to reduce truck traffic and its deadly toll.

The program will allow large trucks to unload at designated hubs, shifting the final delivery leg to vans, cargo bikes, or carts. Details on locations and management are pending. After a year, DOT will review data and consider expansion, with a final report due in 2026. Environmentalists and advocates support the move but note it does not address warehouse siting in vulnerable communities.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Council’s $2.7-billion proposal calls for a near-doubling of Fair Fares funding, $3 million for a battery swap and fire outreach program for delivery workers, and $45.1 million more for road paving. The Council also demands increased investment in street safety infrastructure, especially in communities of color facing high crash rates. Brooks-Powers said, 'New Yorkers deserve access to high-quality services and investments in infrastructure citywide.' Council Member Keith Powers called the battery swap program a 'down payment.' The Council’s push aims to restore cuts and address deadly street conditions.

The crash happened on North Channel Bridge near Cross Bay Boulevard. The driver stayed at the scene; police made no arrests or summonses. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program (DVAP) requires drivers with 15 speeding tickets in a year to take a safety course or risk vehicle seizure, but enforcement is weak. Only a few hundred out of over 20,000 eligible drivers have complied. Queens Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, chair of the transportation committee, called for re-examining street safety and road design at the corridor, echoing residents’ demands for safer infrastructure. Advocates, including Families for Safe Streets, urged passage of Sammy’s Law to let NYC set its own speed limits.
