Riders keep dying.</p><p class=mb3>A new report from Transportation Alternatives, published October 17, 2023, slams Mayor Adams for failing to meet the City Council-mandated NYC Streets Plan. The report states, 'Traffic crashes in New York City killed more cyclists through the first nine months of 2023 than all but one other year on record.' Adams promised 75 miles of new protected bike lanes each year but delivered just 26.3 miles in 2022, missing the 30-mile benchmark and falling far short of the 50-mile requirement for 2023. Danny Harris, executive director of Transportation Alternatives, accused Adams of putting 'politics over people' and called on Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers and colleagues to pass Intro 417, which would eliminate a three-month delay in bike lane construction. DOT spokesman Chris Browne defended the administration, citing nearly 100 street projects. But the report is clear: delays and broken promises leave cyclists exposed and dying.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "Shared e-scooter service can play an important role in providing sustainable options to connect eastern Queens commuters to transit hubs, commercial corridors, and other neighborhood destinations." Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers and Queens Borough President Donovan Richards both voiced support, highlighting the program's focus on underserved communities and environmental benefits. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives urged the city to pair the expansion with protected infrastructure, warning that safe streets must come with new mobility.

Streets remain unsafe for those on foot and bike.</p><p class=mb3>The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program (DVAP), introduced in 2018 and passed in 2020, will expire after its pilot ends on October 26, 2023. The Department of Transportation (DOT) recommends ending DVAP, citing 'uncertain effects, high cost per participant, and the complexity of its implementation.' City Comptroller Brad Lander, who drafted the bill, criticized DOT for 'slow and limited implementation,' calling the program a failure. Only 885 drivers took the mandated safety course, with little impact on violations. Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers said, 'Holding reckless drivers accountable and keeping our streets safe for all New Yorkers remains a priority.' DOT now supports state-level bills to suspend registrations for repeat red-light violators. No Council legislation will reauthorize or expand DVAP.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The program, designed to target repeat red light and speeding offenders, required violators to take a safety course or risk vehicle seizure. The report, reviewed by Council Transportation Chair Selvena N. Brooks-Powers (District 31), found little impact: 'A program meant to crack down on dangerous drivers did not dramatically reduce their behavior.' Only half completed the course, violations persisted, and just 12 vehicles were seized. Brooks-Powers stated, 'Holding reckless drivers accountable and keeping our streets safe for all New Yorkers remains a priority.' Comptroller Brad Lander criticized DOT for abandoning the effort, urging the city to strengthen, not scrap, DVAP. The report also called for state laws to suspend registrations or install speed governors for repeat offenders, but such measures have stalled in Albany.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill required drivers with 15 speed-camera or five red-light tickets in a year to take a safety course or risk vehicle seizure. Council Member Shahana Hanif voiced disappointment, noting, 'We need to not only reauthorize this program, but strengthen it.' Despite over 34,000 drivers meeting the threshold in the last year, only about 1,200 took the course in three years. DOT has not explained the reporting delay or provided outcome data.

She stressed, 'The 30 miles of bus lane and 50 miles of bike lanes is not a goal—it’s legal mandate.' The exchange revealed ongoing tension over DOT’s slow rollout and lack of transparency.

The victim died on June 11. The crash happened in Council District 31, represented by Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers. The intersection lacks stop signs or a traffic light. A speed camera there issued over 600 tickets in 2021. Transportation Alternatives calls the district the city’s deadliest: six road deaths in early 2023, more than 10 percent of city fatalities, and the highest fatality rate per resident. The driver stayed at the scene. Police gave no details. No charges were filed. The street’s design and lack of enforcement leave pedestrians exposed and unprotected.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
