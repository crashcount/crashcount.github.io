The bill, announced on February 8, 2024, removes prior compromises—no phased rollout, no mandatory training, no ID hurdles. The measure, previously stripped down in committee, now returns to its original form. The matter title: 'Prophet Motive: Restler Bill Would Restore 25% Bounty for Blocked Bike and Bus Lane Tickets.' Restler vows to push hard for passage, saying, 'This bill would make a tremendous difference in making our streets safer for cyclists and pedestrians.' Activists like Sara Lind back the bounty, arguing, 'More reporting, more enforcement, will lead to fewer violations.' The bill’s fate is uncertain after Restler’s removal from the Transportation Committee, but the intent is clear: shift enforcement from NYPD to the people, and clear the way for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brooks-Powers (District 31), chair of the Transportation Committee, criticized Vision Zero’s uneven impact. The report, titled "NYC streets have gotten safer under Vision Zero – especially if you live in a white neighborhood," found that while traffic fatalities dropped citywide, majority-Black communities saw a 13% increase and Latino areas a 30% rise. Brooks-Powers said, "It is deeply concerning that communities of color are experiencing fatalities at higher rates." The report states, "It's clear the program has not been fully or effectively implemented in neighborhoods of color and with lower incomes." DOT spokesperson Anna Correa responded that recent plans focus more resources on high-poverty, non-white neighborhoods, but the safety gap persists.

Clarkston, Georgia, with high traffic-fatality rates, won $1 million from the Safe Streets and Roads for All grant to craft a safety plan. The Local Infrastructure Hub, co-led by Bloomberg Philanthropies, provides technical help, boosting applications. Mayor Beverley Burks of Clarkston said, "You have to be willing to invest in yourself as a city... Having someone who had the skillset to be able to help write the narrative – that’s very crucial for the reviewers to understand the needs in your community." James Anderson, also quoted, highlighted how technical assistance turns ambition into real safety. Other small cities, like Globe, Arizona, and Gladewater, Texas, have also won grants for pedestrian safety.

The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, installed these barriers in fall 2023, aiming to 'harden' bike lanes in a borough with few safe cycling routes. Cyclists like Joseph Rienti say the barriers are better than nothing, but drivers now park at both ends, forcing riders into car traffic. Rienti urges better design or enforcement, not removal. Police enforcement is almost nonexistent: less than 2 percent of 76,000 complaints led to tickets. City Council, including Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, has not advanced a bill allowing citizen reporting of blocked lanes, despite majority support. DOT spokeswoman Mona Bruno promises to work with police, but for now, the barriers fail to protect vulnerable cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

This incident marked the 29th cyclist fatality in 2023, a grim milestone in a year of rising traffic violence. Brooks-Powers criticized the Adams administration and the Department of Transportation for failing to meet the Streets Plan's legal requirement of 50 miles of protected bike lanes, achieving only about 30 miles. She stated, 'Thirty-plus miles of completed new bike lane is of course better than none, but falls far short of Streets Plan requirements.' Brooks-Powers also condemned the missed bus lane targets and called out DOT's lack of transparency, pledging to hold the agency accountable and push for safer, more equitable streets. The city faces more cars, more crashes, and more injuries, while vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation will also add raised crosswalks, extended sidewalks, and leading pedestrian signals at 1,000 intersections next year. The city will expand speed restriction technology in its fleet and increase data transparency. Advocates and community boards have long called for these changes.

The matter, covered by Streetsblog NYC, quotes Adams: the fee is 'the beginning of the conversation' and exemptions must be considered. Councilmember Selvena Brooks-Powers, chair of the Transportation Committee, echoed concerns, saying the toll 'is going to put definitely a hardship on many of my constituents.' Experts Bruce Schaller and Danny Pearlstein criticized Adams, urging him to champion the program’s benefits for transit riders and the environment. The mayor’s office later clarified his comments focused on city workers in city vehicles. The article notes that while a small fraction of Brooks-Powers’s constituents drive into Manhattan, all would benefit from improved transit.
