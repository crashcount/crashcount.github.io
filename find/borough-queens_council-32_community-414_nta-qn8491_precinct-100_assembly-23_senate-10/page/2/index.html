The truck was responding to a call with lights and sirens. The victim, reportedly in his 50s, was pronounced dead at the scene after being trapped under the rear wheels. Photos showed the aftermath, with sheets covering the truck’s back wheels. A witness told the Post, “We stopped at the red light and there was the FDNY truck...

Prosecutors revealed Pena had '25 tickets for speeding in school zones' in recent years. Surveillance showed both cars spinning out after the crash; Diaz died at Elmhurst Hospital. Pena tested positive for cocaine, marijuana, and had a blood-alcohol content of 0.156%. He faces 14 charges, including manslaughter and DWI. Diaz’s family called for stronger laws, with his mother stating, 'They need to look at the laws and see that people need to be charged accordingly.'

Both bills require the Department of Transportation (DOT) to create public trackers for capital projects tied to the Streets Master Plan. Intro 1105, sponsored by Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, mandates a tracker for projects that count toward safety benchmarks. Intro 1114, sponsored by Council Member Julie Won, calls for a broader capital projects tracker. The bills respond to the Adams administration's failure to meet legal targets for bus and bike lanes. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams said, 'Today’s legislation will advance greater transparency.' DOT officials pushed back, arguing project work is not linear and trackers have limited use. Won countered, 'It is [the DOT's] responsibility to take their capital plan and implement it.' Advocates and council members agree: tracking is only a first step.

It was introduced November 13, 2024, and passed committee and full Council votes on April 10, 2025. The law, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to tracking progress made towards the requirements of the streets master plan,' demands the Department of Transportation post annual and monthly updates on all benchmark projects—protected bike lanes, bus lanes, signals, and upgrades. Council Member Julie Won led as primary sponsor, joined by Brooks-Powers, Hanif, Ayala, and others. The law requires public reporting on project status, funding, delays, and overruns. This measure brings hard oversight and transparency to the city’s street safety promises.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Other lawmakers and advocates echoed frustration, questioning MTA management and calling for state responsibility.
