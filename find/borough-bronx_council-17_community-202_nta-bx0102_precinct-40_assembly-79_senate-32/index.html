The numbers come from city data covering 2022–2025.</p><ul><li><strong>Pedestrians killed: 5</strong></li><li><strong>Total injuries: 582</strong> across crashes since 2022</li><li><strong>Peak injury hours</strong> run from mid‑afternoon into night, with the worst between 15:00 and 22:00.</li></ul><p>The worst corners are named. <a href=#>3rd Avenue</a> and <a href=#>East 149th Street</a> each rack up harm. So does <a href=#>Melrose Avenue</a>. These are not one‑offs. They are patterns. The dataset lists them as top sites by injuries.</p><p>Dead is precise. So are the case files. On April 2, 2025, an SUV going straight on 149th hit a 52‑year‑old pedestrian midblock. He died. Three SUVs were involved. The record is <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4803347</a>. On June 25, 2024, a taxi on East 149th struck a 61‑year‑old man crossing without a signal. He died too. That is <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4735638</a>. On January 13, 2024, at Melrose and East 157th, a woman crossing at the intersection was hit and killed. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4695464</a>. On April 12, 2023, a 70‑year‑old man was struck and killed at 305 East 149th. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4623120</a>.</p><p>Heavy machines do heavy damage.

SUVs and sedans kill most.</p><h3 id=where-it-breaks>Where it breaks</h3><p>Injury spikes hit the late hours. 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. stays hot. So does the afternoon school let‑out to rush hour. The count peaks near 4 p.m. and 8–10 p.m., then flares again at 9–10 p.m. The bodies are local. The danger is routine.</p><p>Contributing factors are listed. “Other” leads the death count. “Vulnerable road user error” shows up, but the dead are still on foot. “Disregarded traffic control” and “alcohol involvement” appear too.

Daylight these corners. Give walkers a head start with leading pedestrian intervals. Harden left turns so wide swings can’t knife through the crosswalk. Protect bike space where riders keep going down.</p><p>Target the late‑day hours with enforcement that sticks. Keep trucks out of narrow residential blocks. Slow the turns. Narrow the lanes.</p><h3 id=the-wider-frame>The wider frame</h3><p>Speed is the lever. Citywide, the tools exist. Albany passed Sammy’s Law; the city can set lower limits. Advocates are pushing for a default 20 mph. Our own coverage lays it out and cites the numbers on repeat offenders. The state is also moving on speed limiters for the worst drivers. The Senate bill S 4045 advanced in June; local senators voted yes in committee. Those devices cap speed to the limit plus five for drivers with long violation records.</p><ul><li>The push to drop speeds and stop repeat speeders is detailed in our <a href=/take_action/>action guide</a>, including the data on how a small group of drivers cause outsized harm.</li><li>State bill S 4045 drew yes votes in committee from Senators in this area; see the file and vote records <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>here</a>.</li></ul><h3 id=voices-from-the-aftermath>Voices from the aftermath</h3><p>“Two people were killed. He was drunk,” said a sister after a Bronx parkway crash that took two young riders. She asked why he walked free. “How could they let him go?” The case is not in Melrose, but it is in the Bronx, and it is now. The names were Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19, and Enrique Martinez, 21. Police charged the driver with vehicular manslaughter and DWI. The family’s words stand. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>NY Daily News</a> and <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Gothamist</a> reported them.</p><p>This is not numbers. It is the walk to the store that ends in the road. It is the last call that goes to voicemail.</p><h3 id=what-must-change>What must change</h3><ul><li><strong>Set a default 20 mph limit</strong> on city streets. Use the power Albany granted. Fewer bodies hit the ground when the cars slow. See the case for it in our <a href=/take_action/>guide</a>.</li><li><strong>Shut down repeat speeders</strong> with speed limiters. S 4045 is built for them. Senators advanced it in June; read the bill file and vote records on the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>state site</a>.</li><li><strong>Fix the local kill zones</strong>: daylighting, LPIs, hardened turns, protected bike space on 149th, 3rd Ave, and Melrose Ave, with late‑day enforcement where injuries peak.</li></ul><p>One block at a time. One law at a time. The clock is loud.</p><p>Take one step now. Add your name, make the calls, and push the city to slow the cars.
