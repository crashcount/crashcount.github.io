The Assembly has a matching push. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>See A2299</a>. These are the drivers who turn people into names on a sheet.</p><blockquote><p>“We are taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection,” the city’s traffic chief said of Canal Street after two people were killed by a car going over 100 mph. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>The quote is here</a>. One street moved after two deaths. Midtown’s list is longer.</p></blockquote><h3 id=use-the-tools>Use the tools</h3><p>Lower the default speed. Install limiters on the worst repeat speeders. Daylight and harden every deadly turn. Then check the numbers.

Russo-Lennon and others backed bus improvements, highlighting how cars choke streets and trap riders. The demonstration drew support from Council Members Erik Bottcher and Keith Powers, and city officials.

Busway and car-free blocks promise safer streets. Council backs plan. Advocates watch Adams, wary from past reversals. Riders wait for real change.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist (2025-08-06) reports the 34th Street busway plan advances after council approval, restricting cars and adding car-free blocks. The plan, part of a Midtown rezoning, aims for safer, faster transit and more housing. Councilmember Keith Powers called it a key commitment, saying, "We wanted to make sure...residents...have quicker ways to get around." Advocates remain cautious, citing past city reversals on transit projects. Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance notes, "Faster buses for millions...shouldn't ride on last-minute bargaining." The plan highlights the city's uneven record on street safety and transit improvements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
