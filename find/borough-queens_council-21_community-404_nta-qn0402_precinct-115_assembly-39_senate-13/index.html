Seven with life-changing wounds.</strong> In Corona, the street is a wound that never closes. From 2022 to June 2025, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>1,266 crashes</a> tore through this neighborhood. <strong>612 people were hurt.</strong></p><p>A 49-year-old man, walking where there was no crosswalk, was crushed by a sedan and an SUV on Grand Central Parkway. A 36-year-old moped rider died on 97th Street, his body thrown, his helmet useless. A 43-year-old woman died in the back seat of an SUV, distraction listed as the cause. An 8-year-old girl, crossing outside the lines, was left with deep cuts to her legs. These are not numbers. These are lives, stopped cold.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt</h3><p><strong>Children and working-age adults take the hits.</strong> In the last year, 23 kids under 18 were injured. One was seriously hurt. For adults 25 to 44, the toll is higher: 81 injured, one dead, one left with wounds that will not heal. The street does not care who you are. It only takes.</p><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage.</strong> In three years, SUVs and cars killed once, left three with grave injuries, and hurt 23 more. Trucks, bikes, and mopeds add to the count, but the weight of steel and speed does the worst.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p><strong>The city says it wants zero deaths.</strong> Laws have passed. Speed cameras now run all day and night. The city can set speed limits lower, but in Corona, the pace of change is slow. The street stays the same. The bodies keep coming. There is no record here of local leaders standing in the street, demanding more. No sign of a council vote to claim the power Sammy’s Law gives. No public push for more cameras, more safe crossings, more space for people.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.

Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>The 2025 Albany legislative session ended June 25, with lawmakers failing to pass key street safety bills. The Streetsblog NYC report reads: "Our elected officials in Albany have failed the livable streets movement again." Despite support for measures like speed camera reauthorization, most bills to protect pedestrians and cyclists died in committee or never reached the floor. Assembly Member Amy Sohn and others criticized the lack of action. The only major win was extending the city’s speed camera program. A safety analyst notes: 'Failure to advance livable streets policies likely maintains the status quo, which typically prioritizes car-centric infrastructure and neglects the safety and needs of pedestrians and cyclists.' The session’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users at risk. No progress.

The redesign widens sidewalks and adds planters and seating, but cars still dominate. Council members and advocates oppose the car-first approach.

The committee passed the bill, with only one senator, Mario Mattera, voting no. The measure aims to catch drivers who speed near schools, a proven danger to children and families on foot. Mayer’s bill targets reckless driving at the source. The committee’s action marks a step toward streets that remember every crash and fight for every life.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Myrie promises a 'year-round outdoor dining program' and restoration of open streets, citing safety and access for pedestrians and cyclists. Ramos calls the current scheme 'unworkable' and urges consensus. Lander faults City Hall for 'over-regulating' and vows to speed up applications while 'respecting pedestrian traffic.' Mamdani highlights the economic and social benefits. All criticize current restrictions and bureaucratic hurdles.

Stringer demanded 'massive expansion of protected bike lanes.' Myrie backed S1047, a bill for 50-percent e-bike rebates. Ramos called for safe bike lanes and clear signage for all riders. Lander pushed for stricter rules on heavy e-bikes and a crackdown on illegal sales, saying, 'I support stricter regulations for the heaviest e-bikes, which can travel at higher speeds and are more likely to injure both riders and pedestrians.' Mamdani supported e-bike subsidies with safety checks. Tilson urged a 20 mph cap and mandatory registration for delivery e-bikes. All agreed: safer streets need better design, strong enforcement, and real protections for workers and vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Police allege Peña was 'drunk and high on cocaine and marijuana' and speeding at 83 mph when he 'ran a red light and T-boned a car driven by 24-year-old Justin Diaz.' The crash happened at Northern Boulevard and East 107th Street as Diaz drove to work. Prosecutors cited Peña’s firing from the FDNY and prior legal issues to argue for remand, but the appellate court released him with minimal bail conditions. Peña faces manslaughter and other charges, with a possible 15-year sentence if convicted. The case highlights the lethal risk of impaired, reckless driving and the limits of pretrial detention policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
