In the last twelve months, 123 people were hurt in crashes across West New Brighton-Silver Lake-Grymes Hill. One was left with injuries so severe they may never heal. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. A 14-year-old bled from the head after a crash at Forest Avenue and Victory Boulevard. A cyclist, age 28, thrown and bleeding on Brighton Avenue. These are not numbers. They are lives split open by steel and speed.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-harm>The Machines That Harm</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage.</strong> In this district, they caused 1 death and 51 injuries to pedestrians since 2022. Trucks and buses added more. Bikes and mopeds—none. The pattern is clear. The danger comes heavy and fast, from behind a windshield. The city’s own data <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>shows it</a>. There is no mystery here. &ldquo;Driver inattention/distraction&rdquo; was the cause when an 82-year-old woman was killed crossing Bard Avenue at Forest Avenue.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-evasion>Leadership: Action and Evasion</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have failed to act with urgency.</strong> Assembly Member Sam Pirozzolo and State Senator Andrew Lanza both voted against extending school speed zones, turning their backs on the most basic protection for children. Pirozzolo also <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>opposed the city&rsquo;s speed camera program</a>, a tool proven to save lives. Their votes are on the record. The silence is louder than the crash. The system investigates, but the bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=the-path-forward>The Path Forward</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every injury, every death, could have been stopped. Lower the speed limit. Expand camera enforcement. Redesign the streets so mistakes do not kill. Call your council member. Demand action. Do not wait for another child’s blood on the asphalt.</p><p><strong>Contact your leaders. Demand safer streets.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Reporter Kirstyn Brendlen covered the findings. No council members sponsored or voted, but the review shows the casino could bring thousands of cars daily. The safety analyst notes: increased car traffic and parking demand will heighten risks for pedestrians and cyclists, discourage active transportation, and undermine street safety and equity.

Cyclists, kids, and bystanders paid. Streets turned chaotic. Policy ignored. Trust shattered. Vulnerable road users left exposed.</p><p class=mb3>""The NYPD is led by the best, brightest and most honorable professionals in the nation — and their results speak for themselves: crime continues to fall across the city, with shootings at the lowest level in recorded history. We will respond in court, where we are confident these absurd claims will be disproven."" -- Charles Fall</p><p class=mb3>On July 16, 2025, former NYPD Commissioner Tom Donlon filed a civil racketeering suit, alleging 'deadly and unconstitutional high-speed vehicle chases' under Mayor Adams. The complaint, reported by Streetsblog NYC, claims the NYPD's Community Response Team operated as a rogue unit, answerable only to City Hall, with Deputy Mayor Kaz Daughtry allowing reckless pursuits. Donlon cites deaths and injuries, including cyclist Amanda Servedio. The suit alleges 398 crashes and 315 injuries in 2024—a 47% jump. Donlon's allegations highlight how high-speed chases increase risk to pedestrians and cyclists, introducing unpredictable, dangerous driving and eroding public trust in safe, equitable enforcement. No council bill or committee action is tied to this event.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The reports state, 'Years of bus priority projects have barely improved speeds because New York City leaders have not implemented real bus rapid transit (BRT).' Colon, reporting for Streetsblog NYC, supports comprehensive BRT and opposes the city’s piecemeal fixes. Mayor Adams and city agencies have not acted on key recommendations. The safety analyst notes: the lack of real BRT means missed chances for mode shift and street equity, but does not directly worsen conditions for pedestrians and cyclists; the status quo remains unchanged.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
