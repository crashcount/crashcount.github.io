They whisper. No one has died here since 2022, but 433 people have been hurt. Five were left with serious injuries. The wounds are not always visible: a crushed hip, a torn eye, a life changed in a second.</p><p>The roads do not care if you are young or old. Fifty-seven children under 18 have been injured here since 2022. The oldest, the youngest—all at risk. The cars keep coming. The SUVs keep coming. The numbers pile up, slow and steady, like water wearing down stone.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-the-unseen-disaster>Recent Crashes: The Unseen Disaster</h3><p>The last year brought 188 crashes. 104 people were hurt. Two were seriously injured. No headlines. No outrage. Just the daily grind of metal on flesh. SUVs did the most harm to pedestrians—five injured, one left with serious wounds.</p><p>On the Cross Island Parkway, a 17-year-old was crushed in a sedan. On the same road, a 20-year-old pedestrian was struck by an SUV and left with a broken hip. The stories repeat. The pain repeats. The system does not change.</p><h3 id=leadership-small-steps-slow-change>Leadership: Small Steps, Slow Change</h3><p>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough.

Council Member Linda Lee <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>co-sponsored bills for senior and student bike share discounts, but also backed a bill to lower e-bike speed limits to 15 mph</a>. The focus drifts to e-bikes, not to the cars and trucks that do the real damage.</p><p>The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has not used it. &ldquo;Speeding ruins lives, and reducing vehicle speeds by even a few miles per hour could be the difference between life or death in a traffic crash,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pr2024/sammys-law-enactment.shtml#:~:text=%E2%80%9CSpeeding%20ruins%20lives%2C%20and%20reducing,keep%20everyone%20safe%20on%20our">said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>. The words are true. The action is slow.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to use Sammy’s Law. Lower the speed limit to 20 mph. Stop blaming the vulnerable.

The suit claims the redesign would "jeopardize" safety and hinder emergency access, despite DOT data showing 190 injuries and two deaths in the area since 2020. DOT says the project targets "unpredictable vehicle movements" and double parking, with design elements "found on streets across the city." The agency says it incorporated feedback from 90% of local businesses. The legal fight spotlights tension between safety improvements and business concerns, as the corridor ranks among Queens' most crash-prone.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
