The redesign stretches from Queens Plaza to Hillside Avenue, creating the city’s longest protected bike lane. The DOT reports a 68% drop in fatalities and a 35% reduction in injuries since 2015. The redesign adds parking-protected bike lanes, pedestrian islands, and improved signals.

The article, published October 28, 2024, details community outrage after a cyclist’s death and repeated injuries. NYPD policy says chases should end when risk outweighs reward, but enforcement fails. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program, which once forced repeat offenders into safety courses, has expired. Comptroller Brad Lander says, 'Drivers who are repeatedly caught by speed and red-light cameras currently face no consequences other than a fine in the mail. Repeat reckless drivers must be held to account.' State Senator Michael Gianaris calls for stronger penalties, including suspending registrations. The NYPD has not adopted reforms. Residents and advocates demand legislative action and transparency.

The city aims to connect the Pulaski and Kosciuszko bridges via Borden, Starr, and Review avenues. The project, requested by local civic groups and the community board, follows five deaths—including two cyclists—and over 170 injuries on these roads in five years. Won stated, 'We need to do everything we can to ensure we don’t lose another life to a preventable death.' Thirty-two business owners petitioned DOT to halt the project, citing truck maneuvering dangers. DOT representative Vincent Barone called the route 'a critical gap' in the bike network and promised 'much-needed safety improvements.' The plan will take up to 15 feet from Review Avenue for a two-way bike path and buffer, leaving 22 feet for traffic.

The matter, titled 'Queensboro Pedestrian Path Delayed Again—This Time Until Winter,' has drawn sharp criticism. Council Member Julie Won, who supports the path, said, 'DOT once again is choosing ... drivers over pedestrians,' and warned the delay 'will continue to endanger the nearly 10,000 pedestrians and cyclists who use the narrow shared path every day.' Advocates and local officials echo her concerns, calling the crowded conditions hazardous, especially as nights grow longer.

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the improvement and maintenance of medians through the planting of vegetation or use in stormwater management," requires the city to improve at least one mile of paved medians every two years until 2046. The Department of Transportation, Parks, and Environmental Protection must add planted medians, tree beds, or stormwater infrastructure, focusing on high-priority investment areas. Council Member Shekar Krishnan sponsored the bill, joined by Feliz, Avilés, Nurse, Banks, Restler, Ung, Schulman, Holden, Hudson, and Yeger. The Council passed the bill with broad support, though the mayor returned it unsigned. The law mandates annual progress reports and public tracking of improved medians and responsible agencies.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, requested by Council Member Julie Won, Community Board 2, and the Blissville Civic Association, aims to build protected bike lanes, painted lanes, and safer intersections in industrial neighborhoods near Newtown Creek. The DOT’s summary states the project will bring 'vital bike connectivity' to areas with high injury and fatality rates for pedestrians and cyclists. Reilly Owens, CB2 transportation chair, praised the plan: 'It is nice when DOT presents something to us that's just completely wonderful.' Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives called the area unsafe: 'There's a lot of trucks and other industrial activity and no protection for cyclists.' Some local businesses oppose the project, demanding more studies, but civic leaders and advocates support it for safety and access.

Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives said, “The city has been on notice for years about this problem and it is their responsibility to provide a safe facility for walking and biking.” Crashes and injuries continued as the city prioritized car traffic, keeping the lane open to drivers during bridge rehab.
