Systemic failures left danger unchecked.</p><p class=mb3>According to the New York Post (2025-07-20), a 23-year-old woman drove a stolen, drug-filled car into a cyclist and a woman on a bench at Bowery and Canal, killing both. The driver, Autumn Donna Ascencio Romero, had faced charges for a previous crash but was released without bail. The article reports, 'Romero was behind the wheel of a booze- and drug-filled stolen blue Chevy Malibu when it plowed into a man on a bicycle and a 63-year-old woman on a bench.' Police said the car was packed with pills, marijuana, and alcohol. Romero and her passenger fled but were quickly caught. The case highlights gaps in bail reform and vehicle oversight.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Donlon cites deaths and injuries, including cyclist Amanda Servedio. The suit alleges 398 crashes and 315 injuries in 2024—a 47% jump.
