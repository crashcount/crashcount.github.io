The Citizens Budget Commission urges deep cuts, fare hikes, and more city and state cash. Expansion projects like the Interborough Express may die. Riders risk worse service if lawmakers stall. The clock ticks.</p><p class=mb3>On March 21, 2025, the Citizens Budget Commission (CBC) released a warning about the MTA’s $33.4-billion capital budget gap for 2025–2029. The CBC recommends slashing $17 billion, scrapping expansion plans like the Interborough Express, and boosting city and state contributions by $9 billion. The CBC calls for a 6 percent hike in fares, tolls, and vehicle fees—higher than the planned 4 percent. Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie said tax hikes are on the table. Governor Hochul’s office backs a payroll tax hike, but the CBC wants it regionalized. The CBC’s Andrew Rein said, “We have to prioritize state-of-good-repair, basic modernization, and delay some of the system expansions.” The report warns that failing to fund maintenance will gut service, repeating past crises. No direct safety analysis was provided, but cuts threaten transit reliability for millions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brooklyn’s first Regional Slow Zone targets crowded streets. Ten severe injuries and one death in five years haunt the area. Council Member Restler and DOT push for slower traffic. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On March 19, 2025, Council Member Lincoln Restler announced the lowering of Dumbo’s speed limit to 20 mph, making it Brooklyn’s first Regional Slow Zone. The measure follows the passage of Sammy’s Law, which lets the city set its own speed limits. The Department of Transportation cited ten severe injuries and one death in Dumbo over five years. The new zone covers streets packed with pedestrians, from Furman to Navy and Hudson, and John to Sands and the BQE. Restler said, 'Data has shown that a one mile per hour increase in speed results in a nearly three percent increase in mortality.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez added, 'Lowering vehicle speed limits by even a few miles per hour could be the difference between life or death in a traffic crash.' The change will take effect after a public comment period. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso called for more slow zones in high-crash neighborhoods. The city plans to expand 20 mph limits to over 250 locations by the end of 2025.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The officers were responding to a call about a man with a gun. According to the article, 'another vehicle attempted to make a U-turn, causing the police cruiser to swerve to avoid a collision.' Both officers were hospitalized and are expected to recover. The crash highlights the risks of sudden maneuvers and U-turns on busy city streets. No bystanders were reported injured.

As a result, it's difficult to give Hizzoner a pass for falling short." -- Charles Fall</p><p class=mb3>On March 14, 2025, the Department of Transportation released its annual report on the 2019 Streets Master Plan law. The report, required by the City Council, reveals the city missed mandates for protected bike lanes (29.3 of 50 miles) and bus lanes (17.9 of 30 miles) for the third year running. The matter summary states: 'New York City has failed to meet legally required benchmarks for redesigning streets for bikes, buses, and pedestrians due to a lack of resources and political interference.' Mayor Eric Adams is named as the main obstacle. The report cites staff shortages, shrinking divisions, and political pushback—especially the mayor’s role in killing the Fordham Road busway. Former DOT commissioner Polly Trottenberg warned the plan needed more funding and a new approach. Advocates and officials say Adams’s lack of support left the city’s most vulnerable road users exposed. The law’s promise is broken. The streets stay deadly.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, discussed in both Senate and Assembly one-house budgets, suggests new taxes: fees on online deliveries, higher payroll mobility taxes, and more surcharges on rideshare trips. The matter summary reads: 'Taxes to back the MTA? That is what some New York lawmakers are proposing.' Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins is mentioned as a key figure. Stewart-Cousins and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie previously rejected the MTA’s $68.4 billion plan last December over funding gaps. The proposal has sparked public anger, with advocates and riders decrying more taxes. MTA chair Janno Lieber insists full funding is essential to keep trains and buses running safely.

The editorial highlights rampant illegal vehicle registrations and the dangers they pose, including uninsured cars and increased risk for cyclists. The proposal urges charging both residents and visitors for parking, with higher rates in dense, wealthy areas.

The law demands the Department of Transportation install pavement markings or temporary lines within five business days after any street resurfacing. If DOT misses the deadline, it must notify the public and explain the delay. The bill’s matter title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to installing pavement markings.' Council Member Farah N. Louis led as primary sponsor, joined by Brannan, Schulman, Banks, Farías, Carr, and Ariola. The law took effect March 15, 2025.

Council hears pleas to reject the cut.</p><p class=mb3>Intro 1050, introduced by Council Member Carmen De La Rosa (D-Inwood), is under City Council review. The bill would cut the required minimum personal injury protection insurance for yellow cabs, liveries, and app-based drivers from $200,000 to $50,000. At a recent hearing, Lauren Pine, a nurse and crash survivor, testified: 'The minimum $50,000 no fault insurance was exhausted within the first week or so of my hospitalization.' Pine urged the Council to oppose the bill, warning that victims of traffic violence would be left financially devastated. Transportation Alternatives’ Ben Furnas also opposed the bill, stating, 'This legislation will ultimately make it more expensive and difficult to access care, treatment, and support after a traffic crash.' The bill is generating support among some council members, but advocates and survivors demand the Council maintain current coverage to protect crash victims.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Promised bus lanes never come. Mayor Adams broke his pledge. The city built just 9.6 miles in two years. Riders wait. DOT blames funding. Council law ignored. Streets stay deadly. Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>This report, released February 7, 2025, by the Independent Budget Office, exposes the city’s failure to meet the Streets Master Plan law (passed in 2019) mandating 150 miles of new bus lanes. The IBO states: 'It will be virtually impossible for the city to meet the City Council's required 150 miles of new bus lanes at the pace Mayor Adams is going.' Mayor Adams, who took office in 2022, has slowed or killed key bus projects, including the Fordham Road busway. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno claims the agency is building protected lanes and using cameras for enforcement, but admits resources are tight. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams has called for compliance but not funded it. Riders Alliance spokesman Danny Pearlstein blames hiring freezes and political interference for 'broken promises and neglected legislation.' The report shows that while DOT’s budget grew, staffing for bus lane expansion fell. Bus speeds remain stuck at 8.1 mph. The city’s inaction leaves millions of bus riders—often the city’s most vulnerable—stranded and exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
