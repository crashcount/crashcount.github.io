Andrew Lanza, dismissed the program as a 'cash register.' Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives said, 'When New York City’s speed safety cameras turn off, speeding increases and crashes rise.'

The measure, led by Transportation Committee Chairwoman Mary Cheh, boosts fees to $500 for vehicles over 6,000 pounds, $250 for 5,000–6,000 pounds, and $175 for 3,500–5,000 pounds. The bill summary states, 'the larger a vehicle, the worse it is for the environment, the more damage it causes to our roads, and the more dangerous to others using the roadway.' Cheh, who wrote the proposal, said, 'drivers who pick these larger vehicles will now need to pay a bit more to compensate for that additional damage.' The council expects the new fees to raise $40 million over five years, funding street safety projects and road repairs. Cheh admits the policy is not a cure-all for traffic violence but calls it a step forward to recoup costs from oversized vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, discussed at Brooklyn Community Boards 10 and 11, aims to fix potholes, resurface the path, and repair the seawall. The presentation, however, lacked any guarantee of a safe alternate route for cyclists and pedestrians. Brooklyn Borough Commissioner Martin Maher admitted, 'I can't make any promises.' Council Member Carlina Rivera’s office noted her bill would require protections for cyclists around work zones, highlighting the gap in current planning. Executive Director Terri Carta of the Brooklyn Greenway Initiative said, 'NYC Parks and DOT need to provide a safe alternative for greenway users during construction.' Despite DOT’s willingness to help, no concrete detour exists.

The matter summary states: 'the Legislature is poised to do the right thing and allow the speed cameras...to keep operating around the clock.' Gounardes, a key advocate, joins Mayor Adams and crash victims’ families in support. The endorsement highlights that automated enforcement cuts reckless driving and reduces injuries.

The legislative session nears its end with no clear action. State Sen. Jabari Brisport supports the bill, calling for round-the-clock enforcement. Sen. John Liu backs maintaining cameras but won’t commit to S5602. Some City Council members demand that camera revenue fund local road improvements. Assembly Member Dick Gottfried doubts the Council will send the required home rule message in time, while Assembly Member William Magnarelli promises to advance the bill if they do. Mayor Adams’ team claims safety was discussed in Albany, but the mayor himself stayed silent. The bill faces opposition over increased penalties and insurance notifications. Without action, the city’s speed cameras—and the safety of its streets—are at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

State gas tax revenue shows only a 7.5 percent dip from March 2020 to March 2022. The upcoming gas tax holiday, set for June 1, will drop pump prices by 16 cents per gallon.

Pollution, congestion, and road death remain constant.

Nurse stated, 'Our communities cannot afford any more delays.' Advocates and Families for Safe Streets highlighted the deadly toll: reckless commercial haulers have killed more than two dozen people in recent years. The reform aims to cut truck traffic, reduce pollution, and require life-saving side guards on heavy trucks by 2024.
