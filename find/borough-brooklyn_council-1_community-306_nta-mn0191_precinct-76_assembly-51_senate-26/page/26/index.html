The Department of Transportation will present its draft plan to Brooklyn Community Board 1’s Transportation Committee on June 30. The petition, described as a call for 'wider sidewalks and a wider median, a protected bike lane, and eliminating one lane of traffic in each direction,' follows the hit-and-run death of teacher Matthew Jensen. Gallagher stated, 'Our community is speaking loud and clear: no more deaths on McGuinness.' The campaign has support from Councilmember Lincoln Restler and Borough President Antonio Reynoso. The street, a busy four-lane truck route, has seen dozens of crashes and injuries in recent years.

The Department of Sanitation will install several dozen rat-proof trash bins for building managers and superintendents to store garbage and recycling, moving bags off sidewalks and into curbside street lanes. The matter summary reads: 'Testing a rat-proof trash container... instead of on the sidewalk.' Council Member Erik Bottcher said he is 'thrilled that our district was the first to be chosen for this exciting advance,' calling it 'another important step.' The pilot takes parking space for bins, sparking complaints from drivers but clearing pedestrian paths. The city plans to expand the $1.3-million program to all five boroughs. Critics note the bins are small and collection methods unchanged, limiting scale. Still, the move marks a shift: less sidewalk trash, more space for people.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The carnage included hit-and-runs, reckless driving, and unlicensed operators. Adams and Rodriguez said they are 'working every day to deliver true public safety for pedestrians, cyclists, and everyone who uses our streets.' They acknowledged recent progress but warned, 'the disturbing incidents we've seen in recent weeks and the last 48 hours remind us just how fragile those positive steps are and how much more work remains.'

The measure, sponsored by Assemblymember Deborah Glick (District 66) and Senator Andrew Gounardes, allows speed cameras to operate 24/7 in up to 750 school zones. The bill was set to expire but now runs through July 1, 2025. The matter summary states: 'New York City is now able to operate its speed cameras 24 hours a day.' Glick, who sponsored the bill, dismissed criticism that cameras are a cash grab, saying, 'The city isn't in the car with you... If you don't want to get a ticket, don't speed.' Mayor Eric Adams called the cameras a deterrent, not a punishment. Advocates say the law will slow cars and protect pedestrians, especially children. The bill passed just before the legislative session ended, closing a deadly loophole in city enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary: 'The city's school zone speed cameras will now operate 24/7 year-round.' Hochul cited student deaths and the need for constant protection. Mayor Adams called the program a national model, noting, '72 percent of fatalities have been happening when the cameras were off.' The bill was weakened from its original form, dropping escalating fines and stricter penalties for repeat offenders due to City Council concerns. Glick and Gounardes pledged to push for stronger measures. A separate bill to expand red light cameras failed.

CB11 member John Kelly, speaking personally, voiced fear for his child’s safety and called for a shift in car culture. Victor Dadras, chair of the CB11 Transportation Committee, called the plan 'a step in the right direction' but admitted it is incomplete. The committee will discuss the proposal further, with a full board vote expected in September. DOT may begin marking lanes in the fall.

Victims pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On June 22, 2022, the city Comptroller released the annual Claims Report, revealing that in fiscal year 2021, New York City paid $138.5 million to settle 4,143 cases involving city workers crashing city-owned vehicles. The report states: 'City-owned motor vehicles cause the largest share of personal injury and property damage settlements.' Comptroller Brad Lander sounded the alarm, saying, 'These payouts cost over a hundred of million dollars a year, and can never account for the damage to traffic victims and their families. Traffic violence has a price NYC cannot afford.' The NYPD, Department of Sanitation, FDNY, Department of Environmental Protection, and DOT accounted for nearly all payouts. Only Sanitation and DOT responded to the report. The city’s own fleet remains a threat to vulnerable road users. The cost is measured in blood and dollars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Speaking publicly, Lieber said, "If it doesn't happen, at some point we can't award contracts that are dependent on having capital, the cash a couple of years later." The matter centers on congestion pricing, which Lieber and advocates call the largest, most environmentally beneficial funding source for the MTA. Projects at risk include the Second Avenue Subway, ADA accessibility improvements, and zero-emissions buses. Lieber opposes broad exemptions, arguing carve-outs weaken the plan. Rachel Fauss, a transit advocate, stressed, "There is no other source to fill that $15 billion hole."
