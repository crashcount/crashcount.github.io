The case, rooted in the MTA’s lawsuit against the feds, remains unresolved. The DOT’s attorney, Dominika Tarczynska, said, "The Department of Transportation maintains the position that New York City should stop charging tolls by April 20." MTA attorney Robert Kaplan countered, "Congestion pricing is in effect, we believe it's working, and ... we don't intend to turn it off unless there's an order from your honor." Governor Hochul and the MTA refuse to comply. The federal government threatens vague consequences but takes no concrete steps. The MTA’s November agreement with the Biden-era DOT did not allow for unilateral federal withdrawal. As the legal fight drags on, congestion pricing continues. Streets south of 60th Street see fewer crashes. Bus speeds rise. Foot traffic grows. Vulnerable road users benefit while politicians bicker.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The meeting's summary: 'A large number of Lower Manhattan residents turned out to support the Canal Street open street, but organizers reduced the program's operating times in response to complaints from some residents.' Chairperson Vincent Cirrito said, 'This is an open space for our residents, for our kids... where they don’t have to worry about vehicles and cars.' Council Member Chris Marte and some residents pushed for further cutbacks, while others defended the open street as vital for safety, accessibility, and local business. The board sided with vulnerable road users, keeping two blocks of Canal Street open to people, not cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation (DOT) says $5 million is needed to maintain current operations, but the Council’s preliminary budget omits this. DOT Chief of Staff Ryan Lynch told advocates the agency is lobbying for replacement funds. Council Member Shekar Krishnan criticized the mayor’s stance, saying, “It’s deeply misguided to cut funds from the open street program, especially at this moment.” The City Comptroller’s office also faulted the administration for poor planning.

The letter called the block a 'missing link in Brooklyn’s protected bike lane network.' Brooklyn Community Board 2 backed the demand. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and Borough Commissioner Keith Bray offered only vague replies. The block’s exclusion traces to a mayoral advisor’s intervention for developer Two Trees.

The bill, sponsored in Albany by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, would require drivers with repeated violations to install intelligent speed assistance (ISA) devices. These devices cap speed at 5 mph over the limit for those with 11 or more license points in 24 months or six camera tickets in a year. The rally followed a fatal Gravesend crash that killed a mother and her two daughters. Hanif and other lawmakers called current enforcement—ticketing, suspensions, fines, jail—ineffective. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon said, 'The speed limiter technology is available to us. Let’s use it. It will save lives.' The bill is modeled on EU and Virginia laws.

Gounardes added, 'It’s no longer simply enough to shake our heads in despair when these preventable tragedies occur—it’s time for us to act.'

Advocates like Chauncy Young and Laura Solis welcomed protected lanes but lamented the loss of a car-free riverside route.

Restler said, 'Data has shown that a one mile per hour increase in speed results in a nearly three percent increase in mortality.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez added, 'Lowering vehicle speed limits by even a few miles per hour could be the difference between life or death in a traffic crash.' The change will take effect after a public comment period. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso called for more slow zones in high-crash neighborhoods.
