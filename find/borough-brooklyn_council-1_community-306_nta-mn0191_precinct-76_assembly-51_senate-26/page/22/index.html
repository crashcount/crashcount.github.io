The matter, as described by the Regional Plan Association and partners, aims to 'enable merchants or organized groups to tap into the Open Restaurant program and its legal infrastructure, giving new mixed-use space to programs that benefit their communities.' The Alfresco NYC Coalition and advocates like Maulin Mehta support shifting oversight to the Department of Transportation (DOT) for a broader, safer approach to curb use. The bill is under active debate, with hearings showing strong support for reclaiming curb space for public benefit, not just cars or restaurants.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Manhattan Community Board 4’s Transportation Committee unanimously supported the proposal but urged DOT to add more physical barriers. The plan includes pedestrian islands and repurposes car lanes in some sections, but for 19 blocks, car lanes remain untouched. Council Member Erik Bottcher and local activists pushed for the redesign, citing high crash and fatality rates: 173 crashes this year, 40 injuries, and three pedestrian deaths since 2016. Committee members, including Christine Berthet and Brett Firfer, criticized painted islands as unsafe, calling for concrete or vertical barriers. DOT’s Patrick Kennedy cited resource limits.

Streets remain deadly. Walking saves lives.</p><p class=mb3>This policy advocacy, published November 15, 2022, revisits the impact of car dependency a decade after 'Walkable City.' The article, titled 'Walkable City 10 Years Later: Cars Make Us Sicker Than We Thought,' draws on studies showing road emissions cause 53,000 early deaths annually in the U.S., with 1,400 in New York City alone. Healthcare costs from vehicle emissions top $21 billion per year in the city. The piece highlights that electric vehicles do not eliminate most toxic emissions, which come from tires and non-tailpipe sources. Traffic noise increases risk of heart attacks, strokes, and dementia. The article quotes, 'People who walk 8.6 minutes a day are 33 percent more likely to report better mental health.' It argues that walking and biking foster stronger communities and civic engagement, while car traffic breeds isolation and danger. No council member is named; this is a broad policy critique, not a legislative action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal states: 'The city wants to repurpose a pair of car lanes on the Washington Bridge uptown for a two-way bike lane and a bus lane next year, giving a dedicated space to cyclists who are currently forced to share extremely narrow paths with pedestrians.' Lucia Deng, a Transportation Alternatives activist, called the move 'huge,' noting the Bronx and Upper Manhattan have long been neglected. DOT planner Patrick Kennedy said, 'We try to maintain the protected connections as much as possible. They really only work if they’re continuous.'

The analysis draws a direct line between the rise of SUVs and pickups and the surge in pedestrian deaths. It notes that the largest vehicles are the deadliest, especially for those on foot or bike. The piece argues that taxing these vehicles would not only discourage their use but also shift the burden of their societal costs back onto their owners.

He demanded a year’s pause. The move stalls safer, faster transit. Thousands of daily bus riders wait. Pedestrians and cyclists remain exposed. Cars keep ruling the street. The city’s promise fades.</p><p class=mb3>On October 2, 2022, Councilmember Oswald Feliz of District 15 opposed the Department of Transportation’s plan to convert segments of Fordham Road to bus and delivery-only lanes. Feliz asked DOT to pause the redesign for at least 12 months, citing concerns about traffic diversion and business impacts. The matter, reported as 'Eric Adams’ ambitious bus lane plans hit roadblock on NYC’s Fordham Road,' details how Feliz’s opposition blocks a key part of Mayor Adams’ pledge to build 20 new miles of bus lanes. DOT’s proposal aimed to restrict private vehicle traffic and prioritize buses and deliveries, a move supported by transit advocates and local polls. But Feliz’s action keeps the status quo: crowded streets, slow buses, and danger for those outside cars. No safety analyst assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
