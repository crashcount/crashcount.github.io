The matter summary states: 'A Brooklyn Council member, Sandy Nurse, is seeking to revive the city's stalled effort to reform the private carting industry by introducing legislation to create a working group.' Nurse pushes for quarterly meetings with city officials, industry, and labor until the program launches. Mayor Adams and Sanitation Commissioner Tisch have delayed the law, citing cost concerns. Nurse insists, 'We are not going backwards. This is something that needs to happen.' The City Council will hold a hearing.

Four hours, then dead. Streets need twelve. Commissioner Tisch says full electrification by 2040 is out of reach. Council Member Nurse backs progress on lighter vehicles but admits heavy-duty tech isn’t ready.</p><p class=mb3>On November 18, 2022, the City Council held a hearing on the Department of Sanitation’s (DSNY) electric vehicle fleet performance and electrification goals. Commissioner Jessica Tisch told the Council, “they basically conked out after four hours—we need them to go 12 hours.” She added, “I don't see today a path forward to fully electrifying the rear-loader portion of the fleet by 2040.” DSNY has ordered seven electric collection trucks and seven sweepers, but only mechanical brooms and light-duty vehicles show promise. Council Member Sandy Nurse praised DSNY’s efforts on lighter vehicles, saying, “Let’s get that done as low-hanging fruit,” but acknowledged the technology gap for heavy-duty trucks. The city faces major hurdles: short battery life, high costs, and the need for new charging infrastructure. Vulnerable road users remain at risk when snow isn’t cleared.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors including Rivera, Hudson, and others. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor on October 27, 2022. The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law. The measure compels the city to plan and maintain safe routes for non-drivers, with regular public reporting and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure called for annual reports on driver behavior tied to crashes, injuries, and deaths. The bill died at session’s end. No action, no data, no change for the vulnerable.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0415-2022 was introduced on May 19, 2022, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill required the Department of Transportation, with the NYPD and other agencies, to conduct an annual study of dangerous driving behaviors linked to crashes, injuries, and fatalities. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring a study of dangerous driving.' Council Members Selvena N. Brooks-Powers (primary sponsor), Keith Powers, Gale A. Brewer, Rita C. Joseph, Sandy Nurse, Shekar Krishnan, Lincoln Restler, Pierina Ana Sanchez, Marjorie Velázquez, and the Brooklyn and Manhattan Borough Presidents sponsored the bill. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. Without passage, the city remains without mandated, public-facing data on the patterns that put pedestrians and cyclists at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
