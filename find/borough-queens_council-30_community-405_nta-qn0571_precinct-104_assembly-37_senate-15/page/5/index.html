The city car involved has five enforcement camera tickets since 2018. Holden stated, 'the DOT should expect nothing less than exemplary behavior from its personnel.' He commended DOT for swift action but transparency is lacking. Holden has opposed Citi Bike expansion and the Streets Master Plan, but supports NYPD enforcement against illegal parking and some safety improvements.

Council Member Keith Powers introduced the buy-back bill, which creates a citywide program for defective or uncertified batteries. Powers said, "We don't want to penalize businesses and workers without thinking about this strategically." The Council also moved bills from Oswald Feliz, Gale Brewer, Alexa Avilés, and Robert Holden. These measures ban uncertified batteries, require fireproof charging containers, mandate public education, and order FDNY reporting on battery fires. Speaker Adrienne Adams clarified the bills target commercial sellers, not workers. Shahana Hanif urged that policy must "keep workers" at the center. The Council and delivery workers’ union stressed that tech companies, not workers, should bear costs. The FDNY opposed the reporting bill over resource concerns. The legislation aims to curb battery fires while protecting delivery workers who depend on e-bikes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He warned of danger to both panhandlers and drivers. NYPD prefers voluntary compliance, not arrests. The city condemned the practice. Enforcement remains lax. Vulnerable people stand in harm’s way, traffic roaring past.</p><p class=mb3>On July 23, 2022, Councilman Robert F. Holden (District 30) issued a statement urging Mayor Eric Adams' administration to crack down on panhandling on New York City highways. The matter, described as 'Panhandling in the middle of traffic on NYC highways is now a thing,' highlights the growing presence of people seeking money on major roadways. Holden said, 'It’s not only illegal, but very dangerous. There’s nothing compassionate about letting people do this. Both the panhandlers and motorists are in danger.' The NYPD acknowledged the issue but stated their goal is voluntary compliance and connecting individuals to services, not arrests. The Mayor’s Office condemned panhandling on highways as dangerous and illegal. Despite these statements, enforcement remains limited, leaving vulnerable road users exposed to high-speed traffic and systemic risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
