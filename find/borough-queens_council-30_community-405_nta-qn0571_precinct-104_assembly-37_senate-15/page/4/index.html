The matter notes, 'parents in [Powers'] Manhattan district felt slighted that their kids were left out of the free transportation program.' Powers pressed for fair access, saying, 'we're still hearing from families whose children aren't receiving an OMNY card like their classmates.' Council Member Robert Holden pushed for e-bike licensing, drawing fire from advocates. The review documents a year of policy shifts, enforcement surges, and ongoing fights over who gets safe, affordable transit.

The move comes weeks before new congestion tolls hit Manhattan. The matter, titled 'MTA plans fare hike as it OKs $1.27B train car purchase weeks before new congestion toll: ‘Keep the grift alive’,' drew fire from Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30), who called the fare and toll hikes a 'scam' and accused the MTA of mismanagement. Holden’s comments echo broader council criticism of the MTA’s spending and question the effectiveness of congestion pricing. MTA officials defend the investment, citing improved reliability and safety with the new R211 cars. No independent safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.

The bill’s summary states it aims to increase accountability for e-bike riders after fatal crashes. Holden, the sponsor, cited dangers from unregulated e-vehicles and hit-and-runs. Advocacy groups, including Los Deliveristas Unidos and Open Plans, argue the bill would unfairly criminalize immigrants and delivery workers, and increase police stops for people of color. The NYC Hospitality Alliance warns of new financial and administrative burdens for small businesses. Both sides agree cars cause far more deaths, but the bill’s critics say better street design, not registration, would protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill is named after Priscilla Loke, killed by an electric Citi Bike rider. Legal experts Daniel Flanzig, Peter Beadle, and Brandon Chamberlin argue the bill violates state law, which bars cities from imposing fees that restrict the 'free use' of bicycles. They warn it would create barriers to e-bike use and could lead to inconsistent rules across cities. Holden defends the bill as a push for 'accountability and safety.' Critics say it discourages e-bike use and risks police harassment, especially for immigrants. The city Law Department declined comment.

The bill, sponsored by Council Member Robert Holden, claims to address a 'public safety crisis.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez opposed the measure, stating, 'The administration already has the tools to enforce against illegal [cycling] behaviors; a license plate is not necessary for enforcement.' Rodriguez cited data: 105 pedestrians killed by cars this year, versus six by e-bikes, mopeds, and scooters combined. He argued that street redesigns, not new bureaucracy, cut deaths and injuries. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams echoed this, noting that registration backers often resist proven safety fixes like protected bike lanes. Rodriguez warned the bill would waste $19 million and slow adoption of sustainable transport. He called for holding delivery apps accountable and redesigning streets, not targeting vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Supporters claim it brings order. Critics say it shifts blame from drivers. The hearing spotlights a city where cars still maim and kill most pedestrians.</p><p class=mb3>On December 11, 2024, the New York City Council held a hearing on a bill introduced by Councilmember Robert F. Holden (District 30). The bill would require all electric bikes, scooters, and similar micromobility devices to be licensed and registered. The committee reviewed the proposal, which aims to regulate these vehicles and address their growing presence. The bill summary states: 'A bill requiring electric bikes, scooters, and other motorized vehicles to have license plates and be registered.' Holden, who sponsored the bill, argued it would help identify riders and discourage hit-and-runs. Critics countered that the measure diverts attention from drivers, who cause most injuries and deaths. Danny Harris, former Transportation Alternatives director, called for a holistic safety approach, including holding delivery apps accountable. The hearing also addressed battery fire risks, with 250 lithium-ion battery fires reported this year. The debate centers on whether registration improves safety for vulnerable road users or simply shifts blame.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill would force all e-bikes, including Citi Bikes, to register with the city and display license plates. The matter summary calls this a 'common sense way to address concerns about e-bike rider behavior.' Holden leads the charge, but critics, including Shabazz Stuart, call the bill 'flawed, impossible to enforce, unnecessary, and regressive.' They warn it will hit low-income and minority communities hardest, discourage e-bike use, and fail to improve safety. Stuart notes, 'Registration mandates are notoriously difficult to enforce at almost every level of government.' He argues that real safety comes from proven measures: protected bike lanes, road diets, and consistent enforcement of existing laws. The bill, he says, misses the mark and puts vulnerable road users at greater risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Shabazz Stuart, writing in Streetsblog NYC, calls the bill 'flawed, impossible to enforce, unnecessary, and will not work.' He warns it will be expensive, difficult to implement, and lead to selective policing, especially against poorer and minority communities. Stuart notes registration schemes have failed elsewhere and that police already have tools to address reckless cycling.

The project, covered in committee and public statements, is described as 'transformative for so many New Yorkers.' Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30), who represents the area, had threatened to oppose the IBX if it included street-running. After the MTA’s shift to tunneling, Holden stated, 'Addressing the biggest issue by forgoing light rail on 69th Street is crucial to earning our support.' The plan eliminates a dangerous section where trams would have mixed with cars, reducing exposure for pedestrians and cyclists. The MTA has issued a request for proposals to design the line and guide it through federal review.

Cabán’s platform promised safer streets and fewer cars. Ariola and others say the tickets show a gap between words and actions.</p><p class=mb3>On August 10, 2024, Councilwoman Joann Ariola (District 32) publicly criticized Councilwoman Tiffany Cabán after media reports revealed Cabán received four school-zone speeding tickets and three other violations since November 2022. The matter, covered by the New York Post, states: 'Cabán—who was elected to office on a platform advocating less car use and cracking down on dangerous driving—received four tickets in the past 13 months for speeding her vehicle in school zones.' Ariola, joined by Councilman Robert Holden, accused Cabán of hypocrisy, highlighting the disconnect between Cabán’s advocacy for street safety and her own driving record. Cabán’s policy platform includes converting 25% of city roadways for people, building 1,000 miles of car-free streets, and expanding bus and bike lanes. No formal council bill or committee action is attached to this event, but the public dispute underscores tensions in the city’s push for safer, less car-dominated streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
