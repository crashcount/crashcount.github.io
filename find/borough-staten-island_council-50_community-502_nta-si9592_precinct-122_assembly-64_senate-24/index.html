The article asks, 'But does he care? No.' Carr, representing District 50, opposes speed cameras, red light cameras, and bus lane enforcement. When confronted, he shrugged and drove off.

The toll will be measured in blood, not words.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13 and June 17, 2025, the New York State Senate and Assembly voted on reauthorizing New York City's school zone speed camera program. The Senate passed the measure 38-21; three city senators—Stephen Chan, Andrew Lanza, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton—voted no. The Assembly passed it 110-31, with nine city lawmakers—Alec Brook-Krasny, Lester Chang, Simcha Eichenstein, Michael Novakhov, Stacey Pheffer Amato, Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Reilly, David Weprin, Kalman Yeger—opposing. The Streetsblog NYC article, 'Ye Shall Know Their Names! Meet the Dirty Dozen City Pols Who Voted Against Speed Camera Program,' quotes lawmakers dismissing speed cameras as revenue grabs or burdens. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action, so no direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists can be assessed.' Still, the votes signal disregard for proven tools that protect those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan allows cameras on seven bridges and two tunnels, ticketing drivers who exceed speed limits. Fines start at $50 for a first offense, rising to $75 and $100 for repeat violations within 18 months. Governor Hochul's office called the program 'one more way the governor is working to improve safety on our roads and bridges for workers and travelers alike.' MTA Bridges and Tunnels President Catherine Sheridan said, 'We want to make sure that our maintenance workers and contractors are safe.' The program, part of the $254 billion state budget, will be reviewed again in 2031. The move targets driver speed, a key factor in crash severity, and signals a shift toward automated enforcement on major city crossings.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets stayed dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News (March 15, 2025) reports two separate police-involved crashes. On Staten Island, officers responding to a gun call swerved to avoid a U-turning car, lost control, and crashed into a shuttered restaurant. Both officers were hospitalized with minor injuries. Hours earlier in Manhattan, a Dodge Charger changed lanes, clipped a street sweeper, spun out, and pinned an officer against his patrol SUV. Surveillance footage showed the Charger 'spinning out of control before hitting the officer.' Witness Abi Aguirre described the chaos: 'It was pretty, pretty fast and then he crashed into a sanitation car.' Both incidents highlight the risks posed by high-speed responses and sudden driver maneuvers. Storefronts and sidewalks offered little protection.
