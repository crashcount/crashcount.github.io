Brown questioned new railcars for the borough after lawmakers opposed congestion pricing. Officials call his stance bureaucratic ignorance. The fight spotlights power struggles over transit and rider needs.</p><p class=mb3>On August 3, 2024, seven Staten Island officials, including Council Minority Leader Joseph Borelli (District 51), called for the removal of MTA board member Norman Brown. Their letter to Governor Hochul followed Brown’s June comments suggesting Staten Island lose its promised 75 new R211S railcars because local lawmakers opposed congestion pricing. The letter, signed by Assemblymen Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Tannousis, Michael Reilly, Borough President Vito Fossella, State Senator Andrew Lanza, Councilman David Carr, and Borelli, called Brown’s remarks 'a masterclass in bureaucratic ignorance.' Brown said he would welcome removal. The new railcars would replace aging trains from the 1970s. The matter exposes deep rifts over transit funding and priorities, with Staten Island riders caught in the crossfire.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
