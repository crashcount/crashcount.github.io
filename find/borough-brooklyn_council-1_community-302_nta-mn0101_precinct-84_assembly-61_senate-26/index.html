A child, 11, struck by a moped on Maiden Lane. A 67-year-old man, head bloodied, hit by a sedan at West and Liberty. Cyclists thrown from bikes on Broadway and Fulton. The city keeps moving. The pain stays put.</p><p>Last week, a city worker fixing a street sign at Broadway and Cedar was slashed by a man on an e-bike after a near miss. The DOT called it an <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/dot-worker-slashed-by-e-biker-manhattan/>“abhorrent assault of a NYC DOT employee who performs critical work to keep our city moving”</a>. The worker was treated and released. The rider fled. The street was washed clean, but the wound remains.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-harm>The Machines That Harm</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs are the main threat.</strong> In the past three years, they caused 88 pedestrian injuries—two of them serious. Trucks and buses hurt 13 more. Bikes and mopeds, 14. The city’s streets are a gauntlet. The most vulnerable—children, the old, anyone on foot or bike—pay the price.</p><p>A food cart broke loose from a van on 42nd Street, smashing into a parked car with a woman and child inside. Police found the van packed with propane tanks and fuel. The driver was charged with reckless endangerment. The city called the response, but the danger was already there. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/cops-bust-minivan-driver-in-manhattan-for-carrying-propane-tanks/>&ldquo;Firefighters forced entry into the van, removing 76 20-pound propane cylinders and 15 five-gallon fuel containers,&rdquo;</a> the Daily News reported.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-and-stalls>Leadership: Steps and Stalls</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough.</strong> Council Member Marte co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, aiming to clear sightlines and protect people on foot. State Senator Kavanagh voted yes to extend school speed zones, a step for child safety. But the city still waits for a default 20 mph speed limit. The wounds keep coming.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand action before the next wound opens. The city will not heal itself.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

District Attorney Alvin Bragg called it a 'life-threatening act of domestic violence in our transit system.' Valdez fled but was arrested hours later.

Donlon cites deaths and injuries, including cyclist Amanda Servedio. The suit alleges 398 crashes and 315 injuries in 2024—a 47% jump. Donlon's allegations highlight how high-speed chases increase risk to pedestrians and cyclists, introducing unpredictable, dangerous driving and eroding public trust in safe, equitable enforcement.
