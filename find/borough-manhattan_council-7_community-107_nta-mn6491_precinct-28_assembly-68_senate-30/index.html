Not for the old, not for the young. Not for the cyclist, not for the walker. In the last twelve months, <strong>one person died and three were seriously injured</strong> here. Fifty-one more were hurt. The numbers do not tell you about the sound of bone on asphalt, or the blood that stains the crosswalk. But they are the record of a city that looks away.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a man on a bike died on the 97th Street Transverse. He was 43. The crash report lists him as ejected, dead at the scene. No further detail. No comfort for his family. No change for the next rider. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>A child was hit at Central Park West and 85th. The report says &ldquo;failure to yield right-of-way&rdquo; and &ldquo;unsafe speed.&rdquo; She survived, but with severe lacerations to the head. She was crossing with the signal. The driver was on a bike. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=the-voices-in-the-silence>The Voices in the Silence</h3><p>The dead do not speak. The living do. After a cyclist was struck in Washington Heights, a resident <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said, &ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time.&rdquo;</a> Another added, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>&ldquo;I really want there to be speed humps because it&rsquo;s just terrifying.&rdquo;</a></p><p>The horror is not just in the crash. It is in the waiting. It is in the knowledge that nothing will change until someone makes it change.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-what-they-havent>What Leaders Have Done—and What They Haven&rsquo;t</h3><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal voted yes on the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, a bill that would force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed limiters. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a> Assembly Member Micah Lasher voted to extend school speed zones. These are steps. But the blood still runs. The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not done so.</p><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong></p><h3 id=call-to-action-make-them-hear-you>Call to Action: Make Them Hear You</h3><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to use the power they have. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people who walk and ride. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Change moves slow.</p><p class=mb3>New York Magazine - Curbed (2025-07-29) reports city officials and business groups will fund a $3 million, two-year study to redesign 14th Street. The plan aims for a 'complete street'—space for pedestrians, cyclists, transit, and limited cars. The article notes, 'Their (mostly) shared goal is to make 14th into what's often called a complete street.' The study will assess traffic flow and street dynamics. The busway, which restricts cars, may become permanent. No crash or injury data is cited, but the focus is on systemic street changes, not individual driver actions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
