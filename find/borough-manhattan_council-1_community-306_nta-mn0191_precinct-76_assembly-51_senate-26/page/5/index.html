The article states: “Citi Bike's workers are backing Brad Lander for mayor while their bosses at Lyft chip in on Andrew Cuomo's PAC.” This is not a council bill, but a political endorsement. Local 320 President Edwin Aviles called Lander 'the one and only person in NYC government who has ever publicly recognized and championed safety, fair wages, and a fair Collective Bargaining Agreement.' No council member sponsored or voted on this action. The endorsement signals a push for leadership that may prioritize safer streets and better conditions for cyclists and pedestrians. According to safety analysts, this event concerns political endorsements and campaign contributions, not a policy or legislative change affecting pedestrian or cyclist safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Sen. Andrew Gounardes, aims to curb reckless driving. Initially, Sen. Anthony Palumbo (R-Suffolk) opposed the measure, citing concerns about government overreach and enforcement. He compared it to ignition locks for drunk drivers, which he supports. After discussion with Gounardes, Palumbo shifted, supporting the bill if it meets its goal. The bill’s summary states it targets repeat speeders with court orders and misdemeanor charges for non-compliance. Data shows 21 percent of fatal pedestrian crashes in NYC involve vehicles with six or more camera tickets in the prior year. Speed limiters have been shown to reduce traffic deaths by 37 percent.

The suit claims, 'the city maintains a policy and practice of detaining, ticketing, and prosecuting cyclists who lawfully ride through an intersection when the pedestrian control signal indicates white/walk.' Esparza received a $190 summons at Third Avenue and East 42nd Street, Manhattan, despite acting within the law. The lawsuit names current and former NYPD commissioners, accusing them of knowingly violating civil rights. The article notes a sharp rise in tickets for cyclists in early 2025.

Democrats may let it advance with a hollow 'Aye Without Recommendation.' Meanwhile, the Idaho Stop bill, which could save cyclists’ lives, remains stalled. NYPD cracks down on riders. Cyclists keep dying.</p><p class=mb3>On May 13, 2025, the Senate Transportation Committee considered S533, a bill to repeal congestion pricing, after a procedural motion by Sen. Jack Martins. Committee Chair Jeremy Cooney was compelled to place it on the agenda. Democrats may use 'Aye Without Recommendation' to let the bill advance without clear support. A watchdog coalition, including Reinvent Albany and Bike New York, called the bill 'contrary to notions of basic fairness.' The same day, activists lobbied for the Idaho Stop bill (S639/A7071), sponsored by Sen. Rachel May and Assembly Member Karen McMahon. The bill would let cyclists treat red lights as stop signs and stop signs as yield signs, a move proven to reduce injuries. Despite support, the bill remains blocked. NYPD continues harsh enforcement against cyclists, who make up a small share of city trips but receive a disproportionate number of tickets. Cyclist deaths keep rising.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Only fragments and silence left behind.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News reported on May 7, 2025, that federal officials released images showing a sightseeing helicopter breaking apart in midair before crashing into the Hudson River, killing six. The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
