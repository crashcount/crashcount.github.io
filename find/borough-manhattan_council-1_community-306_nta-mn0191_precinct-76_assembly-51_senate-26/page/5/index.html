Prosecutors said Jiraud, on parole and wearing a GPS anklet, attacked Agudela after 11:30 p.m., stole her e-bike, and discarded it in the East River. Agudela is not expected to survive, having undergone multiple brain surgeries. The article quotes Agudela’s daughter: “We need more protection, we need more lights.” The path where the attack occurred lacked lighting and surveillance.

The measure passed with just two 'no' votes out of 13. The bill requires speed-limiting devices in cars of drivers with six or more camera-issued speeding tickets in a year. Streetsblog NYC reports, 'A bill that would prevent the most-reckless drivers from speeding easily moved forward on Tuesday.' Senator Andrew Gounardes sponsors the bill, emphasizing it targets the most dangerous drivers. Assembly sponsor Emily Gallagher raised concerns about cost and judicial bias, but stressed that speeding endangers everyone. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins backs the bill's safety focus. According to safety analysts, restricting repeat speeders directly tackles a major threat to pedestrians and cyclists, likely reducing crashes and making streets safer citywide.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Buses crawl now. Riders wait. DOT wants faster trips, safer crossings. Community boards back the plan. Painted lanes, fewer cars, more eyes on the street. Change comes for riders and walkers.</p><p class=mb3>West Side Spirit reported on May 20, 2025, that the Department of Transportation (DOT) has proposed turning 34th Street into a mostly car-free busway, modeled after the 14th Street busway. The plan comes with support from three local community boards. According to the article, 'bus speeds on 14th Street increased by at least 24 percent, and bus ridership grew by 30 percent' after similar changes. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'far fewer New Yorkers are getting hurt in crashes' since the 14th Street redesign. The 34th Street proposal would divert most cars, add painted intersections for visibility, and focus on pedestrian safety. The move targets slow bus speeds—now just 3 mph—and aims to reduce systemic danger for bus riders and people on foot. No driver errors are cited, but the plan addresses longstanding risks from car traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article states: “Citi Bike's workers are backing Brad Lander for mayor while their bosses at Lyft chip in on Andrew Cuomo's PAC.” This is not a council bill, but a political endorsement. Local 320 President Edwin Aviles called Lander 'the one and only person in NYC government who has ever publicly recognized and championed safety, fair wages, and a fair Collective Bargaining Agreement.' No council member sponsored or voted on this action. The endorsement signals a push for leadership that may prioritize safer streets and better conditions for cyclists and pedestrians. According to safety analysts, this event concerns political endorsements and campaign contributions, not a policy or legislative change affecting pedestrian or cyclist safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

City Comptroller Brad Lander echoed the urgency, calling mass transit 'the lifeblood of NYC.' The rally criticized Mayor Adams and former Governor Cuomo for failing bus riders and not meeting the NYC Streets Plan’s promise of 10 to 15 new bus lanes each year. Betsy Plum of Riders Alliance said, 'He was meant to be implementing the NYC Streets Plan... He has woefully failed at that.'

Data shows 21 percent of fatal pedestrian crashes in NYC involve vehicles with six or more camera tickets in the prior year. Speed limiters have been shown to reduce traffic deaths by 37 percent.
