New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy refused, risking further strain on NJ Transit, which recently raised fares 15 percent. Riders Alliance’s Betsy Plum called Murphy’s stance 'a stubbornness tax' paid by transit riders. Environmental advocates criticized Murphy for blocking improvements to public transportation.

The plan, now entering its last public feedback phase, will be reviewed by the MTA Board in early winter 2025 and implemented by late summer. The proposal includes over $30 million in new funding, 17 new local routes, and increased frequency for 17 lines, but also service reductions on 29 routes. The main highlight is the introduction of 'rush' routes to connect riders to rail faster. MTA Chair Janno Lieber said, 'Every change to a route has an impact on the schedule... and we did it.' Queens Borough President Donovan Richards voiced support, stating, 'I'm ready. We're ready.' The process began in 2019 and was shaped by extensive community input. No formal safety analysis was provided for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Kathy Hochul's office refused to release her daily schedule for April, May, and June—the months when she halted congestion pricing. Streetsblog filed two Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) requests (R001199-062024 and R001389-102924), both denied or delayed without reason. The matter centers on the governor's decision to 'pause congestion pricing,' a move that impacts every New Yorker who walks, bikes, or rides transit. Heather Murray of Cornell Law School called the delay 'unconscionable,' saying, 'Delaying release of these records for six months is tantamount to denial of the request and violates the Freedom of Information Law.' Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance urged Hochul to 'level with New Yorkers.' The governor's secrecy shields her from accountability as city streets remain dangerous for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Parks Department said, 'While durable repairs have been made, efforts are ongoing to address underlying challenges and create a stronger, safer greenway for New Yorkers.' The path, north of the George Washington Bridge, has collapsed twice in two years. Advocates like Allegra LeGrande and Ira Gershenhorn, along with former Traffic Commissioner Sam Schwartz, urge the city to convert a Henry Hudson Parkway lane into a protected bike path. They call this 'low-hanging fruit.' Instead, the city has forced cyclists onto dangerous, unprotected detours. The city’s refusal to provide a safe, direct route exposes vulnerable road users to ongoing harm.
