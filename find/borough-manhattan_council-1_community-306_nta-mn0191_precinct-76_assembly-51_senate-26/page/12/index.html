The project, led by the NJ Turnpike Authority, faces criticism for ignoring alternatives like mass transit, greenways, and bikeways. The article states: 'Gov. Phil Murphy wants to spend over $10 billion to widen a highway in an environmental justice community while asking transit riders to shoulder a 15 percent fare hike. That is unjust and unacceptable.' The Turnpike Authority held limited public sessions, excluded on-the-record comments, and failed to address induced demand or environmental justice. The piece urges federal agencies to reject the project, arguing it will worsen pollution, noise, and health outcomes for vulnerable residents. The author calls for investment in safer, more sustainable transportation instead.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT aims to reduce vehicle presence and traffic violence, responding to local advocacy after several high-profile crashes. Residents and organizers, including Alana Herlands and John Surico, voiced strong support: 'We are going to advocate for the most ambitious plan that not only adds more space for the community... but also reduces traffic violence.'

The report, highlighted in Streetsblog NYC, found that replacing diesel buses with electric models could cut 40 million metric tons of greenhouse gases by 2035. The study summary states, 'America would reap massive public health and emissions-reduction benefits from electrifying its bus fleet.' Researcher Sofia Martinez said, 'We definitely need to be advocates for electrification, and for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants in any way we can.' The study urges more federal subsidies to speed up the transition. Even replacing aging diesel buses as they retire would cut 35 million tons of CO2. The report stresses the greatest public health gains would come from electrifying buses in the most densely populated neighborhoods, where diesel pollution hits hardest. The study calls for urgent action to protect city dwellers from toxic air.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Kathy Hochul publicly supported reauthorizing New York City’s red light camera program, which is set to expire in December. The bill, sponsored by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, would renew the program for six years and expand cameras from 150 to 1,325 intersections. Hochul, at a ceremony for 'Sammy’s Law,' said, 'local governments should be making these decisions,' but did not endorse the expansion. The Adams administration and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez have pushed for more cameras. Hochul’s stance signals support for local control over traffic enforcement, but leaves the fate of a broader camera rollout uncertain. Vulnerable road users remain at risk while Albany debates the city’s authority to protect its streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Council and DOT hold the power. Advocates say language matters. Streets remain deadly. Action lags. Lives hang in balance.</p><p class=mb3>On May 8, 2024, Mayor Eric Adams publicly supported lowering speed limits after the passage of 'Sammy’s Law,' which allows New York City to reduce limits to 20 mph on most roads. The law, passed in the state budget, excludes wide, multi-lane roads in the outer boroughs. Adams said, 'I do believe as New Yorkers we need to slow down,' but repeatedly referred to preventable crashes as 'accidents,' a term advocates reject for removing driver responsibility. The City Council must legislate any citywide speed limit change, while the Department of Transportation (DOT) can adjust limits on specific streets after community input. Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers and Speaker Adrienne Adams pledged to 'collaborate and negotiate' with City Hall. Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi stressed the need for street redesign and legal reform, noting, 'This is not a problem that goes away on its own.' Despite new authority, the Adams administration has lagged on safe street infrastructure. The city faces its deadliest start to a year in the Vision Zero era, with 60 killed in the first quarter.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The pilot, announced by MTA Chief Customer Officer Shanifah Rieara, aims to expand OMNY access for low-income riders. Fair Fares gives half-priced rides to New Yorkers earning up to 120 percent of the federal poverty line. The bill’s matter: 'New Yorkers who participate in the city's half-priced transit program Fair Fares will finally be able to use OMNY.' Mayor Adams and the City Council raised eligibility last year, but advocates want broader access. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber called OMNY key for proof-of-payment checks. David Jones, Community Service Society CEO and MTA Board member, supports OMNY for Fair Fares and urges non-police fare enforcement. The pilot follows delays tied to vending machine deployment. About 800,000 New Yorkers qualify for Fair Fares, but only 331,000 are enrolled.

Vice Chair Frederick Bland voiced support for the hub's function and design. Commissioner Mark Ginsberg suggested minor design changes.

The measure remains in committee. The bill responds to a fatal flaw: 'We have no mechanism right now, under law, to crack down on extremely reckless drivers,' said Brooklyn State Sen. Andrew Gounardes. The current law lets drivers rack up dozens of camera tickets and keep driving, since no points are added to licenses. Gianaris’s bill aims to close this loophole. DOT and crash victims’ families, including Juliane Williams, whose daughter was killed by a speeding driver, press for stronger penalties and expansion of the red light camera program. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program expired with little effect. The city’s vulnerable road users remain at risk while repeat offenders face few real consequences.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
