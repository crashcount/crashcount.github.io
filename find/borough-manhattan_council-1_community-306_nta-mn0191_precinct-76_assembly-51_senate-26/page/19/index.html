The piece, titled 'Feds Must Give Transit the Support (And Flexibility) It Needs Right Now,' demands Congress let transit agencies use federal funds for operating costs, not just capital projects. Regan warns, 'This flaw in federal policy is squeezing communities around the country.' He highlights looming service cuts in cities like New York, Boston, and Atlanta. Regan opposes current restrictions and supports permanent change. The opinion, published in Streetsblog NYC, reflects labor’s stance: without operational funding, transit shrinks, and vulnerable riders—those who walk, bike, or rely on buses and trains—face greater risk.

Family and advocates say the plan skips key safety fixes. Jersey barriers leave gaps. Pedestrian islands and bike signals are missing. The city delays. Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On May 19, 2023, the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) latest redesign proposal for Ninth Street in Gowanus drew fire at a Community Board 6 meeting. The plan, discussed in the Transportation and Public Safety Committees, adds buffer-protected bike lanes and some jersey barriers, but skips driveways and omits pedestrian islands, raised intersections, and bicycle signals. Maxime Le Munier, whose wife Sarah Schick was killed by a truck driver on Ninth Street, said, “What we want is to guarantee everyone’s safety, and it seems like it’s going to fall short.” Community Board 6 Transportation Chair Doug Gordon and Public Safety Chair Jerry Armer echoed calls for stronger, faster action. Council Member Hanif hosted a recent event on the issue. The committees unanimously approved the DOT proposal with conditions: more pedestrian safety, more traffic calming, and a comprehensive plan for all of Ninth Street. DOT has not set a timeline. Schick’s family is suing the city for $100 million, alleging negligence.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The $2.6-million, seven-block overhaul—managed by the Parks Department—targets the cracked 1894 path between avenues R and X. Construction, delayed by the pandemic and contract issues, will continue through March 2024. The Parks Department closed the northernmost block but failed to provide a safe, legal detour for cyclists, leaving them to navigate dangerous service roads and unclear signage. Treyger celebrated the start on social media, thanking advocates. Jon Orcutt of Bike New York criticized Parks for slow, unsafe detour practices, saying, 'They should be working on it based on function.'

The program, starting fall 2023 in West Harlem, covers up to 10 residential blocks and 14 public schools. The DSNY report, with McKinsey input, finds containerization viable for most neighborhoods.

Advocates like CHEKPEDS founder Christine Berthet support repurposing parking for trash containers, citing sidewalk access.

She walked, biked, and rode transit. Streets felt safe. Drivers yielded. Cities built for people, not cars. She calls for New Jersey to follow. She saw less danger, more freedom, and fewer cars.</p><p class=mb3>This opinion piece, published April 14, 2023, is not a council bill but a personal statement advocating for car-free living. The author describes her experience in Cambridge, Stuttgart, and Tokyo, where 'everything we needed was within easy reach by foot, bike, bus, or train.' She urges New Jersey to deliver more options for all people, not just drivers. The piece supports congestion pricing, public transit, walkability, and bike infrastructure. No council members are named. The author highlights how deliberate city planning—compact development, mixed uses, and robust transit—keeps vulnerable road users safer. Streets designed for people, not cars, reduce risk and open freedom for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It targets a 15% cut in vehicle miles by 2050. The plan favors safer streets, less pollution, and more ways to get around. Advocates say it’s overdue. The old system kept streets dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>State Bill S1234, introduced by Senator Andrew Gounardes on April 12, 2023, aims to overhaul New York’s environmental review process. The bill, now before the legislature, would replace the outdated 'level of service' metric—focused on driver delay—with a mandate to reduce total vehicle miles traveled (VMT) by 15 percent by 2050. The bill summary states: 'By eliminating the relevance of level of service as a metric and utilizing vehicle miles traveled reduction instead, we can provide a new criteria for determining the significance of transportation impacts.' Gounardes, the bill’s sponsor, argues this shift will cut emissions and promote safer, multimodal streets. Advocates like Jon Orcutt and Sara Lind back the measure, calling it a long-overdue update that could finally let safety and climate take priority over car traffic. The bill follows California’s lead and could set a national example.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

This corridor is a Vision Zero priority but only has an unprotected bike lane. The crash marks the 11th cyclist death in New York City this year, a record high for this point in the year. Council Member Tiffany Cabán called the loss 'wave after wave of grief and heartbreak' and demanded safer streets for pedestrians and cyclists. Transportation Alternatives Executive Director Danny Harris urged Mayor Adams and DOT Commissioner Rodriguez to invest in safe streets and fulfill the NYC Streets Plan’s legal requirements. Advocates noted the Department of Transportation failed to expand bike and bus lanes as required last year. The call is clear: the city must act now to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The contest pits Brooklyn’s 75th Precinct against Queens’ 102nd Precinct for worst parking abuses. The article states: 'cars parked all over the place, garbage everywhere, and little respect for its neighbors.' Officers park illegally, block sidewalks, and force bus passengers into the street. The 75th Precinct surrounds its memorial with cars. The 102nd’s entrance is nearly blocked by police vehicles. Both precincts show disregard for neighbors and the law. Council members are not named; this is a public exposé, not a legislative action. No safety analyst note is provided, but the reporting makes clear: NYPD parking practices endanger pedestrians, transit riders, and neighbors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, named for Sammy Cohen Eckstein, killed by a speeding driver in 2013, would let the city lower limits to 20 mph. The matter, described as 'Let New York City lower its own speed limits,' has strong support from the mayor, DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, and advocates like Families for Safe Streets. Restler’s action was public advocacy. The Assembly is the final hurdle; the bill is already in the governor’s and Senate’s budgets. Advocates cite a 36% drop in pedestrian deaths after the 2014 speed limit change.
