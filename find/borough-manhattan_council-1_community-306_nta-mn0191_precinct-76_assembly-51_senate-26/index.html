The bill, described as 'an extra boost' for automated enforcement, updates home-rule provisions first enacted in 2013. State Senator Andrew Gounardes and Assembly Member Deborah Glick sponsored the measure. Both praised the program’s record in cutting speeds and saving lives. Council member Barbara Russo-Lennon supported the renewal. A safety analyst notes the extension is likely to reduce speeds and crashes, improving safety for pedestrians and cyclists, especially children, without burdening vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Senator Andrew Gounardes, the bill's sponsor, praised the renewal. City data shows a 30 percent drop in severe injuries and a 94 percent fall in speeding at camera sites. Safety analysts confirm: speed cameras cut dangerous driving and protect pedestrians and cyclists without burdening them.

The Streetsblog NYC report reads: "Our elected officials in Albany have failed the livable streets movement again." Despite support for measures like speed camera reauthorization, most bills to protect pedestrians and cyclists died in committee or never reached the floor. Assembly Member Amy Sohn and others criticized the lack of action. The only major win was extending the city’s speed camera program. A safety analyst notes: 'Failure to advance livable streets policies likely maintains the status quo, which typically prioritizes car-centric infrastructure and neglects the safety and needs of pedestrians and cyclists.' The session’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users at risk. No progress. No protection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Andrew Gounardes and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, had passed the Senate Transportation Committee but stalled in the Assembly. The measure would have required drivers caught speeding six or more times in a year to install devices preventing reckless driving. The matter summary states: 'A bill that would require recidivist speeders to install a simple device to block the car from being driven recklessly will not pass this session.' Gallagher expressed frustration, warning that every delay means preventable crashes and lives lost. Safety analysts note the bill would have directly reduced risk for pedestrians and cyclists by targeting repeat dangerous drivers. Despite support from advocates and NYC DOT, the committee cited due process and enforcement concerns. The bill must be reintroduced next year. Vulnerable road users remain at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Prosecutors say Ali drank for nearly six hours at three Manhattan bars, reaching a blood alcohol content of .158, almost twice the legal limit. After hitting Esiyok, Ali continued, injuring a cyclist, two more pedestrians, and crashing into a van. The family’s lawsuit cites New York’s Dram Shop Act, which holds bars liable for serving visibly drunk patrons who later cause harm. The article quotes the family’s lawyer: “The family is devastated. They’re still in disbelief.” The case highlights failures in both driver responsibility and alcohol-serving oversight.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The boards argue the crackdown will not make streets safer and targets vulnerable workers. Ken Coughlin of CB7 said, “This resolution is simply saying, 'This is not the way.'” Jesse Greenwald of CB4 warned of the risks to immigrant delivery workers, stating, “We know that ICE agents are looking for any opportunity to detain and deport our immigrant workers.” The boards’ votes follow similar action by Midtown’s CB6. The article notes the NYPD has not provided evidence for the claimed surge in complaints that prompted the policy. The move highlights growing concern that enforcement strategies may harm vulnerable road users instead of addressing systemic street safety issues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The statement reads, 'There's a new member of Families for Safe Streets, which is not good news.' Joe Jankoski, mourning Amanda Servedio, spoke out after her death by a recidivist speeder. The group’s ranks swell with each tragedy. No specific bill or committee is named in this event. Kuntzman’s statement underscores the relentless danger faced by pedestrians and cyclists. The safety analyst notes: the event describes a new member joining an advocacy group, which does not directly affect pedestrian or cyclist safety at the population level. The city’s streets remain perilous. The group’s growth is a grim measure of failure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
