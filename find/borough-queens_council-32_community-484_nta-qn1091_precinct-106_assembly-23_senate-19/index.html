A 33-year-old male rear passenger suffered a head injury. A 27-year-old male driver sustained severe leg lacerations. According to the police report, the contributing factor was “Unsafe Speed.” That driver error sits at the center of this crash. No other contributing factors were listed for the drivers or passengers. The road’s wide, fast design leaves little margin when drivers barrel ahead.

The suit claims the redesign would "jeopardize" safety and hinder emergency access, despite DOT data showing 190 injuries and two deaths in the area since 2020. DOT says the project targets "unpredictable vehicle movements" and double parking, with design elements "found on streets across the city." The agency says it incorporated feedback from 90% of local businesses. The legal fight spotlights tension between safety improvements and business concerns, as the corridor ranks among Queens' most crash-prone.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The original proposal called for 2,775 homes and limited parking. Now, density drops by 27 percent.

The Assembly passed it 110-31, with nine city lawmakers—Alec Brook-Krasny, Lester Chang, Simcha Eichenstein, Michael Novakhov, Stacey Pheffer Amato, Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Reilly, David Weprin, Kalman Yeger—opposing. The Streetsblog NYC article, 'Ye Shall Know Their Names! Meet the Dirty Dozen City Pols Who Voted Against Speed Camera Program,' quotes lawmakers dismissing speed cameras as revenue grabs or burdens. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action, so no direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists can be assessed.'
