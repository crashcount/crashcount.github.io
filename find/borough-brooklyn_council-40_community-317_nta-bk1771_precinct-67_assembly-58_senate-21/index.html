A driver turns right. The man goes down. In Holy Cross Cemetery and the blocks around it, this is not rare. It is routine. <strong>Five people injured in five crashes in the last year.</strong> None died. But the numbers do not show the limp, the hospital bills, the fear that lingers at the curb.</p><p><strong>No one is spared.</strong> Children, adults, the old. In the last twelve months, injuries struck every age: a teenager, a man in his thirties, a woman in her forties. No one was killed. But the luck will not hold. The street does not care.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hit>The Machines That Hit</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do the damage.</strong> In this patch of Brooklyn, they are the only ones to injure pedestrians. No bikes. No motorcycles. Just steel and glass, moving too fast, turning too quick. The data is plain: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>sedans, vans, SUVs</a> are the weapons. The people on foot are the targets.</p><h3 id=the-silence-of-power>The Silence of Power</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The state passes laws. But here, in Holy Cross Cemetery, the blood dries and the leaders stay quiet. <strong>No bold redesigns. No new protections.</strong> The numbers tick up, the bodies mend or do not. The crisis moves slow, but it moves. Each crash is a warning. Each injury is a failure.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Streets can be made safe. Speed can be slowed. Crosswalks can be rebuilt. But only if leaders act. Only if neighbors demand it. The cost of waiting is counted in broken bones and lost days.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand slower speeds, safer crossings, and streets that do not maim.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for the next siren. <a href=../../take_action/>Act now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The city planned to restore the old painted lane, citing complaints about fast bikes and e-bikes. But advocates and residents sued, arguing the old design was unsafe and that 'safety of all road users has improved since the upgraded design was installed.' The judge's order prevents immediate removal, pending an August hearing. Transportation Alternatives called the ruling a win for street safety, saying, 'We won't let anyone make our streets more dangerous.' The case highlights ongoing tension between street safety improvements and city policy decisions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists called the move "unwise and unsafe." The article notes the city had previously identified this stretch as among the most dangerous. Officials responded to concerns by painting pedestrian islands and loading zones but did not install physical barriers or bus boarding islands. Cyclists described the decision as political, with one saying, "There’s a very important voting bloc that’s using their leverage over the mayor to remove the bike lane." The mayor’s refusal to sacrifice parking for safety left vulnerable road users exposed. The city’s Streets Master Plan, which mandates more protected lanes, remains unmet.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
