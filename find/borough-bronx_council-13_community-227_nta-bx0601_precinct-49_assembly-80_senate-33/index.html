A car jumps the light. The street swallows her. In West Farms, the numbers pile up. <strong>Since 2022, two people are dead. Five more are left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, 160 neighbors have been hurt in 210 crashes. No one walks away unchanged.</p><p>The dead do not speak. The living remember. <strong>A 26-year-old woman was killed by an SUV on Boston Road</strong>. She was not in the roadway. She never made it home. The city calls it a collision. The family calls it a loss that never ends.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-speed-and-broken-bodies>The Pattern: Cars, Speed, and Broken Bodies</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the damage.</strong> They killed two. They left dozens more with broken bones and blood on the street. Bikes and mopeds hurt a handful, but the real carnage comes on four wheels. The numbers do not lie: <strong>SUVs and sedans are the main threat to life and limb here</strong>.</p><p>The stories repeat. A driver misses a turn and mounts the sidewalk. Six people go to the hospital. Police say the injuries are minor, but the fear lingers. &ldquo;I saw one lady was out on the ground. They was giving her medical attention, checking her body. She was laid out,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/op-city-crash-multiple-people-injured-including-1-critically-bronx/17075710/>said a witness</a>. The city moves on. The street stays the same.</p><h3 id=leaders-votes-bills-and-the-waiting>Leaders: Votes, Bills, and the Waiting</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough.</strong> State Senator Luis Sepúlveda voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting tech <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>in June 2025</a>. Assembly Member Karines Reyes co-sponsored the same bill. Council Member Oswald Feliz backed a law to ban parking near crosswalks. These are steps. But the blood keeps flowing. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so.</p><p>The survivors wait. The dead do not.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-make-them-feel-the-heat>Call to Action: Make Them Feel the Heat</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to drop the speed limit to 20 mph. Tell them to back bills that stop repeat speeders. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Streets grow less safe for people on foot and bike.</p><p class=mb3>Bill S 7785, titled 'Relates to bus operation-related traffic regulations,' passed the Senate and Assembly in June 2025. The measure, sponsored by Senator Jamaal Bailey, excludes violations in cooperative housing developments with at least 10,000 Mitchell-Lama units from bus operation traffic regulations. The bill advanced through committee and received broad support in both chambers. By exempting these large complexes, the law weakens traffic enforcement where thousands live. This move increases risk to pedestrians and cyclists, stripping away protections that save lives. Vulnerable road users lose another layer of safety in dense city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
