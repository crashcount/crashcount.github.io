The incident left a 49-year-old woman in critical condition. The driver, Stanley Manel, was arrested and charged with failure to yield and failure to exercise due care. The officials' statement read: 'We’re deeply saddened and outraged at the news of yet another pedestrian being struck by an unsafe driver in Greenpoint.' Restler and colleagues highlighted the intersection's dangers and the driver's history—35 tickets since 2019, including 26 speed camera violations. They urged support for bills requiring speed control devices for repeat offenders and for Sammy’s Law, which would let NYC set its own speed limits.

Mike Gianaris and Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani announced a $90-million proposal to expand bus service and the MTA's free bus pilot. The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, became a public reckoning for Mayor Adams's transportation record. The matter: 'a proposal in Albany to increase bus service before congestion pricing begins.' Mamdani accused Adams of 'incompetence' and violating the Streets Master Plan law, which requires 30 miles of new bus lanes each year. Reporters pressed for answers on mayoral compliance. MTA CEO Janno Lieber praised Adams's past promises but noted the lack of progress. The mayor's spokesperson defended the administration, but data shows bus speeds have dropped since Adams took office. No safety analyst has formally assessed the impact, but the lack of bus lanes leaves vulnerable road users exposed to traffic danger and slow, unreliable transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Their proposal seeks $45 million in this year’s budget to boost bus frequency, with another $45 million to triple free buses citywide. The lawmakers’ push follows a successful fare-free pilot, which Mamdani says increased ridership by over 20%. Gianaris admitted, 'It should have been done sooner.' Critics argue the move is too late, as congestion pricing was approved in 2019. Some unions warn of possible driver shortages, but Mamdani insists existing buses and operators can handle the expansion. The funding proposal comes as the congestion toll faces lawsuits and could launch by mid-June.

Bus speeds dropped from 7.7 mph in January 2022 to 7.4 mph in December 2023. Adams claimed his approach was 'revolutionary' for prioritizing community input. Critics, including Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and Riders Alliance spokesman Danny Pearlstein, countered that Adams canceled or stalled key projects like Fordham Road, despite strong community support. Mamdani said, 'he's made 1.4 million daily bus riders take the slowest buses in the country.' The mayor’s promises remain unmet.

The Department of Transportation missed legal targets both years. The matter, as reported, states: 'Mayor Adams claimed... his administration has done an "amazing job" building bus lanes... despite missing legally required targets.' Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani, representing District 36, slammed the mayor for scrapping key projects and failing bus riders. Mamdani said, '49 percent of bus riders are dissatisfied with wait times... instead he's made 1.4 million daily bus riders take the slowest buses in the country.' Riders Alliance joined the criticism, demanding a real plan for the 130 miles of overdue bus lanes. The city’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users exposed, with no clear agenda for safer, faster streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Local officials, including Council Member Lincoln Restler, called it a 'critical step' but noted it lacks key safety elements. The compromise leaves gaps.

The rider’s leg broke. Politicians and neighbors demand the mayor act. The city delays a safety plan. The street stays deadly. The call is clear: fix McGuinness now.</p><p class=mb3>On August 11, 2023, Council Member Lincoln Restler and other Northern Brooklyn officials responded to a crash on McGuinness Boulevard, where a driver hit and injured a moped rider. The incident happened near Meeker Avenue, one block from where teacher Matthew Jensen was killed in 2021. The matter, titled 'Locals call for mayor to take immediate action after moped rider injured on McGuinness Boulevard,' highlights the urgent need for the Department of Transportation’s proposed safety redesign. Restler, along with U.S. Rep. Nydia Velázquez, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, and State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, issued a joint statement: 'Lives are being put at risk. We need immediate action by the Mayor's office to implement the Department of Transportation's proposed safety improvements so that everyone in our community can feel confident that McGuinness Boulevard will not cause more tragedies.' The safety plan remains blocked, leaving vulnerable road users exposed to ongoing danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
