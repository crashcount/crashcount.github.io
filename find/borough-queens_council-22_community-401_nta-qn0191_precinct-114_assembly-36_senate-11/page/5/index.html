The article states: “If the governor wants to do the MTA and riders a favor, she should use the money she finds to instead boost MTA operations.” Author Samuel Santaella criticizes Hochul’s move, arguing it jeopardizes service for working-class New Yorkers. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and State Senator Michael Gianaris are cited as proponents of fare-free buses, while Riders Alliance pushes for six-minute service. The piece urges Hochul to reject highway expansions and instead invest in frequent, affordable transit.

The MTA ends its free bus pilot. Ridership soared. Assaults on drivers fell. Assemblymember Mamdani pushed for more funding. The state said no. Riders and workers lose. The streets stay dangerous. The fight continues.</p><p class=mb3>The MTA free bus pilot, funded by the state in 2023, ends August 31, 2024, after lawmakers dropped support in the latest budget. The pilot let riders skip fares on one route per borough. According to the bill summary, 'the program mainly benefitted existing riders.' Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, a strong proponent, pushed for more funding but faced MTA opposition. He said, 'When you see fare evasion at levels of 48%, that speaks to an economic issue where working-class New Yorkers are being priced out of public transit.' The pilot saw weekday ridership jump 35% and assaults on drivers drop 39% on free routes. Despite these gains, the state did not renew funding. Mamdani pledged to keep fighting for free bus service, as the MTA faces deeper funding woes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
