Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights.

Council Member Chi A. Ossé leads as primary sponsor, joined by Restler, Marte, Hudson, Cabán, Brannan, Hanif, Brewer, and Abreu. The bill would prohibit bike share companies from charging members more than the base subway fare for e-bike rides of one hour or less, or regular bike rides of two hours or less. The law would take effect 120 days after passage and apply to new or renewed contracts.

The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee had advanced the bill, but Speaker Adrienne Adams held it back from a full vote, citing ongoing debate. The bill’s summary: ending NYPD tickets for crossing outside crosswalks, a practice disproportionately enforced against New Yorkers of color. Councilmember Tiffany Cabán, a sponsor, condemned the law’s discriminatory impact and its failure to reduce traffic violence. After lawmakers amended the bill to shield drivers from liability in pedestrian crashes, advocates like Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives withdrew support, insisting the law should 'clearly protect [pedestrians’] right to safety and security.' The latest version still exposes jaywalkers to civil suits and mandates a city safety education campaign. The bill’s future is uncertain. Advocates demand stronger protections for people on foot.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Restler called for renewed investment in the MTA, including the resumption of congestion pricing, to fund future upgrades. The project continues through 2027, but no more full shutdowns are planned.
