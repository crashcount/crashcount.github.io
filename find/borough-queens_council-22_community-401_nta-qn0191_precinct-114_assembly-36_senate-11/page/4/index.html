Jean-Baptiste, driving a Dodge Ram, turned left and hit Jimenez as he crossed the busy intersection. Jimenez suffered a massive head injury and died a week later. The driver remained at the scene and was later given a desk appearance ticket.

The owner, Jose DeAguiar, described, "He rams right into the side of the car." The driver exited, inspected the damage, then left without leaving a note. Despite clear video evidence, DeAguiar spent three months seeking accountability as insurers denied responsibility. Only after ABC7's intervention did Amazon respond, covering $6,000 in repairs and $5,000 in storage fees.

City Comptroller Brad Lander echoed the urgency, calling mass transit 'the lifeblood of NYC.' The rally criticized Mayor Adams and former Governor Cuomo for failing bus riders and not meeting the NYC Streets Plan’s promise of 10 to 15 new bus lanes each year.

The plan, detailed in his mayoral campaign, calls for fully staffing the Department of Transportation's bus unit, painting at least 30 miles of new bus lanes each year, and expanding transit signal priority. Mamdani says, 'There is a portion of that 'fast' that comes from the fact that if you make it free [you get] a faster ride.' He also pledges to lockbox dedicated funding for free service, citing his past work on MTA rescue packages. Mamdani and his allies point to a recent free bus pilot that increased ridership and reduced assaults. The proposal, if enacted, would shift street space from cars to buses, aiming to make public transit safer and more reliable for all riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The rest called for safer streets, more transit, and fewer cars.</p><p class=mb3>At a May 8, 2025 forum, candidates for New York City mayor faced off on the future of parking and street space. The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, featured Scott Stringer, Zellnor Myrie, Jessica Ramos, Brad Lander, Zohran Mamdani, and Whitney Tilson. Stringer pledged to move the city away from car dependence and build infrastructure for biking and transit. Myrie called for removing parking mandates to boost housing and speed up buses. Ramos supported repurposing parking for safer streets and green space. Lander pushed for eliminating parking minimums citywide and dynamic curbside management. Mamdani criticized the vast space given to cars. Only Tilson promised to preserve free street parking. The candidates’ stances show a clear divide: most want to reclaim streets for people, not vehicles. The debate signals a shift toward policies that could reduce car dominance and improve safety for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill would require 16- and 17-year-olds riding Class 1 or 2 e-bikes, including Citi Bikes, to wear helmets. Committee Chair William Magnarelli (D-Syracuse) defended the bill, stating, "My only concern is the safety of the people riding the bike." The bill summary notes, 'studies have shown [helmet mandates] can dramatically reduce ridership of the city’s bike share system.' Experts warn such laws lead to fewer cyclists and open the door to discriminatory enforcement, especially against youth of color. Seattle dropped its helmet law in 2022 for these reasons. Despite evidence that helmet laws hurt vulnerable road users, the committee advanced the bill without addressing these harms.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Restler called the disparity 'extreme.' Caban said, 'Black and brown people are being beaten up, searched, arrested, 10 times more than white people.' The NYPD claimed disparities stem from policing high-crime areas. Lawmakers rejected this, citing data showing Black and Latinx drivers are disproportionately stopped, searched, and arrested. The hearing referenced the city’s long record of racially biased enforcement, including jaywalking laws once used to target Black and Latinx New Yorkers. Experts, including the NYCLU, say the Adams administration’s surge in traffic stops continues a pattern of racist policing.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
