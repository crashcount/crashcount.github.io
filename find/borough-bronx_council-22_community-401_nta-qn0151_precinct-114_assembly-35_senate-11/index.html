The proposal, discussed at a heated community board meeting, remains active and is set for installation after summer repaving. Council Member Tiffany Caban, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, and Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas endorsed the plan in a letter, stating it would 'protect pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers while making our streets safer and less congested.' DOT spokesman Will Livingston said the design improves safety and supports local businesses. Despite opposition from some business owners, the plan moves forward. Safety analysts note: 'Protected bike lanes are proven to reduce injuries and fatalities for cyclists and pedestrians, encourage mode shift, and improve street equity by reallocating space from cars to vulnerable users.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The protest, covered by Streetsblog NYC, centers on mass deactivations and the fight for gig worker protections. Sophia Lebowitz opposes the deactivations and supports worker rights. The article states, 'More than 50 delivery workers have had their accounts deactivated by Grubhub in the past two weeks, and they're blaming the company's new owner, Wonder.' Council Member Tiffany Cabán’s 'Secure Jobs Act' is cited as a possible remedy, requiring companies to give reason for termination, even for gig workers. The safety analyst warns: deactivating accounts pushes workers into riskier, informal jobs, increases unsafe cycling, and erodes safety in numbers for vulnerable road users. The city’s streets grow more dangerous when riders disappear.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Members Yusef Salaam, Tiffany Caban, and Lincoln Restler pressed NYPD Director Joshua Levin about stark racial disparities. The matter: 'Council members criticized NYPD leadership over racial disparities in traffic enforcement after the department refused to acknowledge evidence of bias.' Restler called the disparity 'extreme.' Caban said, 'Black and brown people are being beaten up, searched, arrested, 10 times more than white people.' The NYPD claimed disparities stem from policing high-crime areas. Lawmakers rejected this, citing data showing Black and Latinx drivers are disproportionately stopped, searched, and arrested. The hearing referenced the city’s long record of racially biased enforcement, including jaywalking laws once used to target Black and Latinx New Yorkers. Experts, including the NYCLU, say the Adams administration’s surge in traffic stops continues a pattern of racist policing.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers is the primary sponsor, joined by Amanda Farías, Justin L. Brannan, Shahana K. Hanif, Kamillah Hanks, and Tiffany Cabán. The bill highlights the steep $7 express bus fare, which leaves students in transit deserts with few safe, affordable options.

The move targets long, complex trips that force riders to pay extra. Sponsors say the current policy punishes those with the hardest commutes.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0252-2024 sits in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced March 7, 2024, it urges Albany to pass and sign a law creating unlimited subway and bus transfers within two hours for pay-per-ride users. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the New York State Governor to sign, legislation, which would create unlimited transfers within the two-hour period of paying the Metropolitan Transportation Authority subway or bus fare for pay-per-ride users.' Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez leads as primary sponsor, joined by Riley, Stevens, Hanif, Won, Feliz, Salaam, Hanks, Farías, De La Rosa, Cabán, Williams, Hudson, Ung, Ossé, Banks, and Holden. The sponsors argue the current one-transfer rule hits hardest for riders with long, complex trips, often in transit deserts. They demand fare equity for all, not just those with short, easy rides.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
