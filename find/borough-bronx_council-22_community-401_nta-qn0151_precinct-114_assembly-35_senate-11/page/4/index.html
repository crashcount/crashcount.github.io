In Astoria, a 35-year-old driver 'lost control of her vehicle and went onto the sidewalk, running over two girls, ages 7 and 14.' Police charged her with reckless driving and driving without a license. Later, in South Ozone Park, a 79-year-old driver swerved, sideswiped a bus, then 'jumped the curb and struck four women who were standing at a bus shelter.' All victims survived, but injuries ranged from broken bones to head trauma.
