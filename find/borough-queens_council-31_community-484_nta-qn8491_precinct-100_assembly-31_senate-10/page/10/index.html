The law requires the Department of Transportation to publish a monthly-updated, searchable map of all city bike lanes. The map must show obstructions, construction, crash patterns, shared paths, conflict points, resurfacing, parking, bike share docks, open streets, repair shops, and reporting tools. The bill’s matter title reads: 'requiring the department of transportation to develop a map of bicycle infrastructure conditions.' Council Member Crystal Hudson sponsored the bill, joined by Rivera, Sanchez, Stevens, Yeger, Restler, Avilés, and others. The law brings sunlight to hidden hazards, giving vulnerable road users the facts they need to see the city’s dangers in plain sight.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the installation of solar-powered crosswalks.'

The map must show obstructions, construction, crash patterns, shared paths, conflict points, resurfacing, parking, bike share docks, open streets, repair shops, and reporting tools. The bill’s matter title reads: 'requiring the department of transportation to develop a map of bicycle infrastructure conditions.' Council Member Crystal Hudson sponsored the bill, joined by Rivera, Sanchez, Stevens, Yeger, Restler, Avilés, and others. The law brings sunlight to hidden hazards, giving vulnerable road users the facts they need to see the city’s dangers in plain sight.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

NYPD Transportation Bureau’s Michael Pilecki reported arrests for forged plates fell 11 percent from last year, while summonses rose just 0.6 percent. The hearing spotlighted two bills from Council Member Oswald Feliz to raise fines for using or selling fake plates, both widely supported, including by the NYPD. The matter summary: 'NYPD claims it has stepped up its efforts to summons and arrest car drivers who cover or deface their plate, or drive with a fake temporary tag, but its own statistics show that the effort has not continued into this year.' Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers and Kamillah Hanks did not comment. Activists and officials noted DOT’s automated cameras failed to bill 1.2 million violations last year due to temp tags, leaving dangerous drivers unaccountable.

Ariola said, 'At long last, we will finally have a safe, steady, and efficient flow of traffic here, and the area is now more resilient than ever before.' The project, part of a $16.6 million investment begun in March 2021, also repaired or replaced 1,100 feet of storm sewer and added new left turn lanes.
