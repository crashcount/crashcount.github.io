Brooks-Powers—bearing the highest toll. The matter, titled 'Crunching the Data on the Record-Setting Year For Cyclist Deaths,' details that 94 percent of victims died on streets lacking protected bike lanes. Transportation Alternatives called on Brooks-Powers and her Council colleagues to pass Intro 417, which would eliminate a three-month wait and speed up bike lane construction. Brooks-Powers, mentioned as district representative, faces mounting pressure as advocates decry delays and demand urgent action. The report states: 'Promises won’t keep bike riders safe – but completed, fully protected bike lanes will. The time to act is now.' The city’s failure to meet the NYC Streets Plan benchmarks has left vulnerable road users exposed, with advocates urging immediate follow-through on essential street redesigns.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states, 'Traffic crashes in New York City killed more cyclists through the first nine months of 2023 than all but one other year on record.' Adams promised 75 miles of new protected bike lanes each year but delivered just 26.3 miles in 2022, missing the 30-mile benchmark and falling far short of the 50-mile requirement for 2023. Danny Harris, executive director of Transportation Alternatives, accused Adams of putting 'politics over people' and called on Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers and colleagues to pass Intro 417, which would eliminate a three-month delay in bike lane construction. DOT spokesman Chris Browne defended the administration, citing nearly 100 street projects. But the report is clear: delays and broken promises leave cyclists exposed and dying.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report, reviewed by Council Transportation Chair Selvena N. Brooks-Powers (District 31), found little impact: 'A program meant to crack down on dangerous drivers did not dramatically reduce their behavior.' Only half completed the course, violations persisted, and just 12 vehicles were seized. Brooks-Powers stated, 'Holding reckless drivers accountable and keeping our streets safe for all New Yorkers remains a priority.' Comptroller Brad Lander criticized DOT for abandoning the effort, urging the city to strengthen, not scrap, DVAP.

The bill required drivers with 15 speed-camera or five red-light tickets in a year to take a safety course or risk vehicle seizure. Council Member Shahana Hanif voiced disappointment, noting, 'We need to not only reauthorize this program, but strengthen it.' Despite over 34,000 drivers meeting the threshold in the last year, only about 1,200 took the course in three years. DOT has not explained the reporting delay or provided outcome data.

The hearing, led by Transportation Committee chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, pressed DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez for answers. The law requires 150 miles of protected bus lanes and 250 miles of protected bike lanes by 2026. In 2022, the city built only 4.4 miles of bus lanes and 26.3 miles of bike lanes, far short of the legal benchmarks. Councilmember Lincoln Restler criticized political interference, saying, 'We're at a point where it's all politics all the time, and we're failing to execute.' Advocacy groups confirmed the city lags behind. The administration’s refusal to track or disclose progress leaves vulnerable road users exposed.

DOT officials, including Deputy Commissioner Eric Beaton and Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, refused to provide current figures, promising data next year. Brooks-Powers called this 'unacceptable.' She stressed, 'The 30 miles of bus lane and 50 miles of bike lanes is not a goal—it’s legal mandate.' The exchange revealed ongoing tension over DOT’s slow rollout and lack of transparency. Staffing shortages and council opposition to projects were cited as obstacles.

The matter summary reads, 'New York City is on pace for one of the deadliest years for bike riders in recent history, but it doesn't have to be this way.' Restler called on the Adams administration to 'prioritize and expedite proven solutions that will save lives, especially the swift implementation of a truly protected network of bike lanes.'

Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers and Kamillah Hanks did not comment. Activists and officials noted DOT’s automated cameras failed to bill 1.2 million violations last year due to temp tags, leaving dangerous drivers unaccountable.
