She crosses Woodhaven Boulevard. A motorcycle hits her as the light turns. She does not make it home. Her mother waits for a text that never comes. &ldquo;The night that she died, I spoke to her. I told her that I love her&mldr; And then that&rsquo;s when I found about the accident&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/27/up-and-coming-soul-singer-headed-home-from-show-dies-after-being-struck-by-queens-motorcyclist/>said Paula Henderson</a>.</p><p>In the last twelve months, two people died and 110 were injured on Forest Park streets. One was a 23-year-old woman, struck and killed at an intersection. Another was a 28-year-old man, crushed on the Jackie Robinson Parkway. One child suffered serious injury.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h3><p>Since 2022, Forest Park has seen five deaths and 279 injuries from crashes. Cars and SUVs killed two. Motorcycles killed one. Sedans and SUVs caused most of the pain. No one died on a bicycle. The dead do not care about statistics. But the living must.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-excuse>Leadership: Action or Excuse?</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The state passed Sammy’s Law, letting New York City lower speed limits. But the limit on Woodhaven Boulevard still stands. Cameras catch speeders, but only where they are allowed. The law that keeps them running is always at risk of expiring. Each delay is a dare. Each silence is a sentence.</p><p>District Attorney Melinda Katz said it plain after a road rage killing: &ldquo;Our roadways are not the place to settle disputes&rdquo; <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/driver-charged-murder-deadly-nyc-road-rage-crash-da-says>she told Patch</a>. But the streets remain the same. Wide. Fast. Deadly.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p>Every day of delay is another family broken. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that do not kill. Do not wait for another unopened text. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Vulnerable road users watch and wait.</p><p class=mb3>On June 25, 2025, New York City held local elections with major implications for street safety. The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, saw candidates who championed 'the importance of bike lanes, public transit, and open streets' win across the city. Council members Lincoln Restler, Shahana Hanif, Shekar Krishnan, Chi Oss, Crystal Hudson, and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams all prevailed on platforms supporting safer streets. Mark Levine, who called for bold highway changes, won the Comptroller race. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text is a vague statement of support for livable streets but does not describe a specific policy action or legislative change, so its direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists cannot be determined.' The victories signal a mandate for people-first streets, but concrete safety gains depend on future action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Instead of a ban, the Parks Department will increase signage and enforcement, especially near concessions. The community board voted 30-1 for new signs and called for marked bike lanes, an 8 mph speed limit, and clearer right-of-way rules.

The system failed them again.</p><p class=mb3>On May 9, 2025, during New York State’s $254-million budget negotiations, lawmakers rejected Governor Hochul’s proposed street safety measures. The legislature dropped a mandate for daylighting—banning parking at corners near elementary schools—deferring instead to New York City, where Council Member Julie Won’s universal daylighting bill faces opposition from the Department of Transportation. Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, herself a crash survivor, vowed to keep fighting for daylighting, saying, 'I think daylighting would have helped me.' Hochul’s proposals to let the city set lower bike lane speed limits and to reclassify heavy e-bikes as mopeds were also cut. Critics argued these would not address core safety issues. The Adams administration opposes a City Council bill for e-bike registration and plates, while State Sen. Jenifer Rajkumar’s state version would shift licensing to the DMV. As Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives put it, 'A daylighting requirement would have made intersections safer around elementary schools, and it’s disappointing that this provision was cut from the New York State budget.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Prosecutors revealed Pena had '25 tickets for speeding in school zones' in recent years. Surveillance showed both cars spinning out after the crash; Diaz died at Elmhurst Hospital. Pena tested positive for cocaine, marijuana, and had a blood-alcohol content of 0.156%. He faces 14 charges, including manslaughter and DWI. Diaz’s family called for stronger laws, with his mother stating, 'They need to look at the laws and see that people need to be charged accordingly.'
