A black Mercedes comes fast. The car does not stop. It hits him, throws him into the air, drags him half a block. His mother stands on the sidewalk and watches her son die. “That car deliberately went straight speeding, didn&rsquo;t stop, hit my son all the way up into the air and came down, dragged him half a block, they killed my son,” <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bronx-pedestrian-killed-heartbroken-family-mourns-father-3-nyc-hit-run/16394341/>she said</a>.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>three people died</strong> on these streets. <strong>Six were left with serious injuries.</strong> One was a child. <strong>160 people were hurt.</strong> The numbers do not stop. They do not care if you are young or old. They do not care if you are walking, riding, or sitting in a car.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage.</strong> In the last three years, sedans killed one person and injured nine more. Trucks broke bones and left a pedestrian with a crushed body. SUVs, taxis, bikes, mopeds—all played their part. The street does not forgive. The machines do not care.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city passed Sammy’s Law. Now, the speed limit can drop to 20 mph. But the limit has not dropped. The council has not acted. The mayor has not acted. The blood dries on the crosswalk while leaders wait.</p><p><strong>Speed cameras work.</strong> Where installed, speeding drops. But the law that keeps them running is always at risk. Each year, Albany must vote to keep them alive. Each year, the clock runs out for someone.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone with power. The council can lower the speed limit. The mayor can demand safer streets. Albany can keep the cameras on. They have the tools. They need the will.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand 20 mph. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets where children can cross and come home.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another body in the road. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
