The toll is not. Since 2022, this area logged <strong>11 deaths and 886 injuries</strong> in 1,492 crashes, with trucks and buses involved in deadly pedestrian strikes. The city’s own data say so (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=maurice-fresh-pond-grand-the-hard-corners>Maurice, Fresh Pond, Grand: the hard corners</h3><p>A 75‑year‑old woman was hit and killed while crossing with the signal at Fresh Pond Road and 60th Road. The driver made a right turn in a pickup. Police recorded “Failure to Yield Right‑of‑Way” (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash 4669744</a>).</p><p>On Maurice Avenue, a 47‑year‑old cyclist died in a three‑vehicle crash involving a box truck and a parked SUV (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash 4705063</a>).</p><p>Grand Avenue keeps taking hits too. The dataset flags deaths and dozens hurt there since 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-expressway-edge>The expressway edge</h3><p>The Long Island Expressway is Maspeth’s top hot spot by injuries, with one death and 172 injured. Heavy vehicles show up again and again in local wrecks (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). On a June morning, a 26‑year‑old motorcyclist died after contact with a tractor‑truck during a lane change on the LIE (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash 4729766</a>).</p><p>The numbers run late into the day. Injuries peak in the evening rush at 5–6 p.m., and pain spreads across the clock. Deaths show at 10 a.m., 6 p.m., 8 p.m., 10 p.m., and near midnight (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data hourly</a>).</p><h3 id=who-gets-hurt-here>Who gets hurt here</h3><p>Pedestrians: 3 killed, 101 injured. Cyclists: 1 killed, 75 injured. People on mopeds and other small devices: 4 killed, 27 injured. Vehicle occupants: 3 killed, 683 injured. Trucks and buses are tied to pedestrian harm: 2 of the pedestrian deaths involved trucks, per the rollup (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The listed causes are blunt. Failure to yield. Improper passing. Inattention. Unsafe speed shows up too. “Other” is the largest bucket in the city’s coding, which hides more than it tells, but the bodies are real (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=what-could-change-on-these-blocks>What could change on these blocks</h3><p>Start with turns. Harden the right turns on Fresh Pond Road and Grand Avenue. Give walkers a head start with LPIs. Clear sightlines with daylighting. These basics answer the failure‑to‑yield pattern the data shows on local corners (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Cut truck risk. Target truck routes to keep the biggest vehicles off neighborhood streets. Enforce yielding at Maurice and Fresh Pond during peak injury hours. The dataset’s “trucks/buses” share in pedestrian harm makes the case (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=accountability-that-sticks>Accountability that sticks</h3><p>Obscured plates block cameras and block justice. A new Council bill would revoke city permits for drivers caught with covered or defaced plates. Council Member Robert Holden is listed as a sponsor on <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int. 1358‑2025</a>. The bill says it aims at “revocation of city‑issued parking permits” for “obscured or defaced license plates” (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council Legistar</a>).</p><p>Repeat speeders do outsized harm citywide. Albany is moving a bill to force speed‑limiting tech on drivers who rack up violations. State Sen. Michael Gianaris voted yes in committee on <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>, which would require intelligent speed assistance for repeat offenders, per the bill summary and vote logs (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>).</p><h3 id=slower-streets-save-lives>Slower streets save lives</h3><p>The worst damage in Maspeth piles up at truck routes and fast corridors like the LIE, Maurice, Fresh Pond, and Grand. The fixes are simple and known: slower turns, clear corners, real truck management, speed kept in check. Citywide, lower default speeds and stopping repeat speeders will reach every block here.

Council Member Julie Won and Mayor Ravi Bhalla called the report a scare tactic, urging citywide daylighting to save lives. DOT’s compromise with pro-car officials weakens protections.
