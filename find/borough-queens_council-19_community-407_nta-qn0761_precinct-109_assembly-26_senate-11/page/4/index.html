Council Members Bob Holden and Vickie Paladino publicly oppose Citi Bike expansion, congestion pricing, and safe street redesigns, framing them as attacks on drivers. The piece states: 'Initiatives that use less than 1 percent of a city’s parking spots for something that isn’t the private storage of vehicles... are labeled a "war" on our "way of life."' The editorial underscores how these measures—bike lanes, pedestrianization, reduced car speeds—are essential for protecting vulnerable road users. It warns that entrenched car culture and political backlash threaten progress, but also notes growing public demand for safer, more walkable streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The piece, titled 'Hey, Bike Haters, You Will Lose the Culture War You're Starting,' highlights Paladino's public opposition to congestion pricing, electric vehicle transition, and safe street redesigns. She uses her office to denounce these measures as 'Democrat-led cash grabs.' The editorial notes, 'Cities cannot succeed in solving America’s road-death crisis without calming streets, reducing car speeds and creating more space for cyclists and pedestrians.'

Paladino has co-sponsored two pending Council bills to increase fines for fake tags and has publicly decried unregistered vehicles, stating, 'The only solution to this, of course, is old-fashioned law enforcement.' Despite her tough stance, photographs showed the car with the fake tag on public streets. Paladino claimed the tag was merely expired, but Arizona authorities confirmed it was a forgery. Her son denied knowledge of the fake tag. Paladino’s actions highlight a stark contradiction between her legislative efforts and her family’s conduct.

The measure targeted blaring horns, illegal claxons, and roaring engines. It died at session’s end. No direct safety gains for people walking or biking. Noise remains. Streets stay loud.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0312-2022 was introduced on May 5, 2022, in the Committee on Public Safety. The bill aimed to amend the city’s administrative code to increase penalties for excessive noise from motor vehicles, including those under and over 10,000 pounds, and for unauthorized horns and claxons. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to increasing certain penalties for excessive noise from motor vehicles.' Council Member Sandra Ung sponsored the bill, joined by 26 co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023, and did not advance. There is no evidence the bill would have improved safety for vulnerable road users. The city’s noise problem, and its threat to livable streets, remains unresolved.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill aimed to shift responsibility for sidewalk damage caused by city-owned trees from homeowners to the Parks Department. The matter title reads: 'requiring the parks department to repair damage caused by trees owned by the city of New York.' Council Member Kalman Yeger sponsored the bill, joined by Holden, Ung, Ayala, Restler, Dinowitz, Williams, Gutiérrez, Riley, Schulman, Brooks-Powers, Lee, Paladino, and Vernikov. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law. If passed, it could have led to safer, smoother sidewalks for pedestrians and cyclists, removing a hazard that city government created and left to fester.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
