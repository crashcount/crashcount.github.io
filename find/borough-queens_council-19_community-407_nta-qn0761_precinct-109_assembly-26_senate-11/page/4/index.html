The piece states: 'Initiatives that use less than 1 percent of a city’s parking spots for something that isn’t the private storage of vehicles... are labeled a "war" on our "way of life."' The editorial underscores how these measures—bike lanes, pedestrianization, reduced car speeds—are essential for protecting vulnerable road users.

She uses her office to denounce these measures as 'Democrat-led cash grabs.' The editorial notes, 'Cities cannot succeed in solving America’s road-death crisis without calming streets, reducing car speeds and creating more space for cyclists and pedestrians.'

Paladino has co-sponsored two pending Council bills to increase fines for fake tags and has publicly decried unregistered vehicles, stating, 'The only solution to this, of course, is old-fashioned law enforcement.' Despite her tough stance, photographs showed the car with the fake tag on public streets. Paladino claimed the tag was merely expired, but Arizona authorities confirmed it was a forgery. Her son denied knowledge of the fake tag. Paladino’s actions highlight a stark contradiction between her legislative efforts and her family’s conduct.

Ben Turner, a Bayside resident, challenges Council Member Vickie Paladino’s opposition, arguing she misrepresents her district. Turner writes, 'Congestion pricing is a step in the right direction for northeastern Queens.' He claims most commuters use public transit, while drivers into Manhattan are wealthier. Turner highlights the toll of car dominance: traffic, slow buses, pedestrian fatalities, and childhood asthma. He insists that reducing car use will free up space, improve safety, and boost quality of life. Turner’s stance: congestion pricing is vital for safer, healthier streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Adams argued, “MTA is a statewide obligation. We’re doing our share.” State lawmakers, including Assembly Member Ed Braunstein and State Senator Liz Krueger, countered that the city should help. Hochul’s budget would shift more costs—like Access-A-Ride and student Metrocards—to the city. Progressive lawmakers suggested taxing the wealthy and freezing fares. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins warned, “To increase fares would be detrimental.” The debate continues as the legislature drafts its own budget.

Council Member Kalman Yeger sponsored the bill, joined by Holden, Ung, Ayala, Restler, Dinowitz, Williams, Gutiérrez, Riley, Schulman, Brooks-Powers, Lee, Paladino, and Vernikov. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law. If passed, it could have led to safer, smoother sidewalks for pedestrians and cyclists, removing a hazard that city government created and left to fester.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
