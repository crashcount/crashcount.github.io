Councilmember Vickie Paladino opposes Vision Zero, speed cameras, and bike lanes. Councilmember Chris Marte leads efforts to reopen Park Row to cars, a move criticized by safety advocates. The Department of Transportation supports some safety measures, like speed governors and suspending registrations for repeat offenders, but rejects universal daylighting, claiming other treatments work better. Advocates and family members call for lower speed limits, more protected bike lanes, and urgent reforms to save lives. The DOT disputes some findings, especially on daylighting and fatality trends.

The impact caused the garage to collapse onto both his SUV and a parked, unoccupied Prius. Police said Barry was trapped and later died at Jamaica Hospital. The article notes, 'he lost control of the SUV, which went crashing into a detached garage in Queens, police said.' Family members stated Barry had no known medical issues.

The matter, titled "Masters of Deflection: Congestion Pricing Foes Stoke Fear of Subway Crime," highlights how some council members and political groups use concerns about subway crime to oppose congestion pricing. Councilwoman Vickie Paladino voiced strong opposition, while advocates like Sara Lind and Ben Furnas countered that such arguments ignore real solutions and endanger transit funding. The article notes, 'Data shows the subway is statistically safer than city streets for both pedestrians and drivers.' Despite visible homelessness and high-profile crimes, most riders continue to use the subway. The debate exposes how fear is weaponized to block policies that could reduce traffic violence and improve safety for vulnerable road users.

Vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>This policy debate, dated January 8, 2025, centers on congestion pricing enforcement in New York City. The matter, titled 'Congestion Pricing: City Needs to Get Real With Plate, Placard Frauds,' highlights the city's weak response to license plate and placard fraud since the $9 toll launched. Council Member Vickie Paladino joked about sabotaging toll cameras, while Mayor Adams downplayed the issue. Transportation experts like Sam Schwartz called for stronger action: 'There’s a lot more the city can do.' The NYPD and Sanitation Department have removed some ghost plates, but enforcement remains patchy. Placard abuse and fake plates let drivers dodge tolls and traffic laws, eroding the policy’s impact. The anonymous watchdog Placard Corruption noted, 'Even a strong effort would probably take some time to reverse years of corruption.' Without real enforcement, the city’s most vulnerable—pedestrians and cyclists—remain at risk from unchecked, rule-breaking drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She wrote on X, "a high-powered green laser pointer like the ones you find on eBay for under $30 can destroy a camera sensor." She added, "So if you buy one of these lasers, be sure to NOT point them at any cameras, because they could be permanently damaged!" Paladino also shared footage of vigilantes destroying enforcement cameras in London, warning, "it would be foolish to believe the same won't happen here in due time." Her comments came the day the MTA launched congestion pricing, which charges drivers to enter Manhattan below 60th Street. Paladino’s stance undermines the city’s efforts to control traffic and protect vulnerable road users.

The bill is titled, "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to installing child with autism warning plaques on streets." Council Member Kevin C. Riley is the primary sponsor, joined by Ariola, Joseph, Moya, Won, Banks, Narcisse, Paladino, and Marmorato. Their action: referral to committee. The bill requires the Department of Transportation to install warning plaques at the request of a parent or guardian. It details the process for requesting, installing, and removing these signs. The stated aim is to alert motorists to the presence of a child with autism. There is no evidence these plaques reduce crashes or protect children.
