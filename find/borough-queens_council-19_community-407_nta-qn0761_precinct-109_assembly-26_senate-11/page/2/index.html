The report states, 'the number of children and teens killed in car crashes in NYC has reached record highs, with 16 kids killed last year.' Councilmember Vickie Paladino opposes Vision Zero, speed cameras, and bike lanes. Councilmember Chris Marte leads efforts to reopen Park Row to cars, a move criticized by safety advocates. The Department of Transportation supports some safety measures, like speed governors and suspending registrations for repeat offenders, but rejects universal daylighting, claiming other treatments work better. Advocates and family members call for lower speed limits, more protected bike lanes, and urgent reforms to save lives. The DOT disputes some findings, especially on daylighting and fatality trends.

The impact caused the garage to collapse onto both his SUV and a parked, unoccupied Prius. Police said Barry was trapped and later died at Jamaica Hospital.

The matter, titled "Masters of Deflection: Congestion Pricing Foes Stoke Fear of Subway Crime," highlights how some council members and political groups use concerns about subway crime to oppose congestion pricing. Councilwoman Vickie Paladino voiced strong opposition, while advocates like Sara Lind and Ben Furnas countered that such arguments ignore real solutions and endanger transit funding. The article notes, 'Data shows the subway is statistically safer than city streets for both pedestrians and drivers.' Despite visible homelessness and high-profile crimes, most riders continue to use the subway. The debate exposes how fear is weaponized to block policies that could reduce traffic violence and improve safety for vulnerable road users.

Vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>This policy debate, dated January 8, 2025, centers on congestion pricing enforcement in New York City. The matter, titled 'Congestion Pricing: City Needs to Get Real With Plate, Placard Frauds,' highlights the city's weak response to license plate and placard fraud since the $9 toll launched. Council Member Vickie Paladino joked about sabotaging toll cameras, while Mayor Adams downplayed the issue. Transportation experts like Sam Schwartz called for stronger action: 'There’s a lot more the city can do.' The NYPD and Sanitation Department have removed some ghost plates, but enforcement remains patchy. Placard abuse and fake plates let drivers dodge tolls and traffic laws, eroding the policy’s impact. The anonymous watchdog Placard Corruption noted, 'Even a strong effort would probably take some time to reverse years of corruption.' Without real enforcement, the city’s most vulnerable—pedestrians and cyclists—remain at risk from unchecked, rule-breaking drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city’s safety net for pedestrians and cyclists grows weaker.</p><p class=mb3>On January 6, 2025, Councilmember Vickie Paladino (District 19, Queens) made a public statement opposing congestion pricing enforcement. She wrote on X, "a high-powered green laser pointer like the ones you find on eBay for under $30 can destroy a camera sensor." She added, "So if you buy one of these lasers, be sure to NOT point them at any cameras, because they could be permanently damaged!" Paladino also shared footage of vigilantes destroying enforcement cameras in London, warning, "it would be foolish to believe the same won't happen here in due time." Her comments came the day the MTA launched congestion pricing, which charges drivers to enter Manhattan below 60th Street. Paladino’s stance undermines the city’s efforts to control traffic and protect vulnerable road users.

The fight for safer streets continues.</p><p class=mb3>This advocacy piece, published December 25, 2024, by Streetsblog NYC, is not a council bill but a year-end reflection on the livable streets movement. The article, titled 'On Christmas, Let’s Consider the Successes of the Livable Streets Movement,' features a short film by Clarence Eckerson Jr. and highlights the work of groups like OpenPlans, Streetfilms, and StreetsblogNYC. Mayor Adams, Zohran Mamdani, Vickie Paladino, Ydanis Rodriguez, and Governor Kathy Hochul are named as figures in the year’s news. The film and article celebrate progress in street safety and sustainable transportation, showing that advocacy can bring real change for vulnerable road users. No direct safety analyst note is included, but the message is one of hope and continued struggle for safer streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article highlighted both progress and setbacks, stating: 'The 2024 Streetsie Awards by Streetsblog NYC review the year's best and worst in NYC transportation policy, highlighting key events, policies, and political actors.' Key actions included the City Council decriminalizing jaywalking and cutting mandatory parking minimums, though low-density areas were left out. Council Member Lincoln Restler lost his Transportation Committee seat despite pushing for citizen enforcement against illegal parking. Speaker Adrienne Adams, Comptroller Brad Lander, and Mayor Adams were all named for missed promises or weak follow-through. Sanitation Commissioner Jessica Tisch’s crackdown on ghost plates drew praise. The review called out Gov. Hochul for delaying congestion pricing, then reversing course. The NYPD faced criticism for ignoring placard abuse and Vision Zero, and for deadly high-speed chases. The piece underscored the need for accountability and stronger action to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The stated aim is to alert motorists to the presence of a child with autism. There is no evidence these plaques reduce crashes or protect children.

Streets will change.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0746-2024, now Local Law 94 of 2024, was enacted by the City Council on October 12, 2024, after passing the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the improvement and maintenance of medians through the planting of vegetation or use in stormwater management," requires the city to improve at least one mile of paved medians every two years until 2046. The Department of Transportation, Parks, and Environmental Protection must add planted medians, tree beds, or stormwater infrastructure, focusing on high-priority investment areas. Council Member Shekar Krishnan sponsored the bill, joined by Feliz, Avilés, Nurse, Banks, Restler, Ung, Schulman, Holden, Hudson, and Yeger. The Council passed the bill with broad support, though the mayor returned it unsigned. The law mandates annual progress reports and public tracking of improved medians and responsible agencies.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
