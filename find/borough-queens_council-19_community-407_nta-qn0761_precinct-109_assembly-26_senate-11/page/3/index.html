The city adds more car-free zones for kids. Streets once deadly will now be safer for walking, play, and learning. The move targets neighborhoods hit hardest by crashes.</p><p class=mb3>On August 29, 2024, the Department of Transportation announced a record 71 school streets will close to cars this fall. The expansion, not tied to a specific council bill, builds on the Open Streets program, made permanent in 2021. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodríguez said, 'We have created a new framework to give this space back to our school children.' Councilwoman Vickie Paladino celebrated the new open street at PS 129, calling it a win for safe pick-up, drop-off, and play. Funding comes from the Public Space Equity Program, with $30 million focused on under-resourced areas. Street Lab will provide programming and street furniture. The program responds to past investigations showing higher crash and injury rates outside schools, especially in poorer neighborhoods. The city will directly fund management and operations starting in 2025, aiming to make these safety gains permanent.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law would require all unregistered e-bikes, mopeds, and scooters to register with the NYC Department of Transportation and display a visible plate. The bill honors Priscilla Loke, killed by an e-bike rider who ran a red light. Paladino declared, 'It's time for e-bike accountability. Our streets cannot be a free-for-all when it comes to these motorized vehicles, which are increasingly causing chaos throughout the city.' The bill has support from 31 council members. Emergency doctors report rising injuries and deaths from e-vehicle crashes.

Council Members Eric Dinowitz (primary sponsor), Vickie Paladino, and Robert F. Holden back the measure. They argue that capped fines are too low—companies absorb them, streets clog with trucks, and residents pay the price. The Council wants authority to set fines that actually deter illegal parking.

Streets remain deadly for the vulnerable.</p><p class=mb3>On May 20, 2024, Councilmember Vickie Paladino (District 19) was mentioned in a public debate following a deadly weekend on Queens streets. The event, covered by Gothamist, highlighted that 2024 is one of the deadliest years for Queens since Vision Zero began. The matter summary states, 'Five people were killed by cars over the weekend.' Paladino criticized DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and street safety advocates, calling for a 'robust, inclusive debate.' Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives condemned the city's failure to meet the 2019 NYC Streets Plan, which mandates 50 miles of protected bike lanes and 30 miles of bus lanes each year. The city has built only 72% of required bike lanes and 19% of bus lanes. Advocates point to rising deaths, especially among children, and blame delays and opposition from local officials. The debate underscores a systemic failure to protect pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The group wrote to MTA chairman Janno Lieber, stating, "Express buses play a vital role in Queens’ public transit network and only stand to become even more pivotal in the near and distant future." They criticized the MTA for boosting express bus service in Brooklyn and Staten Island but not Queens, calling the exclusion "unacceptable." The lawmakers stressed that many southeast and northeast Queens residents lack subway access and rely on express buses to reach Midtown. They argued the 10 percent LIRR discount is no substitute for robust bus service.

The move targets riders, not reckless drivers. The bill died at session’s end. Parks remain a rare refuge, but the threat of cars still looms outside.</p><p class=mb3>Int 1267-2023 was introduced on December 6, 2023, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting the operation of electric scooters and bicycles with electric assist in parks,' sought to ban e-scooters and e-bikes from all parks under city jurisdiction. Council Members Robert F. Holden (primary sponsor), Vickie Paladino, Joann Ariola, and Ari Kagan backed the measure. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote or enactment. The summary reads: 'This bill would prohibit the operation of electric scooters and bicycles with electric assist in any park under the jurisdiction of the department of parks and recreation.' No safety analyst assessed the bill’s impact on vulnerable road users. The measure targeted micro-mobility, not the cars that kill.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
