The measure targeted blaring horns, illegal claxons, and roaring engines. It died at session’s end. No direct safety gains for people walking or biking. Noise remains. Streets stay loud.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0312-2022 was introduced on May 5, 2022, in the Committee on Public Safety. The bill aimed to amend the city’s administrative code to increase penalties for excessive noise from motor vehicles, including those under and over 10,000 pounds, and for unauthorized horns and claxons. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to increasing certain penalties for excessive noise from motor vehicles.' Council Member Sandra Ung sponsored the bill, joined by 26 co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023, and did not advance. There is no evidence the bill would have improved safety for vulnerable road users. The city’s noise problem, and its threat to livable streets, remains unresolved.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
