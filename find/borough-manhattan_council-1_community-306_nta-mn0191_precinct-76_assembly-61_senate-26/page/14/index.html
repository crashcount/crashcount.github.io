The episode detailed how, from Hurricane Katrina to the Lahaina wildfires, seniors bear the brunt of heat, floods, and storms. Host Jeff Wood pressed on the need for policy that protects the vulnerable. The discussion made clear: the system ignores the predictable, mounting toll on older adults.

He stated, 'The Bedford Avenue bike lane has been unacceptably dangerous since it was first laid, and for years, the people of my district have been promised that it would be protected.' Advocacy groups, including Transportation Alternatives, echoed his frustration, citing record cyclist deaths and urgent need for safety. The DOT has not responded to requests for comment.

In a closed-door meeting with the Department of Transportation, Adams said, "My legacy is not how many bike miles I do. My legacy is not how many bus lanes I do." He signaled a shift from measurable safety benchmarks to a focus on community input, a move DOT staffers called "extremely micromanaged." Adams’s administration has failed to meet even the minimum legal standards for new lanes. A mayoral spokesman claimed the city still delivers "safe, efficient streets," but advocates say Adams’s approach relies on vague metrics and lacks accountability. No council members are directly involved; this is a mayoral policy stance. The result: fewer protected spaces for vulnerable road users, more risk on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Past proposals to extend the M22 or restore the B71 with a Manhattan extension were dismissed over cost and logistics.

Council Members Christopher Marte (primary sponsor), Lincoln Restler, and Rita C. Joseph backed the measure. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote or enactment. The proposal would have targeted illegal parking, a key threat to pedestrians and cyclists. With the bill’s failure, enforcement remains fragmented. Vulnerable road users continue to face blocked crosswalks and bike lanes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He says communities need more input. Advocates warn this lets small groups block life-saving changes. The city falls behind on safety targets. Vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On October 17, 2023, Mayor Eric Adams made a public statement criticizing the Department of Transportation’s community outreach for street redesigns. No council bill number applies; this is a mayoral policy stance. Adams said, “We have not done a good job of speaking to long-term residents on how they want the shaping of their streets to change.” He announced a new door-to-door engagement strategy on Underhill Avenue, after stalling a bike network project for over a year. Adams’s comments came as he defended delays and rollbacks of approved street safety improvements, citing the need for more community input. Advocates like Jon Orcutt (Bike New York) and Juan Restrepo (Transportation Alternatives) condemned the mayor’s approach, warning it gives veto power to small groups and leaves the city “rudderless” on street safety. DOT outreach has dropped to its lowest since Vision Zero began. The city is on pace to miss its bike and bus lane goals for the second year running. Vulnerable road users face continued danger as life-saving projects stall.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, led by the Department of Transportation, aimed to create a protected bike lane from the Manhattan Bridge to Barclays Center. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso said, "New York City is regressing on meeting its Vision Zero goals ... and stalled street safety improvements, like those slated for Ashland Place, are a part of the reason why." State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Council Member Crystal Hudson joined the outcry, with Hudson lamenting the incomplete corridor for cyclists. The DOT confirmed the southernmost block would not be converted, following objections from developer Two Trees Management. Advocates cited 88 crashes and multiple injuries in two years, with the most dangerous block excluded from improvements. Residents and advocates rallied, accusing the mayor of prioritizing business over public safety. City Hall deflected, blaming e-bikes for rising cyclist deaths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Sanitation (DSNY) leads the rollout. The plan covers about 41% of city housing. The official summary states, 'New Yorkers living in smaller residential buildings will have to set out their garbage in lidded bins.' DSNY Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended sidewalk placement, saying, 'It is standard practice around the world to put wheelie bins out on the sidewalk rather than in the parking lane.' Advocate Christine Berthet countered, 'While the bags will be easy to move between cars, containers will be much harder. And therefore having them in the parking lane would be a major benefit.' The city will retrofit trucks for the new bins. For now, pedestrians must still navigate bins on crowded sidewalks. The curb stays reserved for parked cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The policy, unveiled by DSNY, aims to move trash from sidewalks into closed bins, targeting cleaner streets and less sidewalk clutter. The mayor said, 'Everyday New Yorkers are tired of the rodents, they’re tired of the trash, and this is a small price to pay on ensuring that you can have cleaner streets.' Council member Shaun Abreu, representing West Harlem, voiced strong support, citing visible improvements from the local pilot. The plan requires smaller buildings to use wheeled bins on sidewalks, while larger buildings would get shared curbside containers. The city faces pushback from some residents, but Adams insists street cleanliness is a top concern. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the move could clear sidewalks for pedestrians and reduce hazards from trash piles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, discussed in October 2023, has not specified a streamlined process for licensing. The matter’s summary states: 'Holden's bill does nothing to rectify the fundamental issues of inadequate space and dangerous workplace practices.' Holden and his colleagues push regulation, but critics say the bill ignores the real threats: narrow sidewalks, blocked crosswalks, and unsafe delivery work. The proposal would burden riders and discourage micromobility, while failing to address illegal mopeds or car dominance. State Senator Brad Hoylman’s employer-provided ID plan is cited as a better alternative. The opinion calls for protected bike lanes, wider sidewalks, and fair enforcement, not more bureaucracy.
