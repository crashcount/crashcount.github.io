Brooks-Powers stated, 'The Streets Plan is the law, and the Department of Transportation is still failing to fulfill its legal obligations.' She promised to hold DOT accountable at an upcoming budget hearing. The city also lagged on bus stop upgrades, completing just 54 out of 500 required. Cyclist fatalities soared to 30 in 2023, the highest this century.

The plan, discussed in workshops since spring 2023, would reduce the avenue from three to two moving lanes each way, add parking-protected bike lanes, and install painted pedestrian islands. Board members, including Katie Walsh and Gabino Morales, voiced strong support, with Morales stating, 'This is just a beginning of what we could do to fix our community.' Diana Gonzalez described the avenue as a place where 'they're gonna kill you.' The board will urge DOT to go beyond paint and install hard infrastructure.

Gounardes declared, 'That’s not gonna happen if the money’s not there.' The MTA earmarked $6 billion for accessibility, aiming to make 70 stations ADA accessible and modernize 78 elevators. Disability advocates like Elizabeth Valdez and Joe Rappaport stressed that most disabled New Yorkers rely on subways and buses, not private cars.

The plan will close the current narrow walkway this fall and replace it with an eight-foot-wide path for cyclists and pedestrians by year’s end. The project is part of a broader push to make three MTA bridges accessible to non-drivers. MTA Construction and Development President Jamie Torres-Springer said, 'The MTA has made great progress in planned capital improvements to pedestrian and bike accessibility on bridges.' Local cyclist Allegra LeGrande called the move overdue, noting, 'If they build it they will come.' The project includes a cantilevered ramp for wheelchair access and improved exits. While the path is closed, a shuttle bus may run for six weeks. The overhaul answers years of calls for safe, direct bike connections between the Bronx and Manhattan, and throws down a challenge to city agencies to fix the patchwork of local bike paths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Departments of Sanitation and Transportation used narrow plows to clear bike lanes, including the East River bridges and key protected paths. Commissioner Jessica Tisch said, "We put salt on every street, every highway, every bike lane in the city, we've done multiple passes at it." The DOT boasted about clearing the Brooklyn Bridge bike path before sunrise. Citi Bike stayed open. But sidewalks, left to property owners, remained treacherous. Mayor Adams praised road crews while standing by snow-covered pedestrian space. Commissioner Tisch warned, "We want those sidewalks safe tomorrow." The city’s effort favored cyclists and drivers.

Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance says the bill is about shifting priorities to climate and equity. Advocates note that over 90 percent of recent infrastructure funds went to roads, not transit.
