The plan, described as a 'traffic network and public realm plan,' aims to convert Underhill Avenue into a bike boulevard and upgrade Vanderbilt Avenue with new bike lanes, pedestrian islands, and traffic-calming features. The proposal follows community workshops where residents demanded safer, people-first streets and dedicated loading zones. DOT will close the northern-most block of Underhill to cars, add two-way bike lanes, and install pinch-points to slow drivers. On Vanderbilt, sharrows become painted bike lanes, and new pedestrian islands and turn lanes will protect cyclists and walkers. DOT hopes to begin construction in the fall and is reviewing the neighborhood for further changes. Gib Veconi, a local advocate, said, 'The changes will help force drivers to slow down 24/7.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation (DOT) briefed Manhattan Community Board 1 on the plan, which aims to prioritize pedestrians and cyclists in the Financial District. The project, funded by $500,000 from then-Council Member Margaret Chin, remains in the study phase, delayed by the pandemic. DOT Project Manager Jenny Leung said the city is updating conditions and planning stakeholder engagement. Community Board 1 and the Financial District Neighborhood Association (FDNA) have backed the plan since 2015 and 2016, respectively. FDNA Board Member Catherine Hughes pressed for urgency, saying, 'It's time for a pilot project now.' Business leader Jessica Lappin voiced logistical concerns. The plan envisions shared streets with 5 mph speed limits and a future pedestrian plaza. Progress is slow.

The project, part of the Streets Master Plan, faces committee review and community outreach through summer and fall, with implementation not expected before 2023. DOT Director of Bus Priority Kyle Gebhart said, “Everything is on the table.” The agency’s data shows slow buses and high rates of pedestrian and cyclist injuries. The plan divides the corridor into three segments for tailored solutions, including curbside and center-running bus lanes, transit signal priority, and busways. Some business groups voiced anger over possible parking loss, but transit advocates countered that most shoppers do not drive. Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein said, “Busways are great for business, bringing more customers from more neighborhoods more efficiently and affordably.” The project’s outcome will shape safety for thousands who walk, bike, and ride.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The petition, described as a call for 'wider sidewalks and a wider median, a protected bike lane, and eliminating one lane of traffic in each direction,' follows the hit-and-run death of teacher Matthew Jensen. Gallagher stated, 'Our community is speaking loud and clear: no more deaths on McGuinness.' The campaign has support from Councilmember Lincoln Restler and Borough President Antonio Reynoso.

The Department of Sanitation will install several dozen rat-proof trash bins for building managers and superintendents to store garbage and recycling, moving bags off sidewalks and into curbside street lanes. The matter summary reads: 'Testing a rat-proof trash container... instead of on the sidewalk.' Council Member Erik Bottcher said he is 'thrilled that our district was the first to be chosen for this exciting advance,' calling it 'another important step.' The pilot takes parking space for bins, sparking complaints from drivers but clearing pedestrian paths. The city plans to expand the $1.3-million program to all five boroughs. Critics note the bins are small and collection methods unchanged, limiting scale.

They acknowledged recent progress but warned, 'the disturbing incidents we've seen in recent weeks and the last 48 hours remind us just how fragile those positive steps are and how much more work remains.'

The bill was set to expire but now runs through July 1, 2025. The matter summary states: 'New York City is now able to operate its speed cameras 24 hours a day.' Glick, who sponsored the bill, dismissed criticism that cameras are a cash grab, saying, 'The city isn't in the car with you... If you don't want to get a ticket, don't speed.' Mayor Eric Adams called the cameras a deterrent, not a punishment. Advocates say the law will slow cars and protect pedestrians, especially children.

No more gaps. Crashes and injuries near schools drove the change. The law dropped tougher penalties, but sponsors vow to keep fighting. Streets stay dangerous. Cameras now never sleep.</p><p class=mb3>On June 24, 2022, Governor Kathy Hochul signed a bill expanding New York City's school zone speed camera program to operate 24/7, year-round. The bill, sponsored by Assembly Member Deborah Glick and State Senator Andrew Gounardes, was passed after statistics showed rising crashes and injuries near schools. The matter summary: 'The city's school zone speed cameras will now operate 24/7 year-round.' Hochul cited student deaths and the need for constant protection. Mayor Adams called the program a national model, noting, '72 percent of fatalities have been happening when the cameras were off.' The bill was weakened from its original form, dropping escalating fines and stricter penalties for repeat offenders due to City Council concerns. Glick and Gounardes pledged to push for stronger measures. A separate bill to expand red light cameras failed. The new law closes deadly loopholes but leaves enforcement gaps for repeat offenders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, described as 'crucial for providing protected access to parks and greenways,' faces criticism from activists and residents who say it lacks key connections and leaves cyclists exposed. CB11 member John Kelly, speaking personally, voiced fear for his child’s safety and called for a shift in car culture. Victor Dadras, chair of the CB11 Transportation Committee, called the plan 'a step in the right direction' but admitted it is incomplete. The committee will discuss the proposal further, with a full board vote expected in September. DOT may begin marking lanes in the fall.
