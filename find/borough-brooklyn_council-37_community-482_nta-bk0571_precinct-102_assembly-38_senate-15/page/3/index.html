The matter, titled 'expanding the delivery worker minimum wage to grocery delivery workers,' drew sharp lines. Council Member Sandy Nurse (D-Brooklyn), sponsor, blasted industry claims that fair pay would hurt food-insecure New Yorkers, calling them 'absurd and thoughtless.' The Chamber of Progress, representing Instacart and others, testified against the bills. The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) and advocacy groups testified in favor, with Commissioner Vilda Vera Mayuga stating, 'This package of bills would close that gap.' Economic experts argued that previous wage hikes did not raise prices for consumers. Advocates for immigrant and Muslim workers demanded equal wage protections. The hearing exposed the rift between industry and worker safety, with the Council siding with vulnerable workers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Erik D. Bottcher is the primary sponsor, joined by Julie Won, Jumaane Williams, and others. The bill prohibits standing or parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and mandates the Department of Transportation to install daylighting barriers at a minimum of 1,000 intersections per year.

The bills aim to close a loophole that lets grocery delivery apps like Instacart avoid paying the $20 per hour minimum wage required for restaurant deliveristas. The matter title: 'Council Seeks To Expand Minimum Wage to Grocery Deliveristas.' The hearing is scheduled for December 9. Council Member Alexa Avilés, chair of the Immigration Committee, called for broader protections: 'When you become a worker, you should be ensured a living wage.' Ligia Guallpa of Worker’s Justice Project said all delivery workers face significant risks and deserve safety, dignity, and respect. The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection supports expanding the wage standard. Instacart opposes the bill.

The bill, now before the Council, mandates at least 25 percent of stations be placed in the roadway and requires DOT to report on usage and maintenance after three years. The matter title calls for 'expanding e-bike charging and battery safety infrastructure.' Rivera said, 'We certainly want to expand the conversation around e-bike charging and battery safety as much as possible.' Industry voices, like Baruch Herzfeld of Pop Wheels, argue the plan is too small to meet demand or curb deadly indoor charging fires. Ligia Guallpa of the Worker’s Justice Project warns that infrastructure has not kept pace with e-micromobility growth, increasing risks for riders and workers. The bill follows years of slow city action, with only three public charging stations operating today.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, as described: “the legislature never gave her or any governor the power to do away with the traffic toll.” The brief cites the 2019 Traffic Mobility Act, arguing only the Traffic Mobility Review Board and the MTA can make such decisions. The lawmakers warn that letting the governor override the MTA would “make impossibly opaque the actual responsibility for MTA decisions.” Their action supports the MTA Board’s independence and opposes executive interference.

The gap opened when Governor Hochul halted Manhattan’s congestion pricing. The bill, discussed but not passed, would have replaced lost revenue—$1 billion a year meant for transit upgrades. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, mentioned in the debate, said, 'Our conference is reticent to commit a billion dollars annually for the next 15 years without having some understanding in place as to how we're going to deal with congestion as well.' Lawmakers could not agree on new taxes or a legislative IOU. The inaction leaves critical MTA projects—like electric buses and accessible stations—at risk.

Council leaders pushed back. Mastro fights congestion pricing in court. Progressives and caucus members call him unfit. Adams dodges questions. Council signals rejection. Streets stay dangerous while power brokers argue.</p><p class=mb3>On April 24, 2024, Mayor Adams considered Randy Mastro for corporation counsel. The City Council, which must approve the appointment, voiced strong opposition. The Progressive Caucus chair, Council Member Sandy Nurse, declared, 'she would not support Mastro and would encourage her fellow progressives to follow her lead.' The Black, Latino and Asian Caucus called the potential appointment 'an affront to the principles of public service we all hold dear.' Mastro is currently representing New Jersey in its lawsuit against New York's congestion pricing plan. Adams refused to say if Mastro’s anti-congestion pricing work would affect city policy, insisting attorneys should not be demonized for their clients. The council appears ready to reject Mastro if nominated. Vulnerable road users remain at risk while city leaders debate who will shape transportation policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
