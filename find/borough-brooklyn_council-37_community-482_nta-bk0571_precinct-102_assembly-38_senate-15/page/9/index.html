The hearing, covered by Streetsblog NYC, spotlighted Council Member Sandy Nurse and Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso. Nurse demanded full funding for sanitation, calling the crisis 'unprecedented.' Reynoso urged immediate action on 'save-as-you-throw' and mandatory organics recycling, saying, 'We have full authority to implement both.' The matter title reads: 'TRASH CITY: Here’s Why New York is So Filthy.' The committee reviewed stalled pilot programs and budget cuts. Nurse stressed the need for equitable services and investment in public transit and clean streets. The debate exposed political inertia and underfunding, leaving sidewalks hazardous for pedestrians and failing neighborhoods most at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The group condemned the current plastic delineators, noting, 'From day one, the Grand Street bike lane has failed to keep people safe.' Since 2019, 67 cyclists have been injured and 196 crashes reported. The letter urges the city to replace weak barriers, fix dangerous entrances, and finally deliver safety for vulnerable road users.

The push follows years of crashes—67 cyclist injuries and 196 total crashes since 2019—despite so-called 'protected' lanes. The matter, titled 'Activists and electeds ask DOT to add better barriers to Grand Street bike lane,' highlights how plastic bollards fail to stop drivers from blocking lanes, forcing cyclists into traffic. Restler, along with Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, State Senator Julia Salazar, and Borough President Antonio Reynoso, signed a letter urging Mayor Adams and Commissioner Rodriguez to act. The DOT has started hardening some lanes citywide, but Grand Street remains unprotected. Activists say, 'We knew the omission of protective jersey barriers would lead to dangerous conditions back in 2019 and we have witnessed that prediction come tragically true throughout 2021.' The call is clear: real barriers, not broken promises.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
