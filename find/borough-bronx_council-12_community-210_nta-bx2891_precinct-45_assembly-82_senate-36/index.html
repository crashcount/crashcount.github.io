Eighty-three injured. One left with life-altering wounds.</strong> That is the count in Pelham Bay Park over the last year alone. These are not just numbers. They are fathers, mothers, sons, daughters—people who left home and did not return the same.</p><p>Crashes come steady as rain. In the last twelve months, there were <strong>95 crashes</strong> in this small corner of the Bronx. The deadliest was a 42-year-old, killed behind the wheel on Pelham Parkway this April. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The data does not give his name</a>. It only says: apparent death. Lap belt and harness. Ford SUV. Night fell. He did not come home.</p><p><strong>Injuries cut across every age.</strong> Children, teens, the old. No one is spared. In the last year, two children under 18 were hurt. Twenty-one people aged 45 to 54. The violence is not random. It is relentless.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have tools.</strong> Sammy’s Law lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph. The city has expanded speed cameras and redesigned intersections. But in Pelham Bay Park, the carnage continues. The numbers do not show a sharp drop. They show a steady drip of blood.</p><p><strong>No public statements. No bold new plans.</strong> The silence is loud. The law gives power, but power unused is no power at all. Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> It is policy. It is choice. The city can lower speeds. The city can harden crossings. The city can flood the streets with cameras that never blink. But only if leaders act.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras.
