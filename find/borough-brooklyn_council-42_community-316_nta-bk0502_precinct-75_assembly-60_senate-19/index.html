A push to shield riders and people on the street.</p><p class=mb3>Int 1347-2025 is in Committee. It sits with the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure after introduction and referral on August 14, 2025. The bill’s title reads, “A Local Law … in relation to enforcing violations against unlicensed commuter vans.” It orders TLC, with NYPD and DOT, to maintain a checklist of laws on vehicle and driver licensure, service authorization, insurance, and inspections. When an officer stops an unlicensed van, they must review the list and issue the maximum penalty for each violation. Primary sponsor Nantasha M. Williams is joined by Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, Mercedes Narcisse, Chris Banks, and Farah N. Louis. The aim is to protect riders and bystanders from unlicensed operators who skip the rules.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Council passed the bill with a veto-proof majority. Council Member Sandy Nurse, the sponsor, called out Adams for breaking his 2022 promise to raise pay standards. The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection backed the bill, saying it would close gaps in pay protections. According to safety analysts, this event concerns labor protections and does not directly affect street safety or infrastructure for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Eighteen caucus members back the bill, aiming to force a vote this year. The matter: 'eliminate parking within 20 feet of an intersection.' Council Member Sandy Nurse called daylighting 'a proven, effective way to make our streets safer.'
