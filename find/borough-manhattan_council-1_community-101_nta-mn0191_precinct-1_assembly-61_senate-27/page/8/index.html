Non-member unlock fees rise to $4.99. Annual membership remains at $219.99. The Adams administration negotiated price caps in 2023; Lyft’s new rates stay below those limits. The matter summary notes, 'Lyft's latest increases still fall below those caps—even as they earned mild jeers from regular users.' No council members are directly involved, as this is a company action, not legislation.

Speaker Adams called the benchmarks 'critical for street safety,' and her spokesperson Mara Davis criticized DOT for 'consistently fall[ing] short of complying with the law.'

The piece notes, 'America's first-ever congestion pricing program had been paused at the 11th hour... brought back in November, though in a sadly diminished form.' USDOT approved a rule for automatic pedestrian emergency braking in new cars. Atlanta passed a right-on-red ban. St. Louis invested $300 million in sustainable transport. Canadian leaders pushed for high car registration fees to fund transit. No single council member is named; instead, the review tracks national and local leaders’ actions.

The move comes weeks before new congestion tolls hit Manhattan. The matter, titled 'MTA plans fare hike as it OKs $1.27B train car purchase weeks before new congestion toll: ‘Keep the grift alive’,' drew fire from Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30), who called the fare and toll hikes a 'scam' and accused the MTA of mismanagement. Holden’s comments echo broader council criticism of the MTA’s spending and question the effectiveness of congestion pricing. MTA officials defend the investment, citing improved reliability and safety with the new R211 cars. No independent safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.

Cars keep winning.</p><p class=mb3>On December 18, 2024, Governor Kathy Hochul announced that New Jersey rejected a 'very generous' settlement offer to end its lawsuit against New York’s congestion pricing plan. The matter, reported by Streetsblog NYC, centers on New York’s offer of over $100 million for New Jersey Transit, potentially as an annual payment from congestion toll revenue. Hochul said, 'We've made multiple offers to settle this lawsuit. Very generous offers.' New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy refused, risking further strain on NJ Transit, which recently raised fares 15 percent. Riders Alliance’s Betsy Plum called Murphy’s stance 'a stubbornness tax' paid by transit riders. Environmental advocates criticized Murphy for blocking improvements to public transportation. The congestion pricing program, set to be the nation’s first, remains tied up in court. No safety analyst has formally assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal includes over $30 million in new funding, 17 new local routes, and increased frequency for 17 lines, but also service reductions on 29 routes. The main highlight is the introduction of 'rush' routes to connect riders to rail faster. MTA Chair Janno Lieber said, 'Every change to a route has an impact on the schedule... and we did it.' Queens Borough President Donovan Richards voiced support, stating, 'I'm ready. We're ready.' The process began in 2019 and was shaped by extensive community input.

Kathy Hochul's office refused to release her daily schedule for April, May, and June—the months when she halted congestion pricing. Streetsblog filed two Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) requests (R001199-062024 and R001389-102924), both denied or delayed without reason. The matter centers on the governor's decision to 'pause congestion pricing,' a move that impacts every New Yorker who walks, bikes, or rides transit. Heather Murray of Cornell Law School called the delay 'unconscionable,' saying, 'Delaying release of these records for six months is tantamount to denial of the request and violates the Freedom of Information Law.' Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance urged Hochul to 'level with New Yorkers.' The governor's secrecy shields her from accountability as city streets remain dangerous for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The path, north of the George Washington Bridge, has collapsed twice in two years.

Hutson sued and won a $1.1 million jury verdict. The piece highlights city code requiring a clear pedestrian passage and criticizes the city’s lax enforcement.

The measure, sponsored by Council Member Erik Bottcher (District 3), passed through committee and aims to address neglected, broken, and obstructive newspaper boxes. The bill summary states it will 'establish clear guidelines and help ensure that our local publications get to maintain their newsracks while also helping to alleviate sidewalk congestion.' Bottcher’s action brings new requirements: owners must display contact information, and the Department of Transportation gains authority to set size, shape, and material standards. Sandra Ung, another council member, noted that without oversight, newsracks become a blight. The law seeks to reduce sidewalk clutter, making streets less hazardous for pedestrians and other vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
