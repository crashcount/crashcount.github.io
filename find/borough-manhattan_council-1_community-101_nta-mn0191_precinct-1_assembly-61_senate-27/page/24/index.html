Robert Jackson and Gounardes defending it: 'Cars speeding in New York kill New Yorkers, injure New Yorkers.' Gounardes called the cameras 'life-saving.' Opponents, including Sen. Andrew Lanza, dismissed the program as a 'cash register.' Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives said, 'When New York City’s speed safety cameras turn off, speeding increases and crashes rise.'

The measure, led by Transportation Committee Chairwoman Mary Cheh, boosts fees to $500 for vehicles over 6,000 pounds, $250 for 5,000–6,000 pounds, and $175 for 3,500–5,000 pounds. The bill summary states, 'the larger a vehicle, the worse it is for the environment, the more damage it causes to our roads, and the more dangerous to others using the roadway.' Cheh, who wrote the proposal, said, 'drivers who pick these larger vehicles will now need to pay a bit more to compensate for that additional damage.' The council expects the new fees to raise $40 million over five years, funding street safety projects and road repairs. Cheh admits the policy is not a cure-all for traffic violence but calls it a step forward to recoup costs from oversized vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, discussed at Brooklyn Community Boards 10 and 11, aims to fix potholes, resurface the path, and repair the seawall. The presentation, however, lacked any guarantee of a safe alternate route for cyclists and pedestrians. Brooklyn Borough Commissioner Martin Maher admitted, 'I can't make any promises.' Council Member Carlina Rivera’s office noted her bill would require protections for cyclists around work zones, highlighting the gap in current planning. Executive Director Terri Carta of the Brooklyn Greenway Initiative said, 'NYC Parks and DOT need to provide a safe alternative for greenway users during construction.' Despite DOT’s willingness to help, no concrete detour exists.

Mayor Eric Adams called it 'a major victory for New Yorkers that will save lives.' Advocacy groups and lawmakers voiced frustration at Albany’s reluctance to adopt stronger safety tools.

The measure, awaiting City Council and state approval, aims to keep cameras running nights and weekends—when 41% of crashes occur. The matter summary states: 'the Legislature is poised to do the right thing and allow the speed cameras...to keep operating around the clock.' Gounardes, a key advocate, joins Mayor Adams and crash victims’ families in support. The endorsement highlights that automated enforcement cuts reckless driving and reduces injuries. The deal falls short by lacking escalating penalties for repeat speeders and lasting only three years. Still, keeping cameras on at all hours is the most important fix, targeting the deadliest times for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, confirmed by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, grants a three-year extension with 24/7 camera operation. The original bill would have suspended registrations for repeat speeders, notified insurers, and raised fines. These provisions were removed after concerns from lawmakers, including co-sponsor Sen. Roxanne Persaud. The matter summary: 'Albany lawmakers reached a deal to renew and expand New York City's speed camera program, keeping them on 24/7, but only after key provisions...were removed.' Mayor Adams called the deal 'a major victory,' but advocates like Eric McClure of StreetsPAC said, 'it’s not enough.' The City Council must submit a home rule message before final passage. The compromise keeps cameras rolling but leaves dangerous drivers unchecked.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
