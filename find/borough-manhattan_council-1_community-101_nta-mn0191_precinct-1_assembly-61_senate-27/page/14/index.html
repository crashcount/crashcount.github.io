She called for new legislation to require the Department of Transportation to track progress on the Streets Master Plan, which mandates yearly construction of bike and bus lanes. Adams criticized the mayor for failing to meet these benchmarks and for cutting funding to vital services. She said, 'Our duty is to turn these ideas into effective laws and to conduct oversight... But laws and policies are only as good as their implementation.' Adams also proposed using city land for affordable housing and expressed conditional support for zoning reforms, insisting on deeper affordability. Her speech centered the needs of low-income and working-class New Yorkers, especially in Black and brown communities.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Robert Holden is named for pushing e-bike licensing, a move described as 'extremely harmful' for vulnerable road users. The article criticizes engineers and community boards who resist bike lanes and street redesigns. It urges advocates to call out denialist rhetoric and challenge the roots of car-first policies.

The measure, discussed in an advocacy article, has not advanced to committee or vote. The article states: 'Council Member Robert Holden has proposed legislation to require licensing and registration for all e-bikes. This legislation will be extremely harmful if it becomes law—likely cutting e-bike use, increasing motorcycle and car emissions and traffic, and forfeiting economic benefits associated with micro-mobility.' Holden’s push aligns with car-centric policy, drawing sharp criticism from safety advocates. They argue the bill would endanger vulnerable road users by forcing more people into cars and away from safer, sustainable options.

The matter, titled 'Spinning wheels: Adams admin misses legal benchmarks for new bus, bike lanes for second year in a row, DOT data shows,' revealed DOT built only 31.9 miles of protected bike lanes and 5.2 miles of protected bus lanes in 2023—far short of the 50 and 30 miles required by the Streets Master Plan. Brooks-Powers stated, 'The Streets Plan is the law, and the Department of Transportation is still failing to fulfill its legal obligations.' She promised to hold DOT accountable at an upcoming budget hearing. The city also lagged on bus stop upgrades, completing just 54 out of 500 required. Cyclist fatalities soared to 30 in 2023, the highest this century.
