Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>This report, released February 7, 2025, by the Independent Budget Office, exposes the city’s failure to meet the Streets Master Plan law (passed in 2019) mandating 150 miles of new bus lanes. The IBO states: 'It will be virtually impossible for the city to meet the City Council's required 150 miles of new bus lanes at the pace Mayor Adams is going.' Mayor Adams, who took office in 2022, has slowed or killed key bus projects, including the Fordham Road busway. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno claims the agency is building protected lanes and using cameras for enforcement, but admits resources are tight. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams has called for compliance but not funded it. Riders Alliance spokesman Danny Pearlstein blames hiring freezes and political interference for 'broken promises and neglected legislation.' The report shows that while DOT’s budget grew, staffing for bus lane expansion fell. Bus speeds remain stuck at 8.1 mph. The city’s inaction leaves millions of bus riders—often the city’s most vulnerable—stranded and exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Charles Fall (District 61), was introduced on February 4, 2025. It is titled: 'Relates to photo speed violation monitoring systems in school speed zones in the city of New York.' The measure 'reduces the radial distance from school buildings for such school speed zones.' This means fewer streets near schools will be covered by speed cameras. Fall’s sponsorship signals support for shrinking the protected area. No votes have been recorded yet. The bill’s change strips away a layer of safety for children and other vulnerable road users who walk near schools. No safety analyst has weighed in, but the intent is clear: less camera coverage, more danger at the curb.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No victory for people on foot or bike.</p><p class=mb3>This opinion piece, published January 27, 2025, criticizes the City Council's compromise on the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity (COYHO) zoning amendments. The Council, after pressure from housing opponents, reinstated parking requirements in many transit-served neighborhoods, despite the City Planning Commission's push to eliminate them citywide. The matter, as described, states: 'Anyone not supporting the elimination of parking mandates is only perpetuating our city's housing crisis.' Planning expert Eric Kober, the author, argues the Council's move blocks housing growth and contradicts city policies to reduce car use. Council members' actions—passing a diluted version of COYHO—leave vulnerable road users exposed. The compromise preserves car dominance, keeps streets dangerous, and stalls progress for safer, people-first neighborhoods.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The case is not a council bill, but a flashpoint in the debate over child independence and pedestrian safety. Prosecutor Emma Harper said the arrest was due to the boy walking on 'a busy highway with no sidewalk.' The matter highlights how parents, not road designers or drivers, face consequences when children navigate unsafe streets. Advocates, including Lenore Skenazy and attorney David DeLugas, condemned the criminalization of parents and called for accountability in road design. Streets like Mineral Bluff Highway, with high speeds and no sidewalks, endanger all pedestrians. The story underscores a systemic failure: dangerous roads persist, while parents and children bear the risk and blame.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The program, covering 750 school zones, needs state approval before June. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez calls speed cameras 'one of the most effective tools' to stop deadly driving. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, who sponsored the last reauthorization, says, 'my bill to expand the speed camera program has saved lives.' The city wants stronger penalties for repeat offenders and action on license plate fraud, which lets millions of violations go unpunished. The report shows cameras cut speeding by 94 percent and reduce injuries and deaths. The program faces political hurdles, but the evidence is clear: speed cameras protect people on foot and bike. Lawmakers must decide whether to keep this life-saving tool.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lawmakers push for real consequences when cars strike dogs, cats, and other companions.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0723-2025 sits in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced January 23, 2025, it urges the state to pass A10660/S9915, the Protecting Animals Walking on the Street (PAWS) Act. The resolution states: 'add the term companion animals to the list of possible victim classes should a driver fail to exercise due care to avoid striking pedestrians and to increase the fine for striking a pet with a vehicle and leaving the scene without reporting the incident.' Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary sponsor), Lynn C. Schulman, Carlina Rivera, and Justin L. Brannan back the measure. The PAWS Act would raise fines for drivers who hit pets and leave, and would recognize companion animals as protected victims under traffic law. The move targets a gap in current law, where penalties for striking animals are minor—on par with an illegal U-turn. The Council’s action signals a push for stronger accountability when vehicles harm the city’s most vulnerable, including its animals.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill responds to Citi Bike fare hikes that took effect January 13, 2025, raising per-minute and pass prices for both members and non-members. The matter summary: 'New Yorkers can't afford for Citi Bike to hike prices every few months. We need to tie the cost of a CitiBike ride to the cost of a subway fare to make it more accessible and affordable to choose cycling,' said Nieve Mooney, Restler's spokesperson. Restler’s action highlights the burden on low-income riders and the need for regulation. The bill’s status is pending in committee. Mayor Adams voiced support for subsidies but offered no plan.
