The matter arose after attorney Adam White was arrested for removing plastic from an obscured license plate; charges were later dropped by Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez, citing 'insufficient evidence.' The bill, discussed at a press conference, aims to crack down on license plate defacement and illegal parking, which Restler says is rampant among city workers and police. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes introduced a similar bill at the state level. Both lawmakers stress the need for public accountability and tougher enforcement to protect vulnerable road users from drivers who evade responsibility.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Alfresco NYC Coalition and advocates like Maulin Mehta support shifting oversight to the Department of Transportation (DOT) for a broader, safer approach to curb use.

Manhattan Community Board 4’s Transportation Committee unanimously supported the proposal but urged DOT to add more physical barriers. The plan includes pedestrian islands and repurposes car lanes in some sections, but for 19 blocks, car lanes remain untouched. Council Member Erik Bottcher and local activists pushed for the redesign, citing high crash and fatality rates: 173 crashes this year, 40 injuries, and three pedestrian deaths since 2016. Committee members, including Christine Berthet and Brett Firfer, criticized painted islands as unsafe, calling for concrete or vertical barriers. DOT’s Patrick Kennedy cited resource limits.

The story features direct quotes from Arnout and Nicole Zoeller Boelens, who describe the ease and joy of cycling as a family. No council bill, vote, or committee action is involved.

Riders need safe, frequent service.</p><p class=mb3>On November 17, 2022, state legislators and transit advocates pressed for increased MTA funding and six-minute off-peak service. The push comes ahead of the next budget cycle. Assembly Members Zohran Mamdani and Amanda Septimo, State Senator Andrew Gounardes, and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher led the call. Mamdani said, 'If we implement six-minute service, the consequences would be felt for riders across all aspects of their life.' Septimo called transit an economic and racial justice issue. Gounardes urged the governor to include MTA funding in the initial budget. Gallagher criticized the gas tax holiday, urging funds go to transit. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber warned that cuts or fare hikes would devastate working- and middle-class New Yorkers. The group demanded action to protect and improve transit for all riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article, titled 'Walkable City 10 Years Later: Cars Make Us Sicker Than We Thought,' draws on studies showing road emissions cause 53,000 early deaths annually in the U.S., with 1,400 in New York City alone. Healthcare costs from vehicle emissions top $21 billion per year in the city. The piece highlights that electric vehicles do not eliminate most toxic emissions, which come from tires and non-tailpipe sources. Traffic noise increases risk of heart attacks, strokes, and dementia. The article quotes, 'People who walk 8.6 minutes a day are 33 percent more likely to report better mental health.' It argues that walking and biking foster stronger communities and civic engagement, while car traffic breeds isolation and danger.

Lucia Deng, a Transportation Alternatives activist, called the move 'huge,' noting the Bronx and Upper Manhattan have long been neglected. DOT planner Patrick Kennedy said, 'We try to maintain the protected connections as much as possible. They really only work if they’re continuous.'
