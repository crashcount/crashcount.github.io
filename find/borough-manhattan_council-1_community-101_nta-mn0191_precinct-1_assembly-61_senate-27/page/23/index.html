Emissions kill 1,400 city residents each year—more than crashes. Noise from traffic warps bodies and minds. Walking brings health, sanity, and community. Electric cars do not solve the core danger. Streets remain deadly. Walking saves lives.</p><p class=mb3>This policy advocacy, published November 15, 2022, revisits the impact of car dependency a decade after 'Walkable City.' The article, titled 'Walkable City 10 Years Later: Cars Make Us Sicker Than We Thought,' draws on studies showing road emissions cause 53,000 early deaths annually in the U.S., with 1,400 in New York City alone. Healthcare costs from vehicle emissions top $21 billion per year in the city. The piece highlights that electric vehicles do not eliminate most toxic emissions, which come from tires and non-tailpipe sources. Traffic noise increases risk of heart attacks, strokes, and dementia. The article quotes, 'People who walk 8.6 minutes a day are 33 percent more likely to report better mental health.' It argues that walking and biking foster stronger communities and civic engagement, while car traffic breeds isolation and danger. No council member is named; this is a broad policy critique, not a legislative action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city dragged its feet for decades. Disabled residents faced danger, isolation, and injury. Officials acted only after being sued. Sidewalks beyond ramps remain neglected. Justice came slow, hard-fought.</p><p class=mb3>On November 7, 2022, Philadelphia settled a class-action lawsuit filed in 2019, agreeing to install or repair 10,000 curb ramps over 15 years—at least 2,000 every three years. The city must keep these ramps in working order, but sidewalks beyond the ramps are excluded. The matter, titled 'Why Do People With Disabilities Have to Sue To Get Accessible Sidewalks?', highlights the city's long resistance to basic ADA compliance. Plaintiffs like Fran Fulton said, 'They're responding to our needs now because we sued them.' Disability Rights Advocates attorney Meredith Weaver called the process 'hard-fought,' noting that leaders' inaction led to injuries and isolation. Weaver stressed that proactive, well-funded sidewalk networks—not lawsuits—would better protect people with mobility challenges. This settlement forces overdue action, but leaves many sidewalks unsafe.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists and bus riders get space. Pedestrians breathe easier. Community board backs the plan. Car drivers lose parking. The city moves to fix a deadly gap.</p><p class=mb3>On November 9, 2022, the Department of Transportation proposed repurposing two car lanes on the Washington Bridge for a two-way protected bike lane and a dedicated bus lane. The plan was presented to Manhattan Community Board 12's Traffic and Transportation committee, which gave unanimous advisory support. The DOT aims to install the changes by summer or early fall 2023. The proposal states: 'The city wants to repurpose a pair of car lanes on the Washington Bridge uptown for a two-way bike lane and a bus lane next year, giving a dedicated space to cyclists who are currently forced to share extremely narrow paths with pedestrians.' Lucia Deng, a Transportation Alternatives activist, called the move 'huge,' noting the Bronx and Upper Manhattan have long been neglected. DOT planner Patrick Kennedy said, 'We try to maintain the protected connections as much as possible. They really only work if they’re continuous.' The plan removes 20 parking spaces but connects vital bike and bus routes, giving thousands of non-drivers safer passage.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The study, led by University of Washington researchers, argues that 'rolling back the clocks in November may give millions of Americans an extra hour of sleep, but it also costs human and animal lives on U.S. roads that could be saved by making daylight savings time permanent.' The report found that keeping daylight savings time year-round could prevent 33 human deaths and 36,550 deer deaths annually by reducing crashes during dark hours, especially at peak commute times. A 2004 Rutgers study cited in the report found permanent daylight savings time would cut pedestrian deaths by about 13 percent during dusk and dawn. The researchers stress that systemic changes—like mandatory streetlights, traffic-calming infrastructure, and wildlife crossings—are also needed to protect vulnerable road users and wildlife.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The analysis draws a direct line between the rise of SUVs and pickups and the surge in pedestrian deaths. It notes that the largest vehicles are the deadliest, especially for those on foot or bike. The piece argues that taxing these vehicles would not only discourage their use but also shift the burden of their societal costs back onto their owners. The model follows Washington, D.C.'s recent move to scale registration fees by vehicle size and dedicate funds to safety programs.

Council Member Christina Henderson acknowledged the controversy, highlighting that 'the vast majority of [traffic violence] incidents are occurring in communities of color.' Advocates and council members argue the ban will reduce deadly 'right-hook' crashes, especially as large vehicles create blind zones. The bill awaits a final vote and Congressional approval, aiming to protect vulnerable road users and address longstanding inequities in traffic violence.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The program grows, block by block.</p><p class=mb3>On September 27, 2022, the Department of Sanitation announced the expansion of its 'Clean Curbs' pilot program to Staten Island, with a new installation at 704 Bay St. The initiative, previously launched in Times Square and Brooklyn, containerizes commercial trash to clear sidewalks of leaky bags. The Staten Island Chamber of Commerce received a $3,500 grant for the project, which uses bins from CITIBIN, a Brooklyn-based woman-owned business. DSNY spokesman Vincent Gragnani said, 'Use of bins in these two different locations...will improve quality of life in these locations, while helping us learn more about containerized trash in a variety of New York City settings.' The program also repurposes curbside space for public use—like loading zones and parklets—instead of private car storage, freeing up sidewalks for pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lives at risk.</p><p class=mb3>On September 26, 2022, advocacy groups Transportation Alternatives and Riders Alliance released a report slamming the Adams administration for failing to meet the NYC Streets Master Plan’s legal mandates. The report states, 'the city is at only 23% of its bike lane goal and 10% of its bus lane goal for the year.' Elizabeth Adams called for protected bike lanes, saying, 'For the future of our climate and the safety on our streets, protected bike lanes need to be a priority.' Danny Pearlstein demanded faster action on bus lanes. Michael Kaess highlighted the Bronx’s lack of progress. The Department of Transportation disputed the numbers, but advocates pointed to missed deadlines and lack of transparency. Staffing shortages and political interference are blamed. Vulnerable road users—cyclists, bus riders, pedestrians—remain exposed as the city drags its feet.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

But the rise of pickups and SUVs drowns out progress. Heavier, dirtier vehicles clog streets and pump out carbon. Loopholes let automakers dodge real cuts. The climate and city air pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>This policy analysis, published September 26, 2022, by Streetsblog NYC, examines how surging sales of pickups and SUVs undermine carbon reductions from electric vehicles. The report states, 'sales of gas-guzzling pickups and SUVs are also surging. This other face of the market subverts electric cars’ carbon-cutting progress.' No council bill number or committee is attached, as this is a policy report, not legislation. The analysis highlights that regulatory loopholes and weaker standards for larger vehicles allow automakers to offset EV gains by selling more polluting trucks and SUVs. The author urges tightening greenhouse gas standards, especially for large gasoline-powered vehicles, and closing loopholes that let automakers evade meaningful carbon cuts. The report warns that unless regulators act, excessive emissions from pickups and SUVs will harm the climate and city air for years, stalling the benefits of electric vehicles for all road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Steve Strauss and the Empire State Passengers Association press for more trains, added cars, and restored bike and baggage capacity. The piece blames state and Amtrak inaction for packed trains and stranded riders. It highlights that New York funds all Amtrak service north of the city, making state officials as responsible as Amtrak.
