No headlines. No sirens. Just families changed forever. In the last year alone, 150 people were hurt in 234 crashes. Children, elders, workers—no one spared. Not one serious injury, but pain that lingers in the body and the mind.</p><h3 id=the-faces-in-the-data>The Faces in the Data</h3><p>A 78-year-old man tried to cross Jericho Turnpike. He never made it home. Five months later, police charged the driver with failure to yield and failure to exercise due care. The charge is a misdemeanor. The man is still dead. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/21/driver-arrested-5-months-after-fatally-striking-78-year-old-man-in-queens/>&ldquo;On Tuesday, cops charged him with failure to yield to a pedestrian and failure to exercise due care, both misdemeanors.&rdquo;</a> The driver got a desk ticket. The family got a funeral.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>No new laws. No bold redesigns.</strong> The city talks about Vision Zero. The state passed Sammy’s Law, giving New York City the power to lower speed limits. But in Bellerose, the speed stays the same. The cameras blink, but only where the law allows. The council and community board have not forced the issue. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every crash is preventable. Every injury is a policy choice. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand cameras that never go dark. Demand streets where a child can cross and live. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p><p><strong>If you wait, the next name could be someone you love.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The crash happened at Northern Boulevard and East 107th Street as Diaz drove to work. Prosecutors cited Peña’s firing from the FDNY and prior legal issues to argue for remand, but the appellate court released him with minimal bail conditions.

Rahimi, the driver, said, "We were driving right off here. Something fell off the train, damaging the windshield." Passenger Malnick described, "A bolt hit and then right away just the sound of glass exploding and glass all over me." The incident echoes previous cases: in 2019, falling debris from elevated tracks struck vehicles three times in a month. The MTA responded then by intensifying inspections, but the problem persists. The agency now says it is investigating and will inspect the area. The repeated incidents highlight ongoing risks from aging infrastructure above city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Surveillance and body camera footage show Peña admitting to running the light. Five hours after the crash, tests confirmed intoxication by alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine.
