Barriers remain for many.</p><p class=mb3>On May 1, 2024, the MTA and city officials launched a 90-day OMNY pilot for 50 Fair Fares participants. The pilot, announced by MTA Chief Customer Officer Shanifah Rieara, aims to expand OMNY access for low-income riders. Fair Fares gives half-priced rides to New Yorkers earning up to 120 percent of the federal poverty line. The bill’s matter: 'New Yorkers who participate in the city's half-priced transit program Fair Fares will finally be able to use OMNY.' Mayor Adams and the City Council raised eligibility last year, but advocates want broader access. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber called OMNY key for proof-of-payment checks. David Jones, Community Service Society CEO and MTA Board member, supports OMNY for Fair Fares and urges non-police fare enforcement. The pilot follows delays tied to vending machine deployment. About 800,000 New Yorkers qualify for Fair Fares, but only 331,000 are enrolled. The city and MTA plan to expand OMNY to all Fair Fares users by year’s end.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as a 'federally funded delivery worker charging station and rest stop,' required LPC review due to its location in a historic district. The project is backed by federal funds secured by Sen. Chuck Schumer. Commissioner Jeanne Lutfy said, 'People need to make a living, they need to make a safe living, and they need to be able to recharge batteries, they need to be able to rest.' Vice Chair Frederick Bland voiced support for the hub's function and design. Commissioner Mark Ginsberg suggested minor design changes. Manhattan Community Board 1 opposed the plan, citing sidewalk encroachment and lack of restrooms. The Parks Department will contract the Workers Justice Project to staff the hub. The project faced delays but is now set to open in late fall.

The Department of Transportation (DOT) is required to build 50 miles of protected lanes per year but has missed targets. The author writes, 'quality matters over quantity,' arguing that well-integrated lanes save more lives than disconnected stretches.

Systemic failure persists.</p><p class=mb3>On April 2, 2024, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration released final 2022 and preliminary 2023 traffic fatality numbers. The agency’s summary highlights a modest dip in overall deaths, but the details are stark: 'drivers had killed more cyclists (1,105) than they had in any single year in the entire history of the reporting system—and pedestrian deaths (7,522) were the highest since 1981.' Vulnerable road users now account for 36 percent of all fatalities, up from 20 percent in 1996. Hit-and-run deaths and serious injuries for pedestrians and cyclists both rose 11 percent. Tami Friedrich of the Truck Safety Coalition demanded urgent federal action, stating, 'No one else needs to die because of bureaucratic inaction.' Advocates and Vision Zero supporters call for systemic reforms—speed limiters, automatic braking, safer trucks, and better infrastructure.

The article asks, 'What if we treated our national epidemic of car crashes with that same degree of urgency—not to mention that same holistic approach to saving lives?' No council bill number or committee applies; this is a media analysis, not legislation. The piece criticizes how officials and media leap into action for rare infrastructure disasters, but ignore the daily, deadly toll of car violence. It notes that highway expansion is prioritized over repair, and that systemic failures—not individual mistakes—drive the crisis. The commentary urges a shift to a Safe System Approach, demanding the same scrutiny and coordinated action for traffic violence as for headline-grabbing catastrophes. Vulnerable road users remain at risk while the system looks away.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Sponsored by Timothy M. Kennedy with support from Jake Ashby, Jamaal Bailey, and others, the bill mandates street designs that protect everyone—not just drivers. The measure saw strong support but faced opposition from some senators. By requiring complete street principles, S 2714 aims to reduce danger for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users. The bill marks a shift away from car-first planning, forcing cities to build streets for people, not just traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city pledged 75 miles of new or improved bike routes by 2022. As of now, none have been built. Council Member Rita Joseph, representing Flatbush and Midwood, introduced legislation to speed up construction, stating, “My community has been asking for it. The Commissioner has made a commitment. He needs to step up and do it now.” Council Member Chi Ossé condemned the administration’s inaction, calling it “yet another glaring example” of broken promises. Advocates and residents cite safety and equity concerns, noting these districts suffer more cyclist injuries and deaths but get fewer protected lanes.

Advocates demand speed, transparency, and real safety for streets choked by trucks.</p><p class=mb3>Council Bill for commercial waste zone reform, passed in 2019, remains stalled. The Department of Sanitation (DSNY) will launch only one zone in central Queens after September 3, 2024. The oversight task force has not met in two years. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, who authored the law as a Council member, called DSNY’s rollout a 'missed opportunity' for clarity and accountability. Justin Wood of New York Lawyers for the Public Interest warned, 'The system cannot achieve transformational change if it is treated as a limited pilot program.' The city’s goal to cut truck miles falls short of original promises. Action Carting, whose driver killed a cyclist in 2017, secured contracts for 14 zones. Advocates say the lack of outreach, oversight, and clear safety benchmarks leaves vulnerable road users at risk.

The measure remains in committee. The bill responds to a fatal flaw: 'We have no mechanism right now, under law, to crack down on extremely reckless drivers,' said Brooklyn State Sen. Andrew Gounardes. The current law lets drivers rack up dozens of camera tickets and keep driving, since no points are added to licenses. Gianaris’s bill aims to close this loophole. DOT and crash victims’ families, including Juliane Williams, whose daughter was killed by a speeding driver, press for stronger penalties and expansion of the red light camera program. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program expired with little effect.

Adams also proposed using city land for affordable housing and expressed conditional support for zoning reforms, insisting on deeper affordability.
