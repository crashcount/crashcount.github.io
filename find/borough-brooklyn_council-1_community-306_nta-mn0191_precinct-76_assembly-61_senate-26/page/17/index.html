The work, running from Beach Channel Drive to Shore Front Parkway, added porous pavement, new bike lanes, and wider pedestrian walkways. The city says the 11,000 square feet of new surface can absorb nearly 1.3 million gallons of stormwater each year. Ariola said, 'At long last, we will finally have a safe, steady, and efficient flow of traffic here, and the area is now more resilient than ever before.' The project, part of a $16.6 million investment begun in March 2021, also repaired or replaced 1,100 feet of storm sewer and added new left turn lanes. The changes give cyclists and pedestrians an easier, safer route to the Rockaway ferry terminal and boardwalk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article argues, ‘SUVs, pick-up trucks, and passenger cars should not be the benchmark by which we judge the size of other forms of transit, and the term 'micromobility' encourages us to believe that they are.’ Author Sarah Risser calls for dropping the ‘micro’ prefix, urging us to see bikes and scooters as standard, not lesser. She highlights how oversized vehicles—cars, SUVs, trucks—fuel rising deaths among pedestrians and cyclists. Risser urges language that centers human-scaled mobility and rejects car supremacy.

The matter summary states: 'Because people are dying and being maimed on New York's most-dangerous 25-mile-per-hour streets.' Supporters, including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, cite the science: lower speeds mean less force, fewer deaths. Research shows 20 mph zones cut crashes by 60 percent.

The plan, discussed in the Transportation and Public Safety Committees, adds buffer-protected bike lanes and some jersey barriers, but skips driveways and omits pedestrian islands, raised intersections, and bicycle signals. Maxime Le Munier, whose wife Sarah Schick was killed by a truck driver on Ninth Street, said, “What we want is to guarantee everyone’s safety, and it seems like it’s going to fall short.” Community Board 6 Transportation Chair Doug Gordon and Public Safety Chair Jerry Armer echoed calls for stronger, faster action. Council Member Hanif hosted a recent event on the issue. The committees unanimously approved the DOT proposal with conditions: more pedestrian safety, more traffic calming, and a comprehensive plan for all of Ninth Street. DOT has not set a timeline.

The $2.6-million, seven-block overhaul—managed by the Parks Department—targets the cracked 1894 path between avenues R and X. Construction, delayed by the pandemic and contract issues, will continue through March 2024. The Parks Department closed the northernmost block but failed to provide a safe, legal detour for cyclists, leaving them to navigate dangerous service roads and unclear signage. Treyger celebrated the start on social media, thanking advocates. Jon Orcutt of Bike New York criticized Parks for slow, unsafe detour practices, saying, 'They should be working on it based on function.' Lawmakers have introduced legislation to speed up Parks capital projects.
