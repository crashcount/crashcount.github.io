The event, titled 'The Streetsie Awards: Vote for Your Favorite Streetfilm of the Year!', showcases Clarence Eckerson Jr.’s work documenting the fight for safer streets. The films cover cargo bikes, school streets, women’s rides, and international comparisons. They highlight how protected bike lanes and open streets reduce danger for children and families. Jersey City and Hoboken, featured in one film, have reached zero road deaths by redesigning streets for people, not cars. Council action is not involved, but the advocacy is clear: safer infrastructure saves lives. The films make the case—New York can do better for its most vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Riders and advocates condemned the shortfall. Staff shortages fueled the lapse. City Council demanded action. Vulnerable road users remain exposed. The city’s promise to protect them remains unkept.</p><p class=mb3>On December 27, 2022, the Department of Transportation confirmed it would not meet the legal mandate to build 30 miles of protected bike lanes and 20 miles of dedicated bus lanes, as required by the Streets Plan. The agency completed only 25 miles of bike lanes and 11.95 miles of bus lanes. The matter, titled 'DOT Will Not Reach Required Bike and Bus Lane Requirements This Year,' drew sharp criticism from Riders Alliance and Transportation Alternatives. Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance said, 'The Adams administration is many miles wide of the mark when it comes to complying with the Streets Plan and keeping the mayor's promise to millions of riders.' Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives added, 'The city needs to meet these goals without delay or excuse and stop leaving New Yorkers who walk, bike, and bus behind.' A City Council spokesperson blamed staff shortages and unfilled vacancies, calling the situation 'unacceptable.' The Council urged the administration to fill key roles and meet legal requirements. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, bus riders—bear the brunt of these failures.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

SUVs kill more walkers, especially children. Vehicle-into-building crashes devastate. Autonomous cars fail to solve the crisis. Marginalized communities bear the brunt. The car culture’s toll grows. The numbers are grim. The danger is real.</p><p class=mb3>The Streetsie Awards 2022, published December 27, 2022 by Streetsblog NYC, highlights the year’s worst setbacks for vulnerable road users. The commentary notes, 'the stats on 2021's pedestrian death crisis came out not too long ago, and they were awful. As in, the-worst-they-been-in-40-years awful.' No council bill or vote is attached, but the piece draws on federal data and expert analysis. It singles out SUVs as a main threat: drivers are four times more likely to strike pedestrians while turning, and children hit by SUVs are eight times more likely to die than if struck by smaller cars. The article also exposes the frequency and devastation of vehicle-into-building crashes and the false promise of autonomous vehicles. It underscores how car culture’s burdens fall hardest on marginalized communities. The message is clear: systemic danger persists, and the most vulnerable pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill awaits final passage to avoid a government shutdown. The measure aims to 'address gaps in bike lane, sidewalk, and multi-use trail networks.' Brandi Horton of Rails-to-Trails Conservancy called it 'a major victory' but stressed the need for more funding. Congress authorized up to $200 million per year, but only $45 million was delivered for 2023—less than 10 percent of what advocates requested. Projects must cost over $15 million to qualify, leaving most communities behind. A survey found $7 billion in unmet needs for active transportation. Lawmakers included $1.6 billion in transportation earmarks, but most funds still go to highways.

The MTA Board approved a 2023 budget allowing fare hikes and service changes, pending Albany’s action. Chairman Janno Lieber said, "All good things can happen if people are willing to pay for them, or help figure out recurring funding sources, which is what MTA needs to achieve fiscal stability." New York City Transit President Richard Davey explained that peak hour service would be trimmed, with modest increases in wait times, while some weekend service would expand. Transit advocates and union leaders, including Richard Davis, condemned the cuts, warning of increased rider frustration and assaults on workers. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani urged passage of bills to freeze fares and fill the MTA’s fiscal gap, stating, "We have to fix the rot at the heart of the transit system."

The state calls transit taxes its own contribution, shortchanging riders. Lawmakers and watchdogs demand an end to the shell game. The governor stalls. Riders pay the price in service and safety.</p><p class=mb3>This state budgetary action, revealed December 20, 2022, exposes New York’s long-running diversion of dedicated transit funds from the MTA. Under the 1975 18-b law, the state must match local funding for public transit. Instead, since 1995, Albany has counted regional transit taxes as its own share, leaving a $4.9 billion shortfall. State Comptroller Tom DiNapoli criticizes the practice: 'the state has used a portion of these resources... rather than using General Fund revenues as originally intended.' Assembly Member Amy Paulin, chair of the Corporations Committee, insists, 'we don’t have to justify funding the MTA adequately. It is very justified.' Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany calls for an end to 'raiding dedicated funds.' The governor’s office has not pledged to stop. The result: less money for transit, more danger for those who rely on it.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The study, titled "Four Ways To Build A Better Automated Enforcement Program," surveyed 1,500 U.S. adults about traffic cameras. Researchers, including Kelcie Ralph, urge cities to use data-driven camera placement, scale fines to income, and spend revenue on self-enforcing infrastructure like road narrowing. They warn against using cameras as cash cows or funding police and private contractors. The report states: "The purpose of [automated enforcement] is to improve safety, not catch unsuspecting drivers." Ralph adds, "They need to be in places with known safety risks, and it should be a data driven process." The analysis calls for shifting control to transportation departments and removing jail time for unpaid fines.

Subway riders backed Governor Hochul by an 81 to 19 percent margin in districts with the busiest stations. The article states, 'the governor needs to invest in mass transit and provide the MTA the billions it needs in new dedicated revenues to save it from the fiscal cliff.' Advocates like Rachael Fauss, John McCarthy, Liam Blank, Kate Slevin, and Lisa Daglian urge Hochul and the legislature to boost funding and treat transit as essential. They warn of a 'death spiral' if service cuts and fare hikes hit. Hochul’s support for projects like the Interborough Express and congestion pricing is noted. The message is clear: New Yorkers demand safe, reliable transit, and the governor must deliver.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Manhattan Community Board 4’s Transportation Committee unanimously supported the proposal but urged DOT to add more physical barriers. The plan includes pedestrian islands and repurposes car lanes in some sections, but for 19 blocks, car lanes remain untouched. Council Member Erik Bottcher and local activists pushed for the redesign, citing high crash and fatality rates: 173 crashes this year, 40 injuries, and three pedestrian deaths since 2016. Committee members, including Christine Berthet and Brett Firfer, criticized painted islands as unsafe, calling for concrete or vertical barriers. DOT’s Patrick Kennedy cited resource limits. The agency aims to start work in spring and finish by fall.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Bikes bring freedom.</p><p class=mb3>On November 18, 2022, Streetsblog NYC published a public advocacy piece titled "Cargo Bikes: The Happiest Transportation Mode on Earth." The article highlights the Boelens family, who have lived car-free for 11 years, using cargo bikes for daily errands and childcare. The piece states: "We find it's just as easy to get around within a five-mile radius by bike than it is by car. We get exercise, fresh air, and save so much money." The story features direct quotes from Arnout and Nicole Zoeller Boelens, who describe the ease and joy of cycling as a family. No council bill, vote, or committee action is involved. The article challenges the myth that families need cars, showing how street design—not personal choice—shapes safety and mobility for vulnerable road users. No formal safety analyst assessment is included.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Robin Middleman Filepp of Families for Safe Streets called it 'a public health crisis that demands action.' The grove honors over 2,100 killed and nearly half a million injured since Vision Zero began in 2014. The Parks Department set aside the space, with saplings planted by volunteers and city workers.

The push comes ahead of the next budget cycle. Assembly Members Zohran Mamdani and Amanda Septimo, State Senator Andrew Gounardes, and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher led the call. Mamdani said, 'If we implement six-minute service, the consequences would be felt for riders across all aspects of their life.' Septimo called transit an economic and racial justice issue. Gounardes urged the governor to include MTA funding in the initial budget. Gallagher criticized the gas tax holiday, urging funds go to transit. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber warned that cuts or fare hikes would devastate working- and middle-class New Yorkers. The group demanded action to protect and improve transit for all riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
