The bill, still under negotiation before the April 1 deadline, does not include the $300 million sought to boost off-peak bus and subway service to every six minutes. The matter summary reads: 'Legislators in Albany have proposed a budget to fill the MTA's fiscal hole, avert a fare hike, and fund a small pilot of free buses across New York City.' Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and State Senator Andrew Gounardes pledged to keep fighting for better frequency. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber praised stable funding. Advocates like Betsy Plum criticized the omission: 'The legislature's budget ignores millions of riders stranded 12, 15, 20 minutes or more on subway platforms and at bus stops.'

The plan, discussed in committee, fills the funding gap and stops a fare hike. It launches a free bus pilot in low-income and commercial districts. The bill, backed by Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal, does not include the $300 million needed to run buses and subways every six minutes off-peak. The matter summary states: 'Legislators in Albany have proposed a budget to fill the MTA's fiscal hole, avert a fare hike, and fund a small pilot of free buses.' Hoylman-Sigal supported ending Madison Square Garden’s tax break to help fund transit. Advocates and lawmakers like Zohran Mamdani blasted the omission, warning that infrequent service leaves riders stranded and exposed.

Ramos criticized City Hall for failing to post speed limits and design streets for e-mobility. Krueger backed battery safety bills, while Councilman Bob Holden pushed for outright bans, citing deaths and injuries.

Gounardes said, 'These students, their families and our entire community here in southern Brooklyn will be forever grateful.' Brannan called the response 'a shining example' of local policing. The commendation took place at Bay Ridge Preparatory School. The incident sparked calls for 'enhanced measures against traffic violence' and more mental health resources at a vigil for the victims.

Painted bike lanes became useless as drivers shoveled snow into them and plows avoided parked cars. The Department of Sanitation’s new narrow snowplows cleared some routes well, but the Parks Department left cycling paths impassable, showing 'no interest...to encourage cycling.' Only the Brooklyn Bridge bike path stood out, freshly swept and safe.
