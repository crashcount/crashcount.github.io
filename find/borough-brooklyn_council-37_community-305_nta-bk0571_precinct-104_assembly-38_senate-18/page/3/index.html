One cyclist, Robert Hillebrand, suffered a severed windpipe and required blood transfusions. Another, Jennifer Noble, received stitches and a broken finger. Police said the string was likely from kite fighting, a practice where glass-coated strings are used to cut opponents' kites. Witnesses described a yellow nylon string stretched across the bike lane. The NYPD found no criminality. The city parks department bans kite fighting but enforcement is lacking. Danny Mundy, a local civic leader, said, “It’s absolutely dangerous and unacceptable.” Previous injuries and lawsuits linked to kite string in the area highlight ongoing risks for cyclists and wildlife. No driver involvement was reported, but the incident exposes gaps in infrastructure and enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
