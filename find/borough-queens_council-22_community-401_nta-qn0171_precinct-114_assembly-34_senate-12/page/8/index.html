The bill was filed at the end of session with no report issued. The measure aimed to examine street redesign, traffic calming, and camera enforcement to keep trucks out of residential areas, but it stalled before any impact reached the street.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cabán called the crash 'devastating' and pressed city agencies for action. DOT spokesman Vin Barone promised immediate steps at the crash site and talks on protected bike lanes.
