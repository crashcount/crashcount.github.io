Streets stay deadly.</p><p class=mb3>This report covers the sharp rise in high-speed police chases in the NYPD’s 114th Precinct, Astoria, Queens. The article, published October 28, 2024, details community outrage after a cyclist’s death and repeated injuries. NYPD policy says chases should end when risk outweighs reward, but enforcement fails. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program, which once forced repeat offenders into safety courses, has expired. Comptroller Brad Lander says, 'Drivers who are repeatedly caught by speed and red-light cameras currently face no consequences other than a fine in the mail. Repeat reckless drivers must be held to account.' State Senator Michael Gianaris calls for stronger penalties, including suspending registrations. The NYPD has not adopted reforms. Residents and advocates demand legislative action and transparency.

The article states: “If the governor wants to do the MTA and riders a favor, she should use the money she finds to instead boost MTA operations.” Author Samuel Santaella criticizes Hochul’s move, arguing it jeopardizes service for working-class New Yorkers. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and State Senator Michael Gianaris are cited as proponents of fare-free buses, while Riders Alliance pushes for six-minute service. The piece urges Hochul to reject highway expansions and instead invest in frequent, affordable transit. The editorial frames this as a fight for clean air, equity, and safety for all New Yorkers who rely on public transportation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities.

Advocates demand more.</p><p class=mb3>On September 25, 2024, the MTA completed a major upgrade to the Cross Bay Bridge, replacing its hazardous Rockaway-side ramp with a wider, ADA-compliant path. This action fulfills a mandate from the 2021 MTA Bike Access bill. Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, who sponsored the law, said, "I'm excited about the ADA-accessible ramp on the Cross Bay Bridge and that cyclists and pedestrians can access this space... because we passed my legislation." The MTA also announced similar improvements for the Henry Hudson and Triboro Bridges. However, plans for the Verrazzano, Gil Hodges-Marine Parkway, Bronx-Whitestone, and Throgs Neck bridges remain uncertain. Cycling advocates praised the MTA’s progress but criticized its reluctance to consider lane conversions for safer, broader access. The new ramp removes a deadly barrier, but the fight for safe passage on all city bridges continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vast majority go to people of color.' Cabán, a key sponsor, argued police use jaywalking as a pretext for stop-and-frisk, calling the law archaic and motorist-centered.

The matter, covered by the New York Post, states: 'Cabán—who was elected to office on a platform advocating less car use and cracking down on dangerous driving—received four tickets in the past 13 months for speeding her vehicle in school zones.' Ariola, joined by Councilman Robert Holden, accused Cabán of hypocrisy, highlighting the disconnect between Cabán’s advocacy for street safety and her own driving record. Cabán’s policy platform includes converting 25% of city roadways for people, building 1,000 miles of car-free streets, and expanding bus and bike lanes. No formal council bill or committee action is attached to this event, but the public dispute underscores tensions in the city’s push for safer, less car-dominated streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
