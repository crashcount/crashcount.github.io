Police cited driver inattention. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City data shows it</a>.</li><li>A 90-year-old woman was struck near York and East 72nd by a southbound taxi and an SUV.

The database flags failure to yield. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>It’s in the file</a>.</li></ul><p>On the FDR, speed is a knife. In 2025, a northbound sedan was wrecked; the driver was ejected and killed. The record lists unsafe speed. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The entry is blunt</a>. In 2022 by East 74th, alcohol and lane changes led to fire and two dead passengers. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The data speaks</a>.</p><p>Three corners. One fix.</p><p>FDR Drive is the top hotspot here with 247 injuries and three deaths since 2022. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The city’s rollup shows it</a>. Second Avenue and First Avenue each show dozens more injuries and multiple serious cases. York Avenue shows two deaths. Afternoons sting: injuries peak from 2 to 6 p.m., with a spike at 5 p.m. when three people died in this window. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the hourly curve</a>.</p><p>Who’s getting hurt? Pedestrians and cyclists. Since 2022, four pedestrians are dead and 145 injured. Cyclists count 126 injuries. SUVs and cars drive most of the harm. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Mode split and vehicle rollup back it up</a>.</p><p>The pattern hides in plain sight. Turning cars. Failure to yield. Distraction. Night and rush hours. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The city tags the causes</a>.</p><p>A city that waits.</p><p>Officials know 14th Street will be rebuilt to favor people on foot. “The redesign aims to improve the pedestrian experience,” NY1 reported. <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/15/redesign-of-14th-street-to-kick-off-next-year>It begins next year</a>. But uptown, people still die in the crosswalk.</p><p>Albany moved on two levers. Lawmakers extended 24-hour school-zone speed cameras through 2030. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Votes are recorded here</a>. And the Senate advanced a bill to force repeat violators to install speed limiters. Sen. Liz Krueger voted yes in committee. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>See S 4045</a>.</p><p>On the ground, fixes are simple and close. Daylight every corner on First, Second, and York. Harden turns where drivers cut the walk. Give walkers a head start at signals. Target FDR off-ramps with speed control and barriers. Focus enforcement at the worst hours and the worst corridors. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The hotspot and hourly data point the way</a>.</p><p>Officials know what works — do they?</p><p>One bill would curb the tiny group doing outsized harm. “The bill… requires the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices for repeated violation of maximum speed limits,” reads the summary for S 4045. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>It passed key votes</a>. Speed cameras are locked in; keep them working all day and night. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>The Legislature did its part</a>.</p><p>Lower speeds. Fewer funerals.

The bicyclist, a 22-year-old man, was injured and ejected. According to the police report, the contributing factor was “Traffic Control Disregarded.” That signals a driver failing to obey a signal or sign. The bike showed left-side damage, consistent with a hit from the Jeep’s front. The driver is listed as licensed; two vehicle occupants reported unspecified injuries. After the driver’s violation, the report notes the cyclist had no safety equipment.
