Five serious injuries. Four hundred forty-nine hurt.</strong> These are not numbers from a war zone. They are the cost of moving through Jamaica Estates-Holliswood since 2022, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a>. The dead do not speak. The injured carry the story in scars and limps. The pain is quiet, but it does not stop.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians are struck at intersections and in the crosswalk.</strong> An 83-year-old woman killed by a box truck turning right at Union Turnpike and 193rd Street. A 29-year-old man, crossing with the signal, left with deep wounds to his legs. A 74-year-old man, not even in the roadway, cut down by a backing sedan. The street does not care about age or reason. It only takes.</p><h3 id=patterns-in-the-wreckage>Patterns in the Wreckage</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do most of the harm.</strong> No cyclist has died here in three years, but the threat is always present. Trucks, sedans, SUVs—these are the weapons. The victims are often walking, sometimes just standing. The violence is routine. The shock is not.</p><p><strong>Crashes are not rare.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, 224 crashes. One hundred fifty-nine injured. One left with injuries so severe they may never heal. The numbers do not fall. They hold steady, year after year. The disaster is slow, but it does not stop.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p><strong>The city has tools.</strong> Sammy’s Law lets New York lower speed limits to 20 mph. The city can act now, but has not. Speed cameras work, but their future is always in doubt. Local leaders talk of safety, but the street remains the same. Each day of delay is another roll of the dice for the next person crossing.</p><p><strong>The time for waiting is over.</strong></p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p><strong>Demand more.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower the speed limit. Tell them to protect speed cameras. Tell them to build streets that do not kill. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

She flew like 30 feet. It was a lot of force." The article highlights concerns about NYPD's pursuit tactics, quoting the victim's father: "It was probably not the place to be doing a high-speed chase, in the residential neighborhood." Fiseku faces murder and manslaughter charges.

The bill would require 16- and 17-year-olds riding Class 1 or 2 e-bikes, including Citi Bikes, to wear helmets. Committee Chair William Magnarelli (D-Syracuse) defended the bill, stating, "My only concern is the safety of the people riding the bike." The bill summary notes, 'studies have shown [helmet mandates] can dramatically reduce ridership of the city’s bike share system.' Experts warn such laws lead to fewer cyclists and open the door to discriminatory enforcement, especially against youth of color. Seattle dropped its helmet law in 2022 for these reasons.

The system moves on.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News reported on May 2, 2025, that Michael Peña, a former firefighter, was released from jail after being charged in a fatal crash. Police said Peña drove 83 mph in a 25 mph zone and ran a red light, t-boning Justin Diaz near LaGuardia Airport. Peña had a history of 25 school-zone speeding tickets. The article quotes Diaz's brother: "We're sick, angry, disgusted." Peña was charged with vehicular manslaughter, DWI, and refusing a breath test. The release followed an appellate judge's decision, despite community outrage. The case highlights persistent dangers from high-speed driving and repeated violations, raising questions about enforcement and bail decisions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
