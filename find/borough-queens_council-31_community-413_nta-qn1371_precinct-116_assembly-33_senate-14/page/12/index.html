Brewer vows investigation.</p><p class=mb3>On October 5, 2022, Council Member Gale Brewer, chair of the Council's oversight committee, announced plans to investigate the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) street safety claims. Brewer questioned DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez’s assertion that 750 of 1,000 intersections were redesigned, citing public data showing fewer than 400. Brewer said, “I love the idea of using her committee's investigatory power to explore whether the Adams administration has indeed redesigned 750 of the promised 1,000 intersections... or whether it done fewer than that, as the agency's own public data shows.” She confirmed her intent to use committee investigators and hold an oversight hearing. The matter, titled “City Council oversight inquiry into DOT street safety implementation and data transparency,” highlights DOT’s lack of documentation and reliance on signal retiming over physical improvements. Advocates and Brewer demand full transparency and real progress. Road deaths remain high, and the city lags on legal mandates for bus and bike lanes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Borough President Donovan Richards and Assembly Members Jenifer Rajkumar and David Weprin back both the park and the QueensLink transit proposal. Richards said, 'We need to do both when it comes to making sure that we can enhance our public transportation and also ensuring that our communities have access to open space.' Transit advocates warn the park blocks future rail service, cutting off faster commutes and cleaner air for southern Queens. The MTA previously cited high costs for transit reactivation.

Won, whose district covers the bridge’s eastern approaches, led a walkthrough with DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and staff from Council Members Julie Menin and Selvena Brooks-Powers. Won said, “They kept saying they can’t give the south outer roadway to pedestrians because there would be traffic. Well, I don’t care about the congestion!” She forced the commissioner to stand in the cramped lane, showing how unsafe it is for both cyclists and pedestrians. DOT offered only minor adjustments, like repainting lines, which Won dismissed as “missing the point.” The agency promised lawmakers data to justify keeping five car lanes, but Won insisted the delay puts lives at risk and called for immediate action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, not a council bill but a city action, follows years of neglect and repeated crashes. DOT will cut traffic lanes from six to two, add a parking-protected bike lane, and expand pedestrian space. The plan also includes daylighting at intersections and improved markings. According to DOT, 'the project will improve safety for all users, providing connections to existing bike infrastructure and the reduction of a vehicle lane encouraging safer speeds.' Queens Borough President Donovan Richards praised the move, saying, 'Far too many people are killed and injured on our city’s streets, especially people of color, who are disproportionately impacted by traffic violence.' Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives added, 'DOT's move to turn car space into protected bike lanes on Seagirt Boulevard, while shortening crossings and expanding median space, will prevent speeding and make it safer to walk, bike, and take transit.' The redesign targets a stretch with 222 crashes and 87 injuries since 2019, aiming to end the long-standing danger for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
