But they do not lie. <strong>Four people are dead. Six more are seriously injured.</strong> Seven hundred twenty-five have been hurt since 2022. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. One was 95, struck at the intersection of Cropsey and 24th. Another, a 2-year-old girl, was hit crossing with the signal. She survived; the woman with her did not. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p><strong>Cars and trucks did most of the damage.</strong> SUVs and sedans killed two. Trucks killed another. Bikes and mopeds hurt, but did not kill. The street is not safe for the old, the young, or anyone in between.</p><h3 id=the-recent-wounds>The Recent Wounds</h3><p>The pain is fresh. In the last year, <strong>one person died, two were seriously hurt, and 224 were injured</strong>. Children are not spared. Thirty-two under 18 were hurt. The numbers rise, year after year. <strong>Crashes are up 15% over last year. Injuries up 23%.</strong></p><p>A 66-year-old woman was killed crossing with the light on Bath Avenue. A 65-year-old man died at Avenue P. A 20-year-old on an e-bike was killed on 86th Street. The pattern is plain. The street is a gauntlet.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>Assembly Member William Colton voted to extend school speed zones.</strong> This helps. <strong>State Senator Steve Chan voted yes to curb repeat speeders,</strong> but also voted no on safer school speed zones. The record is mixed. The danger remains.</p><p>The city passed bills to clear abandoned vehicles and mark pavement. These are steps, not leaps. <strong>No law has yet forced the street to yield to the most vulnerable.</strong></p><h3 id=the-voices-left-behind>The Voices Left Behind</h3><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating. It&rsquo;s affecting everyone in our family, especially (Ruiz&rsquo;s) mom. Maddy was her only daughter,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>said Ruiz&rsquo;s sister-in-law</a>.

The question hangs in the air. The street is silent.</p><h3 id=what-must-be-done>What Must Be Done</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call your assembly member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for those who walk and ride. <strong>Every day of delay is another day of loss.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
