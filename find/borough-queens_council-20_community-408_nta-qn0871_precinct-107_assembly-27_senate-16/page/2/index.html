Prosecutors said Pena was drunk, high on cocaine and marijuana, and driving 83 mph in a 25 mph zone when he ran a red light and struck Diaz’s BMW. Surveillance footage showed the Mercedes 'barreled through an East Elmhurst intersection' at 4:15 a.m. Diaz, headed to work at LaGuardia, died at the scene. Pena refused a breath test; a blood draw later confirmed drug use. He was charged with vehicular manslaughter, DWI, and refusal to submit to testing, but posted $50,000 bail. The article highlights family grief and outrage at bail laws, quoting Diaz’s brother: 'Pena will walk the streets for a $50,000 bail...

At a press conference, Council Member John Liu warned, “This is not for fancy stuff. This is basic transit maintenance.” Liu said losing congestion pricing would erase a billion dollars in annual MTA revenue, threatening $15 billion in planned upgrades. The money funds new subway cars, buses, station repairs, and safety improvements. U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand joined Liu, stressing millions rely on transit daily. Both officials opposed the repeal, highlighting the risk to the city’s transit backbone. The bill is not numbered, but the threat is clear: without congestion pricing, the city’s streets and subways grow more dangerous for everyone outside a car.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It also allows school buses to idle up to 15 minutes and imposes a new code of conduct for enforcers. The Adams administration supports capping bounties but wants higher fines. Opponents, including the New York Clean Air Collective, say the bill 'weaponizes rules that chill participation' and will 'watch while companies like Con Ed, Verizon, and Amazon steal New York’s breath.'

Liu highlighted the planned elimination of the QM3 bus and reductions to the QM5, warning of increased wait times and higher fares for commuters.
