Since January 2022, 420 people have been injured and 15 seriously hurt in traffic crashes in Upper East Side-Carnegie Hill. One person is dead. The bodies are not just numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. A 16-year-old cyclist, cut open in the gut by a passing car. An 81-year-old woman, her head split by an SUV while she tried to cross behind a parked car. The street does not forgive.</p><p>Just last month, eight people were sent to the hospital when a car and SUV slammed into scaffolding on Madison Avenue. The news reported, &ldquo;Eight people were hurt in the crash. All of the injuries are believed to be non-life-threatening,&rdquo; according to <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/2-vehicle-crash-upper-east-side-scaffolding-injures-8-people-manhattan/17376667/>ABC7</a>. No word on charges. No word on why. Only the sound of sirens and the scrape of metal.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p>The old and the young take the brunt. In the last 12 months, 13 people over 75 were hurt. Four children under 18. The street is not safe for anyone, but it is cruelest to those with the least armor. Cars and SUVs do most of the damage—107 injuries to pedestrians from these vehicles alone. Trucks, buses, bikes, mopeds—they all play a part, but the big machines do the worst.</p><h2 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h2><p>The city talks of safety. Council Member Keith Powers backed a bill to ban parking near crosswalks. Assembly Member Alex Bores pushed for moped registration and better crash data. Senator Liz Krueger voted to extend school speed zones and co-sponsored a bill for speed limiters on repeat offenders. But the pace is slow. Congestion pricing, a proven way to cut traffic and save lives, was paused. Powers said, &ldquo;[The state] certainly should take advantage of this very expensive infrastructure in Midtown&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/us-news/gov-hochul-mta-lack-plan-b-for-nyc-congestion-pricing-infrastructure/>NY Post</a>. The machines sit idle. The danger does not.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p>No more waiting. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand the city use every tool—speed cameras, street redesign, real enforcement. Every day of delay is another body in the street.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
