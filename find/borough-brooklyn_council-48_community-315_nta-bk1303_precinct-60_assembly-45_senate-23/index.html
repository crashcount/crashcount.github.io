Slow the Cars.</p><p>This map tells us what to do. At Neptune Ave and Brighton Beach Ave, protect crossings and sightlines: daylight the corners, add leading pedestrian intervals, and harden turns.

Lower the default speed limit and pass the Stop Super Speeders Act to rein in the worst repeat offenders.

DOT’s report claimed high costs and little safety gain, fueling opposition from Council Members Inna Vernikov, Bob Holden, and Vito Fossella. Council Member Julie Won and Mayor Ravi Bhalla called the report a scare tactic, urging citywide daylighting to save lives. DOT’s compromise with pro-car officials weakens protections. As safety analyst notes, this shift prioritizes cars over people, undermining vulnerable road user safety and citywide mode shift goals.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Last week, a speeding driver ran a red light, killing two pedestrians. The article quotes Adams, who once called Third Avenue 'extremely intimidating' and said it 'must be at the top of our list.' Despite this, his administration 'put the brakes on a potentially life-saving road redesign,' favoring business interests. Attorney Peter Beadle notes, 'they had a plan ready to go and then it was pulled back.' The city could face legal action for failing to act despite knowing the risks, echoing a 2017 state court ruling on municipal liability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives called the lane a 'critical safety project.' City Hall insists the reconfiguration is legal and claims the appeal delays 'easing the safety concerns plaguing Williamsburg parents.' The protected lane, installed in October 2024, separates cyclists from moving vehicles.
