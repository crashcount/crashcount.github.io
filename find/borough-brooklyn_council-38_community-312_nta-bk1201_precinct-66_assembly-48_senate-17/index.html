The Assembly passed it 110-31, with nine city lawmakers—Alec Brook-Krasny, Lester Chang, Simcha Eichenstein, Michael Novakhov, Stacey Pheffer Amato, Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Reilly, David Weprin, Kalman Yeger—opposing. The Streetsblog NYC article, 'Ye Shall Know Their Names! Meet the Dirty Dozen City Pols Who Voted Against Speed Camera Program,' quotes lawmakers dismissing speed cameras as revenue grabs or burdens.

The city issued over 3,000 warnings during a 90-day grace period. Similar enforcement on Queens-bound trucks led to a 60% drop in overweight vehicles.

Fear spreads. Court dates loom. Immigration cases hang in the balance. Council Member Avilés slams the move. Advocates warn: this policy endangers lives and livelihoods.</p><p class=mb3>On May 9, 2025, the NYPD announced a shift: cyclists, especially delivery workers, now face criminal court summonses for minor traffic violations. The department claims it is responding to e-bike complaints, but has offered no data. Council Member Alexa Avilés (D-Sunset Park) condemned the policy, saying, 'contact with the NYPD is a premise for the deportation pipeline.' She accused Mayor Adams of political maneuvering and failing to address street safety equitably. Lawyers warn that criminal charges can derail immigration cases, exposing workers to ICE. App companies like Uber Eats oppose criminalization, while GrubHub urges legal compliance. Transportation Alternatives launched a petition against the crackdown. The Adams administration also leaked a draft bill to regulate delivery apps, but it has stalled. The new enforcement targets the city’s most vulnerable road users—immigrant cyclists—putting their safety and futures at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
