But the blood never dries. In the past twelve months, 158 people were hurt in 293 crashes across Rockaway Beach-Arverne-Edgemere. Four suffered serious injuries. Children are not spared: 14 kids were injured, one seriously. These numbers are not just statistics—they are broken bones, hospital beds, and families waiting for news that never gets better.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a cyclist was left with severe cuts to his face after a crash at Beach Channel Drive and Beach 73rd Street. In February, a woman crossing with the signal was crushed by an SUV turning left at the same intersection. She survived, but the pain lingers. Data from <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a> shows the toll.</p><h2 id=sirens-steel-and-silence>Sirens, Steel, and Silence</h2><p>The danger is not just for those on foot or bike. On August 4, two NYPD cruisers collided at Rockaway Freeway and Beach 35th Street while racing to a shots-fired call. Four officers were sent to the hospital. As <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-crash-4-nypd-officers-injured-2-cruisers-collided-rockaways/17438473/>ABC7 reported</a>, &ldquo;The officers were responding to a call for shots fired nearby when they crashed.&rdquo; No civilians were hurt this time. But the risk is always there. Steel meets flesh, and flesh loses.</p><h2 id=leaders-talk-streets-bleed>Leaders Talk, Streets Bleed</h2><p>Local leaders know the score. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers called the city’s greenway plan &ldquo;a real opportunity&mldr; to make a profound impact&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/nyc-greenway-plan-bike-pedestrian-city-council/>amNY</a>). She has backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks and expand protected bike lanes. But the pace is slow. The committee laid over the daylighting bill in April (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council Legistar</a>). Promises pile up. The crashes do too.</p><h2 id=what-now-demand-more>What Now? Demand More</h2><p>Every day without action is another day of risk. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Push for the Stop Super Speeders Act (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). Tell them: enough waiting. The next crash is coming.

The matter, described as a 'call for flood-related street signage and storm mitigation efforts,' saw Richards call signage a 'small step' and Paladino stress the need for warnings.
