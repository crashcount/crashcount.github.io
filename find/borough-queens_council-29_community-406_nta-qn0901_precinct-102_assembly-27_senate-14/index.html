But the blood still runs. In the past 12 months, 132 people were injured in 188 crashes. Two were left with serious wounds. Children were not spared—ten under 18 were hurt. The old were not spared—one over 75 was struck. The numbers do not rest. They pile up, slow and steady, like the sound of tires on wet asphalt.</p><h3 id=the-faces-behind-the-numbers>The Faces Behind the Numbers</h3><p>A 19-year-old bled from his arm after a motorcycle crash. A 56-year-old woman was left with torn flesh after a collision on Queens Boulevard. A 26-year-old was thrown from his moped, his leg broken. These are not statistics. These are people who woke up that morning and did not expect pain. &ldquo;He rams right into the side of the car,&rdquo; said Jose DeAguiar, after an Amazon driver hit his parked car and left without a word (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/7-side-helps-get-repairs-covered-amazon-driver-allegedly-crashed-parked-car-drove-off/16474908/>ABC7</a>). The driver shrugged. The victim waited months for justice.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They say every life matters. They point to new laws, like Sammy’s Law, which lets New York City lower speed limits. But the limit is not yet lowered. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always at risk. The city redesigns intersections, but the blood does not stop. No one in power has stood in Kew Gardens and said, &lsquo;Enough.&rsquo;</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras that never go dark. Demand streets that do not bleed.</p><p>Do not wait for another name to become a number. Act now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Sponsored by Queens Councilman Robert Holden, the bill sits in the health committee, chaired by Lynn Schulman. Speaker Adrienne Adams has not stated her position. The bill, described as a push to end the city’s carriage industry, gained attention after the death of a horse named Lady. Animal rights groups rallied, warning, 'Without a ban there will be more crashes in traffic, there will be more injuries and possibly deaths.' TWU Local 100 opposes the ban. Safety analysts note that removing carriages would cut unpredictable, slow vehicles from streets, reducing crash risk and making roads safer for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

MTA workers get a pass for driving in bus lanes while on duty. Law shields agency vehicles from tickets. Streets grow more crowded. Vulnerable users face more risk.</p><p class=mb3>Bill S 6815, titled 'Relates to bus lane restrictions in New York city,' passed the Senate on June 12, 2025, and the Assembly on June 13, 2025. The bill states, 'it shall be a defense to any prosecution for a violation of a bus lane restriction ... when an employee of the metropolitan transportation authority is performing authorized duties.' Sponsored by Senator Leroy Comrie and co-sponsored by Nathalia Fernandez, the measure exempts MTA employees from bus lane tickets while working. No safety analysis was provided. The bill opens bus lanes to more agency vehicles, crowding space meant for buses, cyclists, and pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
