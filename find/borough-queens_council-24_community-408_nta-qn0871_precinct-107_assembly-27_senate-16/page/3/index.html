Rollins allegedly ran over Gary Charlotin, who was crossing Hempstead Ave., then stopped for two minutes before fleeing. According to Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz, Rollins 'proceeded to speed away from the scene while dragging the victim's body, while the victim was still alive.' Bystanders pleaded for the driver to stop. The incident highlights the lethal consequences of driver inattention and failure to yield, as well as the dangers posed by drivers who flee crash scenes.
