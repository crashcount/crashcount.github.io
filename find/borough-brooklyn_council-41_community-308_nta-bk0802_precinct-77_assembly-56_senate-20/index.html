Assembly Member Amy Sohn and others criticized the lack of action. The only major win was extending the city’s speed camera program.

According to the police report, the moped driver, a 36-year-old man, was injured in the leg and remained conscious. Four other occupants—three in the SUV and one on the moped—were involved, with unspecified injuries. The crash report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Driver Inexperience' as contributing factors. The moped driver was wearing a helmet, as noted in the data. The SUV sustained damage to its left side doors, while the moped was struck at the center front end. The report does not blame any victim.

Bus lanes and pedestrian islands will take their place. Fifty-five killed or badly hurt since 2019. Buses crawl. Pedestrians dodge traffic. The city moves to fix a deadly, clogged corridor.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist reported on June 4, 2025, that New York City's Department of Transportation plans to overhaul Flatbush Avenue between Livingston Street and Grand Army Plaza. The redesign replaces two car lanes with 24/7 bus-only lanes and adds pedestrian islands. DOT officials said, 'almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles.' Since 2019, 55 people have been killed or severely injured in crashes along this stretch. The plan removes curbside parking and bans cars from bus lanes, aiming to speed up twelve bus routes and protect people on foot. Most residents in the area do not own cars and depend on slow buses. The proposal reflects a shift toward prioritizing vulnerable road users and addressing systemic danger on one of Brooklyn's busiest corridors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Trains crawl. Riders stew. The fix promises faster, steadier service. Fewer delays. More trains. Streets breathe easier when subways run strong. The city waits for relief.</p><p class=mb3>On June 3, 2025, the MTA unveiled its 2025-2029 capital plan, targeting the notorious Nostrand Junction subway bottleneck in Central Brooklyn. The plan, announced by MTA Construction & Development president Jamie Torres-Springer and supported by State Sen. Zellnor Myrie, promises to 'finally unclog a notoriously slow-rolling segment of the subway.' The project will keep express and local trains on their tracks, cut delays, and boost throughput from 44 to 60 trains per hour. Myrie said, 'I'm proud the MTA Capital Plan includes funding to finally un-cluster Crown Heights so more New Yorkers can get to work and school on time.' According to safety analysts, improving subway service can shift trips from cars to transit, reducing car traffic and risks for pedestrians and cyclists. The work is overdue. The city watches.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
