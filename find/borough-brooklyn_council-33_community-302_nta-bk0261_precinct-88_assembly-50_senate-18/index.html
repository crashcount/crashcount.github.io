Two left with life-changing injuries.</strong> Fifty-five hurt since 2022. These are not just numbers. They are broken bodies, families left waiting for a call that never comes. The dead do not speak. The injured carry the story in scars.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> Cars and SUVs killed one, injured three more. Bikes left two hurt. Trucks and buses, this time, did not take a life, but the margin is thin. The street does not care who you are. It only cares who is slower, who is softer, who is left behind.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-no-end-in-sight>The Pattern: No End in Sight</h3><p>The last twelve months brought <strong>no deaths, but ten more injuries</strong>. The year before, eight. The pace does not slow. The pain does not ease. A 59-year-old woman, crossing at Kent and Taylor, was struck and killed by an SUV. The cause: &ldquo;Failure to Yield Right-of-Way.&rdquo; The words are dry. The result is not. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>A cyclist, 24, ejected from his bike, left bleeding on Kent Avenue. Another, 39, thrown to the ground. The pattern repeats. The city calls them accidents. The street calls them what they are: collisions, preventable, relentless.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-and-stalls>Leadership: Steps and Stalls</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have moved, but not fast enough.</strong> Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/stop-super-speeders-brooklyn-borough-hall/>called for speed limiter technology</a>: &ldquo;The speed limiter technology is available to us. Let’s use it. It will save lives.&rdquo;</p><p>Simon also <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/26/no-brainer-state-pol-seeks-citywide-parking-ban-near-intersections>pushed for daylighting</a>—removing parked cars from corners—calling it a &ldquo;no-brainer,&rdquo; because &ldquo;people feel a lot safer crossing those intersections.&rdquo;</p><p>But the city drags its feet. Promises pile up. Paint fades. The curb stays dangerous. The most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, children—wait for action.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made upstream. <strong>Call your council member. Call your assembly member. Demand daylighting at every corner. Demand speed limiters for repeat offenders. Demand streets where the softest bodies are not the first to bleed.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Despite this, his administration 'put the brakes on a potentially life-saving road redesign,' favoring business interests. Attorney Peter Beadle notes, 'they had a plan ready to go and then it was pulled back.'

Pedestrians and cyclists reclaim space.</p><p class=mb3>On June 24, 2025, NYPD and the 84th Precinct enforced a sweep against illegal placard parking under the Brooklyn Queens Expressway at Tillary and Navy streets. The action, coordinated with Council Member Lincoln Restler, followed community complaints. Officers issued 40 summonses and towed 10 vehicles. The NYPD stated, "Following community complaints about illegal parking... the NYPD Transportation Bureau and Council Member Lincoln Restler coordinated... to address the parking condition and clear the area." Council Members Restler and Crystal Hudson represent the district but did not claim credit. The crackdown targets city employees who abused parking privileges for years. Safety analysts note: "Cracking down on placard abuse reduces illegal parking, especially in bike lanes, crosswalks, and sidewalks, improving safety and accessibility for pedestrians and cyclists by reclaiming public space and reducing driver entitlement."</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The car driver remained at the scene. No arrests were made, and the NYPD Highway District Collision Squad is investigating.

Cyclists called the move "unwise and unsafe." The article notes the city had previously identified this stretch as among the most dangerous. Officials responded to concerns by painting pedestrian islands and loading zones but did not install physical barriers or bus boarding islands. Cyclists described the decision as political, with one saying, "There’s a very important voting bloc that’s using their leverage over the mayor to remove the bike lane." The mayor’s refusal to sacrifice parking for safety left vulnerable road users exposed.
