Night after night, the parkways bleed.</h1></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>Pelham Bay Park: Jan 1, 2022 - Aug 25, 2025</h2><p>Two men died before dawn on the Bronx River Parkway. Police say a 21‑year‑old in a Mercedes tried to pass, hit a car, then struck two bikes. The riders were thrown onto the road and died at hospitals. Their names: Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19, and Enrique Martinez, 21. The driver was charged with vehicular manslaughter and DWI. He refused a chemical test. The southbound lanes closed for hours near Gun Hill.</p><p>“Two people were killed. He was drunk,” said a sister at court. “Think about how he took two lives.” The lawyer said his client will contest the charges. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Police and prosecutors laid out the basics</a>. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>Family members asked why he walked free after arraignment</a>.</p><p>The morning rush crept past flares and wrecked metal. Another night. Another stretch of Bronx parkway sealed with tape.</p><h3 id=the-parkways-dont-forgive>The parkways don’t forgive</h3><p>This corner of the Bronx is carved by fast roads. The dead pile up on the big names. In the last three years, the worst injury clusters sit on the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Bruckner Expressway</a> and the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Hutchinson River Parkway</a>. Pelham Parkway shows death too.</p><p>Night is cruel here. Injuries spike after dark. The heaviest hours run from midnight to 3 a.m., then again from late afternoon into night, with deaths marked at 4 a.m., 4 p.m., and 9 p.m. The data call it out: nighttime conditions.</p><p>On these roads, most victims sit inside vehicles. But people outside are not spared. In this zone since 2022: seven cyclists hurt, seven pedestrians hurt, one pedestrian seriously.</p><h3 id=patterns-you-can-touch>Patterns you can touch</h3><p>City data tags the usual sins: distraction, tailgating, improper passing. “Other” fills many reports. One crash on the Hutch last winter killed a woman and injured a 14‑year‑old in a chain of cars and trucks on slick pavement. Another on Pelham Parkway killed a driver at night. A summer left turn at Bruckner and Pelham ended with a motorcyclist ejected and dead.</p><p>Trucks and SUVs are in the mix on every artery. Rear‑ends. Unsafe turns. Speed.</p><h3 id=what-this-neighborhood-needs-now>What this neighborhood needs now</h3><p>Cut the speed where people live and cross. Daylight the turns. Harden them. Give slow‑to‑start signals at Pelham Parkway and the service roads. Target late‑night speeding on the Hutch, the Bruckner, and the Bronx River Parkway.</p><p>Then do the citywide work we already know saves lives. <strong>Lower the default speed limit</strong> on residential streets. Albany gave the city that power. Use it. <strong>Force the worst repeat speeders to slow down</strong> with intelligent speed assistance after a pattern of tickets or points. State lawmakers advanced that bill this session.</p><p>Leaders have the tools. Use them or explain the next obituary to a mother at 2 a.m.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What you can do</h3><p>Tell City Hall and Albany to slow the cars and stop repeat offenders. Start here: <a href=../../take_action/>take action</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
