Police charged Michael Aracena, 20, with murder, manslaughter, and criminal possession of a weapon. The article describes the incident as an 'alleged road rage' shooting but does not detail the events leading up to the violence. Campbell was shot three times in the chest while sitting in his gray 2012 Infiniti sedan. His mother, Suzette Thomas, said, 'I want people to remember my son as a humble person, one to do the best for the world.' The case highlights the lethal risk of violent escalation on city streets and the ongoing threat to vulnerable road users from armed drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The transition faced delays, including the COVID-19 pandemic and medallion owner financial struggles. Policy changes, such as alternating accessible vehicles and funding support, drove the shift.

The project, backed by the Economic Development Corporation and Council Member Rafael Salamanca, aims to move food by boat and e-cargo trike instead of trucks. The matter summary states: 'Replacing truck trips with boat trips and cargo bikes is a key feature of the city's urgent push to shift cargo trips out of big trucks.' EDC President Andrew Kimball said, 'The goal is, over time, to move more and more of this food out of Hunts Point not by truck, but by water with e-cargo trikes.' The dock will remove one thousand trucks per month from South Bronx streets. Officials plan to expand docks citywide. The bill’s status is an active infrastructure rollout, not a legislative vote.
