Goods will arrive by boat, then move by truck or cargo bike. Council Member Farías wants faster action to cut truck traffic. The project aims to shift freight off city streets.</p><p class=mb3>The city announced plans for a maritime freight facility at the Downtown Manhattan Heliport, with completion set for mid-2029. The Economic Development Corporation (EDC) leads the project, backed by a $5.2-million federal grant to upgrade six city-owned landings. The pier will allow boats to offload goods for last-mile delivery by small trucks or cargo bikes. The matter summary states: 'The city unveiled plans to build a maritime freight delivery facility at the Downtown Manhattan Heliport, with a barge for boats to offload goods for last-mile delivery via small trucks or cargo bikes.' Bronx Council Member Amanda Farías praised the commitment, saying, 'We have to do everything we can to alleviate road congestion and lessen the harmful effects of pollution.' She urged faster progress to reduce truck traffic and pollution. The downtown dock will cost about $1.2 million, with most costs covered by the grant. Timelines for other sites depend on federal reviews.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill targets drivers hiding their plates from red light and speed cameras. Reports must show where, when, and how plates go unseen. Data goes public, every quarter.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0712-2022, now enacted as Local Law 155 of 2023, passed the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the full Council on October 19, 2023. The law, sponsored by Gale A. Brewer with co-sponsors including Erik D. Bottcher, Lincoln Restler, and others, amends the city code to require the Department of Transportation to report on vehicles with license plates unreadable by photo violation monitoring systems. The law’s title states it is 'in relation to reporting on motor vehicles with license plates that are unreadable by photo violation monitoring systems.' DOT must post quarterly reports showing the time, location, and reasons plates evade cameras—whether by concealment, distortion, or missing tags. The law aims to expose drivers who dodge automated enforcement, shining light on a loophole that puts pedestrians and cyclists at risk. The reports must be public and sent to the Mayor and Council Speaker.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lives depend on it.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0854-2022, now enacted as Local Law 66 of 2023, passed the City Council on April 27, 2023, after review by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The law requires the Department of Transportation to 'implement daylighting at a minimum of 100 intersections a year,' meaning no parking within 15 feet of corners. High-crash intersections must be prioritized unless deemed infeasible. DOT must also install physical daylighting features, such as planters or bike corrals, where possible. Council Member Farah N. Louis sponsored the bill, joined by Brooks-Powers, Hudson, Ossé, and others. The law took effect 90 days after enactment. DOT must report annually on locations and reasons for any exceptions. This measure targets the blind spots that kill and injure pedestrians and cyclists at intersections. The city’s streets will see more open corners and fewer hiding places for danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law was introduced on October 27, 2022, passed on May 29, 2023, and returned unsigned by the mayor. The bill amends the administrative code to require the Department of Transportation to conduct a comprehensive study of all pedestrian fatalities and serious injuries every three years, instead of every five. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian safety reporting.' Sponsors include Alexa Avilés (primary), Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, Crystal Hudson, Amanda Farías, Tiffany Cabán, Lynn C. Schulman, Kalman Yeger, Farah N. Louis, Lincoln Restler, Darlene Mealy, Eric Dinowitz, Linda Lee, Pierina Ana Sanchez, Carlina Rivera, Mercedes Narcisse, and Rita C. Joseph. The law mandates that crash reports and recommendations be sent to council members, community boards, and made public. This change increases transparency and keeps the focus on the deadly toll of cars in New York City.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The resolution calls on the New York State Legislature and Governor to 'fully fund the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) in the State’s upcoming Fiscal Year 2024 Budget.' Council Member Farah N. Louis sponsored the measure, joined by over thirty co-sponsors. The committee vote was unanimous among present members. The resolution highlights the MTA’s critical role for millions of New Yorkers and warns of a 'looming fiscal cliff' as federal aid dries up. The Council insists that full funding is needed to prevent service cuts and keep transit affordable and frequent. The measure references the 'New York City in Six' plan, pushing for buses and trains every six minutes. The Council’s action centers the needs of riders—especially those with no other way to move safely through the city.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
