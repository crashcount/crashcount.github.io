The bill aims to alert drivers to the presence of school-aged children and pedestrians. It remains in committee, with no vote or enactment date set.

The report states, 'A moped struck from behind. The woman stayed upright. Her knee split open. Blood soaked her jeans.' The impact caused severe lacerations to her knee, though she did not fall from the vehicle. The moped sustained damage to the center back end, consistent with a rear impact. The police report lists the contributing factor as 'Unspecified,' but the collision's nature—center back end impact—points to a failure by the striking vehicle to maintain safe distance or control.
