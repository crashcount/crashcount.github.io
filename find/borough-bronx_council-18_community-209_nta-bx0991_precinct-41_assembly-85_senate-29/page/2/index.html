The bus crashed into the wall, breaking through and leaving debris below. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz said, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." No injuries were reported, but the crash caused structural damage. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz noted, "That’s a very big bus, so even going very slowly, it can do a lot of damage," highlighting the risk of lax parking enforcement. The incident underscores systemic issues: double-parking and weak infrastructure can combine to threaten lives, even when no one is hurt.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the improvement and maintenance of medians through the planting of vegetation or use in stormwater management," requires the city to improve at least one mile of paved medians every two years until 2046. The Department of Transportation, Parks, and Environmental Protection must add planted medians, tree beds, or stormwater infrastructure, focusing on high-priority investment areas. Council Member Shekar Krishnan sponsored the bill, joined by Feliz, Avilés, Nurse, Banks, Restler, Ung, Schulman, Holden, Hudson, and Yeger. The Council passed the bill with broad support, though the mayor returned it unsigned. The law mandates annual progress reports and public tracking of improved medians and responsible agencies.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The MTA’s 2025-29 capital program, discussed at the Capital Program Committee meeting, remains unfunded after Governor Hochul’s indefinite delay of congestion pricing. The matter centers on the need for new rail cars, power stations, and repairs to tracks and tunnels. MTA President of Construction and Development Jamie Torres-Springer stressed, 'We need to achieve 100 percent state-of-good-repair.' State Senator Jeremy Cooney challenged the governor to restore funding or implement congestion pricing within 100 days. Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein urged, 'Gov. Hochul must start congestion pricing now to rebuild trust.' The MTA is $15 billion short on its 2020-24 plan, with no clear path forward. Transit advocates warn that underfunding public transit puts riders—especially those on foot or bike—at continued risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
