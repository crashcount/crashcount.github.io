Assembly Member Charles Fall is mentioned noting Midtown restaurant amenity closures affecting tenants. The report records layoff filings and shuttering this fall. Safety impact: none recorded; no safety analyst note provided.

He said, 'Summer Streets is bigger and better than ever—and New Yorkers are begging for more.' Meyer supports car-free events but criticizes their limited scale. No council bill or committee action is attached. A safety analyst notes: expanding Summer Streets increases car-free space, encourages walking and cycling, and improves safety by reducing vehicle conflicts and promoting mode shift.

The MTA’s $68.4 billion capital plan for 2025-2029 funds the project. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes said, “With elevators coming to the Smith-9th Street station, that’s finally going to change.” Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon praised the MTA for prioritizing accessibility. The upgrades follow a court settlement requiring 95% ADA-accessible stations by 2055. Safety analysts note: elevator installation boosts access for people with mobility challenges but does not directly impact street safety for pedestrians or cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They condemned the Adams administration's delay of a DOT safety plan, approved by Community Board 7 in 2023, after a hit-and-run killed two pedestrians. Council Member Alexa Avilés called for real investment. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives called the delay 'unconscionable.' State Sen Andrew Gounardes and Assembly Member Marcela Mitaynes demanded urgent redesign. The rally's matter: 'demanding the Adams administration implement traffic safety measures on Third Avenue.' Safety analysts note: public rallies like this can push systemic changes, making streets safer for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Nearly 6,000 tickets in months. Riders face courts for minor moves. Cars escape harsher scrutiny. Streets stay dangerous. Frustration mounts.</p><p class=mb3>ABC7 reported on July 23, 2025, that NYPD issued nearly 6,000 tickets to cyclists in recent months, up from 561 earlier in the year. These are not simple fines but criminal summonses, forcing court appearances for violations like riding the wrong way or in bus lanes. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said, "New Yorkers are telling us that even as crime falls, that they still don't feel safe." Critics, including Transportation Alternatives, argue that cyclists face harsher penalties than drivers, with Charlie Baker noting, "A 50-pound bike gets a criminal court date, a 6,000-pound car gets a ticket." The crackdown highlights enforcement gaps and calls for more protected bike lanes and better regulation of delivery vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Police found 'an open bottle of tequila in the car’s passenger area' and two pistols in the trunk. Witnesses saw the driver and a passenger try to flee. Romero had been charged in a prior Brooklyn crash involving a suspended license.
