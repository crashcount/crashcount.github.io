The agency completed only 25 miles of bike lanes and 11.95 miles of bus lanes. The matter, titled 'DOT Will Not Reach Required Bike and Bus Lane Requirements This Year,' drew sharp criticism from Riders Alliance and Transportation Alternatives. Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance said, 'The Adams administration is many miles wide of the mark when it comes to complying with the Streets Plan and keeping the mayor's promise to millions of riders.' Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives added, 'The city needs to meet these goals without delay or excuse and stop leaving New Yorkers who walk, bike, and bus behind.' A City Council spokesperson blamed staff shortages and unfilled vacancies, calling the situation 'unacceptable.' The Council urged the administration to fill key roles and meet legal requirements. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, bus riders—bear the brunt of these failures.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The numbers are grim. The danger is real.</p><p class=mb3>The Streetsie Awards 2022, published December 27, 2022 by Streetsblog NYC, highlights the year’s worst setbacks for vulnerable road users. The commentary notes, 'the stats on 2021's pedestrian death crisis came out not too long ago, and they were awful. As in, the-worst-they-been-in-40-years awful.' No council bill or vote is attached, but the piece draws on federal data and expert analysis. It singles out SUVs as a main threat: drivers are four times more likely to strike pedestrians while turning, and children hit by SUVs are eight times more likely to die than if struck by smaller cars. The article also exposes the frequency and devastation of vehicle-into-building crashes and the false promise of autonomous vehicles. It underscores how car culture’s burdens fall hardest on marginalized communities. The message is clear: systemic danger persists, and the most vulnerable pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill awaits final passage to avoid a government shutdown. The measure aims to 'address gaps in bike lane, sidewalk, and multi-use trail networks.' Brandi Horton of Rails-to-Trails Conservancy called it 'a major victory' but stressed the need for more funding. Congress authorized up to $200 million per year, but only $45 million was delivered for 2023—less than 10 percent of what advocates requested. Projects must cost over $15 million to qualify, leaving most communities behind. A survey found $7 billion in unmet needs for active transportation. Lawmakers included $1.6 billion in transportation earmarks, but most funds still go to highways.

We have to fix the rot at the heart of the transit system, which means we have to pass the package of bills known as the 'Fix the MTA.'"" -- Charles Fall</p><p class=mb3>On December 22, 2022, MTA leaders announced that without recurring state funding, service cuts are inevitable. The MTA Board approved a 2023 budget allowing fare hikes and service changes, pending Albany’s action. Chairman Janno Lieber said, "All good things can happen if people are willing to pay for them, or help figure out recurring funding sources, which is what MTA needs to achieve fiscal stability." New York City Transit President Richard Davey explained that peak hour service would be trimmed, with modest increases in wait times, while some weekend service would expand. Transit advocates and union leaders, including Richard Davis, condemned the cuts, warning of increased rider frustration and assaults on workers. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani urged passage of bills to freeze fares and fill the MTA’s fiscal gap, stating, "We have to fix the rot at the heart of the transit system." No formal safety analyst assessment was provided, but the debate centers on the risk to riders and workers if service shrinks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The state calls transit taxes its own contribution, shortchanging riders. Lawmakers and watchdogs demand an end to the shell game. The governor stalls. Riders pay the price in service and safety.</p><p class=mb3>This state budgetary action, revealed December 20, 2022, exposes New York’s long-running diversion of dedicated transit funds from the MTA. Under the 1975 18-b law, the state must match local funding for public transit. Instead, since 1995, Albany has counted regional transit taxes as its own share, leaving a $4.9 billion shortfall. State Comptroller Tom DiNapoli criticizes the practice: 'the state has used a portion of these resources... rather than using General Fund revenues as originally intended.' Assembly Member Amy Paulin, chair of the Corporations Committee, insists, 'we don’t have to justify funding the MTA adequately. It is very justified.' Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany calls for an end to 'raiding dedicated funds.' The governor’s office has not pledged to stop. The result: less money for transit, more danger for those who rely on it.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The study, titled "Four Ways To Build A Better Automated Enforcement Program," surveyed 1,500 U.S. adults about traffic cameras. Researchers, including Kelcie Ralph, urge cities to use data-driven camera placement, scale fines to income, and spend revenue on self-enforcing infrastructure like road narrowing. They warn against using cameras as cash cows or funding police and private contractors. The report states: "The purpose of [automated enforcement] is to improve safety, not catch unsuspecting drivers." Ralph adds, "They need to be in places with known safety risks, and it should be a data driven process." The analysis calls for shifting control to transportation departments and removing jail time for unpaid fines.

The agency cites staff shortages and budget cuts as the main obstacles. Council members and advocates, including Riders Alliance and the City Council, have condemned the delays and called staff shortages 'unacceptable.' Mayor Adams’s administration has revised its promise, now counting 'enhanced' lanes, not just new ones. DOT spokesman Vin Barone insists the agency intends to meet 2023 goals, but specifics are lacking. The law has no enforcement provision.

They dodge car chaos, breathe clean air, and stay close. Their story cuts through car culture. They prove families can thrive without a car. Streets shape safety. Bikes bring freedom.</p><p class=mb3>On November 18, 2022, Streetsblog NYC published a public advocacy piece titled "Cargo Bikes: The Happiest Transportation Mode on Earth." The article highlights the Boelens family, who have lived car-free for 11 years, using cargo bikes for daily errands and childcare. The piece states: "We find it's just as easy to get around within a five-mile radius by bike than it is by car. We get exercise, fresh air, and save so much money." The story features direct quotes from Arnout and Nicole Zoeller Boelens, who describe the ease and joy of cycling as a family. No council bill, vote, or committee action is involved. The article challenges the myth that families need cars, showing how street design—not personal choice—shapes safety and mobility for vulnerable road users. No formal safety analyst assessment is included.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city’s pain is made visible.</p><p class=mb3>On November 18, 2022, city officials and Families for Safe Streets dedicated the Memorial Grove for Victims of Traffic Violence in Lincoln Terrace/Arthur S. Somers Park, Brooklyn. The event, supported by Mayor Eric Adams, marks the first such memorial in the United States. Adams said, 'My administration has zero tolerance for traffic violence.' Robin Middleman Filepp of Families for Safe Streets called it 'a public health crisis that demands action.' The grove honors over 2,100 killed and nearly half a million injured since Vision Zero began in 2014. The Parks Department set aside the space, with saplings planted by volunteers and city workers. The memorial stands as a stark reminder: traffic violence is preventable, and victims deserve recognition.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They demanded more money for the MTA. They want six-minute bus and subway service. They warned against service cuts and fare hikes. They called for gas tax revenue to fund transit. Riders need safe, frequent service.</p><p class=mb3>On November 17, 2022, state legislators and transit advocates pressed for increased MTA funding and six-minute off-peak service. The push comes ahead of the next budget cycle. Assembly Members Zohran Mamdani and Amanda Septimo, State Senator Andrew Gounardes, and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher led the call. Mamdani said, 'If we implement six-minute service, the consequences would be felt for riders across all aspects of their life.' Septimo called transit an economic and racial justice issue. Gounardes urged the governor to include MTA funding in the initial budget. Gallagher criticized the gas tax holiday, urging funds go to transit. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber warned that cuts or fare hikes would devastate working- and middle-class New Yorkers. The group demanded action to protect and improve transit for all riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Emissions kill 1,400 city residents each year—more than crashes. Noise from traffic warps bodies and minds. Walking brings health, sanity, and community. Electric cars do not solve the core danger. Streets remain deadly. Walking saves lives.</p><p class=mb3>This policy advocacy, published November 15, 2022, revisits the impact of car dependency a decade after 'Walkable City.' The article, titled 'Walkable City 10 Years Later: Cars Make Us Sicker Than We Thought,' draws on studies showing road emissions cause 53,000 early deaths annually in the U.S., with 1,400 in New York City alone. Healthcare costs from vehicle emissions top $21 billion per year in the city. The piece highlights that electric vehicles do not eliminate most toxic emissions, which come from tires and non-tailpipe sources. Traffic noise increases risk of heart attacks, strokes, and dementia. The article quotes, 'People who walk 8.6 minutes a day are 33 percent more likely to report better mental health.' It argues that walking and biking foster stronger communities and civic engagement, while car traffic breeds isolation and danger. No council member is named; this is a broad policy critique, not a legislative action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
