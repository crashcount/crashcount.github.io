The law, named after Carlos Moncayo, aims to curb a surge in construction worker deaths—22 in the past year, the highest in five years. State Sen. Jessica Ramos, representing District 13, called the law 'critically needed' as thousands of migrants enter non-union construction jobs lacking basic safety protections. Ramos and other lawmakers supported the bill, but advocates and union officials warn that without strong enforcement and education for new arrivals, deaths and injuries will persist. The law passed after years of advocacy, but the minimum fine was removed, and nonprofits struggle to train the influx of new workers.

The article centers on Ian Lockwood, a sustainable transportation expert, who was hit by a truck towing a boat while cycling. Lockwood blames road markings, not the driver, saying, 'I blame it on that yellow line.' He criticizes the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) for prioritizing speed over safety, stating, 'They're there to make them faster.' Lockwood argues that traffic controls shift blame onto vulnerable users and do not guarantee safety. He supports Vision Zero and shared space designs, which slow traffic and reduce crashes.

The public consultation, held in November, drew 1,270 in-person responses. The DOT summarized: 'the majority of respondents were interested in options to unify the public spaces.' Council members are not directly named, but city officials like Terra Ishee, DOT Pedestrian Unit Director, acknowledged the limits of past efforts: 'We really need to bump it up and make it a full blown capital project.' Brooklyn organizer Kathy Park-Price of Transportation Alternatives said, 'After decades of car-centric planning, it's time to return Grand Army Plaza to people.' Residents’ top demands: more protected pedestrian space, protected bike lanes, and overhauled traffic operations. The DOT plans a capital project design in fall 2023.

The incident, reported by Streetsblog NYC, involved a 70-year-old man who died and a critically injured passenger. Witnesses described the SUV smashing through a concrete barrier and fence before falling onto the tracks, estimating speeds of 30 to 40 miles per hour. The NYPD initially suggested a 'medical episode' but later dropped this claim, despite a pattern of police blaming unexplained crashes on health issues. The vehicle’s license plate had 13 speeding violations since 2019, including four in the past year. No council bill or committee action is attached to this event. The case highlights systemic failures: weak enforcement against repeat reckless drivers, barriers that fail to protect, and police narratives that obscure driver responsibility.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives added, 'The city needs to meet these goals without delay or excuse and stop leaving New Yorkers who walk, bike, and bus behind.' A City Council spokesperson blamed staff shortages and unfilled vacancies, calling the situation 'unacceptable.' The Council urged the administration to fill key roles and meet legal requirements.

No council bill or vote is attached, but the piece draws on federal data and expert analysis. It singles out SUVs as a main threat: drivers are four times more likely to strike pedestrians while turning, and children hit by SUVs are eight times more likely to die than if struck by smaller cars. The article also exposes the frequency and devastation of vehicle-into-building crashes and the false promise of autonomous vehicles. It underscores how car culture’s burdens fall hardest on marginalized communities.

New York City Transit President Richard Davey explained that peak hour service would be trimmed, with modest increases in wait times, while some weekend service would expand. Transit advocates and union leaders, including Richard Davis, condemned the cuts, warning of increased rider frustration and assaults on workers. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani urged passage of bills to freeze fares and fill the MTA’s fiscal gap, stating, "We have to fix the rot at the heart of the transit system."

The report states: "The purpose of [automated enforcement] is to improve safety, not catch unsuspecting drivers."
