The agency’s summary highlights a modest dip in overall deaths, but the details are stark: 'drivers had killed more cyclists (1,105) than they had in any single year in the entire history of the reporting system—and pedestrian deaths (7,522) were the highest since 1981.' Vulnerable road users now account for 36 percent of all fatalities, up from 20 percent in 1996. Hit-and-run deaths and serious injuries for pedestrians and cyclists both rose 11 percent. Tami Friedrich of the Truck Safety Coalition demanded urgent federal action, stating, 'No one else needs to die because of bureaucratic inaction.' Advocates and Vision Zero supporters call for systemic reforms—speed limiters, automatic braking, safer trucks, and better infrastructure.

The article asks, 'What if we treated our national epidemic of car crashes with that same degree of urgency—not to mention that same holistic approach to saving lives?' No council bill number or committee applies; this is a media analysis, not legislation. The piece criticizes how officials and media leap into action for rare infrastructure disasters, but ignore the daily, deadly toll of car violence. It notes that highway expansion is prioritized over repair, and that systemic failures—not individual mistakes—drive the crisis. The commentary urges a shift to a Safe System Approach, demanding the same scrutiny and coordinated action for traffic violence as for headline-grabbing catastrophes.

Justin Wood of New York Lawyers for the Public Interest warned, 'The system cannot achieve transformational change if it is treated as a limited pilot program.'

The measure remains in committee. The bill responds to a fatal flaw: 'We have no mechanism right now, under law, to crack down on extremely reckless drivers,' said Brooklyn State Sen. Andrew Gounardes. The current law lets drivers rack up dozens of camera tickets and keep driving, since no points are added to licenses. Gianaris’s bill aims to close this loophole.

The fight is for life, not convenience.</p><p class=mb3>This opinion piece, published March 4, 2024 by Streetsblog NYC, dissects how denialist tactics undermine safety reforms in New York City. The article, titled 'Understanding Car Culture ‘Denialism’ Can Help Safety Advocates Respond,' details how fake experts, logical fallacies, and shifting demands block alternatives to car-centric streets. Council Member Robert Holden is named for pushing e-bike licensing, a move described as 'extremely harmful' for vulnerable road users. The article criticizes engineers and community boards who resist bike lanes and street redesigns. It urges advocates to call out denialist rhetoric and challenge the roots of car-first policies. The piece stands firmly for bike lanes, e-bikes, and safer streets, and against delays that keep New Yorkers in danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates warn: this move will slash e-bike use, boost car traffic, and choke the city with more danger. Denialism shields car dominance. The fight for safer streets grows sharper, louder, urgent.</p><p class=mb3>On March 4, 2024, Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30) was spotlighted for proposing legislation to require licensing and registration for all e-bikes. The measure, discussed in an advocacy article, has not advanced to committee or vote. The article states: 'Council Member Robert Holden has proposed legislation to require licensing and registration for all e-bikes. This legislation will be extremely harmful if it becomes law—likely cutting e-bike use, increasing motorcycle and car emissions and traffic, and forfeiting economic benefits associated with micro-mobility.' Holden’s push aligns with car-centric policy, drawing sharp criticism from safety advocates. They argue the bill would endanger vulnerable road users by forcing more people into cars and away from safer, sustainable options. The piece calls for direct confrontation of denialist rhetoric and a shift from car dependency to protect lives on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Members Julie Won (primary sponsor), Williams, Restler, Salaam, Bottcher, Riley, Brewer, Farías, and the Brooklyn Borough President back the measure. Vehicles with special permits remain exempt from these fees. The bill aims to cut congestion, but offers no direct safety gains for pedestrians or cyclists.
