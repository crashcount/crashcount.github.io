Stewart-Cousins and Carl Heastie cited a $33 billion funding gap, stating, 'The proposed program currently faces a significant funding deficit... which is a specific concern that needs to be addressed before we can approve the program.' The rejection halts contracts for new train cars and electrical upgrades. The MTA now has ten days to respond. This move follows delays from Governor Hochul’s congestion pricing pause.

Williams was struck, thrown, and died from his injuries. The article states, “An officer pursuing dirt bikers suddenly crossed the double yellow line into Williams' path, causing a collision.” Another NYPD vehicle attempted a similar maneuver. The family’s attorney called it a “deadly maneuver” for a minor violation. The city later billed Williams’ family for police vehicle damages. The NYPD has not commented, citing litigation. The case raises questions about police pursuit tactics and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move comes weeks before new congestion tolls hit Manhattan. The matter, titled 'MTA plans fare hike as it OKs $1.27B train car purchase weeks before new congestion toll: ‘Keep the grift alive’,' drew fire from Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30), who called the fare and toll hikes a 'scam' and accused the MTA of mismanagement. Holden’s comments echo broader council criticism of the MTA’s spending and question the effectiveness of congestion pricing. MTA officials defend the investment, citing improved reliability and safety with the new R211 cars. No independent safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.

The matter, reported by Streetsblog NYC, centers on New York’s offer of over $100 million for New Jersey Transit, potentially as an annual payment from congestion toll revenue. Hochul said, 'We've made multiple offers to settle this lawsuit. Very generous offers.' New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy refused, risking further strain on NJ Transit, which recently raised fares 15 percent. Riders Alliance’s Betsy Plum called Murphy’s stance 'a stubbornness tax' paid by transit riders. Environmental advocates criticized Murphy for blocking improvements to public transportation. The congestion pricing program, set to be the nation’s first, remains tied up in court.

Streetsblog filed two Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) requests (R001199-062024 and R001389-102924), both denied or delayed without reason. The matter centers on the governor's decision to 'pause congestion pricing,' a move that impacts every New Yorker who walks, bikes, or rides transit. Heather Murray of Cornell Law School called the delay 'unconscionable,' saying, 'Delaying release of these records for six months is tantamount to denial of the request and violates the Freedom of Information Law.' Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance urged Hochul to 'level with New Yorkers.'

The path, north of the George Washington Bridge, has collapsed twice in two years. Advocates like Allegra LeGrande and Ira Gershenhorn, along with former Traffic Commissioner Sam Schwartz, urge the city to convert a Henry Hudson Parkway lane into a protected bike path. They call this 'low-hanging fruit.' Instead, the city has forced cyclists onto dangerous, unprotected detours.
