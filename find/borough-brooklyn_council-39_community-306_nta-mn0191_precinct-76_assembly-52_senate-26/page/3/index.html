Charles Komanoff, a noted analyst, criticized NYLCV’s endorsement, arguing, 'Both City of Yes and congestion pricing will generate huge environmental dividends.' Komanoff said NYLCV’s scorecard ignored Marte’s record on housing and transportation, which should have disqualified him. NYLCV President Julie Tighe admitted to a slight incumbent bias and highlighted Marte’s park work, but could not confirm if congestion pricing was discussed.

He noted Yarimi’s 21 speeding and five red-light tickets did not trigger license points or insurance penalties. Gonzalez questioned why the NYPD cannot seize cars based on repeated violations and called for legislative change. He endorsed State Sen.

The crash followed a police chase; two officers involved were suspended pending investigation. The article notes, "The police are investigating whether the officers left the scene without reporting the crash." The medical examiner found Guzman Parra died from blunt impact and thermal injuries. The NYPD force investigation unit and state attorney general are reviewing the incident. The police have not disclosed why the chase began or details about the pursuit.

The bill, titled 'Relates to the use of certain photo speed violation monitoring systems for the purposes of enforcement of license plate obstruction; repealer,' was introduced on April 11, 2025. It permits New York City to use speed cameras not just for speeding, but also to enforce against license plate obstruction, concealment, and distortion. The measure also extends speed camera enforcement in school zones. Gounardes leads the charge, aiming to close loopholes that let reckless drivers dodge accountability. The bill gives the city sharper teeth to catch those who hide from the law. Vulnerable road users—kids, walkers, cyclists—stand to benefit as the city cracks down on plate cheats and speeds near schools.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The letter called the block a 'missing link in Brooklyn’s protected bike lane network.' Brooklyn Community Board 2 backed the demand.
