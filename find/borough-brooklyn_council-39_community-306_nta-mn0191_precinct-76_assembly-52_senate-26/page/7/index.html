It would amend the state’s climate law, forcing transportation officials to align highway projects with the goal of fewer car trips. Gounardes warns, 'If we’re just going to use that money to double down on the transportation of the past, on just purely automobile usage, we’re making a great mistake.' Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance says the bill is about shifting priorities to climate and equity. Advocates note that over 90 percent of recent infrastructure funds went to roads, not transit. The measure would require revisions or offsets for projects that don’t cut driving. Gov. Hochul’s office declined comment.

The report states, 'a quarter of residents across the Empire State live within half a mile of a distribution center that’s at least 50,000 square feet, disproportionately harming Black and Latino communities.' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, representing the affected Brooklyn neighborhoods, calls for urgent action 'for the sake of our climate and the safety of our streets.' Assembly Member Marcela Mitaynes, whose district sees the most daily truck traffic, urges colleagues to pass the Act. Advocates like Kevin Garcia say the bill is 'key legislation to protect frontline communities from increased vehicular traffic and tailpipe emissions.' The Act would require emissions reviews, pollution minimization, and studies of low-emission zones in hotspots.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Juan Restrepo of Transportation Alternatives calls for reducing car dependency.
