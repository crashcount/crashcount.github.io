The city had canceled a planned busway after pushback from business owners and Council Member Oswald Feliz, who remains a vocal critic.

MTA CEO Janno Lieber stressed, "We can't deemphasize and under-prioritize the lives of people of the Bronx and also Upper Manhattan who are trying to get east and west across this incredibly busy corridor." DOT spokesperson Vin Barone described a new proposal with dedicated curbside loading and minimal traffic diversions. The city’s earlier pledge for 20 new miles of bus lanes per year has not been met. Eighty-five thousand daily bus riders, many vulnerable, remain at risk on slow, crowded streets.

They propose a credit system to balance costs between DOT bridges and MTA tunnels, aiming to protect neighborhoods like the Brooklyn waterfront and the BQE corridor from traffic surges. The MTA declined comment. The Board will soon set final toll rates and rules. The federal government has approved the congestion pricing plan, with tolls for cars expected between $9 and $23. Over 100 exemption requests, including from taxi and for-hire vehicle drivers, are under review.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon criticized the plan for increasing traffic and pollution near homes, urging a new approach: 'They need to go back to the drawing board.' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes called out the reliance on old infrastructure, saying, 'The proposals should not be doubling down on the infrastructure and transportation of the past.' Former DOT Commissioner Hank Gutman said, 'They don't improve safety, they don't improve traffic, and they certainly don't improve any of the surrounding communities.'

Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On June 29, 2023, a report surfaced in Streetsblog NYC detailing the debate over MTA congestion pricing. The report, titled "New Jersey May See Red over Congestion Pricing, but Garden State Gets Plenty of MTA Green," highlights that from 2014 to 2022, the MTA paid New Jersey companies $3.3 billion for goods and services. The plan, set to raise $15 billion for the MTA's 2020-2024 capital plan, faces opposition from New Jersey officials, including Governor Phil Murphy, who have threatened lawsuits. The article quotes Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany: "Congestion pricing will bring in $15 billion alone for the MTA's $55 billion 2020-2024 capital plan, and New Jersey businesses stand to profit from this major increase in MTA capital spending." MTA spokesperson Eugene Resnick adds that congestion pricing will "reduce traffic, improve regional air quality, and boost the Garden State's economy." Despite the political fight, the money keeps flowing. Vulnerable road users remain at risk as the system prioritizes contracts and capital over street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move comes as injuries and deaths from SUVs surge. Lawmakers say the fees will fund safer streets. The city’s children pay the price for oversized cars.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Bill (no number cited) was introduced by Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and Senator Andrew Gounardes on June 23, 2023. The bill, now under consideration, would 'raise the existing by-weight registration fees to make them more likely to disincentivize the purchase of larger cars.' The proposal responds to a Transportation Alternatives report showing a 91% jump in injuries and a 75% rise in fatalities from large vehicle crashes between 2016 and 2019. Mamdani, at a press conference, said, 'This is an initiative to make our streets safer for our children.' Gounardes added, 'We the public has had to bear the cost of people's decisions to drive these mini-tanks.' The bill earmarks new revenue for street safety projects, aiming to protect vulnerable road users from the growing threat of oversized vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The work, running from Beach Channel Drive to Shore Front Parkway, added porous pavement, new bike lanes, and wider pedestrian walkways. The city says the 11,000 square feet of new surface can absorb nearly 1.3 million gallons of stormwater each year. Ariola said, 'At long last, we will finally have a safe, steady, and efficient flow of traffic here, and the area is now more resilient than ever before.' The project, part of a $16.6 million investment begun in March 2021, also repaired or replaced 1,100 feet of storm sewer and added new left turn lanes. The changes give cyclists and pedestrians an easier, safer route to the Rockaway ferry terminal and boardwalk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article argues, ‘SUVs, pick-up trucks, and passenger cars should not be the benchmark by which we judge the size of other forms of transit, and the term 'micromobility' encourages us to believe that they are.’ Author Sarah Risser calls for dropping the ‘micro’ prefix, urging us to see bikes and scooters as standard, not lesser. She highlights how oversized vehicles—cars, SUVs, trucks—fuel rising deaths among pedestrians and cyclists. Risser urges language that centers human-scaled mobility and rejects car supremacy.
