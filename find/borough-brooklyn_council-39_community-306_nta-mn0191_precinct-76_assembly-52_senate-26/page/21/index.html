They reject piecemeal fixes. They call out decades of harm. The state’s refusal leaves neighborhoods exposed. The city’s hands are tied. The highway’s danger remains. Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On February 10, 2023, eighteen Brooklyn lawmakers issued a joint letter demanding New York State Department of Transportation (DOT) participate in comprehensive planning for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens. Jabari Brisport, Julia Salazar, Kristen Gonzalez, Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Members Bobby Carroll, Maritza Davila, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Emily Gallagher, Jo Anne Simon, Marcela Mitaynes, and Council Members Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Lincoln Restler. Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint. Without state action, only city-owned segments see attention. The city’s efforts are limited. The state’s inaction leaves systemic danger unaddressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, covered by brooklynpaper.com, saw Simon and other officials racing at Smith-9th Streets station to dramatize the daily struggle of straphangers. The matter focused on 'the impact of low MTA funding and long wait times.' Simon said, 'It is really critically important...for people to be able to take reliable, safe, regular, speedy-enough transit service. That’s what’s going to get people out of their cars.' State Senator Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymembers Robert Carroll and Zohran Mamdani also participated, urging Albany to boost state funding and implement congestion pricing. The lawmakers oppose fare hikes and the rider-funded model, calling for public dollars to improve frequency and reliability. No formal bill was cited, but the advocacy targets the state budget and MTA funding structure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On February 5, 2023, legislators and advocates rallied for increased MTA funding and more frequent subway service. The event, led by Assembly Members Zohran Mamdani and Robert Carroll, State Senator Andrew Gounardes, and Riders Alliance’s Betsy Plum, responded to Governor Hochul’s budget proposal. The matter: 'Advocates and legislators raced up the stairs...to press their case for Gov. Hochul to do more to fill the MTA's fiscal gap.' Hochul’s plan stabilizes finances but does not boost service or halt fare hikes. Mamdani and Gounardes called for six-minute off-peak trains and new taxes on the wealthy. Gounardes said, 'We all know that we need better service and we need more service.' The proposal remains under negotiation. No safety analyst has assessed the direct impact on vulnerable road users, but frequent, reliable transit is vital for their safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streetsblog’s coverage, criticized by City Hall and DOT, revealed that vacancies and political interference—especially from Council Members Bob Holden and Oswald Feliz—stalled projects like the Citi Bike expansion in Queens and the Fordham Road bus lane in the Bronx. DOT completed only 67% of its bus lane mandate and fell 17% short on bike lanes.

The bill extends a bus rapid transit demonstration program, using cameras to enforce bus lane rules. No safety analyst note was provided. The sponsors aim to hold vehicle owners accountable and keep bus lanes clear, a move that can reduce risk for pedestrians and bus riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Hundreds called for car-free space, protected bike lanes, and safer crossings. The plaza’s chaotic traffic traps pedestrians. The city’s paint-and-plastic fixes have failed. Residents demand bold change. The city must listen.</p><p class=mb3>On December 30, 2022, the Department of Transportation (DOT) released survey results on the future of Grand Army Plaza. The public consultation, held in November, drew 1,270 in-person responses. The DOT summarized: 'the majority of respondents were interested in options to unify the public spaces.' Council members are not directly named, but city officials like Terra Ishee, DOT Pedestrian Unit Director, acknowledged the limits of past efforts: 'We really need to bump it up and make it a full blown capital project.' Brooklyn organizer Kathy Park-Price of Transportation Alternatives said, 'After decades of car-centric planning, it's time to return Grand Army Plaza to people.' Residents’ top demands: more protected pedestrian space, protected bike lanes, and overhauled traffic operations. The DOT plans a capital project design in fall 2023. The survey shows clear public support for bold, systemic safety improvements for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident, reported by Streetsblog NYC, involved a 70-year-old man who died and a critically injured passenger. Witnesses described the SUV smashing through a concrete barrier and fence before falling onto the tracks, estimating speeds of 30 to 40 miles per hour. The NYPD initially suggested a 'medical episode' but later dropped this claim, despite a pattern of police blaming unexplained crashes on health issues. The vehicle’s license plate had 13 speeding violations since 2019, including four in the past year. No council bill or committee action is attached to this event. The case highlights systemic failures: weak enforcement against repeat reckless drivers, barriers that fail to protect, and police narratives that obscure driver responsibility.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The truck, owned by JCDecaux, had racked up 30 violations since 2017. Despite this, the driver escaped charges, and the vehicle never triggered the city’s Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program, which requires safety courses for drivers with repeated violations. The intersection had only paint and plastic flappers—ignored by drivers—until officials added some concrete barriers in the fall. Local council members had pushed for stronger protection. The DOT said it would review safety practices with JCDecaux. The 34th District has one of Brooklyn’s highest truck-related fatality rates.
