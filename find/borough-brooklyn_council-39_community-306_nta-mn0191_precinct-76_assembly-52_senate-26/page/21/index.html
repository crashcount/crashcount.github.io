The matter, described as 'Let New York City lower its own speed limits,' has strong support from the mayor, DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, and advocates like Families for Safe Streets. Restler’s action was public advocacy. The Assembly is the final hurdle; the bill is already in the governor’s and Senate’s budgets. Advocates cite a 36% drop in pedestrian deaths after the 2014 speed limit change. Families demand action to prevent more deaths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report, led by Clare Miflin of the Center for Zero Waste Design, states: 'The Vanderbilt Avenue open street in Brooklyn could become a blueprint for how the city can finally containerize its trash for collection.' The analysis found that containers could replace sidewalk trash piles, freeing up as much as 25 percent of pedestrian space. The Department of Transportation is redesigning the road, adding curb extensions and loading zones, while the Department of Sanitation considers new collection methods. The plan calls for curbside bins, reducing sidewalk obstacles for pedestrians and shifting space away from cars and trash. No council member sponsored this report, but city agencies and experts are involved. The report argues for urgent action to reclaim public space from garbage and vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The policy, described as a 'multi-billion dollar network of electric vehicle (EV) charging hubs,' claims to cut carbon emissions in half by 2030. Transportation advocates Jon Orcutt, Chris Rall, and Jaqi Cohen voiced strong opposition, warning that the plan entrenches car dependency and endangers future use of curb space for bike lanes, pedestrian plazas, or outdoor dining. Critics argue the federal grant program ignores transit riders and fails to electrify municipal fleets. As one advocate put it, 'Billions of dollars are essentially being spent to further the public’s dependence on cars with little benefit to those who cannot rely on one.' The initiative, lacking support for transit or active transportation, leaves vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, now under review, aims to raise $226 million yearly for city infrastructure. Gounardes said, "We're proposing an infrastructure fund to help pay for some of the capital costs to mitigate some of the consequences of last-mile trucking, and freight growth." The bill responds to a surge in daily package deliveries, now at 2.3 million, and forecasts of 200,000 trucks a day by 2045. Gounardes, the bill's sponsor, wants the city—not the MTA—to control the funds. City Hall has not taken a position but said it welcomes ideas to limit emissions and advance infrastructure. The bill joins other efforts to regulate last-mile delivery and warehouse placement.

The bill, still under negotiation before the April 1 deadline, does not include the $300 million sought to boost off-peak bus and subway service to every six minutes. The matter summary reads: 'Legislators in Albany have proposed a budget to fill the MTA's fiscal hole, avert a fare hike, and fund a small pilot of free buses across New York City.' Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and State Senator Andrew Gounardes pledged to keep fighting for better frequency. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber praised stable funding. Advocates like Betsy Plum criticized the omission: 'The legislature's budget ignores millions of riders stranded 12, 15, 20 minutes or more on subway platforms and at bus stops.' The budget’s failure to expand service leaves vulnerable riders waiting longer, exposed to danger and delay.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, discussed in committee, fills the funding gap and stops a fare hike. It launches a free bus pilot in low-income and commercial districts. The bill, backed by Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal, does not include the $300 million needed to run buses and subways every six minutes off-peak. The matter summary states: 'Legislators in Albany have proposed a budget to fill the MTA's fiscal hole, avert a fare hike, and fund a small pilot of free buses.' Hoylman-Sigal supported ending Madison Square Garden’s tax break to help fund transit. Advocates and lawmakers like Zohran Mamdani blasted the omission, warning that infrequent service leaves riders stranded and exposed.
