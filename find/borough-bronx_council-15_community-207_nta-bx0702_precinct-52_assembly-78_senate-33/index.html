City leaders talk of a 15 MPH cap. State law stands in the way. Critics slam the plan as toothless or unfair. Enforcement remains unclear. Riders and pedestrians face the same old risks.</p><p class=mb3>West Side Spirit reported on June 19, 2025, that New York City is considering a 15 MPH speed limit for e-bikes, but implementation faces legal and bureaucratic delays. Mayor Eric Adams said, "there’s going to be a whole rule making process to make sure that we comply and follow the laws." Critics argue the plan singles out e-bikes while ignoring faster, heavier vehicles. Ben Furans of Transportation Alternatives called it "half-baked and ill-conceived," noting that "bikes and cars sharing the same road would be subject to different speed limits and consequences." Janet Schroeder of the E-Bike Safety Alliance doubts the rule will matter without real enforcement. The NYPD already issues thousands of criminal summonses to cyclists for minor violations, raising questions about fair and effective policy. No new enforcement methods or crash data were cited.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Four new elevators will rise. Three Harlem Line stops in the Bronx will open to all. The city’s transit spine grows stronger for those left waiting longest.</p><p class=mb3>On June 18, 2025, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced a sweeping accessibility project for three Metro-North Harlem Line stations in the Bronx: Williams Bridge, Woodlawn, and Botanical Garden. According to the MTA, crews will completely rebuild Williams Bridge and Woodlawn, installing four new elevators—two at each station—to ensure full accessibility. The matter summary states: 'comprehensive renovation and accessibility project at three Metro-North Railroad Harlem Line stations in the Bronx.' Christian Murray reported the announcement. No council bill number or committee applies, as this is an agency initiative, not legislation. The upgrades promise to open transit to riders long shut out by stairs and barriers. Improving station accessibility encourages more walking and cycling to transit, supports mode shift away from driving, and benefits vulnerable users by making the built environment more inclusive and safer.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article notes the police are investigating if officers left the scene without reporting the crash. The incident came three months after NYPD restricted car chases for low-level offenses. Commissioner Tisch said, “Our officers deserve clear guidance and smart protocols when determining whether to engage in a vehicle pursuit on our streets.” The pursuit was reportedly justified under new policy, which still allows chases for serious crimes. The fatal fire highlights the ongoing risks of police pursuits and questions the effectiveness of recent reforms.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The driver crashed at Dyckman St., and the car caught fire. The officers 'fled the scene, leaving him to die in the fiery wreck,' then returned to their Bronx precinct without reporting the crash. Surveillance footage showed their patrol car leaving. The NYPD suspended both officers and launched an investigation. This comes after new pursuit policies were enacted in February, restricting chases to felony or violent misdemeanor cases. The guidelines aimed to curb 'unnecessary police pursuits that lead to crashes and injure other motorists and pedestrians.' The incident raises questions about adherence to these policies and the risks of police chases in dense urban areas.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
