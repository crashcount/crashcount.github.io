MTA officials defend the investment, citing improved reliability and safety with the new R211 cars. No independent safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez opposed the measure, stating, 'The administration already has the tools to enforce against illegal [cycling] behaviors; a license plate is not necessary for enforcement.' Rodriguez cited data: 105 pedestrians killed by cars this year, versus six by e-bikes, mopeds, and scooters combined. He argued that street redesigns, not new bureaucracy, cut deaths and injuries. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams echoed this, noting that registration backers often resist proven safety fixes like protected bike lanes. Rodriguez warned the bill would waste $19 million and slow adoption of sustainable transport.

Holden (District 30). The bill would require all electric bikes, scooters, and similar micromobility devices to be licensed and registered. The committee reviewed the proposal, which aims to regulate these vehicles and address their growing presence. The bill summary states: 'A bill requiring electric bikes, scooters, and other motorized vehicles to have license plates and be registered.' Holden, who sponsored the bill, argued it would help identify riders and discourage hit-and-runs. Critics countered that the measure diverts attention from drivers, who cause most injuries and deaths. Danny Harris, former Transportation Alternatives director, called for a holistic safety approach, including holding delivery apps accountable. The hearing also addressed battery fire risks, with 250 lithium-ion battery fires reported this year.

The bill would force all e-bikes, including Citi Bikes, to register with the city and display license plates. The matter summary calls this a 'common sense way to address concerns about e-bike rider behavior.' Holden leads the charge, but critics, including Shabazz Stuart, call the bill 'flawed, impossible to enforce, unnecessary, and regressive.' They warn it will hit low-income and minority communities hardest, discourage e-bike use, and fail to improve safety. Stuart notes, 'Registration mandates are notoriously difficult to enforce at almost every level of government.' He argues that real safety comes from proven measures: protected bike lanes, road diets, and consistent enforcement of existing laws. The bill, he says, misses the mark and puts vulnerable road users at greater risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Shabazz Stuart, writing in Streetsblog NYC, calls the bill 'flawed, impossible to enforce, unnecessary, and will not work.' He warns it will be expensive, difficult to implement, and lead to selective policing, especially against poorer and minority communities. Stuart notes registration schemes have failed elsewhere and that police already have tools to address reckless cycling.

The plan eliminates a dangerous section where trams would have mixed with cars, reducing exposure for pedestrians and cyclists.
