The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting school bus parking on city streets overnight and on weekends,' aimed to stop school buses from parking on city streets between 5:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. on weekdays and all weekend. The measure was referred to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Sponsors included Justin L. Brannan (primary), Robert F. Holden, Joann Ariola, Sandy Nurse, and Marjorie Velázquez. The bill was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023, without a vote or enactment. School buses continue to occupy curb space overnight, leaving visibility and access issues for pedestrians and cyclists unresolved.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by Brooks-Powers, Yeger, Stevens, Hanif, Bottcher, Krishnan, and many others. The resolution was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law. The Atlantic Ticket pilot, launched in 2018, gave Southeast Queens and Brooklyn riders cheaper LIRR fares. Advocates say expanding it citywide could mean faster, safer commutes and more transit riders. The council’s action highlights the need for affordable, accessible transit—especially for neighborhoods with long, punishing commutes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Out-of-state cars, often tied to deadly crashes, skirt city rules and costs. The measure aims to crack down on scofflaws and close loopholes that endanger New Yorkers.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0091-2022 was filed by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on March 24, 2022, and closed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023. The resolution, titled 'Resolution calling upon the New York State Legislature to introduce and pass, and the Governor to sign, legislation increasing penalties on drivers who improperly register vehicles in another state,' was sponsored by Council Members Robert F. Holden, Kalman Yeger (primary), and Justin L. Brannan. The bill cites data showing out-of-state cars are involved in a growing share of city crashes, including 11,000 injuries and 62 deaths in 2021 alone. The council urges Albany to act, targeting drivers who dodge taxes, fees, and insurance by registering elsewhere. The measure seeks to close enforcement gaps that let dangerous drivers slip through, shifting the burden and risk onto city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

New York lags behind other states on older driver safety rules.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0090-2022, filed at session’s end, came from the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced March 24, 2022, it urges Albany to pass S.5004. The resolution’s title: 'calling upon the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.5004, to enhance the fitness and safety requirements for certain licensed individuals.' Council Members Kalman Yeger (primary sponsor, District 44) and Robert F. Holden (co-sponsor, District 30) led the push. The bill responds to the death of Madeline Sershen, 17, killed by an 88-year-old driver who ran a red. S.5004 would require drivers to prove medical fitness with a physician’s exam after their seventh license renewal. New York’s current rules only demand a vision test every eight years, far less strict than many states. The council’s action highlights a gap in protections for pedestrians and other vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
