The driver stayed. The boy did not. A witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/boy-fatally-struck-honda-suv-driver-crown-heights-brooklyn/>saw the kid being dragged from underneath the car by a woman</a>. Blood pooled on the street. Neighbors ran for towels. They tried to stop the bleeding. They could not.</p><p>This is not rare. In the last twelve months, Crown Heights (North) saw 513 crashes. One person died. Three suffered serious injuries. Children are not spared. In the same period, 15 people under 18 were hurt. A neighbor <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-year-old-boy-killed-suv-crossing-intersection-crown-heights-brooklyn/16875804/>said this street is dangerous</a> after the crash. The numbers do not flinch. The bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>SUVs and cars do most of the harm. Since 2022, they have killed one person and injured 199 more on these streets. Trucks and buses killed one, injured 13. Motorcycles and mopeds, seven injuries. Six more injuries came from bikes. The pattern is clear. The weight of steel, the speed, the blind corners—these are not accidents. They are the result of choices.</p><h3 id=leaders-promises-and-delays>Leaders: Promises and Delays</h3><p>Council Member <a href=/council-district/36/>Chi Ossé</a> and State Senator <a href=/senate-district/20/>Zellnor Myrie</a> have backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and redesign Atlantic Avenue. But the bills sit in committee. The deaths do not wait. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so citywide. Every day of delay is another risk.</p><h3 id=act-demand-action-not-excuses>Act: Demand Action, Not Excuses</h3><p>Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand real protection for people, not cars.</p><p>The blood on the street is not an act of God. It is policy, inertia, and silence. Break it. Demand more. Do not wait for another child to die.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Attorney General Letitia James leads the suit. Mayor Eric Adams backs it. The funding loss threatens projects in Harlem, East Elmhurst, and NYCHA sites.
