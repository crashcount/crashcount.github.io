The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring the police department to report on the justification for the stop in vehicle encounter reports," demands the NYPD document every vehicle stop. Reports must include the reason for the stop, the level of offense, and demographic details, but no personal identifiers. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, Lincoln Restler (primary sponsor), Amanda Farías, and others led the charge. The law aims to expose patterns in police stops and holds officers to account. Reports go online, open to all. This is a step toward transparency, not just for drivers, but for every New Yorker who walks, rides, or waits at the curb.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure targeted blaring horns, illegal claxons, and roaring engines. It died at session’s end. No direct safety gains for people walking or biking. Noise remains. Streets stay loud.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0312-2022 was introduced on May 5, 2022, in the Committee on Public Safety. The bill aimed to amend the city’s administrative code to increase penalties for excessive noise from motor vehicles, including those under and over 10,000 pounds, and for unauthorized horns and claxons. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to increasing certain penalties for excessive noise from motor vehicles.' Council Member Sandra Ung sponsored the bill, joined by 26 co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023, and did not advance. There is no evidence the bill would have improved safety for vulnerable road users. The city’s noise problem, and its threat to livable streets, remains unresolved.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
