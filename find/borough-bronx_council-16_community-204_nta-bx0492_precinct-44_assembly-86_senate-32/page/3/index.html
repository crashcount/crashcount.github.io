Quizhpi Naranjo died at Jacobi Hospital; the girl survived. The minivan driver, 42, remained at the scene and faced no charges.

The bus crashed into the wall, leaving it hanging over the edge. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz said, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." No injuries were reported, but the crash caused structural damage and scattered debris below. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz noted, "It speaks to the importance of enforcing our parking rules because it was going around a double-parked car."

Cars must turn off; only buses and trucks allowed. The move targets slow, crowded buses. Most locals ride transit. The plan keeps parking, speeds up buses, and centers people, not cars.</p><p class=mb3>The Department of Transportation (DOT) announced a new two-way busway for East Tremont Avenue between Third Avenue and Southern Boulevard, to be installed in spring 2025. The proposal was presented to the Municipal Services Committee of Bronx Community Board 5. DOT’s plan, first floated in June 2024, restricts the 0.6-mile stretch to buses and trucks, forcing cars to turn off at the first opportunity. The matter summary notes, 'Bronx bus riders are about to get a short stretch of relief.' Council Member Oswald Feliz represents the district but has not publicly supported or opposed this project. Bronx Borough President Vanessa Gibson, however, called for better bus service, stating, 'We need better buses to move across our borough from east to west.' DOT’s outreach found most shoppers and workers use transit or walk, not drive. The agency chose not to remove parking, responding to business concerns. The busway aims to speed up the Bx36, the Bronx’s fifth-busiest bus, and serve a low-income, car-free majority.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
