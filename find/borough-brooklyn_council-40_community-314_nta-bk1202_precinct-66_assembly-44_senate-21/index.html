Council Member Kalman Yeger has <a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/nyc-greenway-plan-bike-pedestrian-city-council/>spoken out against protected bike lanes and greenway plans</a>, calling for more enforcement instead of safer streets.</p><p>The silence is loud.

Last week, a speeding driver ran a red light, killing two pedestrians. The article quotes Adams, who once called Third Avenue 'extremely intimidating' and said it 'must be at the top of our list.' Despite this, his administration 'put the brakes on a potentially life-saving road redesign,' favoring business interests. Attorney Peter Beadle notes, 'they had a plan ready to go and then it was pulled back.' The city could face legal action for failing to act despite knowing the risks, echoing a 2017 state court ruling on municipal liability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
