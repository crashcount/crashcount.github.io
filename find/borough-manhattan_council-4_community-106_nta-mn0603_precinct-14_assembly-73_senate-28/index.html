Buses and trucks are overrepresented in pedestrian harm: one pedestrian killed by a bus; trucks and buses caused 18 pedestrian injuries; SUVs and cars killed one pedestrian and injured many more. These are the city’s counts for Murray Hill–Kips Bay through Aug. 24, 2025 <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a>.</p><p>Speed is the shadow you can’t see in the numbers marked “other.” It still shows. Night hours stack injuries. The worst spikes hit 10 p.m. and 11 p.m., with 73 and 58 injuries recorded across the period. Dawn and late afternoon also hurt: 5 a.m. and 4 p.m. each saw a death in this dataset. These hours, these corners, the pattern holds <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hourly distribution</a>.</p><p>“Demand for curb space is increasing,” DOT said as it moved curb rules on the Upper West Side. More trucks. More loading. More conflict if the street stays the same <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/new-digital-parking-system-on-the-uws-implemented-in-dead-of-night-DG4954621>West Side Spirit</a>.</p><p>Three corners. One fix.</p><ul><li><strong>FDR Drive</strong> is the top hotspot here, with 121 injuries and two serious injuries. One person died here. High speed meets human bodies in breakdown lanes and on ramps. The tally is not a headline. It is a list of names no one prints <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city hotspot data</a>.</li><li><strong>East 34th Street</strong> logs 58 injuries and a serious injury. Hospital traffic. Ferries. Taxis. People walking to appointments they won’t keep if a driver looks down for a second <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>same source</a>.</li><li><strong>Lexington Avenue</strong> shows 22 injuries and a serious injury. At East 37th, a 61-year-old woman crossing with the signal suffered a head wound from the right front of a pickup’s bumper on May 16, 2025. She lived. She carries it <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash record</a>.</li></ul><p>The fixes are not poetry. They are paint, posts, and time.</p><ul><li>Daylight every corner. No parking to the crosswalk. Harden left turns on Lex and 3rd. Give walkers a head start at the light.</li><li>Keep heavy vehicles out of the mixing zone. Protected intersections where trucks turn. Freight loading off the travel lane on East 34th.</li><li>Night focus. Crashes spike after dark. Target the hours that bleed.</li></ul><p>Officials know what works — do they?</p><p>After two people were killed by a driver going more than 100 mph at Canal and Bowery, DOT said it is “taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection while developing a long-term safety redesign for the entire Canal Street corridor.” Advocates answered: “the vast majority of the corridor will remain deadly” without full redesign <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/07/chinatown-deadly-crash-safety-upgrades-canal-street>NY1</a>, <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Gothamist</a>.</p><p>On 31st Street in Astoria, as a lawsuit tried to stop bike protection, DOT said, “We stand firmly behind this project and will defend our work in court.” Electeds backed the redesign to “protect pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/08/dot-stands-by-astoria-safety-project-despite-foes-anti-bike-lawsuit>Streetsblog</a> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/20/dot-stands-by-astoria-bike-lane-plan-despite-foes-childish-outbursts>earlier coverage</a>). The city can move fast when it wants to.</p><p>Slow the cars. Stop the killers.</p><p>Albany gave New York the tool to lower speeds. The city can set <strong>20 mph</strong> on local streets and save lives. It has not done it citywide. The power is there. The clock runs <a href=../../take_action/>our call to act</a>.</p><p>Repeat speeders do oversized harm. State lawmakers advanced the <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045/A2299)</strong> to force habitual violators to install speed limiters. Senator Kristen Gonzalez voted yes in committee in June. Assembly Member Harvey Epstein co-sponsors the Assembly bill. The bill targets drivers who pile up points or camera tickets with devices that cap speed <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Senate file</a>, <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A2299&amp;term=2025">Assembly file</a>, <a href=../../take_action/>our brief</a>.</p><p>Streets here tell you what to do. FDR. 34th. Lex. Posts, paint, and policy. Then the phone calls.</p><p>Act.</p><ul><li>Take one step today to demand slower speeds and rein in repeat speeders: <a href=../../take_action/>take action</a>.</li></ul></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Russo-Lennon and others backed bus improvements, highlighting how cars choke streets and trap riders. The demonstration drew support from Council Members Erik Bottcher and Keith Powers, and city officials.
