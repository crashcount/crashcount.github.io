Cars and SUVs did most of the damage—two deaths, 102 minor injuries, 34 moderate, six serious. Trucks and buses left 11 more broken. Motorcycles and mopeds, six more. Bikes, six. The young are not spared. One child killed, 101 injured.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-what-they-havent>What Leaders Have Done—And What They Haven’t</h3><p>Council Member Amanda Farías has voted for safer truck routes, daylighting, and speed humps. She co-sponsored bills for school signs and speed reducers. She backed the SAFE Streets Act. But the carnage continues.</p><p>State Senator Nathalia Fernández voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force repeat speeders to install limiters. It is a step. But the dead do not come back. The wounded do not heal because a bill passed. No law yet has slowed the cars enough.</p><h3 id=the-call-demand-more-than-words>The Call: Demand More Than Words</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every crash is a choice made by leaders who act or do not act. Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement. Demand streets that put people first.</p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Cyclists face less risk.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0193-2024, now at the Mayor's desk, moved through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and passed the Council on May 1, 2025. The bill reads: 'requiring taxis and for-hire vehicles to display a decal warning passengers to look for cyclists when opening the door.' Lincoln Restler led as primary sponsor, joined by Jennifer Gutiérrez and a long list of co-sponsors. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law orders all taxis and for-hire vehicles to post warning decals on rear passenger doors, alerting riders to check for cyclists before opening. The Taxi and Limousine Commission will provide the signs at no cost. The measure targets dooring, a common threat to cyclists. The bill takes effect 120 days after becoming law.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
