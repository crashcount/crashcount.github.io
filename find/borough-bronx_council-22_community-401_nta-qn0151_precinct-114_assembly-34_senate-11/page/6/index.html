Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by Brooks-Powers, Yeger, Stevens, Hanif, Bottcher, Krishnan, and many others. The resolution was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law. The Atlantic Ticket pilot, launched in 2018, gave Southeast Queens and Brooklyn riders cheaper LIRR fares. Advocates say expanding it citywide could mean faster, safer commutes and more transit riders. The council’s action highlights the need for affordable, accessible transit—especially for neighborhoods with long, punishing commutes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The council points to pandemic-era staffing shortages and train cancellations that left riders stranded. The measure aims to push the MTA to close these gaps and connect more New Yorkers to jobs and opportunity.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal, discussed in Streetsblog NYC, highlights failures in the current system: 'We should have public snow removal from sidewalks. Currently, we are placing undue burdens on pedestrians, especially those who use wheelchairs, canes, or walkers, or who push strollers,' Cabán said. Levine noted, 'This is a serious challenge for disabled and elderly New Yorkers, as well as their caregivers.' Community Board 4 and pedestrian advocates echoed these concerns, citing blocked bus stops and curb ramps. The Department of Sanitation expressed readiness if given more funding. The push aims to end patchwork clearance and protect those most at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
