Every vehicle gets a pedestrian safety score. The public sees it. No more hiding danger behind steel and glass.</p><p class=mb3>Senate bill S 1675, now at the sponsorship stage, sits with the New York State Senate. Filed January 13, 2025, it aims to 'create a pedestrian safety rating system for motor vehicles which shall be posted on the department of motor vehicles' website.' Senator Andrew Gounardes leads, joined by Leroy Comrie, Michael Gianaris, Brad Hoylman-Sigal, Robert Jackson, Liz Krueger, Zellnor Myrie, Gustavo Rivera, Julia Salazar, Luis R. Sepúlveda, and Toby Ann Stavisky. The bill demands transparency. It would show the public which cars endanger walkers and which spare them. No safety analyst has yet weighed in, but the intent is clear: expose the risk, protect the vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
