Subway, bus, light rail, and ferry all on the table. Council Member Larinda Hooks backed the AirTrain and ferry. No decision. The city waits. Danger and delay remain.</p><p class=mb3>"The original plan is still the best plan. If you look at all the options, it’s the only one that doesn’t go near anybody’s house. It doesn’t go into anyone’s community. Won’t be issues with taking away parking spots, taking away a lane so there’s the most traffic. It makes the most sense for homeowners or renters or people who just live in the community." -- Larinda Hooks</p><p class=mb3>On March 27, 2022, a public consultation in Queens reviewed 14 alternatives for LaGuardia Airport transit access. The session followed Governor Hochul’s cancellation of the Willets Point AirTrain. The event, covered by the media and led by a panel including Janette Sadik-Khan, drew strong opinions. The matter summary: 'In Astoria, Queens, 14 possible transit options for connecting to LaGuardia Airport were presented at a public comment session.' Council Member Larinda Hooks (District 35) voiced support for the original AirTrain, ferry service, and other mass transit options, but opposed removing parking or traffic lanes. Hooks said, 'The original plan is still the best plan... It doesn’t go near anybody’s house.' The process continues. No final plan. Vulnerable road users still face risk as traffic and confusion persist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
