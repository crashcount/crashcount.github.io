Prosecutors allege Pena drove at 83 mph—over three times the speed limit—while drunk and high, running a red light at Northern Boulevard and 107th Street. His blood alcohol content was .156, far above the legal limit. The crash killed Justin Diaz, 23, who was driving to work. Pena had 25 prior school zone speeding tickets and was charged with manslaughter, assault, reckless driving, and more.
