Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie has <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/more-red-light-cameras-coming-to-nyc-intersections-under-newly-passed-legislation>supported red light camera expansion</a> and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/05/15/new-york-pols-push-bill-to-cut-vehicle-miles-by-20>bills to cut driving miles</a>, but in the past, he <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/mother-of-crash-victim-on-failure-of-nyc-speed-limit-bill-albany-backroom-politics-at-its-worst>blocked city control over speed limits</a>.

Call your council member. Call your state senator. Tell them: Lower the speed limit. Expand camera enforcement. Require speed-limiting devices for repeat offenders. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p><p><strong>Act now.</strong></p><p>Citywide fixes are necessary. Lower NYC’s default speed limit across the city, and require speed limiters (intelligent speed assistance) for habitual speeders. Those two moves — lower limits plus enforced tech limits for repeat offenders — would turn local pain into a citywide brake on deadly driving.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The rider went down hard. Leg shattered. Conscious, in pain. Failure to yield wrote the script. Streets let it happen.</p><p class=mb3>A pickup truck traveling south collided with a bicyclist traveling east at Crawford Ave and Boller Ave in the Bronx. The cyclist, a 54-year-old man, suffered a leg fracture and was ejected but remained conscious. According to the police report, the contributing factor was “Failure to Yield Right-of-Way.” The listed driver error—Failure to Yield—put a truck’s right front bumper into a person on a bike who was going straight. The cyclist had no safety equipment noted, but that comes after driver failure in the chain of harm. This is a crash where a larger vehicle overpowered a vulnerable road user.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The shooter, Joseph Meeks, 76, tried four credit cards before the argument escalated. ABC7 reports, "Mr. Barrie asked him to get out of the car and pay him, instead of paying him he shot him in the stomach." Meeks, with about 60 prior arrests, was charged with attempted murder. The United Federation of Taxi Drivers urged the district attorney to deny bail.
