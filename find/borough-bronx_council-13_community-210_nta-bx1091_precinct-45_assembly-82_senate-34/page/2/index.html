The bus crashed into the wall, leaving it hanging over the edge. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz said, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." No injuries were reported, but the crash caused structural damage and scattered debris below. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz noted, "It speaks to the importance of enforcing our parking rules because it was going around a double-parked car."

Rivera and his colleagues call for streets built for people, not just cars. The bill has not yet reached committee or vote. Its language is clear: every user deserves safe passage. Complete streets mean sidewalks, bike lanes, and crossings that protect the most vulnerable. This is a direct response to the daily toll of crashes.

The measure, discussed in the article 'NYC residents slapped with congestion pricing ‘surcharge’ by fed-up companies paying new toll: ‘Hochul inflation’,' has sparked backlash. Queens Councilman Robert F. Holden, representing District 30, condemned the move, stating, 'It’s no surprise that businesses will pass the Congestion Scam Tax on to consumers.' Companies like CompuVoip and Dream Events & Decor now add surcharges for customers in the zone. Holden’s criticism joins that of Bronx Councilwoman Kristy Marmorato and others, who warn of higher costs and increased gridlock. Emergency unions claim response times will suffer.

The toll stirs anger, hope, and a fight over who pays and who breathes.</p><p class=mb3>On January 3, 2025, congestion pricing (no bill number cited) will begin in Manhattan after a federal judge allowed the toll to proceed. The policy charges most drivers $9 to enter south of 60th Street during peak hours. The matter, titled 'Congestion pricing set to begin at midnight Sunday as federal judge clears path for Manhattan toll,' has drawn sharp lines. Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30, Queens) opposes the toll, warning, 'I don't know how my district is going to be impacted.' He fears more cars parking in Queens and unclear pollution risks. Council Member Kristy Marmorato (Bronx) calls it a 'cash grab.' In contrast, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez and Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas support the measure, citing cleaner air, safer streets, and transit upgrades. González-Rojas says, 'Congestion pricing isn't about penalizing anyone—it's about modernizing our transportation system and tackling climate change.' The judge ordered further study on environmental impacts, but the toll begins as scheduled.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, set to fund $15 billion in subway and rail improvements, drew fierce opposition from unions and Councilwoman Kristy Marmorato, who called it a 'cash grab' that would 'increase all costs in our daily lives.' The union for FDNY EMTs argued the toll would burden low-wage workers, but data shows 90% of commuters already use public transit. City officials, including mayoral spokesperson Liz Garcia, insisted emergency response would not suffer. The measure's summary notes that reducing car traffic will speed up emergency vehicles and protect passengers. The uproar highlights the tension between entrenched driving privileges and the urgent need to make streets safer for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Filed January 1, 2025, it seeks to 'establish a bicycle and electric scooter operator's safety manual; provide for the issuance of a license for residents who successfully read and comprehend the operator's safety manual; require residents who operate an electric scooter in New York City to have a license to operate such devices; require instruction in electric scooter safety as part of the drivers pre-licensing course; require liability insurance for electric scooters in cities having a population of one million or more; prohibit the sale of an electric scooter to a purchaser unless the purchaser has a license to operate the electric scooter and has insurance in a city having a population of one million or more.' Assemblymember John Zaccaro Jr. leads sponsorship, joined by Rebecca Seawright, Michael Benedetto, Deborah Glick, David McDonough, and Michael Novakhov.

The bill orders the DOT to brighten at least 25 stairways a year. Dark stairs mean danger. Light means fewer falls, fewer hidden threats. The push comes from a broad coalition. The goal is simple: safer steps.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0875-2024 sits in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced May 16, 2024, it commands the Department of Transportation to install pedestrian lighting on at least 25 step streets each year. The bill’s matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring the installation of pedestrian lighting on step streets.' Prime sponsor Joann Ariola leads, joined by Council Members Hanks, Ayala, Salaam, Brooks-Powers, Banks, Restler, Brannan, Ung, Gutiérrez, Louis, Hudson, Schulman, Ossé, Krishnan, Nurse, Moya, and Marmorato. Step streets are public staircases linking streets at different heights. The bill aims to ensure these stairs are well-lit, reducing risk for walkers. Once all step streets are lit, the mandate ends. The measure targets a clear hazard: darkness on city stairs.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
