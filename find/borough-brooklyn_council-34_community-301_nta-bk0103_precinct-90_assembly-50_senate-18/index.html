The Streetsblog NYC report reads: "Our elected officials in Albany have failed the livable streets movement again." Despite support for measures like speed camera reauthorization, most bills to protect pedestrians and cyclists died in committee or never reached the floor. Assembly Member Amy Sohn and others criticized the lack of action. The only major win was extending the city’s speed camera program. A safety analyst notes: 'Failure to advance livable streets policies likely maintains the status quo, which typically prioritizes car-centric infrastructure and neglects the safety and needs of pedestrians and cyclists.' The session’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users at risk. No progress. No protection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A cyclist died at Monitor and Driggs. Children walk and bike to PS 110. The street stays dangerous. The city has not acted. Families wait. The threat of cars remains.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC reported on June 11, 2025, that parents at Public School 110 in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, are calling for a Paris-style school street to protect children. Their plan would turn Monitor Street into a cul-de-sac with a pedestrian plaza, add mid-block crossings, and close a slip lane to block cut-through traffic from the BQE. The push follows a fatal crash at Monitor and Driggs, where a driver killed 73-year-old cyclist Teddy Orzechowski. Streetsblog notes, 'Streets outside schools have higher crash and injury rates than the city average.' Most PS 110 families walk or bike, but the city has not responded to the proposal. The article highlights the persistent risk from drivers using local streets as shortcuts.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring micromobility share system operators to display rules of the road for safe operation," requires all bike and scooter share operators to show city and state road rules on their apps and at every station. Users must review these rules at least once a year before unlocking a device. Operators cannot charge for the time spent reviewing. Council Members Selvena N. Brooks-Powers (primary sponsor), Shahana K. Hanif, Gale A. Brewer, and Lincoln Restler back the measure. The bill aims to make the rules clear and visible, stripping away excuses and confusion for all riders.

Concrete islands promise safer crossings. Details remain thin. Cars may still block buses. The street could change. Pedestrians and riders wait. The city holds its breath.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC (2025-06-09) reports the Department of Transportation plans a center-running bus lane on Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn. The project aims to connect neighborhoods and calm traffic. DOT Assistant Director Dustin Khuu said the goal is a 'high performing transit priority street.' The plan includes concrete bus boarding islands and may reduce car lanes, giving more space to pedestrians and buses. However, the article notes gaps: 'DOT didn't share a block-by-block breakdown,' and curbside parking may remain, risking bus lane obstruction by double-parked vehicles. The city may physically protect the lane, but details are pending. The B41 bus, serving 28,000 daily trips, crawls at 4 mph during rush hour. The proposal highlights the need for clear enforcement and design to keep cars out of bus lanes and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Upstate politicians balked. The bill will not pass this session. Vulnerable road users remain exposed. No relief. No change. The danger rolls on.</p><p class=mb3>On June 8, 2025, the New York State Assembly Transportation Committee, chaired by William Magnarelli, blocked the Super Speeders bill. The bill, sponsored by Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, had passed the Senate Transportation Committee but stalled in the Assembly. The measure would have required drivers caught speeding six or more times in a year to install devices preventing reckless driving. The matter summary states: 'A bill that would require recidivist speeders to install a simple device to block the car from being driven recklessly will not pass this session.' Gallagher expressed frustration, warning that every delay means preventable crashes and lives lost. Safety analysts note the bill would have directly reduced risk for pedestrians and cyclists by targeting repeat dangerous drivers. Despite support from advocates and NYC DOT, the committee cited due process and enforcement concerns. The bill must be reintroduced next year. Vulnerable road users remain at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report lists 'Following Too Closely' and 'Other Vehicular' as contributing factors. One car was struck in the rear, the other damaged in front. The data points to a clear driver error: not enough space between vehicles. All those injured were inside the cars.

The city’s system failed again.</p><p class=mb3>According to the New York Post (2025-06-07), Abdulhekim Esiyok, a 23-year-old Turkish immigrant, was killed while crossing Third Avenue after Mahbub Ali, allegedly intoxicated, drove into him. Prosecutors say Ali drank for nearly six hours at three Manhattan bars, reaching a blood alcohol content of .158, almost twice the legal limit. After hitting Esiyok, Ali continued, injuring a cyclist, two more pedestrians, and crashing into a van. The family’s lawsuit cites New York’s Dram Shop Act, which holds bars liable for serving visibly drunk patrons who later cause harm. The article quotes the family’s lawyer: “The family is devastated. They’re still in disbelief.” The case highlights failures in both driver responsibility and alcohol-serving oversight.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
