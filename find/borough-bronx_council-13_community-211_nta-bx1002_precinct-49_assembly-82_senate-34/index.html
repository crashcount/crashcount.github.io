The measure extends and corrects school speed zone laws in New York City, repealing outdated provisions. Gounardes led the push, with strong support from most Senate Democrats and a split Assembly.

He struck the track bed. The train hit him. His head and wrist were injured. He now lies in critical condition. The city’s system failed to keep him safe.</p><p class=mb3>CBS New York reported on June 17, 2025, that a teenager was critically injured after falling from a 5 train at Baychester Avenue station in the Bronx. Police said the victim, aged 14 to 16, suffered head and wrist injuries after making contact with the train. The incident occurred just after 4 p.m. as the train approached the northbound platform. The MTA recently launched a campaign called 'Ride Inside, Stay Alive' and is testing barriers between subway cars to deter such incidents. According to the NYPD, at least one person has died from subway surfing this year; in 2024, six died, 15 were injured, and 229 were arrested. No driver error was involved, but the event highlights ongoing risks and the need for systemic safety improvements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
