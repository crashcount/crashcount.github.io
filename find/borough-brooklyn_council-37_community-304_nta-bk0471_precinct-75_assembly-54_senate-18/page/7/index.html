No more excuses.</p><p class=mb3>On May 2, 2022, the City Council’s Sanitation Committee, chaired by Council Member Sandy Nurse, held a hearing on the delayed implementation of commercial waste zones, a reform established by a 2019 law. The matter, titled 'Advocates Warn Against Further Delays on Commercial Waste Zones,' drew sharp criticism after the Department of Sanitation granted private carters a three-month extension to comply with new requirements. Nurse stated, 'Our communities cannot afford any more delays.' Advocates and Families for Safe Streets highlighted the deadly toll: reckless commercial haulers have killed more than two dozen people in recent years. The reform aims to cut truck traffic, reduce pollution, and require life-saving side guards on heavy trucks by 2024. Lauren Pine, a crash survivor, said, 'Commercial waste zone reform can not come fast enough.' The hearing underscored that every delay keeps vulnerable New Yorkers at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill required the Department of Transportation to identify intersections with high pedestrian crash rates and install curb extensions—prohibiting parking within 15 feet of crosswalks—at a minimum of five such intersections in each borough per year. The measure was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. Curb extensions are designed to increase pedestrian visibility and reduce deadly conflicts at crossings, directly targeting systemic dangers faced by people on foot.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Alexa Avilés led the call: "We want $3.1 billion, a little tiny fraction of the [nearly $100-billion] city budget, to make sure our streets belong to us, and to make sure New Yorkers are safe." Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers, Carlina Rivera, Lincoln Restler, Sandy Nurse, Chi Ossé, Crystal Hudson, Shekar Krishnan, and Amanda Farías joined her. Traffic fatalities rose 44 percent in the first quarter of 2022, the deadliest start since Vision Zero began.

The measure, led by Councilwoman Sandy Nurse of District 37, restores alternate side parking and funds year-round cleaning of protected bike lanes. The official summary states: 'City allocates $11 million to make streets cleaner and improve mobility.' Nurse called the move 'a welcome relief to communities that have faced an unprecedented increase in litter during the pandemic.' The investment covers new equipment and staff, including a pilot fleet of 10 Micromobility Operations Machines to sweep narrow lanes. Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine praised the smaller sweepers as 'a win for cyclists.' The funding appears in the Fiscal Year 2023 executive budget.
