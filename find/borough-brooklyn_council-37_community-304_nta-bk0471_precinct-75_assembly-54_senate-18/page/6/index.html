The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens.

Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint.

The Department of Sanitation claims it needs more time to avoid mistakes and cost spikes.

Justin Wood, an advocate, warned, 'Yet another tragic fatality involving a private sanitation truck shows the urgent need to fully implement the new commercial waste zones system.' Staff departures and unfilled positions cripple progress. Council Member Sandy Nurse lamented the loss of key leadership. The city says it remains committed, but the streets tell another story.
