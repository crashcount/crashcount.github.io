The matter, as described: “the legislature never gave her or any governor the power to do away with the traffic toll.” The brief cites the 2019 Traffic Mobility Act, arguing only the Traffic Mobility Review Board and the MTA can make such decisions. The lawmakers warn that letting the governor override the MTA would “make impossibly opaque the actual responsibility for MTA decisions.” Their action supports the MTA Board’s independence and opposes executive interference. No safety analyst has assessed the direct impact on vulnerable road users, but the legislators’ stance highlights the risk of political meddling in life-and-death street policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The gap opened when Governor Hochul halted Manhattan’s congestion pricing. The bill, discussed but not passed, would have replaced lost revenue—$1 billion a year meant for transit upgrades. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, mentioned in the debate, said, 'Our conference is reticent to commit a billion dollars annually for the next 15 years without having some understanding in place as to how we're going to deal with congestion as well.' Lawmakers could not agree on new taxes or a legislative IOU. The inaction leaves critical MTA projects—like electric buses and accessible stations—at risk.
