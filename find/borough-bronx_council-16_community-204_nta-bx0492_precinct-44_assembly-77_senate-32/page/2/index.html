She said, "If we're seeing that these stations aren't being used adequately ... is there another option, can we make the docks smaller?" The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, defended the current system. Bike-share experts like David Eddington countered that full docks signal popularity, not neglect. Citi Bike General Manager Patrick Knoth explained that point-in-time observations mislead, as ridership is strong and docks are planned based on trends. Citi Bike usage in Stevens's district rose 48 percent from 2022 to 2023, with most riders using reduced fares. The hearing highlighted the need for a comprehensive, accessible bike-share network, especially as e-bikes make hilly areas more reachable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0928-2024, introduced May 23, 2024, sits 'Laid Over in Committee' at the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill orders the Department of Transportation, with Health and Mental Hygiene, to run a pilot project testing cool pavement—materials that lower street temperatures—across at least four neighborhoods facing heat and disadvantage. The official summary reads: 'A Local Law in relation to requiring the department of transportation to conduct a pilot project on the use of cool pavement.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers leads as primary sponsor, joined by 29 co-sponsors. The bill requires DOT to report findings to the Mayor and Council. Safety analysts note no direct effect on vulnerable road users: the measure targets heat, not traffic violence. The city’s most dangerous streets remain unchanged.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
