The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the New York city charter, in relation to establishing an office of pedestrians.' Council Member Althea V. Stevens sponsored the bill, with Julie Won, Sandy Nurse, Shekar Krishnan, Lincoln Restler, and Carlina Rivera as co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote or enactment. No safety analyst note was provided. The bill’s failure means no dedicated city office for pedestrian safety.

The bill proposed 'establishing an office of active transportation and an active transportation advisory board.' Council Members Althea V. Stevens (primary sponsor), Lynn C. Schulman, Lincoln Restler, and Carlina Rivera backed the measure. The advisory board would have studied safety, complaints, and policy for cyclists, e-bike riders, and others outside cars. Eight board members would be appointed by the Council Speaker, four by the Mayor. The office would report annually and serve as a citywide liaison for active transportation users. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. No new protections for vulnerable road users resulted.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The resolution urges the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to 'expand and make permanent the Atlantic Ticket pilot in order to include Far Rockaway, and other stations along the LIRR corridor, in the fare affordability program.' Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by Brooks-Powers, Yeger, Stevens, Hanif, Bottcher, Krishnan, and many others. The resolution was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law. The Atlantic Ticket pilot, launched in 2018, gave Southeast Queens and Brooklyn riders cheaper LIRR fares. Advocates say expanding it citywide could mean faster, safer commutes and more transit riders. The council’s action highlights the need for affordable, accessible transit—especially for neighborhoods with long, punishing commutes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The resolution, introduced April 14, 2022, and filed at session's end on December 31, 2023, urges the MTA to 'adjust schedules for distant subway terminal lines to include more peak-direction rush hour trains for commuters to travel to central economic hubs.'

The bill responds to service gaps hitting outer boroughs, end-of-line stations, and transit deserts—areas where 600,000 New Yorkers live with poor transit access. The council points to pandemic-era staffing shortages and train cancellations that left riders stranded. The measure aims to push the MTA to close these gaps and connect more New Yorkers to jobs and opportunity.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill requires the NYC Department of Transportation to give extra notifications and presentations to community boards and local officials before installing or removing bike lanes or racks. The matter summary reads: 'require the NYC DOT to provide additional notifications and presentations.' Advocacy groups, including Bike New York, are preparing testimony to stall the bill before it reaches the Senate floor or Assembly Cities Committee. Critics argue the DOT already must notify community boards under the 'Fidler rule,' and that this bill would gum up the process, delaying life-saving bike infrastructure. A legislative source called the bill 'boneheaded.' Public polls show strong support for more bike lanes, with only a small minority opposed. The city is seeking to streamline—not slow—bike safety upgrades.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
