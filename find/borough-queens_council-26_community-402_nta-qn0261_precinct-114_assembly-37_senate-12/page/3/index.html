The white Toyota sedan hit an underpass near 225th Street around 3:50 a.m. Both occupants were found outside the wreck when police arrived. Investigators are unsure who was driving at the time of impact: 'Since both occupants were out of the car at the time of the crash, investigators haven't figured out who was driving, police said.' The woman died at Long Island Jewish Hospital-Valley Stream; the man was expected to survive.

The matter, titled 'MTA honcho Janno Leiber quiet on plan to fill $33B budget hole — but outside group pitches longshot taxes, fees,' was discussed after the Capital Plan Review Board rejected the MTA’s $68 billion five-year capital plan due to a lack of funding. Valdez said, 'I think that would be helpful so we can all see the details and make sure that we're allocating resources most effectively.' She pressed for transparency and input from all sides. Outside groups proposed new taxes and fees, but lawmakers and the governor have not endorsed any. Rider advocates stressed the urgent need for full funding, warning that delay means a more unreliable system for New Yorkers.

The session saw progressives sidelined as the Council prioritized car-centric bills, including Intros 103 and 104 (parking protection) and hearings on Intro 606 (e-bike registration). The Common Sense Caucus, known for opposing bike lanes and congestion pricing, led the charge. Progressive members lost key committee seats. Universal daylighting (Intro 1138) and other safety reforms stalled. Council Member Julie Won continued to push for daylighting but faced resistance. As Streetsblog reported, 'roadway safety is simply not a priority.' Advocates and former members criticized the Council for failing to hold the mayor accountable on the Streets Master Plan and for focusing on parking over safety. The Council's actions marked a retreat from previous street safety gains, leaving vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates say the report ignores proven safety gains in other cities.</p><p class=mb3>On January 18, 2025, the Department of Transportation released a report challenging the safety benefits of universal daylighting, as a City Council bill requiring it gained momentum. The report, discussed in the Transportation Committee, found higher injury rates at intersections where parking is banned, but DOT officials, including Deputy Commissioner Eric Beaton, admitted they could not prove daylighting causes more injuries. The matter summary states: 'Universal daylighting, as evidenced in DOT’s hydrant zone analysis, does not have the widespread safety benefits anticipated and may have negative effects on safety.' Councilmember Julie Won, the bill’s sponsor, argued, 'That could've been prevented with universal daylighting,' referencing children killed by traffic violence. The bill has 20 co-sponsors. Advocates and researchers, including Marcel Moran and Alex Morano, criticized the report’s lack of data and focus on negatives, noting no city has improved safety by blocking visibility. The report’s timing drew skepticism as cities like San Francisco and Hoboken have seen safety gains from daylighting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, now under council debate, follows a DOT study required by earlier council legislation. The study’s summary: 'simply removing parking or adding signage had little or even negative impact on safety, with injury rates 30% higher at intersections with only hydrant zones.' Won said, 'Daylighting must be supplemented with hardened barriers like planters and boulders.' DOT Deputy Commissioner Eric Beaton warned that sign-only daylighting can actually increase danger by letting drivers speed through wider turns. Advocates and DOT officials agree: daylighting without physical barriers fails to protect. The bill’s fate now rests with the council and the mayor’s pledge to daylight 1,000 intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter title reads: 'A Local Law in relation to the establishment of a task force to study options for making street design and infrastructure safer in consideration of increased use of electric bicycles and related collisions.' The committee laid the bill over on December 11, 2024. The task force, if created, must deliver recommendations for legislation and policy within 270 days. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, e-bike riders—remain at risk while the city studies its next move.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
