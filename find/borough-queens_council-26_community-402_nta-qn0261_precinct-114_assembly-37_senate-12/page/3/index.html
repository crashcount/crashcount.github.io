The project, part of Vision Zero, was celebrated in Council District 26 with Council Member Julie Won present and helping secure $1.5 million for future upgrades. The redesign stretches from Queens Plaza to Hillside Avenue, creating the city’s longest protected bike lane. The DOT reports a 68% drop in fatalities and a 35% reduction in injuries since 2015. The redesign adds parking-protected bike lanes, pedestrian islands, and improved signals. The next phase, funded in part by Won, will replace painted lanes with concrete, add raised medians, and increase accessibility.

The article, published October 28, 2024, details community outrage after a cyclist’s death and repeated injuries. NYPD policy says chases should end when risk outweighs reward, but enforcement fails. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program, which once forced repeat offenders into safety courses, has expired. Comptroller Brad Lander says, 'Drivers who are repeatedly caught by speed and red-light cameras currently face no consequences other than a fine in the mail. Repeat reckless drivers must be held to account.' State Senator Michael Gianaris calls for stronger penalties, including suspending registrations. The NYPD has not adopted reforms. Residents and advocates demand legislative action and transparency.

Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and State Senator Michael Gianaris are cited as proponents of fare-free buses, while Riders Alliance pushes for six-minute service.

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights.

Cyclists and pedestrians pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>The controversy centers on a planned bike lane in Queens’ District 26, championed by Councilwoman Julie Won. The city aims to connect the Pulaski and Kosciuszko bridges via Borden, Starr, and Review avenues. The project, requested by local civic groups and the community board, follows five deaths—including two cyclists—and over 170 injuries on these roads in five years. Won stated, 'We need to do everything we can to ensure we don’t lose another life to a preventable death.' Thirty-two business owners petitioned DOT to halt the project, citing truck maneuvering dangers. DOT representative Vincent Barone called the route 'a critical gap' in the bike network and promised 'much-needed safety improvements.' The plan will take up to 15 feet from Review Avenue for a two-way bike path and buffer, leaving 22 feet for traffic.

The south outer roadway, promised for foot traffic since 2021, will stay open to cars until at least winter. DOT claims closing it would cause gridlock, citing ongoing upper deck repairs. The matter, titled 'Queensboro Pedestrian Path Delayed Again—This Time Until Winter,' has drawn sharp criticism. Council Member Julie Won, who supports the path, said, 'DOT once again is choosing ... drivers over pedestrians,' and warned the delay 'will continue to endanger the nearly 10,000 pedestrians and cyclists who use the narrow shared path every day.' Advocates and local officials echo her concerns, calling the crowded conditions hazardous, especially as nights grow longer. DOT’s decision keeps vulnerable road users at risk, prioritizing car flow over safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The DOT’s summary states the project will bring 'vital bike connectivity' to areas with high injury and fatality rates for pedestrians and cyclists. Reilly Owens, CB2 transportation chair, praised the plan: 'It is nice when DOT presents something to us that's just completely wonderful.' Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives called the area unsafe: 'There's a lot of trucks and other industrial activity and no protection for cyclists.' Some local businesses oppose the project, demanding more studies, but civic leaders and advocates support it for safety and access.

Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives said, “The city has been on notice for years about this problem and it is their responsibility to provide a safe facility for walking and biking.” Crashes and injuries continued as the city prioritized car traffic, keeping the lane open to drivers during bridge rehab.

No more free rides. Lawmakers gave $12 million for better service, but not enough. Riders lose a lifeline. The city’s poorest feel the blow. Congestion pricing looms. Buses stay crowded, fares return.</p><p class=mb3>On April 21, 2024, the New York State budget ended the MTA’s fare-free bus pilot. The pilot, which began in September 2023, made one bus in each borough free. Lawmakers, including Senator Michael Gianaris, pushed to expand it to 15 lines. The budget did not include this. Instead, $12.3 million was set aside to improve bus frequency, far short of the $45 million needed for expansion. The bill’s summary states, 'The MTA's experiment in fare-less city bus service will soon end after Albany lawmakers did not reauthorize it.' Gianaris pledged to keep fighting for affordable transit. Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani called the pilot 'crucial' for working-class New Yorkers. The MTA’s Janno Lieber criticized the program. No safety analyst reviewed the impact on vulnerable road users. The loss hits riders who depend on buses most.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
