The resolution highlights gaps in service that strand working New Yorkers far from Manhattan.</p><p class=mb3>Res 0110-2022 was filed by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The resolution, introduced April 14, 2022, and filed at session's end on December 31, 2023, urges the MTA to 'adjust schedules for distant subway terminal lines to include more peak-direction rush hour trains for commuters to travel to central economic hubs.' Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by Brooks-Powers, Hanif, Bottcher, and others. The bill responds to service gaps hitting outer boroughs, end-of-line stations, and transit deserts—areas where 600,000 New Yorkers live with poor transit access. The council points to pandemic-era staffing shortages and train cancellations that left riders stranded. The measure aims to push the MTA to close these gaps and connect more New Yorkers to jobs and opportunity.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0101-2022 was introduced on March 24, 2022, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill required the Department of Transportation to place temporary priority regulatory signs—like stop or yield—at intersections within one hour of a reported inoperable traffic signal. The matter summary states, 'requiring the placement of temporary priority regulatory signs at intersections within one hour of a report of an inoperable traffic control signal.' Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary), Julie Won, Kalman Yeger, and Justin L. Brannan sponsored the bill. The session ended with the bill filed, not enacted. Analysts noted that faster signage could 'significantly reduce the risk of pedestrian injury and vehicular collisions at intersections with malfunctioning traffic control signals.' The city’s current two-hour response and 24-hour wait for alternative controls left vulnerable road users exposed. This bill tried to close that deadly gap.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The official title: 'Resolution calling upon the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to make bus and subway announcements in the four most commonly spoken languages in New York City.' Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary sponsor), Sandra Ung, Crystal Hudson, Julie Won, and Tiffany Cabán backed the measure. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst note was provided, but the intent was clear: break the language barrier, reach millions of riders, and give all New Yorkers equal warning and access on transit. The MTA still makes most announcements in English only.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation postponed converting the south outer roadway to a pedestrian-only path until December 2023, citing ongoing upper deck repairs. The matter, titled 'City punts fix for ‘treacherous’ Queensboro Bridge bike and pedestrian path by another year,' leaves cyclists and pedestrians sharing a dangerously tight path for another year. Councilmembers Julie Won and Julie Menin urged DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez to speed up the process, calling the delay a safety concern. Cycling advocate Laura Shepard criticized the city for prioritizing drivers' comfort over vulnerable road users. DOT insists repairs must finish first. The delay keeps walkers and cyclists at risk, forced to share space while cars keep most of the bridge.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Nine lanes for cars, none safe for the rest.</p><p class=mb3>On February 3, 2022, the Department of Transportation (DOT) announced a year-long delay in safety improvements for the Queensboro Bridge. The project, which would create a dedicated pedestrian path on the bridge’s south outer roadway, is now postponed until the end of 2023 due to deck fabrication issues. Council Members Julie Menin and Julie Won, responding to the delay, stated, 'At least two more years of a shared pedestrian and bike path is not the best outcome for our constituents.' Both called for a meeting with DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, who reaffirmed his commitment to the project but offered no clear reason for the holdup. Advocates and community members condemned the delay as a threat to non-car users, citing frequent crashes and near-misses on the narrow shared path. They criticized the city’s prioritization of nine car lanes over the safety of cyclists and pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
