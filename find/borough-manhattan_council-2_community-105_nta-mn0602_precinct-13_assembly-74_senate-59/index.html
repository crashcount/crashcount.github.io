The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a 65-year-old e-bike rider was struck on Second Avenue. The driver fled, leaving the man with a crushed skull.

Trucks and buses added four more. Bikes, too, played a part, with ten injuries, two of them serious. The street does not care what you drive. It only counts the bodies.</p><p>A resident said it plain: &ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>CBS New York</a>). The law is a rumor.

Assembly Member Harvey Epstein co-sponsored a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting tech. Senator Kristen Gonzalez voted yes on a law to curb repeat dangerous drivers. These are steps. They are not enough.</p><p>The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not. The street waits. The next crash is already on the calendar.</p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement. Demand streets that put people first.

A 2022 law by Council Member Carlina Rivera requires publication and annual updates; this release arrived over eight months late. The plan is "intended to connect gaps across NYC's bike and pedestrian paths." It names early action corridors and uses $7.25 million in federal funds to write corridor plans by 2028. Construction timelines are missing. Parks Commissioner Iris Rodriguez-Rosa says it maps "strengths and weaknesses." The Midtown Greenway showcase still leaves the East Side gap. Safety impact: none yet. Without implementation details, funding, or accountability, conditions do not change.
