The group—Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, Council Member Lincoln Restler, and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velázquez—called for passage of two state bills: one mandating intelligent speed assistance devices for drivers with six or more speeding tickets in a year, and 'Sammy’s Law,' which would let the City Council lower speed limits. Their statement read, 'We’re calling on the New York State legislature to pass two critical bills that would lead to fewer incidents of traffic violence.' They also urged the Department of Transportation to install raised crosswalks and daylighting at intersections, and to convert Nassau and Norman avenues to one-way streets.

They unveiled a $90-million plan to boost bus service. Adams faces accusations of incompetence and ignoring the law. Bus speeds drop. Riders wait. The mayor stalls. Streets stay dangerous for those outside cars.</p><p class=mb3>On February 9, 2024, at a legislative press conference, State Sen. Mike Gianaris and Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani announced a $90-million proposal to expand bus service and the MTA's free bus pilot. The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, became a public reckoning for Mayor Adams's transportation record. The matter: 'a proposal in Albany to increase bus service before congestion pricing begins.' Mamdani accused Adams of 'incompetence' and violating the Streets Master Plan law, which requires 30 miles of new bus lanes each year. Reporters pressed for answers on mayoral compliance. MTA CEO Janno Lieber praised Adams's past promises but noted the lack of progress. The mayor's spokesperson defended the administration, but data shows bus speeds have dropped since Adams took office. No safety analyst has formally assessed the impact, but the lack of bus lanes leaves vulnerable road users exposed to traffic danger and slow, unreliable transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Their proposal seeks $45 million in this year’s budget to boost bus frequency, with another $45 million to triple free buses citywide. The lawmakers’ push follows a successful fare-free pilot, which Mamdani says increased ridership by over 20%. Gianaris admitted, 'It should have been done sooner.' Critics argue the move is too late, as congestion pricing was approved in 2019. Some unions warn of possible driver shortages, but Mamdani insists existing buses and operators can handle the expansion. The funding proposal comes as the congestion toll faces lawsuits and could launch by mid-June.

The MTA claims fare compliance is vital, but Mamdani and union voices like JP Patafio of TWU Local 100 urge investment in service and affordability. The matter underscores the working-class reliance on buses and the stalled rollout of OMNY, which limits all-door boarding. The debate pits fare enforcement against calls for free or reduced fares, with advocates demanding progressive taxation to fund transit.

Cyclists and pedestrians have died. Drivers speed, double-park, and ignore signals. Councilwoman Cabán and others demand urgent action. DOT vows to return with a safety plan.</p><p class=mb3>On September 14, 2023, the Department of Transportation held a public street safety workshop in Astoria, Queens, following a surge in traffic violence. The event, covered on September 18, 2023, drew over 200 residents and was organized by Western Queens elected officials. The workshop addressed a 'significant increase in traffic-related deaths, including several high-profile fatalities involving cyclists and pedestrians.' Councilwoman Tiffany Cabán, State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, and Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani called the deaths preventable and demanded urgent changes. Cabán stated, 'If it saves lives, it’s worth doing.' DOT officials, including Queens Borough Commissioner Nicole Garcia and senior program manager Kyle Gorman, presented plans for 31st Avenue and collected resident feedback on dangerous driving, lack of protected bike lanes, and unsafe intersections. The DOT pledged to return with a proposal. No formal bill number or committee was cited; the event focused on immediate community engagement and systemic change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Protected bike lanes will come, but car lanes stay open during peak hours. The plan falls short of full safety measures. The road remains dangerous. Victims still count. No one is satisfied.</p><p class=mb3>On August 16, 2023, Mayor Adams announced a compromise redesign for McGuinness Boulevard, a notorious Brooklyn corridor. The Department of Transportation will install curbside protected bike lanes and reduce car lanes from two to one in each direction on most of the strip. However, north of Calyer Street, two lanes for cars will remain open during weekdays, reverting to parking lanes at night and on weekends. The plan, shaped after lobbying by business interests and mayoral adviser Ingrid Lewis-Martin, mixes two previous DOT proposals. Mayoral spokesman Charles Lutvak said, 'Traffic safety is a key priority for Mayor Adams, and we are delivering with a redesign of McGuinness Boulevard that will make this corridor safer for all road users.' Local officials, including Council Member Lincoln Restler, called it a 'critical step' but noted it lacks key safety elements. The compromise leaves gaps. Since 2021, 62 people have been injured on this stretch. The carnage continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
