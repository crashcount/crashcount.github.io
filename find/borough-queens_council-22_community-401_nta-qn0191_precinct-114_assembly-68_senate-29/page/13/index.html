The event, led by Assembly Members Zohran Mamdani and Robert Carroll, State Senator Andrew Gounardes, and Riders Alliance’s Betsy Plum, responded to Governor Hochul’s budget proposal. The matter: 'Advocates and legislators raced up the stairs...to press their case for Gov. Hochul to do more to fill the MTA's fiscal gap.' Hochul’s plan stabilizes finances but does not boost service or halt fare hikes. Mamdani and Gounardes called for six-minute off-peak trains and new taxes on the wealthy. Gounardes said, 'We all know that we need better service and we need more service.' The proposal remains under negotiation.

The city would pay $500 million more each year. MTA Chair Janno Lieber praised the plan for preserving service without cuts. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani criticized it for raising fares and failing low-income riders. Mayor Adams and Comptroller Lander objected to the city’s increased burden, calling for congestion pricing and opposing fare hikes.
