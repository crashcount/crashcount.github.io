Same ending.</p><ul><li>Two men died on Atlantic Avenue at 87th Street in daylight. The police file lists both as pedestrians, both killed, the SUV “going straight ahead” with center‑front damage. The driver survived. The record shows no crosswalk note, just two lives gone. See the city’s own file, CrashID 4801846, with times, modes, and injuries <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>in the dataset</a>.</li><li>A 23‑year‑old died on 101st Street near 103‑53 at 11:32 p.m. The city file says “Unsafe Speed.” Pavement was slippery. He was a pedestrian. Dead on scene. CrashID 4832080 is listed in the same <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>dataset</a>.</li><li>A 38‑year‑old man took a sedan to the head at Rockaway Boulevard and 86‑15 just after 4 a.m. The file marks “Unsafe Speed.” He lived, but with severe bleeding.

That split is in the city roll‑up for this area <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>here</a>. Nights bite hard. Injuries jump at 5 p.m., 7–9 a.m., and again late: 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. show the deaths. The hourly curve sits in the city file <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>here</a>.</p><p>The pattern does not hide.</p><ul><li>Contributing factors logged for this area put “other” first, but speed is carved into bodies and timestamps. The local analysis shows “unsafe speed” on fatal and severe cases, with roadway surface flagged in deaths, too. See the small‑area analysis drawn from city data <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>here</a>.</li><li>A three‑year‑old boy was hurt at Rockaway Boulevard and 84th Street. The file marks “Unsafe Speed” and “Traffic Control Disregarded.” Severe lacerations. Conscious. CrashID 4835025 is in the records <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>here</a>.</li></ul><p>Officials know what works — do they?</p><ul><li>Albany kept 24/7 school‑zone cameras alive through 2030. Some city lawmakers fought it. One Queens pol voted no; the roll call is documented <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>here</a>. Another Queens councilmember opposed camera expansion earlier while racking up dozens of violations, reported <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/09/queens-pol-voted-against-speed-cameras-and-has-27-speeding-tickets>here</a> and in a contemporaneous account <a href=https://nypost.com/2022/05/26/nyc-council-signs-off-on-24-7-speed-enforcement-cameras/>here</a>.</li><li>The state is moving a bill to force “intelligent speed assistance” on repeat violators. Senator Joe Addabbo voted yes in committee. The bill file is <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>; the votes posted on June 11 and 12, 2025, are noted <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>here</a>.</li></ul><p>A citywide fix sits on the desk.</p><ul><li>Sammy’s Law lets the city set lower limits. Our own site lays out the case and the call for a default 20 mph. Read it and pick up the phone <a href=/take_action/>here</a>.</li><li>Cameras are renewed. The worst drivers kill out of proportion. The Stop Super Speeders Act would cut them down with speed limiters. The action steps are listed <a href=/take_action/>here</a>.</li></ul><p>What to do at these corners</p><ul><li>Daylight the mouths of Atlantic Avenue at 87th and 82nd. Clear the sightlines. Harden the turns. Tie in leading pedestrian intervals. The crash files and local analysis show pedestrians hit at and near intersections and by turning and fast‑moving cars. See the city data powering this <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>here</a>.</li><li>Slow Rockaway Boulevard. The records show “Unsafe Speed” across multiple crashes, including the 4 a.m. hit listed above. Use raised crossings and enforced signals at 84th–86th. The source file is the same <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>dataset</a>.</li><li>Target night hours. The death curve spikes late. Focus enforcement and calming after dark. The hourly distribution is posted <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>here</a>.</li></ul><p>One number to carry home: <strong>four dead here since 2022</strong>. Most on foot. The state has a tool. The city has a law. Use them. Then come fix these blocks.</p><p>Take one step now. Ask the city to drop the limit to 20 mph and back speed limiters for repeat offenders. Start <a href=/take_action/>here</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The suit claims the redesign would "jeopardize" safety and hinder emergency access, despite DOT data showing 190 injuries and two deaths in the area since 2020. DOT says the project targets "unpredictable vehicle movements" and double parking, with design elements "found on streets across the city." The agency says it incorporated feedback from 90% of local businesses. The legal fight spotlights tension between safety improvements and business concerns, as the corridor ranks among Queens' most crash-prone.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The original proposal called for 2,775 homes and limited parking. Now, density drops by 27 percent.

More vehicles in bus lanes mean more risk for people walking, biking, and waiting at curbs. Danger grows where curb chaos reigns.</p><p class=mb3>Bill Int 1339-2025 sits with the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure since July 14, 2025. The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code...exempting ambulettes from certain bus lane restrictions and allowing them to double park to assist passengers,' would let ambulettes drive, stop, and double-park in bus lanes to help passengers. Council Member Julie Menin sponsors, joined by Linda Lee, Frank Morano, Eric Dinowitz, Lynn C. Schulman, Kamillah Hanks, Carlina Rivera, and Chris Banks. Allowing more vehicles to double-park and block bus lanes increases risk for pedestrians and cyclists at the curb. The city’s most vulnerable will face more conflict and less safe space.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, saw candidates who championed 'the importance of bike lanes, public transit, and open streets' win across the city. Council members Lincoln Restler, Shahana Hanif, Shekar Krishnan, Chi Oss, Crystal Hudson, and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams all prevailed on platforms supporting safer streets. Mark Levine, who called for bold highway changes, won the Comptroller race. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text is a vague statement of support for livable streets but does not describe a specific policy action or legislative change, so its direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists cannot be determined.'
