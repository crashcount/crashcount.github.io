Twenty seriously hurt.</strong> Midtown South-Flatiron-Union Square is a killing field for the unprotected. In the last twelve months, 220 people were injured in crashes here. Ten were left with wounds that will not heal. One did not make it home.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a taxi turned left and struck a pedestrian at West 30th. Four men were hurt—one with severe bleeding, another with a crushed leg. The street was quiet after, except for the sirens.</p><p>On Avenue of the Americas, a moped driver, age 20, was left semiconscious and bleeding from the head after a collision with an SUV.

The redesign took 18 feet from each side for decks and seating, adding over 4,000 square feet for people.

The matter, as reported by Streetsblog NYC, reads: 'Manhattan Community Board 6 overwhelmingly supported by a vote of 31-5 the DOT's plans to install a busway on 34th Street, passing a resolution that urged the city to prioritize its installation.' Council Members Erik Bottcher and Keith Powers, who represent the corridor, both support the measure. The resolution urges the city to prioritize the busway, which would ban through traffic by private cars between Third and Ninth avenues. Leadership from Community Boards 4 and 5 also joined the call. DOT plans to implement the busway in summer or fall 2025. According to the safety analyst, the event text does not describe a policy or legislative change relevant to pedestrian or cyclist safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

In February 2024, journalist Fazil Khan died in a Harlem apartment fire started by a charging battery; 22 others were injured. The article notes, 'Fires from unregulated e-bike batteries have already caused too much harm, including tragic loss of life.' The city’s $2 million pilot lets delivery workers exchange uncertified e-bikes and batteries for certified, UL-standard models. The program also requires a safety course. While battery-related fires rose slightly from 268 in 2023 to 277 in 2024, fatalities fell from 18 to 6.

Residents worry rerouted vehicles will jam local streets and worsen safety. Jessica Lavoie of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association warns, "diverting traffic from this critical corridor onto narrow residential streets would lead to increased congestion, safety hazards, and diminished quality of life." The Department of Transportation aims to replicate the 14th Street busway, which "reduced congestion, sped up bus travel and curbed accidents." The article highlights the ongoing struggle to balance efficient transit, tunnel access, and neighborhood safety.
