The bill, supported by NYPD and DOT, never reached a vote before Rodriguez’s term ended and has not been reassigned. The bill summary states it 'would require drivers of motor vehicles to maintain a minimum distance of three feet when overtaking a bicycle.' Rodriguez sponsored the bill. Legal experts Daniel Flanzig and Steve Vaccaro criticized the lack of enforcement and the absence of a defined safe passing law, noting that most of the country already has such protections. Flanzig called the law essential to prevent tragedies like the death of Kala Santiago, who was killed by a truck driver on Parkside Avenue. Without this law, cyclists remain at risk, and drivers rarely face consequences.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Councilmember Charles Allen (Ward 6) introduced the bill, joined in support by Christina Henderson (At-large) and Janeese Lewis George (Ward 4). Committee Chair Mary Cheh (Ward 3) acknowledged the program’s high cost—an estimated $163 million in fiscal year 2025—but called the community benefit 'more than worth it.' The bill also creates a $10 million Transit Equity fund. The measure now heads to the Committee of the Whole for further review and two rounds of voting.

The matter, reported as 'Eric Adams’ ambitious bus lane plans hit roadblock on NYC’s Fordham Road,' details how Feliz’s opposition blocks a key part of Mayor Adams’ pledge to build 20 new miles of bus lanes.

The project faced fierce opposition, with critics predicting economic ruin for local businesses. Streetsblog obtained sales tax data from the Department of Finance, showing that, after the bike lane went in, Skillman Avenue’s main commercial stretch saw a 12 percent increase in sales and a net gain of three businesses. The article states: 'The economy of Skillman Avenue grew after the city built the new lane.' Department of Transportation spokeswoman Mona Bruno praised the redesign, saying, 'It's thrilling to see the neighborhood flourish with safer and more sustainable streets.' Crash data show a 24 percent drop in crashes and a 28 percent drop in injuries after installation. The findings challenge the myth that bike lanes hurt business and highlight the safety gains for cyclists and pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, discussed at a Citizens Union breakfast, centered on the future of the Open Restaurants program. Adams said, "Outdoor dining, in my perspective, should be sidewalk. The street extensions were designed to be temporary." The City Council is currently developing legislation to allow restaurants to use parking lanes, but Adams’s comments signal resistance. Council Member Erik Bottcher countered, calling the use of road space for dining "an overall positive development." Adams’s stance ignores the reality that most city sidewalks are too narrow for sidewalk-only dining, squeezing pedestrians and limiting restaurant survival. Advocates and groups like Transportation Alternatives and Open Plans criticized her position, urging the Council to reclaim public space from cars and support vibrant, safe streets for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
