The bill, sponsored in the State Senate by Andrew Gounardes, passed in Albany and was signed by Governor Hochul in June. The measure extends the program for three years and ends the old rule that shut cameras off overnight and on weekends. The Department of Transportation has installed about 2,000 cameras in 750 school zones. The bill’s summary: 'expands the safety technology around the clock.' Gounardes said, 'Your right to speed does not supersede anyone’s rights to live on the streets safely.' Mayor Eric Adams joined advocates to celebrate, stating, 'A city that never sleeps deserves a camera system that won’t take a nap.' DOT data shows 59% of traffic deaths happened during off hours. The expansion aims to close that deadly gap.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates like Yonah Freemark, David Zipper, and Noa Banayan criticize the focus on large electric SUVs and trucks, calling them dangerous for people outside cars. Zipper says, “We’re actually inducing people to buy heavier, more dangerous electric automobiles.” The bill introduces a $3.4 billion Neighborhood Equity and Access Grant, but skips high-speed rail and transit.

The agency projects only 74% of pre-pandemic riders will return by 2024, leaving a $4 billion revenue gap through 2026. The matter summary warns, 'Without a new funding stream, the MTA faces a fiscal cliff after 2023.' MTA Chief Financial Officer Kevin Willens urged state legislators to act, saying, 'If we start working together and start solving the deficit by 2023, we can lower the fiscal cliff by a billion dollars a year.' Advocates like Rachael Fauss criticized the state's gas-tax holiday, arguing it incentivized driving over transit funding. State Comptroller Tom DiNapoli warned of looming service changes. The bill is not tied to a specific council number or committee, but the call for recurring, dedicated state revenue is clear.

The report, reviewed by the relevant state oversight committees, states: "the MTA doesn't actually have to cut service to find its footing, and instead has to get creative with service patterns and get serious with riders about what new service could look like." DiNapoli opposes service cuts and supports realigning schedules to match shifting demand, especially off-peak and weekends. MTA Chief External Relations John McCarthy echoed the need for a post-COVID plan. The report stresses that mass transit is essential for New Yorkers.

Driving falls. State fuel tax receipts show a sharp drop. Fewer cars on the road mean less danger for those on foot or bike. The link is clear. Pricing shapes streets. The numbers do not lie.</p><p class=mb3>This editorial, published July 20, 2022, by Charles Komanoff in Streetsblog NYC, examines the effect of high gas prices on driving in New York State. Komanoff, a longtime advocate for congestion pricing and carbon taxes, analyzes state motor fuel tax receipts from 2019 to 2022. He finds a 16 percent drop in fuel sales, with April 2022 showing a stark 40 percent decline compared to April 2019. The piece, titled 'High Gas Prices Are Reducing Driving!', challenges claims that Americans are immune to price signals. Komanoff writes, 'Pricing has power. Changes in the prices of goods and services affect demand for those items.' No council bill or vote is involved. The analysis underscores that fewer cars mean safer streets for vulnerable road users, though no formal safety assessment is provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Wellington Chen, executive director of the Chinatown Partnership, praised the move, calling it "healthier and safer for both shopkeepers and customers." The plan includes new plaza features and changes to nearby parking for commercial loading. The effort is part of a broader city push, with BIDs leading similar projects across New York.
