Now, the city moves to put people before traffic.</p><p class=mb3>On July 26, 2024, Council Member Lincoln Restler announced major street safety upgrades for Atlantic Avenue in District 33. The project, led by NYC DOT, brings mid-block crossings, concrete pedestrian islands, curb enhancements, and split-phase signals to one of Brooklyn’s deadliest corridors. The matter, titled 'Atlantic Avenue upgrade: Locals celebrate major safety fixes coming to dangerous corridor,' highlights years of advocacy after repeated crashes. Restler, who has long pushed for these changes, praised the progress: 'Atlantic Avenue has been extremely dangerous my whole life. I'm excited by the progress we're making in partnership with DOT to expand mid-block crossings and other smart interventions to slow down cars and advance safety in our community.' The announcement follows a deadly crash last spring and is part of the city’s Vision Zero push. Local officials and advocates say these changes mark a crucial step in ending the street’s legacy of danger and death.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

In his op-ed, Cooney wrote, 'the time for debating the merits of congestion pricing has passed,' urging the governor to convene finance, labor, and passenger representatives to find a solution. Cooney’s push comes as the MTA faces threats to station accessibility, signal upgrades, and new trains and buses. Other Albany leaders, including Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and Senate President Andrea Stewart-Cousins, have offered little response. Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger called Hochul’s move illegal. The bill or action is not numbered, but the committee involved is the Senate Transportation Committee.

The action, detailed in 'Disabled NYer’s are Victims of Gov. Hochul’s Congestion Pricing Pause,' leaves tens of thousands without access. Michelle Alcaraz and Ray Ray, both disabled New Yorkers, are forced to travel far from home or avoid transit altogether. The MTA’s $16 billion in scheduled repairs, including crucial accessibility upgrades, is now in limbo. Joe Rappaport of the Brooklyn Center for the Independence of the Disabled called on the governor and legislature to restore funding, warning that the lack of elevators treats disabled riders as 'second-class citizens.' The pause keeps stations dangerous for parents, caregivers, and the disabled.

The matter, discussed in Streetsblog, quotes Adams: “Each Council member is going to have to weigh in on how they feel it should be enacted or should not be enacted in their district.” Adams hesitated to commit to a citywide 20 mph limit, instead suggesting community-by-community decisions. Eric McClure of StreetsPAC called this approach “chaotic and dangerous,” pushing for a uniform 20 mph limit to save lives. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives urged a comprehensive, data-driven plan. State Senator Andrew Gounardes and Brad Hoylman-Sigal pressed the Council to use its new powers. The Department of Transportation clarified its limited authority.

DOT calls the corridor a Vision Zero Priority Corridor, citing 430 injuries from 2019 to 2023, including deaths and serious harm to cyclists and pedestrians. DOT's Rosy Doud said, 'We’re really seeing a need here to make some safety improvements.' Board member Kenneth Crouch supported protected lanes, while Chair Jose Altamirano pushed to limit parking loss. Delivery worker Naquan described drivers 'always trying to run me off the road.'

The change, part of the Fiscal Year 2025 budget, was championed by Council Finance Chair Justin Brannan. The bill increases access for individuals earning up to $21,837 and families of four earning $45,240. The council added $10 million in funding, bringing the total to over $100 million annually. Brannan and economist James Parrott wrote, 'By expanding the reach of Fair Fares, we can ensure that all New Yorkers—particularly those who are already struggling during a crisis of affordability—can fully participate in the economic, social, and cultural opportunities of our city.' The expansion boosts eligibility from 932,000 to just over 1 million people.

The MTA board approved the pause, forcing a $16 billion cut in capital spending. Projects delayed include modern signals, station accessibility, new trains, and electric buses. The plan, crafted by former NYC Transit President Andy Byford, aimed to fix decades of neglect. Byford said, 'The Fast Forward plan we created in 2018 is as necessary today as it was then.'

The project, pitched as a school safety upgrade, will replace painted bike lanes with a two-way protected lane, add sidewalk extensions, and close two slip lanes. DOT cited 110 injury crashes and one fatality in four years along the corridor. The redesign also includes concrete bus boarding islands and pedestrian improvements near schools and hospitals. DOT staffer Alex Ussery said, 'We’ve received some concerns from the community and various elected officials specifically regarding safety around students.' Community board attendees voiced anger over the loss of 28 parking spots, but some residents and advocates praised the safety upgrades, calling them 'desperately needed.' Installation will begin this summer and finish in the fall.

The matter title reads: 'Authorizes the city of Mt. Vernon to establish a school speed zone demonstration program; authorizes installation in no more than twenty school speed zones in such city.' Bailey and a majority of senators voted yes, while a handful opposed. The bill targets speeding near schools, a known threat to children and other vulnerable road users.

The move came late. She caved to political pressure. The toll plan is paused. The city’s streets stay clogged. Vulnerable road users remain at risk. No relief. No progress.</p><p class=mb3>On June 6, 2024, Governor Kathy Hochul reversed her support for Manhattan congestion pricing, indefinitely delaying tolls below 60th Street. The plan, once set to launch June 30, was halted after pressure from U.S. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who feared electoral fallout. The matter, described as a move to 'indefinitely delay' tolls, drew criticism for its timing and impact. Hochul’s action, punctuated by a speech echoing toll critics, left the policy in limbo. Political consultants and union leaders, including @TwuSamuelsen, noted the decision failed to win votes or resolve the issue. The MTA confirmed the program’s pause in court. With no congestion pricing, New York’s streets remain dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists. The delay means no reduction in car traffic, no new funding for transit, and no safety gains for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
