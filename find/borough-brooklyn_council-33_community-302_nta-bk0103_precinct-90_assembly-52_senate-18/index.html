Eight have been seriously hurt.</strong> The numbers do not flinch. Since 2022, South Williamsburg has seen 1,380 crashes. Most victims were walking or riding. Some were children. Some were old. The street does not care.</p><p>Last year, a 10-year-old girl was killed crossing with the signal at Franklin and Wallabout. The driver turned left in an SUV. She never made it to the other side.

The family called it loss.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the damage.</strong> Out of all pedestrian injuries and deaths, SUVs and sedans are the main cause. Trucks and buses follow. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt fewer, but the wounds are deep. Bikes are in the mix, but the numbers are small. The street is ruled by steel and speed.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h3><p>Assembly Member Emily Gallagher has pushed for change.

State Senator Julia Salazar <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">voted yes</a> to curb repeat speeders. But the law is not yet passed. The dead do not wait for Albany.</p><p>Gallagher has also fought for safer streets on McGuinness Boulevard. She <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/06/15/greenpoint-lawmaker-opposition-to-mcguinness-redesign-is-about-fear-bad-faith-and-control>called opposition</a> to the redesign &ldquo;about fear, bad faith and control&rdquo; and urged the mayor to &ldquo;stay the course&rdquo; on safety.</p><p><strong>But the pace is slow.</strong> Each week brings new crashes. Each day, another family waits for news that does not come, or comes too late.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>Enough.</strong> Call your council member. Call your assembly member. Tell them to pass the speed limiter bill. Tell them to finish the job on street redesigns. Tell them to put people before parking, before traffic, before delay. The dead cannot speak.

DOB Commissioner James Oddo said engineers are inspecting a second awning showing 'poor maintenance.' The collapse put pedestrians in harm's way.
