The pain is quiet, but it does not stop. A 13-year-old girl, neck crushed, crossing with the light at Williamsbridge and Allerton. A 45-year-old woman, head bleeding, struck by a moped on White Plains Road. A 48-year-old woman, leg shattered, hit by a truck while crossing with the signal on Wallace Avenue. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The data is public, but the grief is private.</a></p><h3 id=the-pattern-is-relentless>The Pattern Is Relentless</h3><p><strong>No one is spared.</strong> Children, elders, people just trying to cross the street.

Four new elevators will rise. Three Harlem Line stops in the Bronx will open to all. The city’s transit spine grows stronger for those left waiting longest.</p><p class=mb3>On June 18, 2025, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced a sweeping accessibility project for three Metro-North Harlem Line stations in the Bronx: Williams Bridge, Woodlawn, and Botanical Garden. According to the MTA, crews will completely rebuild Williams Bridge and Woodlawn, installing four new elevators—two at each station—to ensure full accessibility. The matter summary states: 'comprehensive renovation and accessibility project at three Metro-North Railroad Harlem Line stations in the Bronx.' Christian Murray reported the announcement. No council bill number or committee applies, as this is an agency initiative, not legislation. The upgrades promise to open transit to riders long shut out by stairs and barriers. Improving station accessibility encourages more walking and cycling to transit, supports mode shift away from driving, and benefits vulnerable users by making the built environment more inclusive and safer.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to police, Campbell was driving near Co-op City at 2 a.m. when a confrontation escalated. Aracena allegedly shot Campbell three times in the chest. The wounded Campbell drove off but lost consciousness and crashed near Givan and Palmer Avenues. He died shortly after at Jacobi Medical Center. The article states, 'Campbell was shot three times in the chest as the quarrel escalated.' This case highlights the lethal risks of armed confrontations on city streets and raises questions about gun access and road conflict escalation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The endorsement, reported by Streetsblog NYC and covered by Gersh Kuntzman, followed a review of candidate plans. StreetsPAC called Lander’s proposal 'by far the most comprehensive blueprint ... we've ever seen from a candidate for any office.' Lander promised more protected bike lanes, a citywide Bus Rapid Transit network, and using congestion pricing revenue for busways and bikeways. He pledged six-minute service on subways and buses and action on street homelessness. StreetsPAC’s endorsement signals strong support for policies that prioritize vulnerable road users. Their safety analyst noted: 'A comprehensive plan for safer streets and better public transit typically prioritizes vulnerable road users, supports mode shift, and aligns with best practices for population-level safety improvements.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
