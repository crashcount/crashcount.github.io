They walk, they bike, they take the bus.” State Assembly candidate Claire Valdez called the move “a slap in the face to millions who use public transit.” The MTA’s capital plan, including long-awaited elevator upgrades at 46 St-Bliss St and 33 St-Rawson, now hangs in the balance.

The Legislature rejected Hochul’s push for a payroll tax hike, then considered a vague $1 billion IOU for the MTA, with no funding source. Gianaris told reporters the proposal would simply promise a billion dollars for the next year’s budget, but offered no details. The bill has not been introduced or assigned to committee. Betsy Plum of the Riders Alliance warned, 'The proposal on the table will not fix the subway. A billion dollar IOU is not nearly enough money nor is it nearly secure enough to build trust and rebuild our critical infrastructure.' With no new revenue, the MTA’s ability to fund repairs and upgrades remains in doubt. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, transit riders—face continued danger as safe, reliable alternatives to driving are left unfunded.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as 'Albany pumps the brakes on MTA funding plan in rebuke of Hochul’s move to ditch congestion pricing,' left the MTA without the $1 billion annual revenue congestion pricing would have provided. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins announced the session’s close without a deal. Lawmakers including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris, State Sen. John Liu, Assemblyman Harvey Epstein, and Assemblyman Tony Simone criticized the governor’s decision and the proposed IOU bailout. Gounardes said, 'I cannot in good conscience ratify a decision that will eliminate a significant, dedicated revenue source for the MTA’s capital plan.'

The matter, described as 'lawlessness on the greenway,' has seen police ignore months of resident complaints. Won, through Chief of Staff Nick Gulotta, demanded the Parks Department install fencing and bollards to block cars. 'Council Member Won fully supports the call for the Parks Department to install fencing and bollards to prevent cars from illegally parking and driving through the Queensbridge Baby Park Greenway,' Gulotta said. The Parks Department claims to be working on a 'barricade plan' with NYCHA, but offers no timeline. The greenway, once a haven for pedestrians and cyclists, now serves as a parking lot. The NYPD and Parks Department pass blame. Vulnerable road users remain exposed. The system fails to protect them.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Michael Gianaris and Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani, seek $90 million for increased bus service and 15 more free bus routes. These measures, part of the 'Get Congestion Pricing Right' package, appear in both houses’ 'one-house' budgets as of March 12, 2024. The matter summary states: 'City buses would run more frequently under new proposals from state legislators in Albany, who included increased bus services and new fare discounts in budget proposals.' Mamdani and Gianaris led the push, citing the need for better transit before congestion pricing launches this summer. Their plan includes expanded Fair Fares, new discounts for seniors and disabled riders, and a weekly CityTicket for unlimited intracity rail travel. Advocates and lawmakers argue these steps are critical for equity and access, especially as the city prepares to charge drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street.
