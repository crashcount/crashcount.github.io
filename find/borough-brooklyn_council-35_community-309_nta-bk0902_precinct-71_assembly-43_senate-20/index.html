Since last July, <strong>233 people have been hurt in crashes</strong> in Prospect Lefferts Gardens-Wingate. Seven were left with serious wounds. No one walks away from a crushed leg or a broken skull the same. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared.</p><p>Just last March, a <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>38-year-old man was crushed by a truck</a> on East New York Avenue. In November, a <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>75-year-old woman was struck by a turning sedan</a> while crossing with the signal. In October, two men—one 38, one 77—were both left bleeding in the street after a truck turned through a crosswalk. The oldest victim was 85, hit by a pickup truck. The youngest, a child not yet grown. <strong>No one is safe.</strong></p><h2 id=the-system-fails-the-vulnerable>The System Fails the Vulnerable</h2><p><strong>Most victims are on foot.</strong> Trucks and cars do the most damage. Of the pedestrian injuries, trucks caused the worst: five serious injuries, twelve hurt in all. Cars and SUVs struck 127 people. Buses, motorcycles, bikes—each left their mark, but the big machines do the killing.</p><p>The stories repeat. A driver turns. A pedestrian crosses. The light changes. Someone does not come home. The numbers pile up, but the city moves slow. <strong>&ldquo;We started talking about a plan in 2014 and it&rsquo;s now 2025. What is going on?&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>asked Assemblymember Marcela Mitaynes</a>.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-pauses>Leadership: Promises and Pauses</h2><p>Council Member Rita Joseph co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, to clear the sightlines and save lives. The bill sits in committee. State Senator Zellnor Myrie backs bus rapid transit and protected bike lanes, but the lanes are not here yet. <strong>The road is still dangerous.</strong></p><p>The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has not done so. The city can build barriers, redesign streets, enforce the law. It has not done enough. <strong>&ldquo;We wait until someone dies. We wait until a tragedy. We wait to say, &lsquo;oh my gosh, how could this possibly have happened?&rsquo; We let this happen time and time again.&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>said State Senator Andrew Gounardes</a>.</p><h2 id=act-nowbefore-the-next-siren>Act Now—Before the Next Siren</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand action, not words.</strong></p><p>Every day the city waits, another family waits for news that will break them. The blood is on the street. The time is now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Last week, a speeding driver ran a red light, killing two pedestrians. The article quotes Adams, who once called Third Avenue 'extremely intimidating' and said it 'must be at the top of our list.' Despite this, his administration 'put the brakes on a potentially life-saving road redesign,' favoring business interests. Attorney Peter Beadle notes, 'they had a plan ready to go and then it was pulled back.' The city could face legal action for failing to act despite knowing the risks, echoing a 2017 state court ruling on municipal liability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Over 200 signed a pledge after Mayor Adams decided to strip three blocks of protection, despite city data showing the lanes made the street 'dramatically safer.' The move follows a court ruling allowing the change. City Hall claims the redesign addresses 'serious safety concerns.' Legal precedent (Turturro v. City of New York) could hold the city liable for knowingly making streets less safe. Advocates see the decision as political, not safety-driven.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
