Reporter Kirstyn Brendlen covered the findings. No council members sponsored or voted, but the review shows the casino could bring thousands of cars daily.

Wilson urges the U.S. to learn from Canada but notes political barriers. No council bill or vote is attached. The statement is too vague to assess specific safety impacts, as it does not identify which Canadian roadway laws would be implemented or how they would affect pedestrians and cyclists. Vulnerable road users remain exposed while proven fixes stall.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
