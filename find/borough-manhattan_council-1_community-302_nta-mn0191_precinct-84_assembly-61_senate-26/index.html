No council bill or committee action is attached.

The report, filed with the casino’s license bid, warns: 'The proposed Coney Island casino would likely clog local roads with heavy traffic and overwhelm public parking.' Reporter Kirstyn Brendlen covered the findings. No council members sponsored or voted, but the review shows the casino could bring thousands of cars daily. The safety analyst notes: increased car traffic and parking demand will heighten risks for pedestrians and cyclists, discourage active transportation, and undermine street safety and equity. The system tips toward drivers. The vulnerable pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
