Vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>This report, published July 14, 2022, highlights the impact of New York State’s gas tax holiday, which started June 1 and runs through year’s end. The article states: 'New York State residents continued to drive heavily despite high gas prices, with fuel consumption increasing from March to May 2022.' Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance slams the tax holiday as 'an outrageous windfall for oil profiteers' and warns it deprives New Yorkers of essential services. The article ties increased driving to sprawl and transit neglect, noting, 'Decades of sprawl planning and disinvestment in transit has made it more difficult to get around without a car—at a cost of our lungs, our bodies and our planet.' The surge in driving means more road deaths, more congestion, and more pollution. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, passengers—face greater danger as car dependency deepens.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Gounardes said, 'If you drive recklessly, you are going to be held accountable.' He stressed the lack of accountability and financial compensation for victims’ families. The bill is limited to drunk drivers for now, but Gounardes hopes to expand it to all reckless drivers who kill. Few drivers are convicted under these charges in New York City.

The proposal follows community workshops where residents demanded safer, people-first streets and dedicated loading zones. DOT will close the northern-most block of Underhill to cars, add two-way bike lanes, and install pinch-points to slow drivers. On Vanderbilt, sharrows become painted bike lanes, and new pedestrian islands and turn lanes will protect cyclists and walkers. DOT hopes to begin construction in the fall and is reviewing the neighborhood for further changes.

The project, funded by $500,000 from then-Council Member Margaret Chin, remains in the study phase, delayed by the pandemic. DOT Project Manager Jenny Leung said the city is updating conditions and planning stakeholder engagement. Community Board 1 and the Financial District Neighborhood Association (FDNA) have backed the plan since 2015 and 2016, respectively. FDNA Board Member Catherine Hughes pressed for urgency, saying, 'It's time for a pilot project now.' Business leader Jessica Lappin voiced logistical concerns. The plan envisions shared streets with 5 mph speed limits and a future pedestrian plaza. Progress is slow.

No fixes before 2023.</p><p class=mb3>On July 1, 2022, the Department of Transportation (DOT) and MTA kicked off a public process to overhaul bus service and pedestrian safety along Brooklyn’s Flatbush Avenue. The project, part of the Streets Master Plan, faces committee review and community outreach through summer and fall, with implementation not expected before 2023. DOT Director of Bus Priority Kyle Gebhart said, “Everything is on the table.” The agency’s data shows slow buses and high rates of pedestrian and cyclist injuries. The plan divides the corridor into three segments for tailored solutions, including curbside and center-running bus lanes, transit signal priority, and busways. Some business groups voiced anger over possible parking loss, but transit advocates countered that most shoppers do not drive. Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein said, “Busways are great for business, bringing more customers from more neighborhoods more efficiently and affordably.” The project’s outcome will shape safety for thousands who walk, bike, and ride.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation will present its draft plan to Brooklyn Community Board 1’s Transportation Committee on June 30. The petition, described as a call for 'wider sidewalks and a wider median, a protected bike lane, and eliminating one lane of traffic in each direction,' follows the hit-and-run death of teacher Matthew Jensen. Gallagher stated, 'Our community is speaking loud and clear: no more deaths on McGuinness.' The campaign has support from Councilmember Lincoln Restler and Borough President Antonio Reynoso. The street, a busy four-lane truck route, has seen dozens of crashes and injuries in recent years.

The Department of Sanitation will install several dozen rat-proof trash bins for building managers and superintendents to store garbage and recycling, moving bags off sidewalks and into curbside street lanes. The matter summary reads: 'Testing a rat-proof trash container... instead of on the sidewalk.' Council Member Erik Bottcher said he is 'thrilled that our district was the first to be chosen for this exciting advance,' calling it 'another important step.' The pilot takes parking space for bins, sparking complaints from drivers but clearing pedestrian paths. The city plans to expand the $1.3-million program to all five boroughs.

The bill was set to expire but now runs through July 1, 2025. The matter summary states: 'New York City is now able to operate its speed cameras 24 hours a day.' Glick, who sponsored the bill, dismissed criticism that cameras are a cash grab, saying, 'The city isn't in the car with you... If you don't want to get a ticket, don't speed.' Mayor Eric Adams called the cameras a deterrent, not a punishment. Advocates say the law will slow cars and protect pedestrians, especially children.

The bill was weakened from its original form, dropping escalating fines and stricter penalties for repeat offenders due to City Council concerns.

Swapping car trips for bike rides cuts carbon now. Active travel means cleaner air, fewer cars, safer streets. The study shows: pedal power outpaces battery power in the race against climate disaster.</p><p class=mb3>This policy analysis, released June 3, 2022, reviews global transport emissions and the impact of cycling versus electric cars. The report, titled 'Study: Cycling is 10x More Important Than Electric Cars For Reaching Net Zero,' finds that 'tackling the climate and air pollution crises requires curbing all motorised transport, particularly private cars, as quickly as possible.' No council members are named; this is a research-driven analysis, not a legislative action. The study tracked 4,000 urban residents across Europe, showing daily cyclists had 84% lower travel emissions than non-cyclists. It argues that active travel—cycling, walking, e-biking—cuts emissions faster than waiting for electric cars to replace gas vehicles. The findings highlight the urgent need to reduce car use, not just electrify it, to protect vulnerable road users and the environment.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
