Lockwood blames road markings, not the driver, saying, 'I blame it on that yellow line.' He criticizes the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) for prioritizing speed over safety, stating, 'They're there to make them faster.' Lockwood argues that traffic controls shift blame onto vulnerable users and do not guarantee safety. He supports Vision Zero and shared space designs, which slow traffic and reduce crashes.

The vehicle’s license plate had 13 speeding violations since 2019, including four in the past year. No council bill or committee action is attached to this event.

Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives added, 'The city needs to meet these goals without delay or excuse and stop leaving New Yorkers who walk, bike, and bus behind.' A City Council spokesperson blamed staff shortages and unfilled vacancies, calling the situation 'unacceptable.' The Council urged the administration to fill key roles and meet legal requirements.

No council bill or vote is attached, but the piece draws on federal data and expert analysis. It singles out SUVs as a main threat: drivers are four times more likely to strike pedestrians while turning, and children hit by SUVs are eight times more likely to die than if struck by smaller cars.

The bill awaits final passage to avoid a government shutdown. The measure aims to 'address gaps in bike lane, sidewalk, and multi-use trail networks.' Brandi Horton of Rails-to-Trails Conservancy called it 'a major victory' but stressed the need for more funding. Congress authorized up to $200 million per year, but only $45 million was delivered for 2023—less than 10 percent of what advocates requested. Projects must cost over $15 million to qualify, leaving most communities behind. A survey found $7 billion in unmet needs for active transportation. Lawmakers included $1.6 billion in transportation earmarks, but most funds still go to highways.

New York City Transit President Richard Davey explained that peak hour service would be trimmed, with modest increases in wait times, while some weekend service would expand. Transit advocates and union leaders, including Richard Davis, condemned the cuts, warning of increased rider frustration and assaults on workers. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani urged passage of bills to freeze fares and fill the MTA’s fiscal gap, stating, "We have to fix the rot at the heart of the transit system."

Under the 1975 18-b law, the state must match local funding for public transit. Instead, since 1995, Albany has counted regional transit taxes as its own share, leaving a $4.9 billion shortfall. State Comptroller Tom DiNapoli criticizes the practice: 'the state has used a portion of these resources... rather than using General Fund revenues as originally intended.' Assembly Member Amy Paulin, chair of the Corporations Committee, insists, 'we don’t have to justify funding the MTA adequately. It is very justified.' Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany calls for an end to 'raiding dedicated funds.' The governor’s office has not pledged to stop.

The study, titled "Four Ways To Build A Better Automated Enforcement Program," surveyed 1,500 U.S. adults about traffic cameras. Researchers, including Kelcie Ralph, urge cities to use data-driven camera placement, scale fines to income, and spend revenue on self-enforcing infrastructure like road narrowing. They warn against using cameras as cash cows or funding police and private contractors. The report states: "The purpose of [automated enforcement] is to improve safety, not catch unsuspecting drivers." Ralph adds, "They need to be in places with known safety risks, and it should be a data driven process." The analysis calls for shifting control to transportation departments and removing jail time for unpaid fines.
