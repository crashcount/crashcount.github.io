The Mayor’s Management Report shows only 32 protected bike lane miles and 2 bus lane miles added in fiscal year 2022—far short of the annual targets. Councilman Lincoln Restler, District 33, is quoted: “We’ve approved $904 million for better bus lanes, more pedestrian space, and protected bike lanes and now we need to pick up the pace on implementation.” Restler pledges robust oversight and accountability, pressing the Department of Transportation to deliver. The report details frustration from council members and advocates over missed deadlines, slow progress, and persistent dangers for vulnerable road users.

The lights stay on, but hope flickers.</p><p class=mb3>This report, published September 22, 2022, exposes a staffing crisis inside the New York City Department of Transportation. Nearly 20% of top agency positions are vacant. The article, titled 'Just Keeping the Lights On,' details how these gaps cripple street safety and improvement projects. Key leadership roles—chief of staff, general counsel, communications director—remain unfilled. Employees blame city hiring policies, pandemic resignations, and weak leadership from Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. One former staffer says, 'We couldn't produce anything new. We were just keeping the lights on.' Another warns, 'The agency's ability to respond to severe injuries and fatalities is also limited and slow.' Political interference and lack of expertise at the top deepen the crisis. The result: fewer bus lanes, stalled bike infrastructure, and a city where vulnerable road users face mounting danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The aim: less noise, fewer health harms. Sirens will still clear streets, but without the shriek. The city’s nights could finally quiet down.</p><p class=mb3>On September 13, 2022, Council Member Carlina Rivera, joined by Gale Brewer and seven others, sponsored a bill to mandate hi-lo, 'two-tone' sirens for emergency vehicles. The bill, discussed in committee, would cap siren volume at 90 decibels and encourage use of vibrating, low-frequency siren technology. The matter title calls for 'mandating the use of hi-lo, "two-tone" sirens by emergency response vehicles.' Brewer wrote, 'the city should mandate that emergency responders use hi-lo as their default siren and cap sirens at 90 decibels—as required by the proposed legislation—and scale up their use of vibrating siren technology.' The bill seeks to cut the health harms of constant siren noise, which studies link to hypertension and heart disease. No direct safety impact for vulnerable road users was noted.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Author Nicole A. Murray argues the true financial and social burden comes from car culture itself. The article highlights how automotive, oil, and insurance industries siphon money from the public, while political decisions—like Governor Hochul's gas tax suspension—undercut transit funding. The piece states: 'The real cash grab: the silent hands that the automotive and subsidiary industries have in our pockets—all of our pockets—every day.' Murray calls out the hypocrisy of congestion pricing opponents who ignore the needs of transit-dependent New Yorkers. No council bill number or committee is involved; this is a public statement, not legislation. The article exposes how car dependency and predatory lending practices trap working families, while public transportation offers a path to freedom and safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Lincoln Restler praised the upgrades as 'a step in the right direction.'

The health benefits for Bronx residents match those in Queens, Brooklyn, and Hudson County. Environmental justice and transportation advocates call for rapid electrification of buses and trucks, capping highways, and rigorous air monitoring to prevent new pollution hot spots.

The senator’s letter called for annual injury and fatality data, improved data collection, and efforts to prevent future deaths. He stated, 'Safety is not—and should never be—a premium feature only available to those who can afford it; it should be the default.' Blumenthal’s push follows a demonstration showing ten children hidden in a single SUV’s blind spot. The bill’s focus is on mandating front cameras, but experts and advocates warn this won’t fix the core problem: cars are too big, too tall, too deadly. As noted, 'The most effective way to reduce tragic frontover deaths is to have fewer cars in American driveways.'

The bill continues the $7,500 federal EV tax credit and adds a $4,000 credit for used EVs, but omits dedicated funding for electric transit, freight, or e-bikes. Advocates like Yonah Freemark, David Zipper, and Noa Banayan criticize the focus on large electric SUVs and trucks, calling them dangerous for people outside cars. Zipper says, “We’re actually inducing people to buy heavier, more dangerous electric automobiles.” The bill introduces a $3.4 billion Neighborhood Equity and Access Grant, but skips high-speed rail and transit. Advocates urge more action, warning that the bill leaves vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Without new state funding, service cuts or fare hikes loom. Advocates slam the gas-tax holiday for boosting driving. Riders, especially those without cars, stand to lose the most.</p><p class=mb3>This event details the MTA's looming fiscal crisis, as described in the July 26, 2022 Streetsblog NYC report. The agency projects only 74% of pre-pandemic riders will return by 2024, leaving a $4 billion revenue gap through 2026. The matter summary warns, 'Without a new funding stream, the MTA faces a fiscal cliff after 2023.' MTA Chief Financial Officer Kevin Willens urged state legislators to act, saying, 'If we start working together and start solving the deficit by 2023, we can lower the fiscal cliff by a billion dollars a year.' Advocates like Rachael Fauss criticized the state's gas-tax holiday, arguing it incentivized driving over transit funding. State Comptroller Tom DiNapoli warned of looming service changes. The bill is not tied to a specific council number or committee, but the call for recurring, dedicated state revenue is clear. Without intervention, vulnerable transit riders face reduced service and higher fares, deepening the city's transportation divide.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It’s time to stop believing and start questioning.</p><p class=mb3>This opinion piece, published July 22, 2022, by Kea Wilson in Streetsblog NYC, calls out Elon Musk’s record on transportation technology. The article, titled 'Opinion: Stop Trusting Elon Musk on Tunnels, on Teslas, on Everything,' cites damning crash data and exposes false safety claims around Tesla’s 'Full Self-Driving' feature. At least 273 crashes have been linked to the technology, contradicting Musk’s public statements. The piece urges planners and policymakers to reject Musk’s unproven solutions, including the Boring Company and Hyperloop, and instead focus on reducing vehicle miles traveled. The author warns that uncritical adoption of these technologies endangers vulnerable road users and worsens congestion and pollution. No council bill or vote is involved, but the message is clear: stop trusting tech hype that puts lives at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report, reviewed by the relevant state oversight committees, states: "the MTA doesn't actually have to cut service to find its footing, and instead has to get creative with service patterns and get serious with riders about what new service could look like." DiNapoli opposes service cuts and supports realigning schedules to match shifting demand, especially off-peak and weekends. MTA Chief External Relations John McCarthy echoed the need for a post-COVID plan. The report stresses that mass transit is essential for New Yorkers. No council members are directly involved, but the recommendations push the MTA to act. The agency’s slow response leaves vulnerable riders exposed to longer waits and increased danger on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The intersection, despite a history of crashes, has not been redesigned. No charges were filed against the driver, even though evidence suggested a failure to yield. Days earlier, Monica Chen, a pedestrian, was killed by a turning driver in Bay Ridge. Again, no charges. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and City Council Member Justin Brannan expressed outrage, stating, "We are both outraged that the epidemic of traffic violence continues and as a result, a 67 year old woman is dead."
