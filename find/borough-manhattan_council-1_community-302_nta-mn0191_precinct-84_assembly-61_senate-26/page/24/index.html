The bill, sponsored by Assembly Member Deborah Glick and State Senator Andrew Gounardes, was passed after statistics showed rising crashes and injuries near schools. The matter summary: 'The city's school zone speed cameras will now operate 24/7 year-round.' Hochul cited student deaths and the need for constant protection. Mayor Adams called the program a national model, noting, '72 percent of fatalities have been happening when the cameras were off.' The bill was weakened from its original form, dropping escalating fines and stricter penalties for repeat offenders due to City Council concerns. Glick and Gounardes pledged to push for stronger measures. A separate bill to expand red light cameras failed. The new law closes deadly loopholes but leaves enforcement gaps for repeat offenders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, described as 'crucial for providing protected access to parks and greenways,' faces criticism from activists and residents who say it lacks key connections and leaves cyclists exposed. CB11 member John Kelly, speaking personally, voiced fear for his child’s safety and called for a shift in car culture. Victor Dadras, chair of the CB11 Transportation Committee, called the plan 'a step in the right direction' but admitted it is incomplete. The committee will discuss the proposal further, with a full board vote expected in September. DOT may begin marking lanes in the fall.

Janno Lieber, MTA Chairman and CEO, said hiring is underway to address the shortage. Staten Island’s service delivery rate was 92 percent in April, compared to 97 percent citywide. The MTA’s hiring freeze and pandemic losses hit Staten Island hardest. Riders report missed work and abandoning transit.

Comptroller Brad Lander sounded the alarm, saying, 'These payouts cost over a hundred of million dollars a year, and can never account for the damage to traffic victims and their families. Traffic violence has a price NYC cannot afford.' The NYPD, Department of Sanitation, FDNY, Department of Environmental Protection, and DOT accounted for nearly all payouts.

Speaking publicly, Lieber said, "If it doesn't happen, at some point we can't award contracts that are dependent on having capital, the cash a couple of years later." The matter centers on congestion pricing, which Lieber and advocates call the largest, most environmentally beneficial funding source for the MTA. Projects at risk include the Second Avenue Subway, ADA accessibility improvements, and zero-emissions buses. Lieber opposes broad exemptions, arguing carve-outs weaken the plan. Rachel Fauss, a transit advocate, stressed, "There is no other source to fill that $15 billion hole."

Lawmakers extended and expanded New York City’s school-zone speed camera program to operate 24/7 for three more years. The bill passed, but was watered down from its original form. Other key street safety bills, including 'Sammy’s Law'—which would let NYC set its own speed limits—did not advance. Senator Andrew Gounardes called the speed camera win 'monumental,' while Senator Brad Hoylman said, 'not as much as any of us would have wanted to see, but for the first time, speed cameras are normalized.' Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives voiced disappointment over the failure of Sammy’s Law, calling it a top priority for Families for Safe Streets. Several other bills to protect pedestrians and cyclists stalled or died in committee.

Lawmakers extended New York City's school-zone speed camera program for three years, allowing 24/7 operation—a win for street safety. The bill, however, was watered down. Other measures under the 'Crash Victims Rights and Safety Act' saw mixed results: some passed, like upstate towns setting 25 mph speed limits and increased complete streets funding; others, like 'Sammy's Law' for NYC speed limits and expanded safe passing for cyclists, stalled. The matter title called the session 'historic, yet deeply disappointing.' Adams was not a sponsor but was referenced in the debate. Advocates and senators voiced frustration at the lack of progress on local speed limit control and measures against repeat reckless drivers. The session left vulnerable road users without key protections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The study tracked 4,000 urban residents across Europe, showing daily cyclists had 84% lower travel emissions than non-cyclists. It argues that active travel—cycling, walking, e-biking—cuts emissions faster than waiting for electric cars to replace gas vehicles.

Cheh, who wrote the proposal, said, 'drivers who pick these larger vehicles will now need to pay a bit more to compensate for that additional damage.'
