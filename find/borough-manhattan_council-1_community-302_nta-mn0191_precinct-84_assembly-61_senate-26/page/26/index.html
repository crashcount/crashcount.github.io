The proposal, part of the council’s response to the mayor’s $98.5 billion preliminary budget, seeks to expand protected bike lanes to 500 miles, bus lanes to 500 miles, and add 38 million feet of pedestrian space. The council’s plan also introduces 40 miles of car-free busways, a benchmark not found in the mayor’s plan or previous legislation.

The E-BIKE Act, once part of the Build Back Better Act, proposed a federal tax credit for e-bike buyers. Congress reduced the credit from $1,500 to $900 and limited eligibility, stalling progress. The article states, 'By replacing car trips, e-bikes can simultaneously lower emissions, improve street safety, and boost riders' health.' John MacArthur, a transportation program manager, notes that local and state lawmakers now lead with rebates and incentives. Council members and legislators in Vermont, Colorado, California, Washington, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Oklahoma have introduced or supported bills for e-bike rebates. Despite the momentum, no current state proposal pairs incentives with new bike infrastructure.

Adams criticized the law that forces cameras off at 10 p.m., asking, 'Who are we protecting? We're protecting the speeders?' He cited clear data showing cameras cut violations and crashes. State Senator Andrew Gounardes echoed Adams, questioning why lawmakers outside the city control local street safety. Adams admitted NYPD traffic enforcement has dropped and pledged to prioritize it. Advocates argue enforcement alone is not enough and call for street redesigns to protect pedestrians and cyclists. Traffic deaths remain high, especially when cameras are off. The push highlights a fight for local control and safer streets for all vulnerable New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
