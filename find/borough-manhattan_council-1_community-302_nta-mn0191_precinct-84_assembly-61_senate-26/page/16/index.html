The city had canceled a planned busway after pushback from business owners and Council Member Oswald Feliz, who remains a vocal critic. MTA New York City Transit President Richard Davey said, "Our hope is that we DOT stays with us and we're implementing this, hopefully, later this year." MTA CEO Janno Lieber stressed, "We can't deemphasize and under-prioritize the lives of people of the Bronx and also Upper Manhattan who are trying to get east and west across this incredibly busy corridor." DOT spokesperson Vin Barone described a new proposal with dedicated curbside loading and minimal traffic diversions. The city’s earlier pledge for 20 new miles of bus lanes per year has not been met. Eighty-five thousand daily bus riders, many vulnerable, remain at risk on slow, crowded streets.

They propose a credit system to balance costs between DOT bridges and MTA tunnels, aiming to protect neighborhoods like the Brooklyn waterfront and the BQE corridor from traffic surges. The MTA declined comment. The Board will soon set final toll rates and rules. The federal government has approved the congestion pricing plan, with tolls for cars expected between $9 and $23.

Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon criticized the plan for increasing traffic and pollution near homes, urging a new approach: 'They need to go back to the drawing board.' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes called out the reliance on old infrastructure, saying, 'The proposals should not be doubling down on the infrastructure and transportation of the past.' Former DOT Commissioner Hank Gutman said, 'They don't improve safety, they don't improve traffic, and they certainly don't improve any of the surrounding communities.'

The report, titled "New Jersey May See Red over Congestion Pricing, but Garden State Gets Plenty of MTA Green," highlights that from 2014 to 2022, the MTA paid New Jersey companies $3.3 billion for goods and services. The plan, set to raise $15 billion for the MTA's 2020-2024 capital plan, faces opposition from New Jersey officials, including Governor Phil Murphy, who have threatened lawsuits. The article quotes Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany: "Congestion pricing will bring in $15 billion alone for the MTA's $55 billion 2020-2024 capital plan, and New Jersey businesses stand to profit from this major increase in MTA capital spending." MTA spokesperson Eugene Resnick adds that congestion pricing will "reduce traffic, improve regional air quality, and boost the Garden State's economy." Despite the political fight, the money keeps flowing. Vulnerable road users remain at risk as the system prioritizes contracts and capital over street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The work, running from Beach Channel Drive to Shore Front Parkway, added porous pavement, new bike lanes, and wider pedestrian walkways. The city says the 11,000 square feet of new surface can absorb nearly 1.3 million gallons of stormwater each year. Ariola said, 'At long last, we will finally have a safe, steady, and efficient flow of traffic here, and the area is now more resilient than ever before.' The project, part of a $16.6 million investment begun in March 2021, also repaired or replaced 1,100 feet of storm sewer and added new left turn lanes.

She highlights how oversized vehicles—cars, SUVs, trucks—fuel rising deaths among pedestrians and cyclists. Risser urges language that centers human-scaled mobility and rejects car supremacy.

In a letter, Hoylman-Sigal wrote, "We urge you to create a unified payment system as expeditiously as possible." The proposal aims to remove barriers for would-be Citi Bike users and address issues like vandalized QR codes. The bill is a policy proposal, not yet in committee or up for a vote. Hoylman-Sigal’s push highlights the fractured nature of New York’s fare systems, with separate payments for subways, bikes, ferries, and regional trains. While OMNY integration could streamline access, technical and financial hurdles remain. The MTA and Cubic, OMNY’s contractor, say they are reviewing expansion opportunities.

Council Member Jen Gutierrez carried the resolution; Selvena Brooks-Powers later signed on. The bill targets corridors like Bushwick Avenue, Laurelton Parkway, and East Gun Hill Road—sites of hundreds of crashes and dozens killed or maimed since 2019. The matter summary states: 'Because people are dying and being maimed on New York's most-dangerous 25-mile-per-hour streets.' Supporters, including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, cite the science: lower speeds mean less force, fewer deaths. Research shows 20 mph zones cut crashes by 60 percent.

Council Member Hanif hosted a recent event on the issue. The committees unanimously approved the DOT proposal with conditions: more pedestrian safety, more traffic calming, and a comprehensive plan for all of Ninth Street. DOT has not set a timeline.
