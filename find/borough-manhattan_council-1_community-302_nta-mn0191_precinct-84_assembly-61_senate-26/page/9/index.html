The Streets Master Plan requires 30 new miles of bus lanes each year. In 2024, DOT delivered only 5.3 miles—just 17 percent of the legal mandate. Rodriguez claimed, “We are doing a great job,” citing national comparisons and blaming delays on community board processes and local opposition, especially around the 96th Street project. State Sen.

The matter, titled 'Here’s how New Yorkers really feel about congestion pricing,' reveals sharp divides. Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30, Queens) condemned the move, calling it a 'blatant political move and a shameless betrayal of New Yorkers.' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes backed the plan, citing needed transit upgrades. The bill’s impact on vulnerable road users was not assessed. The debate centers on funding transit versus burdening drivers.

The report states, 'A taxi struck a slowing sedan. Steel kissed steel. The airbag burst.' The collision left a 37-year-old man, identified as the driver of one of the vehicles, with crush injuries to his arm. He remained conscious at the scene, clutching his injured limb. Both vehicles were traveling north and slowing or stopping when the impact happened. The taxi sustained center front-end damage, while the sedan was hit at the center back end. The police report lists the contributing factor as 'Unspecified,' and does not cite any victim behavior as a cause.

The project, described as 'Destination: Greenways!', will expand green space, separate bike and pedestrian lanes, add lighting, and install new amenities. Brannan, a key funder and supporter, said, 'Our local parks are the lungs of our city.' The overhaul aims to improve recreational cycling, repair pothole-ridden paths, and increase accessibility.

Tire failure and steering failure contributed to the crash, causing significant damage to both vehicles’ quarter panels.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, two sedans were traveling north on the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel when they collided. The impact occurred at the left rear quarter panel of one vehicle and the right front quarter panel of the other. The crash injured a 26-year-old female passenger seated in the middle rear seat of the Toyota sedan, who sustained contusions and injuries to her knee, lower leg, and foot. The report cites tire failure and steering failure as contributing factors to the collision. Both drivers were licensed males from New York, and both vehicles were going straight ahead prior to the crash. The damage was localized to the quarter panels of both vehicles. No pedestrian or cyclist was involved, and no victim behaviors were noted as contributing factors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The proposal, described as 'a zoning initiative aiming to eliminate costly parking mandates citywide,' faces heavy opposition from council members in low-density, car-dependent districts. Progressive members like Lincoln Restler, Carlina Rivera, Tiffany Cabán, and Shahana Hanif support full removal of parking mandates. But the Council is set to weaken the bill, keeping parking minimums in many areas. This move will slash the number of new housing units and keep dangerous car volumes on city streets. Experts warn that keeping parking mandates will limit housing growth and keep neighborhoods unsafe for those outside cars. The compromise falls short of the original vision for safer, more walkable streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Carl Mahaney of StreetopiaUWS called the slow pace disappointing: “We’ve been super eager to see these changes, see what their impact is and start measuring and observing, so it’s a little disappointing.” Parking expert Donald Shoup urged the city to reinvest meter revenue locally, but DOT declined.

The project, covered in committee and public statements, is described as 'transformative for so many New Yorkers.' Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30), who represents the area, had threatened to oppose the IBX if it included street-running. After the MTA’s shift to tunneling, Holden stated, 'Addressing the biggest issue by forgoing light rail on 69th Street is crucial to earning our support.' The plan eliminates a dangerous section where trams would have mixed with cars, reducing exposure for pedestrians and cyclists. The MTA has issued a request for proposals to design the line and guide it through federal review. The $5.5 billion project’s funding remains uncertain, but the tunnel plan removes a major safety concern for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article, titled 'It’s Past Time to Daylight Every Corner in New York City,' criticizes Mayor Adams’s pledge to daylight 1,000 intersections per year as inadequate and misleading. Morano references the death of Kamari Hughes as a tragic example of the city’s failure. He writes, 'New York City should no longer be an exception when it comes to intersection safety.' Morano urges state lawmakers to enforce daylighting standards citywide, arguing that the current exemption leaves pedestrians at risk. He calls for universal daylighting, citing benefits like stormwater mitigation and safer community spaces. The piece is a direct challenge to City Hall’s slow pace and lack of legal accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

More debt means higher fares or slashed service. Riders face the threat. Congestion pricing was key. Now, the gap grows. The system’s future hangs on real funding, not empty promises.</p><p class=mb3>On October 23, 2024, State Comptroller Tom DiNapoli released a report warning the MTA against borrowing to fill massive holes in its 2020-2024 and 2025-2029 capital plans. The report, not tied to a council bill but crucial for transit policy, states: 'The MTA can't take on any more debt to fill the hole...without dramatically jacking up fares or cutting service.' DiNapoli’s analysis shows that borrowing $15 billion now, plus $13 billion more for the next plan, would force a 16 percent fare hike by 2037. He notes the MTA’s finances are already strained by weak real estate taxes and slow ridership recovery. DiNapoli opposes fare hikes and service cuts, backing congestion pricing and state support instead. He stresses that without new, reliable revenue, vulnerable riders will pay the price. The warning is clear: more debt means danger for those who depend on transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A new NBER study finds EVs only 10 percent less harmful than gas vehicles. Heavier batteries mean deadlier crashes. Smokestack pollution from charging outweighs tailpipe gains. The toll on life and air remains high.</p><p class=mb3>On October 15, 2024, researchers from Duke, Stanford, UC Berkeley, and the University of Chicago published a working paper through the National Bureau of Economic Research. The report, titled 'The Effects of 'Buy American': Electric Vehicles and the Inflation Reduction Act,' analyzes the full societal costs of electric vehicles (EVs) versus gasoline vehicles (GVs). The study finds, 'U.S. electric vehicles are only slightly less harmful to the environment and society than conventional gasoline cars.' The analysis aggregates climate damage, crash deaths, and pollution. It reveals that EVs’ heavier weight leads to more fatal crashes, and their battery production is energy-intensive. Charging EVs on carbon-heavy grids causes six times more harmful pollution than gas tailpipes. The authors conclude that, factoring in all harms, EVs are only 10 percent less damaging than GVs. The report urges policymakers to reconsider subsidies and warns that the real-world toll of cars—electric or not—remains immense.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
