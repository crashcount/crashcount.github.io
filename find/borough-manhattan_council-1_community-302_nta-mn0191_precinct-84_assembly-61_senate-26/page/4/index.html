The plan nearly doubles sidewalk widths and expands pedestrian zones, cutting space for vehicles. The redesign adds tree buffers, benches, and stormwater upgrades.

The measure passed with just two 'no' votes out of 13. The bill requires speed-limiting devices in cars of drivers with six or more camera-issued speeding tickets in a year. Streetsblog NYC reports, 'A bill that would prevent the most-reckless drivers from speeding easily moved forward on Tuesday.' Senator Andrew Gounardes sponsors the bill, emphasizing it targets the most dangerous drivers. Assembly sponsor Emily Gallagher raised concerns about cost and judicial bias, but stressed that speeding endangers everyone. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins backs the bill's safety focus. According to safety analysts, restricting repeat speeders directly tackles a major threat to pedestrians and cyclists, likely reducing crashes and making streets safer citywide.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article states: “Citi Bike's workers are backing Brad Lander for mayor while their bosses at Lyft chip in on Andrew Cuomo's PAC.” This is not a council bill, but a political endorsement. Local 320 President Edwin Aviles called Lander 'the one and only person in NYC government who has ever publicly recognized and championed safety, fair wages, and a fair Collective Bargaining Agreement.' No council member sponsored or voted on this action. The endorsement signals a push for leadership that may prioritize safer streets and better conditions for cyclists and pedestrians. According to safety analysts, this event concerns political endorsements and campaign contributions, not a policy or legislative change affecting pedestrian or cyclist safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'The vast majority of commuters in Midtown are traveling by transit and they deserve world-class, fast, and reliable buses.' The plan includes pedestrian improvements like shorter intersections and brighter crosswalks.

Data shows 21 percent of fatal pedestrian crashes in NYC involve vehicles with six or more camera tickets in the prior year. Speed limiters have been shown to reduce traffic deaths by 37 percent.
