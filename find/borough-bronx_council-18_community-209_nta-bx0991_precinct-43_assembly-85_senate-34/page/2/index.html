Council Member Lynn C. Schulman leads as primary sponsor, joined by Brooks-Powers, Farías, Louis, Riley, Williams, and Banks. The measure responds to fears that congestion pricing could shift traffic and pollution to outer boroughs, especially transit deserts.

The law, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring street resurfacing coordination,' requires the Department of Transportation to coordinate with agencies and utilities and finish resurfacing within 15 business days after milling. If DOT cannot meet the deadline, it must post a public notice and alert the community board. Council Member Diana I. Ayala sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors.

The bus crashed into the wall, leaving it hanging over the edge. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz said, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." No injuries were reported, but the crash caused structural damage and scattered debris below. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz noted, "It speaks to the importance of enforcing our parking rules because it was going around a double-parked car."

The official matter title states the law amends the city code to require DOT to consult with FDNY and notify affected firehouses before moving forward. Primary sponsor Kalman Yeger, with co-sponsors including Joann Ariola, Robert Holden, Lynn Schulman, and others, pushed the bill through. The law expands notification and comment rights for firehouses and community boards, adding new steps before any street or lane changes.

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to limiting the amount of liability coverage that the taxi and limousine commission may require for vehicles it licenses," bars the TLC from requiring more personal injury protection than state law demands. Council Member Diana I. Ayala is the primary sponsor, joined by over two dozen co-sponsors including De La Rosa, Banks, Ossé, Marte, and others. The bill was laid over by committee on February 10, 2025. The measure would take effect immediately if passed. By capping required coverage, the bill may leave crash victims with less compensation after collisions involving TLC-licensed vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled "A Local Law in relation to establishing a task force on vehicles registered out-of-state," calls for an interagency group—DOT, NYPD, Finance, plus mayoral and council appointees—to study the prevalence of out-of-state vehicle registrations in New York City. Sponsors include Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary), Robert F. Holden, Gale A. Brewer, Amanda Farías, James F. Gennaro, and Lincoln Restler. The task force has one year to investigate and report to the Mayor and Council Speaker. The bill aims to expose registration loopholes and recommend solutions, but for now, the city’s most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, passengers—remain at risk as enforcement and accountability lag.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Paint on the street. Metal overhead. Drivers warned: children cross here. The bill sits in committee. Kids walk. Cars speed. The city waits.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0714-2024 sits before the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced March 19, 2024, the bill would require the Department of Transportation to paint and install overhead school safety signs on every street with a school entrance. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to installing safety signs near schools.' Council Member Susan Zhuang leads as primary sponsor, joined by Rivera, Gennaro, Won, Hanif, Gutiérrez, Louis, Cabán, Restler, Farías, Banks, and Riley as co-sponsors. The bill aims to alert drivers to the presence of school-aged children and pedestrians. It remains in committee, with no vote or enactment date set. The measure targets a simple truth: children cross streets, drivers often do not see them. Signs alone will not stop cars, but they mark danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
