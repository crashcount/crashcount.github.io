Same ending.</p><ul><li>In March, a 23-year-old bicyclist was killed at Queens Boulevard and 63rd Drive. The data lists “traffic control disregarded” and “driver inattention.” The rider died at the scene. The SUV and sedan had front-end damage. One man on a bike did not get up. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a> shows it as CrashID 4799953.</li><li>In April, a 55-year-old motorcyclist was killed at Woodhaven Boulevard and 60 Drive. Ejected. Apparent death. Three vehicles listed. CrashID 4803498 in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a>.</li><li>In July, a 24-year-old motorcyclist died on the Long Island Expressway. Changing lanes. Ejected. Apparent death. Three vehicles. CrashID 4830329 in the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>same dataset</a>.</li></ul><p>The neighborhood count is blunt. Since 2022, Rego Park logged 826 crashes, 455 injuries, and 4 deaths. Pedestrians were hit mostly by sedans and SUVs. Bikes were hit too. That’s in the rollups in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Queens Boulevard remains a wound. It ranks near the top for injuries here. So does the LIE. Both show up in the small-area “top intersections” list pulled from <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a>.</p><p>“Two motorists were badly hurt and still have not fully recovered,” Queens DA Melinda Katz said after a wrong-way case on a Queens highway. The driver told police, “I entered the Clearview Expressway in the wrong direction because I wanted to hurt people and I felt ‘liberated’ by what I had done.” Those words live in the court record quoted by <a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY</a>.</p><p>Night after night</p><ul><li>Injuries stack up after dark. Midnight to 3 a.m. shows steady hurt. So do the rush hours at 8 a.m., 3 p.m., and 5 p.m. The hourly chart in the neighborhood data says so. It’s in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>the crash dataset</a>.</li><li>“The driver sped off without stopping. No arrests have been made,” reporters wrote of a 2:30 a.m. hit-and-run near JFK. Not Rego Park, but Queens all the same. A 52‑year‑old man died. The words are from the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/13/queens-hit-and-run-driver-kills-52-year-old-man-near-jfk-airport/>Daily News</a> and <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-in-hit-and-run-near-jfk-airport-police-say>Gothamist</a>, with time and location echoed by <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/police-investigate-hit-run-death-springfield-gardens-queens-john-kennedy-international-airport/17524816/>ABC7</a>.</li></ul><p>Three corners. One fix.</p><ul><li>Queens Boulevard at 63rd Drive. Woodhaven Boulevard at 60 Drive. The Long Island Expressway through Rego Park. They lead this map for harm. See the “top intersections” list in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</li><li>The contributing factors repeat: inattention, failure to yield, disregarded signals. The small-geo breakdown shows them. The fixes are plain: daylighting and hardened turns at the boulevards; leading pedestrian intervals at the signals; targeted nighttime enforcement at repeat hotspots. These are the patterns in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>the dataset</a>.</li></ul><p>Officials know what works — do they?</p><ul><li>City Hall already has tools that slow cars and save lives. Albany passed measures to let NYC set safer speeds. Our own “Take Action” page lays it out and cites the law: drop the default speed to 20 mph and use it citywide. Cameras already run 24/7. The piece is here: <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>.</li><li>The state is moving on the worst repeat speeders. The Senate bill S4045 advanced in June. It would force drivers with heavy points or camera tickets to install speed limiters. Sen. Joe Addabbo voted yes in committee, twice. See the votes in the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Senate record</a>.</li><li>Council Member Robert Holden co-sponsored a bill to yank city permits from drivers with obscured or defaced plates. That stops people from dodging cameras. It’s filed as <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1358-2025</a>.</li></ul><p>The dead, the hurt, the pattern</p><ul><li>In this small patch, bikes and bodies keep meeting steel. Since 2022, one bicyclist killed. Three occupants killed. Eighty‑two pedestrians injured. That split is in the mode table from <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</li><li>The curve is bad this year. Crashes are up 31% over last year to date. Injuries up 68%. Three people dead versus none last year at this point. That’s the year‑to‑date comparison in the period stats derived from <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city data</a>.</li></ul><p>What now</p><ul><li>Slow every car. <strong>Lower the default speed to 20 mph</strong> and enforce it. Back the <strong>speed limiter bill</strong> for repeat offenders. Those two moves, together, cut the worst harm. Read the cases and call your officials: <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>.</li></ul></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
