They count the dead. They add up the injured. They promise change. <strong>Sammy’s Law</strong> passed in Albany. The city can now lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit in South Richmond Hill is still higher. <strong>Speed cameras work</strong>—they cut speeding and injuries. But the law that keeps them running is always at risk of expiring. Each delay is a gamble with lives.</p><p>Local leaders have the power. They can lower the speed limit. They can demand more cameras. They can redesign streets so a child on a bike does not have to pray at every intersection. <strong>Every day they wait, the street takes another name.</strong></p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Call your council member.

Their votes keep streets exposed. Pedestrians and cyclists lose a shield. Reckless drivers win. The city’s most basic defense—rejected. The toll will be measured in blood, not words.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13 and June 17, 2025, the New York State Senate and Assembly voted on reauthorizing New York City's school zone speed camera program. The Senate passed the measure 38-21; three city senators—Stephen Chan, Andrew Lanza, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton—voted no. The Assembly passed it 110-31, with nine city lawmakers—Alec Brook-Krasny, Lester Chang, Simcha Eichenstein, Michael Novakhov, Stacey Pheffer Amato, Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Reilly, David Weprin, Kalman Yeger—opposing. The Streetsblog NYC article, 'Ye Shall Know Their Names! Meet the Dirty Dozen City Pols Who Voted Against Speed Camera Program,' quotes lawmakers dismissing speed cameras as revenue grabs or burdens. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action, so no direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists can be assessed.' Still, the votes signal disregard for proven tools that protect those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
