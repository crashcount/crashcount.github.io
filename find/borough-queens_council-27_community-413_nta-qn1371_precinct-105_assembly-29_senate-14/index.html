Minor infractions become court cases. Riders face fear, confusion, and entrapment. Streets grow hostile. Enforcement is uneven. Safety suffers. The crackdown punishes the vulnerable. City leaders question the policy.</p><p class=mb3>On May 6, 2025, Streetsblog NYC reported on the NYPD's new traffic enforcement policy targeting cyclists and e-bike riders. The policy, supported by Mayor Adams and Police Commissioner Tisch, escalates minor cycling infractions to criminal court summonses. The article, titled 'As NYPD’s Criminal Crackdown on Cyclists Expands, It Grows More Absurd: Victims,' details complaints of overzealous, inconsistent enforcement and alleged entrapment. Council Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers questioned the need for criminal court involvement, while Comptroller Brad Lander called the crackdown 'performative' and dangerous. The safety analyst notes: 'Policies that empower discretionary or punitive enforcement against cyclists can deter active transportation, increase fear and mistrust, and shift responsibility away from systemic safety improvements, ultimately undermining population-level safety for vulnerable road users.' The crackdown draws widespread criticism for endangering those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
