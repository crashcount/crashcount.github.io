The bill aims to carve out protected zones for first responders and lower speed limits in those areas. The measure passed with broad support, reflecting urgency after repeated crashes near emergency scenes.

Simon declared, 'Lowering the BAC limit from .08% to .05% is desperately needed to adequately tackle this epidemic of traffic violence.'

She argued, "DOT has a responsibility to also ensure that there also is parking, even municipal lots or garages available, as we look to share the street." Brooks-Powers claimed more parking would clear cars from bus and bike lanes. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and Executive Deputy Commissioner Paul Ochoa disagreed, stressing the need to share streets among all users. Brooks-Powers has opposed bus lane projects and a safety redesign in her own district, despite high traffic fatality rates. Her stance favors drivers, not vulnerable road users. No safety analyst has assessed the impact, but her opposition to proven safety measures puts pedestrians and cyclists at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The resolution, led by Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez, is a required step before state passage.

She said, 'Lowering speed limits works best when paired with traffic calming and street safety infrastructure.' The resolution now has 23 co-sponsors, three short of a majority. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams has not signed on. Assembly Member Linda Rosenthal sponsors the bill in Albany. Sammy’s Law is named for a child killed by a reckless driver.

Brooks-Powers said, 'Daylighting is a proven safety measure that expands sight lines at intersections, where traffic violence often seems to take place.' The Council voted 40-7. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez initially objected, citing concerns about driver speed, but supported the amended bill requiring physical barriers.

Trucks will unload at these sites. Smaller vehicles will finish deliveries. The goal: fewer trucks clogging streets, less double parking, and cleaner air. Councilmember Brooks-Powers backs sustainable change.</p><p class=mb3>On April 6, 2023, the city announced a Department of Transportation pilot program to launch up to 20 neighborhood delivery microhubs. This initiative, required by a 2021 City Council law, aims to reduce truck traffic and organize last-mile deliveries. The matter summary states: 'The city will launch a pilot program testing neighborhood delivery microhubs across the five boroughs, aimed at reducing the surge of truck traffic.' Councilmember Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, representing District 31, emphasized the need for sustainable infrastructure to curb environmental justice impacts from truck congestion. The program will allow large trucks to unload at designated hubs, shifting the final delivery leg to vans, cargo bikes, or carts. Details on locations and management are pending. After a year, DOT will review data and consider expansion, with a final report due in 2026. Environmentalists and advocates support the move but note it does not address warehouse siting in vulnerable communities.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They demand safer streets, more paving, and equity for communities hit hardest by crashes. Speaker Adams and Brooks-Powers lead the charge. City Hall resists.</p><p class=mb3>On April 4, 2023, the City Council, led by Speaker Adrienne Adams and Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, issued its budget response to the mayor’s $103-billion plan. The Council’s $2.7-billion proposal calls for a near-doubling of Fair Fares funding, $3 million for a battery swap and fire outreach program for delivery workers, and $45.1 million more for road paving. The Council also demands increased investment in street safety infrastructure, especially in communities of color facing high crash rates. Brooks-Powers said, 'New Yorkers deserve access to high-quality services and investments in infrastructure citywide.' Council Member Keith Powers called the battery swap program a 'down payment.' The Council’s push aims to restore cuts and address deadly street conditions. City Hall, citing fiscal pressures, remains cautious but open to negotiation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Assembly leaves the measure out.</p><p class=mb3>On March 31, 2023, a majority of New York City Council members signed a letter supporting Sammy’s Law, which would let the city set speed limits below 25 mph. The letter, sent to state legislative leaders, declared, "We write as a majority of New York City Council Members to express our strong support for the passage of Sammy's Law." Twenty-six council members signed on, but Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers did not. Brooks-Powers argued, "Stricter speed limits must also be paired with investments in physical infrastructure as well that deter drivers from going too fast." Advocates, including DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and Comptroller Brad Lander, rallied in support. Despite the push, the Assembly left the measure out of its budget. The bill remains stalled, leaving vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
