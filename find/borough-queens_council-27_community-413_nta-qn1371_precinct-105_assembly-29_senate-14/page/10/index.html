The matter, titled 'Everyone’s Suddenly Open To Some Congestion Pricing Exemptions,' drew sharp lines. State Senator Leroy Comrie, once a hardliner against exemptions, now listens to public input. Assembly Member Robert Carroll backs limited carve-outs, saying, 'I think that there should be limited exemptions.' State Senator Andrew Gounardes stresses, 'Obviously we want them to be as limited as possible.' Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine pushes for toll credits and taxi exemptions. Advocacy groups warn against broad carve-outs. The Traffic Mobility Review Board will decide after federal review. The debate centers on who pays and who gets a pass, while the safety of people outside cars hangs in the balance.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

An opinion from a Transportation Alternatives staffer urged the Council to 'transform impervious driving lanes into green climate solutions.' The piece calls for bioswales and greenspace in place of parking, citing the deadly floods after Hurricane Ida. It highlights that 72 percent of city land is impervious, worsening flash floods. The author presses city leaders, including Mayor Eric Adams, to repurpose street space for climate resilience, referencing the NYC 25x25 challenge.

The bill aimed to 'establish priority for sidewalk repairs at developments operated by the New York City Housing Authority,' giving first priority to senior-only NYCHA buildings, then to other NYCHA sites. Emergencies at non-NYCHA properties could override this order, with required notification to local officials. The bill required DOT to report on completed and pending NYCHA sidewalk repairs by June 30, 2023.

The proposal, discussed in the City Council’s Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, seeks to restore service on the abandoned LIRR Rockaway Beach Branch, connecting Rego Park and Ozone Park. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, committee chair, emphasized, 'Transportation equity is a major issue in our city that must be confronted.' The letter criticizes the MTA’s previous cost estimates and compares QueensLink’s need to the state-backed Interborough Express. Supporters argue that if the state can spend $1 billion widening the Van Wyck Expressway, it can fund a study for transit. The EIS would include community engagement to address local concerns. The push is clear: more transit, fewer cars, safer streets for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

State Senator Leroy Comrie, representing District 14, voted for the initial PILOT (payment in lieu of taxes) agreement but pledged not to support future deals without federal funding and approvals. The plan faces criticism from watchdogs and officials like State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli’s office, who called for a delay due to limited financial details.

Brooks-Powers, Transportation Chair, joined Councilmember Ari Kagan and DOT officials at Surf Avenue and West 37th Street. The matter: 'Surf Avenue gets new crosswalk and four-way stop sign, creating a safer intersection for seniors.' Kagan’s office led the push, with Brooks-Powers elevating the issue. Kagan said, 'It was one of the most dangerous intersections in Coney Island, not just for pedestrians but for drivers as well.' The crossing serves the Scheuer House senior facility. Community Board 13 and local groups demanded action. Brooks-Powers praised the advocacy: 'Now, your residents will be able to cross the street safely!' The intersection, once life-threatening, now offers basic protection for the city’s most vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Studies show education campaigns can backfire. DOT offered no proof this works.</p><p class=mb3>On May 3, 2022, Mayor Adams announced a $4-million public education campaign called 'Speeding Ruins Lives, Slow Down.' The effort, not tied to a council bill, was revealed as city policy. The campaign aims to cut traffic violence through billboards and media buys. The official summary states it targets driver behavior. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, chair of the Transportation Committee, acknowledged the need for infrastructure investments over media campaigns. Jessie Singer, journalist and author, called the campaign a waste, arguing the city should focus on redesigning intersections. A recent study found similar efforts in Texas increased crash risk. The Department of Transportation could not provide evidence of effectiveness. Advocates agree education matters, but stress that engineering and infrastructure are more crucial for safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
