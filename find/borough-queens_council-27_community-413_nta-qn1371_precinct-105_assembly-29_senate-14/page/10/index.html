DOT officials, including Deputy Commissioner Eric Beaton and Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, refused to provide current figures, promising data next year. Brooks-Powers called this 'unacceptable.' She stressed, 'The 30 miles of bus lane and 50 miles of bike lanes is not a goal—it’s legal mandate.' The exchange revealed ongoing tension over DOT’s slow rollout and lack of transparency. Staffing shortages and council opposition to projects were cited as obstacles.

The data, compiled by Transportation Alternatives, showed his Brooklyn district suffered the most traffic injuries citywide in the first half of 2023: 36 pedestrians, 24 cyclists, and 41 motorists. The matter summary reads, 'New York City is on pace for one of the deadliest years for bike riders in recent history, but it doesn't have to be this way.' Restler called on the Adams administration to 'prioritize and expedite proven solutions that will save lives, especially the swift implementation of a truly protected network of bike lanes.'

NYPD Transportation Bureau’s Michael Pilecki reported arrests for forged plates fell 11 percent from last year, while summonses rose just 0.6 percent. The hearing spotlighted two bills from Council Member Oswald Feliz to raise fines for using or selling fake plates, both widely supported, including by the NYPD. The matter summary: 'NYPD claims it has stepped up its efforts to summons and arrest car drivers who cover or deface their plate, or drive with a fake temporary tag, but its own statistics show that the effort has not continued into this year.' Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers and Kamillah Hanks did not comment. Activists and officials noted DOT’s automated cameras failed to bill 1.2 million violations last year due to temp tags, leaving dangerous drivers unaccountable. The city’s weak enforcement leaves vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT Commissioner Rodriguez said, 'E-scooters and other forms of micromobility will help us build a cleaner and greener transportation system that connects residents to commercial and transit hubs.' Council Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers celebrated the move, highlighting its impact on transit deserts in Southeast Queens. The Bronx pilot logged over two million trips with very low injury rates. Safety features—speed limits, in-app training, 'Beginner Mode,' and no overnight use for new riders—will continue.

Mayor Adams said, “This is a five-borough city and we are now saying the Summer Streets program is going be a five-borough initiative. Everyone deserves to enjoy that.” Adams expressed interest in longer hours but cited public safety and NYPD staffing costs as barriers. Advocates want more hours and connected car-free routes. The city will spend $1.5 million, not including staffing.

Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>Sammy’s Law, debated by the NYC Council and State Legislature, seeks home rule for New York City to lower speed limits from 25 to 20 mph on dangerous streets. Council Member Jen Gutierrez carried the resolution; Selvena Brooks-Powers later signed on. The bill targets corridors like Bushwick Avenue, Laurelton Parkway, and East Gun Hill Road—sites of hundreds of crashes and dozens killed or maimed since 2019. The matter summary states: 'Because people are dying and being maimed on New York's most-dangerous 25-mile-per-hour streets.' Supporters, including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, cite the science: lower speeds mean less force, fewer deaths. Research shows 20 mph zones cut crashes by 60 percent. The bill does not mandate, but allows, lower limits where carnage is highest. The council’s action centers the lives of pedestrians and cyclists, demanding the city act before more are lost.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

NYPD Chief Kim Royster and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez echoed the urgency. The bill awaits action in Albany.
