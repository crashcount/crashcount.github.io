The matter title reads: 'establishing a high visibility pavement marking pilot program.' Council Member Yusef Salaam leads, joined by Menin, De La Rosa, Brooks-Powers, Cabán, Brannan, and Hanif. The law demands a report on results and challenges. The aim: mark danger, force drivers to see, and push the city to act where blood has already been spilled.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, now entering its last public feedback phase, will be reviewed by the MTA Board in early winter 2025 and implemented by late summer. The proposal includes over $30 million in new funding, 17 new local routes, and increased frequency for 17 lines, but also service reductions on 29 routes. The main highlight is the introduction of 'rush' routes to connect riders to rail faster. MTA Chair Janno Lieber said, 'Every change to a route has an impact on the schedule... and we did it.' Queens Borough President Donovan Richards voiced support, stating, 'I'm ready. We're ready.' The process began in 2019 and was shaped by extensive community input.

The project, part of Vision Zero, was celebrated in Council District 26 with Council Member Julie Won present and helping secure $1.5 million for future upgrades. The redesign stretches from Queens Plaza to Hillside Avenue, creating the city’s longest protected bike lane. The DOT reports a 68% drop in fatalities and a 35% reduction in injuries since 2015. The redesign adds parking-protected bike lanes, pedestrian islands, and improved signals. The next phase, funded in part by Won, will replace painted lanes with concrete, add raised medians, and increase accessibility. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called it a milestone, saying, 'Queens Boulevard is not the Boulevard of Death anymore, but the Boulevard of Life.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates objected to last-minute changes that would force pedestrians to yield to drivers, fearing it could criminalize those struck by cars. Narcisse highlighted 'systemic bias in how these laws are enforced.' Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers said, 'There is little evidence to support the claim that criminal or civil offenses for jaywalking change pedestrian behavior or increase pedestrian safety,' and noted racial disparities in ticketing.

Queens Borough President Donovan Richards pledged $500,000, saying, "We're not waiting until someone loses their life to take action." Since 2019, 112 crashes have injured 54 people here—five of them pedestrians. The intersection currently favors cars, forcing pedestrians on long detours. The redesign will dead-end Beach 35th Street, add raised bike lanes, and expand pedestrian space. Final design is due next year, with construction set for 2027 and completion by 2029.

The editorial rebukes this logic, stating, 'We should not cling to parking mandates when we know they encourage car ownership, make streets less vibrant, increase rents, and pollute our air.' The piece urges officials to break the cycle of car-first policy, invest in transit, and end mandates that block affordable housing and safer streets.

Richards claims, “This is the reality of living in a transit desert.” The move splits the city, keeping car-centric policies in place for much of Queens.

They called new housing near transit a threat. They fought against ending parking mandates. Most public testimony backed the reforms. But Queens officials stood firm, defending car-centric streets and single-family homes.</p><p class=mb3>On July 11, 2024, the City Council held a hearing on the City of Yes zoning reforms. The proposal aims to increase housing near transit, allow mixed-use zoning, and eliminate parking mandates. Council Members Joann Ariola and Vicki Paladino led opposition, calling the plan an 'unmitigated disaster' and disputing housing data. Ariola argued, 'That's what they bought in the suburbs for.' Other Queens officials and residents echoed fears for single-family homeowners and suburban 'character.' In contrast, Borough President Donovan Richards's spokesperson and some residents supported the reforms, citing the city's affordability crisis. The majority of public testimony favored the proposal, but entrenched opposition from Queens officials remains strong. No safety analyst assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Only a sliver of city roads get safer. Regional slow zones start in lower Manhattan. Council Member Marte backs the move. Advocates want faster, broader action. Most streets stay risky.</p><p class=mb3>On June 27, 2024, the NYC Department of Transportation announced it will use new powers from Sammy's Law to lower speed limits from 25 to 20 mph on 49 street segments starting September 2024, with 201 more to follow by late 2025. The measure covers just 0.13% of city streets, possibly reaching 0.8% if regional slow zones expand. The first such zone will be south of Canal Street in lower Manhattan. DOT can only lower limits street by street unless the City Council acts. Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers confirmed no citywide bill exists. Council Member Christopher Marte welcomed the slow zone in his district, citing rampant speeding off the bridges. Advocates and officials demand faster, broader action, saying, 'Twenty is plenty wherever you'll find people, and in New York that's everywhere.' DOT says it will prioritize areas near schools and neighborhoods with more non-white and low-income residents. The rollout is slow. Most streets remain unchanged.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They claim it protects pedestrians. Enforcement is rare but hits people of color hardest. Council Member Narcisse wants change. NYPD and DOT resist. Advocates say criminalization fails safety and justice.</p><p class=mb3>On June 26, 2024, the City Council held a hearing on a bill to decriminalize jaywalking. The bill, proposed by Council Member Mercedes Narcisse, seeks to end criminal penalties for crossing streets outside crosswalks. The matter summary states officials argue, 'keeping it illegal protects pedestrian safety.' DOT First Deputy Commissioner Margaret Forgione testified against full legalization, supporting only a reduction to a civil offense. NYPD Deputy Chief Thomas Alps defended targeted enforcement in high-crash areas. Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers questioned the law's fairness, noting most tickets go to Black and Brown New Yorkers. Advocates criticized the city's stance, saying criminalization does not improve safety and harms communities of color. The bill remains under debate, with no clear path forward.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
