The bill seeks to amend city law to "establish a reward for individuals who provide information leading to the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of a person who seriously injures or kills another individual in a hit-and-run accident." Council Member Rita C. Joseph leads as primary sponsor, joined by Brooks-Powers, Narcisse, Vernikov, Louis, Bottcher, Hudson, Gennaro, and Williams. The bill authorizes the mayor, on the police commissioner's recommendation, to offer up to $1,000 for actionable tips. Law enforcement and city or state employees are excluded. The bill responds to the grim fact that many hit-and-runs go unsolved, leaving victims and families without answers.

The matter centers on the DOT’s report and council inaction: 'Out of 51 City Council members, only six responded to a request from DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez for recommended locations where street safety improvements should be made in their districts.' Mayor Adams slashed DOT’s budget and weakened projects, while council leaders deflected responsibility. Advocates like Jon Orcutt and Elizabeth Adams demanded decisive action, warning that delays and excuses cost lives.

Bill orders a citywide study on raised crosswalks, intersections, and speed reducers near schools. Streets choke with cars. Children cross. The city stalls. The bill sits in committee. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0095-2024, introduced February 8, 2024, sits with the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill demands a study on 'the feasibility of installing raised crosswalks, raised intersections, and speed reducers at intersections and roadways adjacent to schools.' Council Member Julie Menin leads, joined by Schulman, Hudson, Brooks-Powers, Riley, Lee, Louis, Restler, and Gutiérrez as sponsors. The bill would repeal and replace Section 19-189 of the city code, requiring the Department of Transportation to report crash data and feasibility findings to the Mayor and Council Speaker. After the study, the Commissioner may install traffic-calming measures where possible. The bill remains 'Laid Over in Committee' as of June 25, 2024. No safety analyst note is available, but the bill targets systemic risk where children walk and drivers speed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
