The numbers keep rising.</p><h3 id=the-road-forward>The Road Forward</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made somewhere—by a driver, by a planner, by a lawmaker who did not act. The tools exist. Lower the speed. Harden the crossings. Protect the people who walk and ride.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor.

Paramedics found him on the tracks. He died at Bellevue Hospital. Another teen fell last month. The rails remain deadly for the young.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News reported on July 7, 2025, that Carlos Oliver, 15, died after falling from the top of a subway train at Queensboro Plaza in Queens. Police said it was unclear if he fell while climbing or lost balance as the train entered the station. The article notes, 'He was shy and quiet but at the end of the day he started hanging out with the wrong crowd.' Last month, another teen was critically injured in a similar incident. The report highlights ongoing risks for youth on city transit, but does not cite driver error.

She flew like 30 feet. It was a lot of force."
