Thirteen seriously hurt.</strong> In three and a half years, Washington Heights (South) has seen 1,581 crashes. <strong>817 people injured.</strong> The bodies pile up. The pain does not fade. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>The dead are not just numbers. Two men, 35 and 73, lost on the street. A 76-year-old pedestrian struck at Broadway and West 161st. A cyclist, 73, killed on Saint Nicholas Avenue. A crash on the Henry Hudson Parkway left two men dead, one with crush injuries, another with a broken body. The living carry scars. A cyclist, 57, left bleeding after a collision with a taxi at Fort Washington Avenue. A motorcyclist, 33, torn open on Saint Nicholas. The list goes on.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> Of the pedestrian injuries and deaths, sedans and SUVs are the main weapons. Trucks, taxis, bikes, and mopeds add to the toll, but the bulk comes from cars. The streets are not safe for the old, the young, or anyone on foot or bike.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p>The city talks about Vision Zero. They promise safer streets. They tout new speed limits and cameras. But in Washington Heights (South), the carnage continues. <strong>No local leader has stood up with urgency.</strong> No bold plan. No public reckoning. The silence is loud. The blood is real.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by those in power. The council, the mayor, the DOT—they can act. They can lower speed limits, redesign streets, and enforce the law. But they move slow. The dead do not wait.</p><p><strong>Demand more.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to use the power they have. Lower the speed limit. Build real protection for people on foot and bike.

Mayor Eric Adams said, "there’s going to be a whole rule making process to make sure that we comply and follow the laws." Critics argue the plan singles out e-bikes while ignoring faster, heavier vehicles. Ben Furans of Transportation Alternatives called it "half-baked and ill-conceived," noting that "bikes and cars sharing the same road would be subject to different speed limits and consequences." Janet Schroeder of the E-Bike Safety Alliance doubts the rule will matter without real enforcement. The NYPD already issues thousands of criminal summonses to cyclists for minor violations, raising questions about fair and effective policy.

Critics worried about diverted car traffic clogging residential streets, with one resident calling for a 'traffic study' and 'action plan.'

The boards argue the crackdown will not make streets safer and targets vulnerable workers. Ken Coughlin of CB7 said, “This resolution is simply saying, 'This is not the way.'” Jesse Greenwald of CB4 warned of the risks to immigrant delivery workers, stating, “We know that ICE agents are looking for any opportunity to detain and deport our immigrant workers.” The boards’ votes follow similar action by Midtown’s CB6. The article notes the NYPD has not provided evidence for the claimed surge in complaints that prompted the policy. The move highlights growing concern that enforcement strategies may harm vulnerable road users instead of addressing systemic street safety issues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
