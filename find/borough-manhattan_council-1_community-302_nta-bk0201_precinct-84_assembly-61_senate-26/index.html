Afternoon hours hit hardest here: injuries stack from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m., with deaths logged at 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. in the historical record.</p><p>A 76‑year‑old woman died in 2022 on Cadman Plaza West. The police file lists “Unsafe Speed.” It also lists “Aggressive Driving/Road Rage.” She was trapped in the wreckage. The driver, 60, was injured. It is all in the city’s data <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>for that crash</a>.</p><p>In 2023, a 48‑year‑old driver died on the BQE. The file says “Lost Consciousness.” Two vehicles. Impact at speed. It sits in the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>BQE record</a>.</p><p>This summer, another driver died on Henry Street. A parked Mini. A Mazda sedan going straight. The woman was 58, marked “Apparent Death” in the log. The entry is dry and final. It lives in the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>August 19, 2025 file</a>.</p><h3 id=who-gets-hit-and-when>Who gets hit, and when</h3><p>Pedestrians keep taking the blow. Forty‑eight injured since 2022, with a serious injury on record. Sedans are the main strike vehicle for people on foot—22 pedestrian injuries traced to them, with one serious. Trucks follow with seven. The counts come from the city’s rollup for this area <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>since 2022</a>.</p><p>Bicyclists were hit 17 times. One serious injury. One file shows a rider cut deep on Atlantic Avenue in April. The log says the SUV was parked; the cyclist was “Going Straight Ahead.” It lists “Driver Inattention/Distraction” and “Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other… Error/Confusion.” Read the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>April 7, 2025 entry</a>.</p><p>Crashes swell in daylight. Injuries spike around noon and into the afternoon. Eleven people hurt at midnight. Nine at 1 a.m. The clock does not care. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hour‑by‑hour counts</a> show no safe hour.</p><h3 id=how-the-system-records-pain>How the system records pain</h3><p>The forms cite causes. “Other” leads this map with 74 injuries. “Vulnerable road user error” shows 17 more injuries. “Inattention/Distraction” adds three. “Disregarded traffic control.” “Backing unsafely.” The labels are blunt. They do not mend bone. They sit in the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>contributing factors list</a>.</p><p>A mother, a boy, and a front‑seat passenger were hurt in a December 2024 crash at Adams and Fulton. The log names “Unsafe Speed” and “Traffic Control Disregarded.” A 55‑year‑old bled from the head. The child and teen list whiplash. It is all in the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>December 7, 2024 record</a>.</p><h3 id=promises-on-paper>Promises on paper</h3><p>At City Hall, Council Member Lincoln Restler backs a state bill to ticket owners by camera for illegal parking. The resolution calls for passing A.5440. The aim is simple: stop the blockages that force people into traffic. The council file is here: <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Res 1024‑2025</a>.</p><p>Restler also co‑sponsors a law to make DOT install school‑zone safety devices within 60 days after a study. The bill is <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int. 1353‑2025</a>. It is in committee.</p><p>Up in Albany, Senator Andrew Gounardes pushed and voted to extend the school‑zone speed cameras through 2030. The governor signed it. Coverage and statements are here in <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>AMNY</a> and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/hochul-signs-speed-camera-reauthorization-enforcement-continues-through-2030>Streetsblog</a>. He also advanced a bill to force speed limiters on repeat dangerous drivers. Committee votes show he voted yes on <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>.</p><h3 id=what-would-help-on-these-blocks>What would help on these blocks</h3><p>Start with the corners that keep breaking: Cadman Plaza West and the BQE ramps. Then Adams at Fulton. Daylight the crosswalks. Harden the turns. Give pedestrians a head start. Use cameras to keep bus lanes, bike lanes, and crosswalks clear—what <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Res 1024‑2025</a> seeks to unlock. Install school‑front safety fast under <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int. 1353‑2025</a>.</p><p>Across the city, lower the default speed limit and rein in repeat speeders. The legislature already renewed school‑zone cameras through 2030, as covered by <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>AMNY</a> and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/30/hochul-signs-speed-camera-reauthorization-enforcement-continues-through-2030>Streetsblog</a>. The next step is passing speed limiters for the worst drivers—tracked in committee and votes on <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>.</p><p>Lower speeds. Fewer funerals. If you want that here, tell them now. Take one step today at <a href=/take_action/>our action page</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Introduced August 14, 2025 and referred the same day. It “calls on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, A.5440, which imposes owner liability for failure of an operator to comply with traffic control indicators within the city of New York.” Sponsor: Council Member Lincoln Restler. A.5440, sponsored by Assemblymember Steven Raga, would pilot camera enforcement (on city vehicles or along streets) for posted parking rules, with owner fines from $50 to $250 and a six-year term, plus a two-year public report. The aim: curb illegal parking that endangers people outside cars and clogs the street.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Years of leaks, rot, and stench warned locals. No one fixed it. The city let danger fester. Pedestrians faced the risk. No injuries, but trust is broken.</p><p class=mb3>On August 4, 2025, a hotel awning collapsed outside the Clark Street subway station in Brooklyn Heights. The incident, reported by Barbara Russo-Lennon and Lloyd Mitchell, followed 'years of visible disrepair, foul smells and water leaks.' Council Member Lincoln Restler confirmed no timeline for reopening. The Department of Buildings cited the owners for 'Failure to maintain' and ordered demolition. DOB Commissioner James Oddo said engineers are inspecting a second awning showing 'poor maintenance.' The collapse put pedestrians in harm's way. As safety analysts note, such failures in busy areas raise the risk of injury or death for vulnerable road users and discourage walking, undermining city safety goals.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
