Three people have died here since 2022. Six more were left with injuries so serious they may never walk the same. In the last twelve months alone, 474 crashes tore through these streets. 307 neighbors were hurt. Five were seriously injured.</p><p>The bodies are not numbers. A worker crushed by a reversing truck. A cyclist thrown by a sedan. A child, a parent, a friend—gone or changed forever. The road is a wound that never closes.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price-the-most-vulnerable>Who Pays the Price? The Most Vulnerable</h3><p>Trucks killed two pedestrians. Cars and SUVs left dozens more with broken bones and broken lives. The data is clear: the bigger the vehicle, the deeper the scar. In the last three years, SUVs and sedans caused 73 pedestrian injuries. Trucks and buses killed two and injured nine more. Bikes caused one moderate injury. No one is safe, but those outside the steel cage pay the highest price.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-cast-lives-at-stake>Leadership: Votes Cast, Lives at Stake</h3><p>When the chance came to make streets safer, local leaders blinked. Assembly Member Sam Pirozzolo and State Senator Andrew Lanza both voted against reauthorizing the city’s school zone speed camera program—a proven tool that saves lives. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>Streetsblog NYC named them among the &ldquo;Dirty Dozen&rdquo; who stood in the way</a>. Lanza also voted no on bills to create safer school speed zones for children. The silence is loud. The inaction is deadly.</p><p>No quote from a grieving family can soften this. But the words of a city official ring out: &ldquo;Speeding ruins lives, and reducing vehicle speeds by even a few miles per hour could be the difference between life or death in a traffic crash,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pr2024/sammys-law-enactment.shtml#:~:text=%E2%80%9CSpeeding%20ruins%20lives%2C%20and%20reducing,keep%20everyone%20safe%20on%20our">said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a>.</p><h3 id=what-now-the-road-ahead>What Now? The Road Ahead</h3><p>Every crash is preventable. The tools exist: lower speed limits, more speed cameras, street redesigns that put people before cars. But tools unused are as useless as promises unkept.</p><p>Call your council member. Call your state reps. Demand action. Tell them the numbers are not enough. The bodies are not enough. The silence is not enough. The next victim does not have to be you.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Council Member Lincoln Restler confirmed no timeline for reopening. The Department of Buildings cited the owners for 'Failure to maintain' and ordered demolition. DOB Commissioner James Oddo said engineers are inspecting a second awning showing 'poor maintenance.' The collapse put pedestrians in harm's way. As safety analysts note, such failures in busy areas raise the risk of injury or death for vulnerable road users and discourage walking, undermining city safety goals.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
