The 37-year-old male driver of one SUV was injured, sustaining a shoulder-upper arm injury and contusions. The report identifies 'Pavement Slippery' as a contributing factor for all involved vehicles. Additionally, the injured driver was noted for 'Following Too Closely,' a critical driver error that likely precipitated the crash. All drivers were licensed and traveling straight ahead at the time of impact. The collision points included the left front quarter panel, right front bumper, and center front end of the vehicles. The injured driver was restrained with a lap belt and remained conscious but was not ejected from the vehicle. The report does not list any victim behaviors as contributing factors, focusing instead on driver errors and hazardous road conditions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
