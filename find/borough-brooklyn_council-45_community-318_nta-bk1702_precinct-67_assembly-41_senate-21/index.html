Nine left with serious injuries.</strong> In East Flatbush-Farragut, from January 2022 to June 2025, the street keeps taking. In the last year alone, 255 crashes. <strong>183 people hurt. Four with injuries so grave they may never walk the same.</strong> Not one month without pain.

A 50-year-old woman, crossing with the signal, hit by a truck on Clarendon Road. A 61-year-old man, thrown from his bike, left bleeding in the street. The list goes on.

They promise lower speed limits and more cameras. But in East Flatbush-Farragut, the blood keeps coming. The council and state passed Sammy’s Law, giving the city power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit here is still higher. The cameras could go dark if Albany stalls. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. Promises pile up. The bodies do too.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next?</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is failure.</strong> Every crash is a choice. Every delay is a wound. The city can lower the speed limit now. The council can demand more cameras, more street redesigns, more protection for the ones on foot and bike. <strong>But they will not move unless you make them.</strong></p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor.
