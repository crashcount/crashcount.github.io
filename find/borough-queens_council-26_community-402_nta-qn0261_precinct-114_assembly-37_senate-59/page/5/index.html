Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez leads as primary sponsor, joined by Avilés, Hudson, Salaam, Cabán, Ayala, Restler, Hanif, Won, Brooks-Powers, Nurse, Public Advocate Williams, and the Brooklyn Borough President. The measure responds to freight growth and truck congestion, which fuel pollution and endanger street users. The Council’s call aims to clear trucks from city streets, cut emissions, and make roads safer for everyone outside a car.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Their proposal seeks $45 million in this year’s budget to boost bus frequency, with another $45 million to triple free buses citywide. The lawmakers’ push follows a successful fare-free pilot, which Mamdani says increased ridership by over 20%. Gianaris admitted, 'It should have been done sooner.' Critics argue the move is too late, as congestion pricing was approved in 2019. Some unions warn of possible driver shortages, but Mamdani insists existing buses and operators can handle the expansion.
