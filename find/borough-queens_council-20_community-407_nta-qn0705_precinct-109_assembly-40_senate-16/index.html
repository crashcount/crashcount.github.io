Eight seriously hurt.</strong> In East Flushing, from 2022 through early June 2025, the numbers keep coming. They do not stop. They do not care. In 514 crashes, 272 people were injured. Two did not come home. Eight carry wounds that will not heal. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p><strong>No one is spared.</strong> Children, elders, workers, and neighbors. In the last year alone, 84 people were hurt on these streets. Three were left with life-changing injuries. Not one death, but the luck will not last. The next siren is always coming.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> Cars and SUVs hit most often. Trucks and buses do their share. One bike, one bus, one taxi—each leaves a mark. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not. The street does not care if you are young or old. It does not care if you are careful.</p><p><strong>The stories repeat.</strong> A sedan making a left turn hits a woman in the crosswalk. A distracted driver strikes a child on a bike. A truck backs up and a pedestrian goes down. The details change. The outcome does not. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>recent crashes</a></p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p><strong>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero.</strong> They tout new laws. They point to speed cameras and lower limits. But the blood on the street says more. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so here. Cameras catch speeders, but only where they are placed. The rest of the street is left to chance.</p><p><strong>No bold action. No end to the toll.</strong> The council, the mayor, the state—they all have a hand. They can act. They have not done enough.

TLC Commissioner David Do said, “We made that today. It is the most accessible fleet in the entire country.” This achievement follows a decade-long push by disability advocates and a 2013 settlement requiring half the medallion fleet to be accessible. The transition faced delays, including the COVID-19 pandemic and medallion owner financial struggles. Policy changes, such as alternating accessible vehicles and funding support, drove the shift.

Drivers with too many points or camera tickets must install speed assistance devices. Lawmakers move to curb reckless driving. The bill targets repeat offenders. The aim: fewer crashes, fewer deaths. Streets demand action.</p><p class=mb3>Bill S 4045, titled 'Relates to requiring the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices for repeated violation of maximum speed limits,' advanced in the Senate on May 20, 2025, following a committee vote. The bill requires drivers who rack up eleven or more points in 24 months, or six speed or red-light camera tickets in twelve months, to install intelligent speed assistance devices. Primary sponsor Andrew Gounardes led the push, joined by co-sponsors Samra Brouk, Cordell Cleare, and others. The vote passed with support from senators including Jeremy Cooney, Pete Harckham, and Jessica Ramos. The measure aims to rein in repeat offenders and reduce deadly speeding. The bill’s language is blunt: 'Requires the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices if a driver accumulates eleven or more points on their driving record during a 24 month period, or receives 6 speed camera or red light camera tickets during a twelve month period.' No safety analyst note was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crash happened at Northern Boulevard and East 107th Street as Diaz drove to work.
