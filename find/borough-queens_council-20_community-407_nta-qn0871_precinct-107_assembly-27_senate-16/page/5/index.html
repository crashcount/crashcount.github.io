Council Members Althea V. Stevens (primary sponsor), James F. Gennaro, Justin L. Brannan, Gale A. Brewer, and Sandra Ung back the measure.

The effort, led by the NYPD and Department of Transportation, aims to keep inebriated motorists off the roads. Senator John Liu, representing District 16, publicly supported the crackdown and advocated for lowering the legal blood alcohol limit from .08 to .05. The campaign includes increased police patrols and active speed cameras. The official matter summary states: 'Drunk driving crackdown: NYC launches aggressive enforcement campaign for New Year’s weekend.' Liu said, 'Cracking down on drunk driving, which continues to destroy lives and families, is the right focus as New Year's approaches.' The DOT notes fatalities from drunk driving have risen nearly 30% in recent years. City lawmakers back state legislation to reduce the DWI threshold, aiming to save lives and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill passed both the state Senate and Assembly unanimously. The matter summary called for a study to extend the greenway, which runs parallel to the hazardous Union Turnpike. State Senator John Liu sponsored the bill and vowed to keep pushing for the project, saying, 'I’m confident we’ll get there.' Hochul’s veto cited budget concerns and the risk of 'duplication and unnecessary bureaucracy.' Advocates like Joby Jacob called the veto a blow to years of organizing, noting that people are forced to walk dirt paths where sidewalks should be. The veto blocks progress on a safer route for cyclists and pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

State Sen. John Liu urges more service in neighborhoods where buses can move. Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance says, "With better service, the path to more service is a much clearer one." ABLE cameras have improved bus speeds by 5 percent on enforced routes. Despite promises, Mayor Eric Adams has not delivered on expanding bus lanes.

The letter, signed by Marte and state legislators, was sent to the Traffic Mobility Review Board. The officials wrote, 'Commuter vans offer the Chinese communities in Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn a much-needed service that is not being provided by other forms of public transportation: safe, language-accessible, and culturally competent means for people to access jobs, resources, and family.' They argue that tolling these vans—serving Flatbush Avenue, eastern Queens, and the city’s Chinatowns—would raise fares and cut off vital connections for Asian New Yorkers.

The bill’s summary states, 'The 0.05 BAC simply says, don’t drink and drive.' Liu, as the bill’s primary sponsor, emphasized that anyone found with a BAC over 0.05 would be charged with DWI. City Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez joined the push, warning, 'Whether they are at 0.06 or 0.12 or 0.20, the consequences can be deadly.' Drunk driving caused 307 deaths in New York State in 2019, nearly a third of all fatal crashes. Utah’s adoption of a 0.05 BAC limit led to a 20% drop in fatal crashes in its first year.

It aimed to restore impoundment powers and repeal recent legal protections. The measure targeted riders, not drivers. The bill died at session’s end. Vulnerable users remain exposed.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0883-2023 was introduced in the City Council on January 19, 2023, and referred to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill proposed to amend the administrative code by expanding the definition of 'motorized scooter' to include e-bikes and e-scooters, raising civil penalties for violations from $250 to $500, and restoring impoundment authority. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the operation of motorized scooters, and to repeal subdivision e of section 19-176.2 of such code, relating to operators of electric scooters and bicycles with electric assist.' Council Members Althea V. Stevens (primary sponsor), Robert F. Holden, Inna Vernikov, Joann Ariola, Vickie Paladino, Pierina Ana Sanchez, Kalman Yeger, and James F. Gennaro sponsored the bill. The bill was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023, and did not advance. No safety analyst assessment was provided. The bill’s focus was on enforcement and penalties, not on systemic danger from cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
