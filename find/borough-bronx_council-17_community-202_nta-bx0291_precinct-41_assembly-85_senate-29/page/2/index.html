Surveillance and body camera footage show Peña admitting to running the light. Five hours after the crash, tests confirmed intoxication by alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine. Peña’s record includes prior arrests and 25 school zone speeding tickets. He also drove an unregistered vehicle with an obstructed plate and tinted windshield. The victim, Diaz, was headed to work and had just graduated college.
