The incident began with a minor collision and escalated as both vehicles ran a red light. Helmet cam footage showed Rosen rear-ending the motorcycle, causing it to catch fire and kill McField instantly. Queens DA Melinda Katz stated, "As alleged, this defendant plowed his BMW SUV into a motorcyclist shortly after the two had a minor collision." The BMW also struck another car before stopping. Rosen had prior traffic summonses for speeding and driving the wrong way. The case highlights the lethal risk of aggressive driving and the deadly power imbalance between cars and vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

One thousand trucks a month will vanish from Bronx streets. Boats and cargo bikes will haul food across the city. Less diesel. Fewer big rigs. The city shifts freight off the road, onto water.</p><p class=mb3>On April 23, 2025, city officials and Con Agg Global announced a new floating freight dock at the Hunts Point Food Distribution Center. The project, backed by the Economic Development Corporation and Council Member Rafael Salamanca, aims to move food by boat and e-cargo trike instead of trucks. The matter summary states: 'Replacing truck trips with boat trips and cargo bikes is a key feature of the city's urgent push to shift cargo trips out of big trucks.' EDC President Andrew Kimball said, 'The goal is, over time, to move more and more of this food out of Hunts Point not by truck, but by water with e-cargo trikes.' The dock will remove one thousand trucks per month from South Bronx streets. Officials plan to expand docks citywide. The bill’s status is an active infrastructure rollout, not a legislative vote. No direct safety analyst assessment was provided, but the shift promises fewer trucks where people walk and ride.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Prosecutors say Pena drove 83 mph in a 25 mph zone, ran a red light, and t-boned a BMW, killing 23-year-old Justin Diaz. The article quotes DA Melinda Katz: "An FDNY firefighter who was off duty is accused of driving under the influence, running a steady red light and slamming into a 23-year-old motorist, killing him, as he drove more than three times the posted speed limit." Pena's blood alcohol content was .156 percent, and he allegedly had drugs in his system. The BMW was sent flying into a parked car, its roof torn off. Pena faces manslaughter and related charges. The case highlights the lethal risk of extreme speeding and impaired driving on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
