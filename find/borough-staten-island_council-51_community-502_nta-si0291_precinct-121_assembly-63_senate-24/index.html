Zero deaths. Zero serious injuries.</strong> That’s the toll in Freshkills Park (North) since 2022. The numbers sound small until you see the faces behind them. A two-year-old girl, head snapped back in a crash on Travis Avenue. A 49-year-old driver, back aching, left in shock on Forest Hill Road. A 52-year-old man, blood on his face, stunned on Yukon Avenue. These are not numbers. They are lives, changed in a moment. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the data</a>.</p><p><strong>No one has died here in three years.</strong> That is luck, not policy. The crashes keep coming. Twenty-eight in the last year. Eleven people hurt since January. The streets do not forgive.</p><h3 id=who-gets-hurt-and-how>Who Gets Hurt, and How</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do the damage.</strong> In the last three years, SUVs and sedans have caused every pedestrian injury in this area. No bikes. No motorcycles. Just steel and speed. Two people on foot were hit by SUVs. The rest were inside cars, but that is cold comfort when the metal bends.</p><p>Children are not spared. In one crash, a toddler in a child seat left the scene with whiplash. The old are not spared. The middle-aged, the young, the unknown. The road takes from all.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p><strong>The city has the power to lower speed limits.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The Council can act. The Mayor can act. But the speed limit here is unchanged. The cameras that catch speeders could go dark if Albany lets the law expire. The clock ticks. <a href=../../take_action/>Learn how to act</a>.</p><p>No press releases. No bold claims from local leaders. No new protections for the people walking, biking, or driving these streets. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Lower the speed limit. Keep the cameras on. Redesign the crossings. Call your council member. Call the mayor.

The study, covered by Barbara Russo-Lennon, found a 25% drop in Manhattan traffic jams, with smaller but real declines in the Bronx and New Jersey. The report states: 'Congestion pricing is delivering clear benefits, saving people time and the aggravation of being stuck in traffic.' Council Member Frank Morano and State Sen. Jessica Scarcella-Spanton criticized the program, citing Staten Island’s smaller gains and health concerns. MTA Chair Janno Lieber defended the policy, pointing to improved drive times and transit use.

The plan allows cameras on seven bridges and two tunnels, ticketing drivers who exceed speed limits. Fines start at $50 for a first offense, rising to $75 and $100 for repeat violations within 18 months. Governor Hochul's office called the program 'one more way the governor is working to improve safety on our roads and bridges for workers and travelers alike.' MTA Bridges and Tunnels President Catherine Sheridan said, 'We want to make sure that our maintenance workers and contractors are safe.' The program, part of the $254 billion state budget, will be reviewed again in 2031.

Council Members David Carr and Kamillah Hanks of Staten Island voted against the modified plan, defending suburban-style zoning. Riley argued, 'One-family zoned districts represent less than 15 percent of the city's land area... they are valuable.' The exemption means fewer apartments near transit, locking in car dependence. Moses Gates of the Regional Plan Association called the move senseless from a planning perspective.

Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable.
