It requires the city to identify at least one feasible off-street parking location for tractor trailers in each borough by the end of 2023, and to establish those sites by December 31, 2025. No location can be on a residential street. Council Member Kamillah Hanks sponsored the bill, joined by Brannan, Riley, Dinowitz, Ung, Brooks-Powers, and others.

Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary sponsor), Gale A. Brewer, Shaun Abreu, Lynn C. Schulman, and Amanda Farías backed the resolution.

Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>Int 1071-2023 was introduced on June 8, 2023, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill aimed to require owners to remove disused or abandoned utility poles, wires, and appurtenances within 60 days, and to act immediately if conditions were dangerous. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the timelines for the removal of abandoned or unsafe utility poles, wires, and appurtenances, and the transfer of appurtenances to newly erected poles.' Council Member Tiffany Cabán sponsored the bill, joined by Kevin C. Riley, Jennifer Gutiérrez, Lincoln Restler, Kristin Richardson Jordan, Amanda Farías, and Robert F. Holden. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst note was provided. The bill’s failure leaves hazardous poles and wires on city streets, a threat to those on foot and bike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
