But the street does not rest. In the last twelve months, 20 people were hurt. One was left with wounds the city calls serious. A leg crushed. Blood on the pavement. A man crossing with the light, struck by a moped. An older woman, bleeding from the head, hit by a truck that did not yield. The numbers do not flinch: 92 crashes since 2022. No deaths.

Trucks, SUVs, sedans, mopeds—they all find flesh. In the last year, a moped ran down a man in the crosswalk. A truck hit a woman crossing without a signal. An SUV left two with broken bodies. The street is a wound that never closes.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. They count the dead. They promise change. They passed Sammy’s Law, letting New York set its own speed limits. But in Crotona Park, the speed stays the same. Cameras catch speeders, but only where the city puts them. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program lapsed. The council could bring it back. They have not. The mayor says one death is too many. But the street keeps taking.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. Every crash can be stopped. Lower the speed. Build real protection for people on foot and on bikes. Bring back the laws that hold reckless drivers to account. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to act. Do not wait for the next siren.</p><p>Demand action. Demand safety.

The incident occurred at Givan and Palmer avenues around 2 a.m. Saturday. Police arrested 20-year-old Michael Aracena, charging him with murder, manslaughter, and criminal possession of a weapon. According to the article, Campbell's family said he tried to resolve the crash through insurance, but the suspect demanded money and then opened fire. ABC7 quotes Campbell’s father: "If you have insurance, you use insurance. Stop jumping out of car and shooting people." The case highlights the deadly risk of road rage and the failure of conflict resolution on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill summary states: 'This bill would subject owners of real property to a maximum civil penalty of $250 if they fail to complete sidewalk repairs as directed by the Department of Transportation.' Owners also face fines if they ignore sidewalk defects that pose immediate danger. The measure was referred to committee and awaits further action.

The bill sits with the Senate, awaiting committee action. Its matter title reads: 'Establishes a bicycle and electric scooter operator's safety manual; provides for the issuance of a license...; requires liability insurance for electric scooters in cities having a population of one million or more.' Primary sponsor Luis R. Sepúlveda (District 32) and co-sponsor Joseph P. Addabbo Jr. (District 15) back the measure. S 5801 would require e-scooter riders in New York City to pass a safety manual, obtain a license, and buy insurance. It also bans sales to unlicensed, uninsured buyers. The bill's impact on vulnerable road users is not assessed. Lawmakers claim it will curb reckless riding, but the real effect on street safety remains unmeasured.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
