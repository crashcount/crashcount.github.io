The matter, titled 'MTA honcho Janno Leiber quiet on plan to fill $33B budget hole — but outside group pitches longshot taxes, fees,' was discussed after the Capital Plan Review Board rejected the MTA’s $68 billion five-year capital plan due to a lack of funding. Valdez said, 'I think that would be helpful so we can all see the details and make sure that we're allocating resources most effectively.' She pressed for transparency and input from all sides. Outside groups proposed new taxes and fees, but lawmakers and the governor have not endorsed any. Rider advocates stressed the urgent need for full funding, warning that delay means a more unreliable system for New Yorkers.

The crash threw Berney from his car, killing him at the scene. The other driver was injured. Vennitti, unlicensed, abandoned his Mercedes and fled on foot. Police arrested him a year later. A grand jury indicted Vennitti for leaving the scene of a fatal crash and driving without a license.

The matter summary states: 'Parking right up against intersections blocks sight lines for pedestrians and drivers, leading to people to have to peak out into the street to see oncoming traffic.' Won said, 'Daylighting saves lives.' Advocates like Jackson Chabot of Open Plans back the bill, citing slow DOT progress and urgent need. Intersections account for 55 percent of pedestrian deaths and 79 percent of injuries, according to DOT.
