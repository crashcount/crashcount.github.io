Painted bike lanes are blocked by double-parked cars. No protected bike lanes exist near the stadium. The Macombs Dam Bridge approach is hazardous. The Yankees promote transit but ignore cycling.

The proposal, part of the council’s response to the mayor’s $98.5 billion preliminary budget, seeks to expand protected bike lanes to 500 miles, bus lanes to 500 miles, and add 38 million feet of pedestrian space. The council’s plan also introduces 40 miles of car-free busways, a benchmark not found in the mayor’s plan or previous legislation. Adams and other council leaders argue this funding is vital, stating, 'To secure an equitable recovery for our city and improve public safety, we must focus on robust investments.' Transit advocates back the plan, urging the mayor to support safer, more accessible streets for all New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The E-BIKE Act, once part of the Build Back Better Act, proposed a federal tax credit for e-bike buyers. Congress reduced the credit from $1,500 to $900 and limited eligibility, stalling progress. The article states, 'By replacing car trips, e-bikes can simultaneously lower emissions, improve street safety, and boost riders' health.' John MacArthur, a transportation program manager, notes that local and state lawmakers now lead with rebates and incentives. Council members and legislators in Vermont, Colorado, California, Washington, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Oklahoma have introduced or supported bills for e-bike rebates. Despite the momentum, no current state proposal pairs incentives with new bike infrastructure. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians and cyclists—remain at risk as car dominance continues and federal action lags.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He said, 'Who are we protecting? We’re protecting the speeders. How about protecting Isaiah?' State Senator Andrew Gounardes, district 26, echoed Adams: 'It makes no sense that the city cannot control its own destiny on these streets.' Adams admitted NYPD traffic enforcement lags, with summonses down by more than half since 2019. Twenty-seven pedestrians have died so far this year—three more than last year.

DOT will refine designs by fall.</p><p class=mb3>On March 21, 2022, the Department of Transportation (DOT) announced three proposals to improve bus service on Fordham Road, the Bronx’s main transit artery. The plans include painted bus lanes, a partial car-free busway, and a full car-free busway between Morris and Webster avenues. DOT aims to finalize designs by early fall and implement changes by mid-fall 2022. The matter summary states, 'Bus speeds are among the slowest in the city.' Council members are not named, but transit advocates like Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance and Juan Restrepo of Transportation Alternatives support the full busway, citing faster buses and safer streets for the majority who walk or ride. Local businesses fear losing car customers. DOT will study traffic impacts before moving forward.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The analysis credits UCLA Professor Donald Shoup’s influence. No council bill number or committee is cited, as this is a legislative trend, not a single bill.

Phil Koopman, an autonomous vehicle expert, said, “Basically, Tesla is programming its cars to break laws.” The report highlights a regulatory gap: U.S. law punishes drivers, not manufacturers.

They challenged policing as a fix. They called for social services, not crackdowns. Riders and the unhoused share the system. Boards shape whether transit is safe for all, or just some.</p><p class=mb3>On January 6, 2022, a panel at the Railvolution conference, moderated by former BART GM Grace Crunican, brought together Monica Tibbits-Nutt (former MBTA board) and Christof Spieler (former Houston Metro board) to discuss transit board policy. The session, titled 'Building a Better Transit Board,' focused on how agencies address homelessness. Tibbits-Nutt argued, 'as long as we continue to have these discussions in just that safety standpoint... we’re not going to be able to address any of these issues.' Spieler added, 'they have a right to be on the bus as much as anyone else.' Both opposed policing as the main response and urged boards to involve social services. The discussion underscored that transit boards can either foster inclusive safety or reinforce exclusion and danger for vulnerable riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
