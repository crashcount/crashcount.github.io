Senator Andrew Gounardes leads, joined by Leroy Comrie, Michael Gianaris, Brad Hoylman-Sigal, Robert Jackson, Liz Krueger, Zellnor Myrie, Gustavo Rivera, Julia Salazar, Luis R.

The incident, covered by nypost.com, centers on Hochul’s photo-op promoting Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) use, while her security detail drove an SUV to pick her up at Syosset station. Ra stated, “here she is responsible for BOTH a car trip and a train ride to get to the same place.” The matter, though not a formal bill, highlights political opposition to congestion pricing and official transit promotion. Ra’s comments, echoed by Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, stress the disconnect between officials’ privileges and the daily reality for vulnerable road users. No direct safety impact was assessed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, covered under the headline 'Did New Jersey fumble congestion pricing negotiations?', details failed settlement talks. Judge Leo Gordon tried to broker a deal. New York offered expanded crossing credits and transit funding. New Jersey, led by Governor Phil Murphy, demanded more. Murphy insisted New Jersey was reasonable, denying New York’s claims of generous offers. Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop criticized Murphy’s approach, arguing New Jersey should have bargained for transit benefits instead of fighting the tolls outright. Council Member Vickie Paladino (District 19) was mentioned in coverage. The outcome: congestion pricing advances, with no new protections or funding for vulnerable road users in New Jersey or New York.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The piece, titled 'A Brush With Danger Made Me Exhibit A in My Fight for Better Bike Lanes in Brooklyn,' describes the lack of protected bike lanes in Cobble Hill and Carroll Gardens. The author recounts merging into traffic, being closely followed by a driver, and crashing on a wet, greasy iron grid. The car sped away. Passersby helped. The cyclist suffered a broken collarbone. The essay notes, 'Our area of Brooklyn is a major hole in the borough's protected bike lane network.' Council Member Shahana Hanif attended a community meeting on the issue. The call is clear: Brooklyn’s streets favor cars, not people. The absence of protected lanes leaves cyclists exposed and injured.

The bill, still in proposal stage, will move through the relevant council committee. Simone’s proposal comes after a spate of subway violence, including a recent shove onto tracks in his district. The bill summary states: 'My legislation will require the MTA to install platform screen doors and gates system-wide within five years.' Simone urges the use of congestion pricing revenue for these safety upgrades, arguing, 'No priority is higher on any rider's mind, including mine, than safety on the system.' Simone is the primary sponsor. The measure aims to prevent fatal and dangerous falls and shoves, focusing on protecting riders from harm.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, district 35, formally objected to the unfunded capital plan with Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie. Their joint letter blocked the plan’s January 1 start, forcing negotiations. Governor Hochul, who backs the $68 billion plan, promised no income tax hikes but left other taxes and fees on the table.

Members called the bill vague, redundant, and unenforceable. Even e-bike skeptics dismissed it. The board demanded real solutions, not empty gestures or propaganda.</p><p class=mb3>Bill number not specified. On December 10, 2024, Manhattan Community Board 2’s transportation and parks committees reviewed Council Member Vickie Paladino’s proposal to ban e-bikes from city parks. The committees voted overwhelmingly against it. The matter, described as an effort to 'make it more harmonious and safer for people in parks,' was criticized as 'not fleshed out.' Paladino, a Queens Republican, failed to provide data or address existing rules. Co-sponsor Gale Brewer admitted she signed on under pressure and doubted enforcement. Committee members Shirley Secunda, Susanna Aaron, Janet Liff, and Jeannine Kiely all voiced strong opposition, calling the bill redundant and inadequate. The Central Park Conservancy declined to endorse a ban, urging more protected bike lanes instead. The board found the proposal did nothing for safety and ignored systemic issues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Video shows others stumbling too. A jury awarded her $1.1 million. The article slams sidewalk dumping, calls for strict enforcement, and demands clear paths for pedestrians.</p><p class=mb3>On December 9, 2024, Streetsblog NYC published a media advocacy piece on sidewalk obstruction and pedestrian safety. The article recounts the case of Barbara Hutson, who suffered two broken arms after tripping over Christmas trees left on a Manhattan sidewalk by Regis High School and a neighboring coop. The article states: 'This would not have happened if Regis and the coop had not left the trees to occupy 70 percent of the sidewalk width,' quoting Hutson’s lawyer, Adam White. Hutson sued and won a $1.1 million jury verdict. The piece highlights city code requiring a clear pedestrian passage and criticizes the city’s lax enforcement. The article urges residents and government to keep sidewalks clear, placing discarded trees in the curbside lane, not where people walk. No council bill was involved, but the advocacy centers the danger to pedestrians and the need for systemic change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Bottcher leads, joined by Public Advocate Jumaane Williams and over two dozen co-sponsors. The law orders the Department of Transportation to install daylighting barriers at a minimum of 1,000 intersections each year, up from 100. The city must also run outreach and education.
