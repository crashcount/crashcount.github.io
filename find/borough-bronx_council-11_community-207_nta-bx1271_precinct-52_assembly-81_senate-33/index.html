But the wounds run deep. Eighty-three people were hurt in 108 crashes since 2022, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. Not one month passes without someone bleeding on the asphalt. In the last year alone, sixteen more were injured. A cyclist struck in the head. A child hurt. An elder bruised. The pain is steady, unbroken, silent.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-metal-against-flesh>The Pattern: Metal Against Flesh</h3><p>Cars and SUVs dominate the carnage. Trucks, motorcycles, mopeds—they all play their part. A truck hit a pedestrian on Webster Avenue. A moped rider was thrown from his seat. A cyclist was struck by an SUV turning left. The stories repeat. The names change. The outcome does not.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p>The city has the power to slow the bloodshed. Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The Council can set a 20 mph speed limit. They have not. Speed cameras could go dark if Albany fails to act. The tools are there. The clock ticks. Every day of delay is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. The city can lower the speed limit. The state can keep cameras running. You can make them act. Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand safer speeds. Demand action.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
