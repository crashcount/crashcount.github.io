Surveillance and body camera footage show Peña admitting to running the light. Five hours after the crash, tests confirmed intoxication by alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine. Peña’s record includes prior arrests and 25 school zone speeding tickets. He also drove an unregistered vehicle with an obstructed plate and tinted windshield.

The white Toyota sedan hit an underpass near 225th Street around 3:50 a.m. Both occupants were found outside the wreck when police arrived. Investigators are unsure who was driving at the time of impact: 'Since both occupants were out of the car at the time of the crash, investigators haven't figured out who was driving, police said.' The woman died at Long Island Jewish Hospital-Valley Stream; the man was expected to survive. The article highlights ongoing uncertainty about driver identity and underscores the persistent risks on city highways, especially where loss of vehicle control leads to deadly outcomes.

The crash threw Berney from his car, killing him at the scene. The other driver was injured. Vennitti, unlicensed, abandoned his Mercedes and fled on foot. Police arrested him a year later. A grand jury indicted Vennitti for leaving the scene of a fatal crash and driving without a license.

At a press conference, Council Member John Liu warned, “This is not for fancy stuff. This is basic transit maintenance.” Liu said losing congestion pricing would erase a billion dollars in annual MTA revenue, threatening $15 billion in planned upgrades. The money funds new subway cars, buses, station repairs, and safety improvements. U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand joined Liu, stressing millions rely on transit daily. Both officials opposed the repeal, highlighting the risk to the city’s transit backbone. The bill is not numbered, but the threat is clear: without congestion pricing, the city’s streets and subways grow more dangerous for everyone outside a car.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report, from Riders Alliance and Pratt Center, surveyed 1,800 riders. It found nearly 70 percent use the bus to shop, eat, or seek entertainment. The matter highlights that 'bus service is a boon for business.' Council Member actions are not directly cited, but Mayor Adams faces criticism for failing to deliver on bus lane promises. DOT spokesperson Vin Barone said redesigning Flatbush could 'speed up bus service...while also enhancing pedestrian safety.' The report exposes how slow buses hurt working-class, Black, and female riders—many lose pay or jobs due to delays. Business opposition to bus lanes remains, despite evidence that most shoppers arrive by transit or foot. The city’s phased approach leaves much of Flatbush waiting, while riders pay the price in time and safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The analysis, covered by Streetsblog NYC, finds that open streets—car-free corridors—have about half the vacant storefronts of car-filled streets. The report states: 'vibrant public spaces are key to the success of local businesses.' City officials like Ya-Ting Liu, chief public realm officer, and volunteers such as Alex Morano and Brent Bovenzi, praised the program's impact. Bovenzi noted, 'the program is shrinking because too much of the burden falls upon volunteer labor.' The Open Streets program, now permanent, covers over 130 locations but relies heavily on volunteers.
