The measure, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code...increasing civil penalties for operating a bicycle, bicycle with electric assist, or electric scooter on the sidewalk,' seeks to raise fines for sidewalk riding. Council Members Stevens (primary), Gennaro, Ung, Brewer, Brannan, and Morano sponsor the bill. The action: referral to committee. The summary states, 'This bill would increase each of the existing civil penalties for operating a bicycle, a bicycle with electric assist (commonly referred to as an “e-bike”), or an electric scooter on the sidewalk.' No safety analyst assessment is available. The bill focuses on penalties, not on street design or driver behavior.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill summary notes, 'A special fund created in 2018 to pay for transportation 'carrots' intended to counteract the supposed stick of congestion pricing finally has a balance of tens of millions of dollars.' Assembly Member Nily Rozic (D-Queens) secured restored Q46 bus service. Lisa Daglian of the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the MTA called for a weekly City Ticket.

The effort, led by the NYPD and Department of Transportation, aims to keep inebriated motorists off the roads. Senator John Liu, representing District 16, publicly supported the crackdown and advocated for lowering the legal blood alcohol limit from .08 to .05. The campaign includes increased police patrols and active speed cameras. The official matter summary states: 'Drunk driving crackdown: NYC launches aggressive enforcement campaign for New Year’s weekend.' Liu said, 'Cracking down on drunk driving, which continues to destroy lives and families, is the right focus as New Year's approaches.' The DOT notes fatalities from drunk driving have risen nearly 30% in recent years.

State Senator John Liu sponsored the bill and vowed to keep pushing for the project, saying, 'I’m confident we’ll get there.' Hochul’s veto cited budget concerns and the risk of 'duplication and unnecessary bureaucracy.' Advocates like Joby Jacob called the veto a blow to years of organizing, noting that people are forced to walk dirt paths where sidewalks should be.

The projects—Jay Street, West 181st Street, Flushing Main Street, and Archer/Jamaica avenues—were made permanent by Mayor Adams, though enforcement hours were reduced on most. The article notes: “Four busways announced and implemented in 2020 and 2021 during the latter days of the de Blasio administration appear to have sped up service for transit riders, according to official MTA bus speed data.” Bus operators like Orlando Tejeda and Anita Mealy describe persistent illegal parking and double-parking, which slows buses and endangers riders. Despite camera enforcement, violations remain rampant. Council Member Peter Koo opposed the Flushing busway, but it survived legal and political attacks. Riders and drivers report faster trips, but the city’s weak enforcement leaves vulnerable road users at risk. The city’s promise of safer, faster streets is only half-kept.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
