The bill reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to department of transportation approval prior to issuing or renewing a stoop line stand license.' Ung’s bill demands the Department of Transportation (DOT) approve, in writing, every stoop line stand license or renewal. DOT must ensure stands do not block pedestrian flow, factoring in sidewalk crowding and, when needed, site visits. If a stand sits within 10 feet of a structure that narrows the walk for at least 10 feet, DOT must inspect before approval. The bill aims to keep sidewalks clear for people, not commerce.
