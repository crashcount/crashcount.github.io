The Assembly passed it 110-31, with nine city lawmakers—Alec Brook-Krasny, Lester Chang, Simcha Eichenstein, Michael Novakhov, Stacey Pheffer Amato, Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Reilly, David Weprin, Kalman Yeger—opposing. The Streetsblog NYC article, 'Ye Shall Know Their Names! Meet the Dirty Dozen City Pols Who Voted Against Speed Camera Program,' quotes lawmakers dismissing speed cameras as revenue grabs or burdens.

The study, covered by Barbara Russo-Lennon, found a 25% drop in Manhattan traffic jams, with smaller but real declines in the Bronx and New Jersey. The report states: 'Congestion pricing is delivering clear benefits, saving people time and the aggravation of being stuck in traffic.' Council Member Frank Morano and State Sen. Jessica Scarcella-Spanton criticized the program, citing Staten Island’s smaller gains and health concerns. MTA Chair Janno Lieber defended the policy, pointing to improved drive times and transit use.

The plan allows cameras on seven bridges and two tunnels, ticketing drivers who exceed speed limits. Fines start at $50 for a first offense, rising to $75 and $100 for repeat violations within 18 months. Governor Hochul's office called the program 'one more way the governor is working to improve safety on our roads and bridges for workers and travelers alike.' MTA Bridges and Tunnels President Catherine Sheridan said, 'We want to make sure that our maintenance workers and contractors are safe.' The program, part of the $254 billion state budget, will be reviewed again in 2031. The move targets driver speed, a key factor in crash severity, and signals a shift toward automated enforcement on major city crossings.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter centers on whether car access improves safety after a recent attempted rape.

The incident happened late Wednesday night as Salcedo-Chevalier stood by the loading dock. Both he and the driver worked for a freight contractor, not Amazon. The driver, 40, remained at the scene. No criminal charges were filed at the time of reporting. An Amazon spokesperson called it a 'horrible tragedy' and said the company was cooperating with police. The article quotes a coworker: 'He was 34 years old. He had two daughters. He was killed on the job.' The crash highlights the dangers faced by workers in busy warehouse loading zones, where large vehicles maneuver in tight spaces.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

On Staten Island, officers responding to a gun call swerved to avoid a U-turning car, lost control, and crashed into a shuttered restaurant. Both officers were hospitalized with minor injuries. Hours earlier in Manhattan, a Dodge Charger changed lanes, clipped a street sweeper, spun out, and pinned an officer against his patrol SUV. Surveillance footage showed the Charger 'spinning out of control before hitting the officer.' Witness Abi Aguirre described the chaos: 'It was pretty, pretty fast and then he crashed into a sanitation car.' Both incidents highlight the risks posed by high-speed responses and sudden driver maneuvers. Storefronts and sidewalks offered little protection. No pedestrians were reported injured.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
