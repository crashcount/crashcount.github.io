The bill orders the Commissioner of Transportation, with the Chancellor of New York City Public Schools, to conduct yearly studies to find non-operational schools. The matter title reads: 'Annual study to identify non-operational schools and the subsequent removal of speed cameras from eliminated school speed zones.' Council Members Chris Banks (District 42, primary sponsor) and Kamillah Hanks (District 49, co-sponsor) back the measure. If passed, speed cameras must be removed from zones tied to closed schools. The bill’s plain language summary confirms cameras will be pulled from these areas. No safety analyst has weighed in, but the removal of cameras means less oversight where children and families once crossed. The bill awaits further action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Diana I. Ayala is the primary sponsor, joined by over two dozen co-sponsors including De La Rosa, Banks, Ossé, Marte, and others. The bill was laid over by committee on February 10, 2025. The measure would take effect immediately if passed. By capping required coverage, the bill may leave crash victims with less compensation after collisions involving TLC-licensed vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The letter, signed by Assemblymen Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Tannousis, Michael Reilly, Borough President Vito Fossella, State Senator Andrew Lanza, Councilman David Carr, and Borelli, called Brown’s remarks 'a masterclass in bureaucratic ignorance.' Brown said he would welcome removal. The new railcars would replace aging trains from the 1970s.

The meeting focused on the loss of funding for transit accessibility. The matter, described as 'New Yorkers decry loss of congestion pricing money for accessible transit to MTA Board,' drew sharp criticism from disability advocates and riders. State Senator Jessica Scarcella-Spanton, representing District 23, praised the Governor’s pause, calling congestion pricing 'the wrong plan for my constituents.' The pause leaves a $15 billion hole in the MTA’s capital budget, halting upgrades like elevators and ramps at dozens of stations. Advocates warned that without this funding, disabled New Yorkers, seniors, and veterans remain shut out of the subway. The MTA faces a federal mandate to make 95% of stations accessible by 2055, but these projects now stall. Riders demanded action.

Introduced April 18, 2024, it calls on the MTA to 'ensure equitable distribution of OMNY vending machines in the five boroughs, including implementing such machines in at least 30 high-traffic areas in each borough.' Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary sponsor), Amanda Farías, Kevin C. Riley, and Kamillah Hanks back the measure. The bill responds to gaps in OMNY machine rollout, especially on Staten Island, where most stations lack vending machines. Riders without contactless cards or devices face barriers. The council’s push aims to end the transit access gap and force the MTA to serve every borough, not just the busiest or wealthiest.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The fight continues.</p><p class=mb3>On March 14, 2024, Councilwoman Kamillah Hanks (District 49) stood with Staten Island officials at a press conference to oppose New York’s congestion pricing plan. The event, covered by nypost.com, highlighted concerns that the $15 toll for driving south of 60th Street in Manhattan would, as Hanks said, 'have a negative impact in neighborhoods of color in the outer boroughs.' Hanks and others argued the plan would burden working residents and increase pollution in Staten Island’s minority communities. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s environmental assessment confirmed air quality could worsen in Staten Island, the Bronx, and New Jersey, even as it improves in Manhattan. The MTA pledged $130 million for clean-up, but local leaders remain unconvinced. Hanks’s opposition underscores the ongoing debate over who pays—and who suffers—when the city tries to curb car traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The sponsors argue the current one-transfer rule hits hardest for riders with long, complex trips, often in transit deserts.
