A 2022 law by Council Member Carlina Rivera requires publication and annual updates; this release arrived over eight months late. The plan is "intended to connect gaps across NYC's bike and pedestrian paths." It names early action corridors and uses $7.25 million in federal funds to write corridor plans by 2028. Construction timelines are missing. Parks Commissioner Iris Rodriguez-Rosa says it maps "strengths and weaknesses." The Midtown Greenway showcase still leaves the East Side gap. Safety impact: none yet. Without implementation details, funding, or accountability, conditions do not change.
