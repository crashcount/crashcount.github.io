But the wounds run deep.</strong> In the last twelve months, 80 people were hurt in 99 crashes in Bay Terrace-Clearview. Six suffered serious injuries. Two were children under 18. Six were seniors over 65. The numbers do not heal. They do not forget. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Data source</a></p><p><strong>Crashes do not care about age.</strong> A 78-year-old woman was struck by a sedan backing up. Two boys, ages 10 and 11, were crushed in a Cross Island Parkway pileup. A 73-year-old man was injured behind the wheel. The road takes from the young and the old, the careful and the unlucky alike.</p><h3 id=the-machinery-of-harm>The Machinery of Harm</h3><p><strong>SUVs, sedans, and trucks do the damage.</strong> In the last three years, not a single cyclist or pedestrian was killed here. But cars and trucks left 10 people with serious injuries. No bikes, no mopeds, no motorcycles. Just steel, speed, and human error.</p><p><strong>Speed is the silent killer.</strong> Unsafe speed was a factor in several of the worst crashes. Lane changes, failure to yield, backing up without looking—these are not acts of God. They are choices, repeated until someone pays.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-delay>Leadership: Action or Delay?</h3><p><strong>The city has the power to lower speed limits.</strong> Albany passed Sammy’s Law. The Council and the Mayor can act. But the limit here is still higher than it should be. Cameras that catch speeders and red-light runners are proven to save lives, but their future is always in doubt. Each delay is another roll of the dice.</p><p><strong>Local leaders must do more.</strong> Every day without action is a day closer to the next crash. The numbers are not fate. They are a warning.</p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p><strong>Demand more.</strong> Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Tell them to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. Tell them to protect speed cameras. Tell them to stop waiting for another child or elder to bleed on the asphalt. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
