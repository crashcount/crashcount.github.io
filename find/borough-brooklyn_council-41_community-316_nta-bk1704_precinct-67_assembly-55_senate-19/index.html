Eight seriously hurt.</strong> In the last twelve months, 252 people have been injured in traffic crashes across East Flatbush-Remsen Village. The deadliest blows fall on the old and the young. A 65-year-old woman was killed crossing with the signal at Rutland Road and E 95th Street this spring. She was crushed by a sedan making a left turn. She never made it to the other side. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p><strong>Crashes come steady, not sudden.</strong> In just the first half of this year, crashes are up.

The street does not care.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p><strong>Council Member Darlene Mealy</strong> co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, aiming to clear sightlines and protect people on foot. The bill sits in committee. No law yet. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council Legistar</a></p><p><strong>State Senator Roxanne Persaud</strong> voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed-limiting devices.

The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code...exempting ambulettes from certain bus lane restrictions and allowing them to double park to assist passengers,' would let ambulettes drive, stop, and double-park in bus lanes to help passengers. Council Member Julie Menin sponsors, joined by Linda Lee, Frank Morano, Eric Dinowitz, Lynn C. Schulman, Kamillah Hanks, Carlina Rivera, and Chris Banks. Allowing more vehicles to double-park and block bus lanes increases risk for pedestrians and cyclists at the curb. The city’s most vulnerable will face more conflict and less safe space.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The driver, charged with manslaughter and fleeing, sped through a red light. The crash happened on a corridor where Mayor Adams paused a safety redesign after business opposition. Streetsblog notes, 'Every death is preventable.' Since the redesign was halted, 96 crashes have injured 80 people. The Department of Transportation’s plan would have reduced lanes and added protections. Community Board 7 supported it, but the project stalled.
