The resolution, introduced April 14, 2022, and filed at session's end on December 31, 2023, urges the MTA to 'adjust schedules for distant subway terminal lines to include more peak-direction rush hour trains for commuters to travel to central economic hubs.' Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by Brooks-Powers, Hanif, Bottcher, and others. The bill responds to service gaps hitting outer boroughs, end-of-line stations, and transit deserts—areas where 600,000 New Yorkers live with poor transit access. The council points to pandemic-era staffing shortages and train cancellations that left riders stranded. The measure aims to push the MTA to close these gaps and connect more New Yorkers to jobs and opportunity.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The fight is for safe, clear passage.</p><p class=mb3>On February 2, 2022, Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine and City Council Member Tiffany Cabán called for the City of New York to take over sidewalk and curb snow removal, shifting responsibility from property owners to the Department of Sanitation. The proposal, discussed in Streetsblog NYC, highlights failures in the current system: 'We should have public snow removal from sidewalks. Currently, we are placing undue burdens on pedestrians, especially those who use wheelchairs, canes, or walkers, or who push strollers,' Cabán said. Levine noted, 'This is a serious challenge for disabled and elderly New Yorkers, as well as their caregivers.' Community Board 4 and pedestrian advocates echoed these concerns, citing blocked bus stops and curb ramps. The Department of Sanitation expressed readiness if given more funding. The push aims to end patchwork clearance and protect those most at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
