The matter summary states: 'State lawmakers proposed spending $90 million this year to improve bus service frequency and expand the scope of the MTA's free bus pilot.' The proposal, supported by Sen. Michael Gianaris and Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, also adopts the FARES Act, extending half-price MetroCards to commuter rail, and funds new discounts for seniors and people with disabilities. Lawmakers back the QueensLink rail project and recommend subway improvements. They reject tougher toll enforcement, instead supporting the Toll Payer Protection Act.

Riders in every borough stand to gain.</p><p class=mb3>Bill proposals in the New York State Assembly and Senate, introduced in February 2024 by State Sen. Michael Gianaris and Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani, seek $90 million for increased bus service and 15 more free bus routes. These measures, part of the 'Get Congestion Pricing Right' package, appear in both houses’ 'one-house' budgets as of March 12, 2024. The matter summary states: 'City buses would run more frequently under new proposals from state legislators in Albany, who included increased bus services and new fare discounts in budget proposals.' Mamdani and Gianaris led the push, citing the need for better transit before congestion pricing launches this summer. Their plan includes expanded Fair Fares, new discounts for seniors and disabled riders, and a weekly CityTicket for unlimited intracity rail travel. Advocates and lawmakers argue these steps are critical for equity and access, especially as the city prepares to charge drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street. The proposals now enter negotiations with Governor Hochul.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the New York State Governor to sign, legislation, which would create unlimited transfers within the two-hour period of paying the Metropolitan Transportation Authority subway or bus fare for pay-per-ride users.' Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez leads as primary sponsor, joined by Riley, Stevens, Hanif, Won, Feliz, Salaam, Hanks, Farías, De La Rosa, Cabán, Williams, Hudson, Ung, Ossé, Banks, and Holden. The sponsors argue the current one-transfer rule hits hardest for riders with long, complex trips, often in transit deserts.

The bill, now before the legislature, seeks to expand New York City's fare-free bus pilot from five to fifteen lines, with three in each borough. The measure promises $45 million for better bus reliability and frequency, targeting low-income and disadvantaged communities. The bill summary states: 'expand and extend New York City's fare-free bus pilot program.' Gianaris, as sponsor, aims to boost mass transit before congestion pricing takes effect. Supporters, including Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, Riders Alliance, and the Transport Workers Union, stress that affordable, frequent buses are vital for safety and equity. MTA Chair Janno Lieber backs more service but warns that bus lanes lag behind. The bill focuses on routes that can handle more buses without new infrastructure, aiming to make public transit a real alternative to cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Introduced February 28, 2024, it calls for an advisory board on school crossing guard deployment. The board would include the NYPD, Department of Transportation, and Department of Education. According to the bill summary: 'Such advisory board would be responsible for submitting biannual reports, relating to recommended deployment of school crossing guards, to the Mayor, the City Council Speaker and the Police Commissioner.' Council Member Kamillah Hanks leads as primary sponsor, joined by Stevens, Schulman, Salaam, Won, Cabán, Riley, Farías, Restler, Williams, Narcisse, Banks, Louis, Brooks-Powers, Marmorato, and the Bronx Borough President. The bill demands city agencies work together, but it does not guarantee more guards or safer crossings. The danger for children at city intersections remains.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Members Julie Won (primary sponsor), Lincoln Restler, Tiffany Cabán, and the Brooklyn Borough President (by request) back the move. The resolution highlights that similar laws in other states have improved safety for all road users. It stresses that pedestrian rights remain unchanged—cyclists must still yield. The bill reflects a shift toward laws that recognize the realities of cycling and aim to reduce deadly car-bike conflicts.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The driver, Stanley Manel, was charged with failure to yield and failure to exercise due care. Gonzalez, representing District 59, called for the state to pass stricter traffic laws targeting drivers with multiple school zone speed camera violations, noting Manel's history of speeding. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher joined Gonzalez, highlighting the lack of traffic calming on Nassau Avenue, where Aber was killed. Gallagher stated, 'Nothing to slow traffic on Nassau: no signal, stop sign, even a painted crosswalk.' The officials urged immediate installation of pedestrian safety measures and renewed calls for policy changes to protect vulnerable road users. The incident marks the first traffic fatality in Northern Brooklyn in 2024, underscoring systemic failures in street design and enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city’s inaction kills.</p><p class=mb3>On February 25, 2024, after Danielle Aber was killed by a repeat speeding driver in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, a coalition of elected officials demanded sweeping changes. The group—Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, Council Member Lincoln Restler, and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velázquez—called for passage of two state bills: one mandating intelligent speed assistance devices for drivers with six or more speeding tickets in a year, and 'Sammy’s Law,' which would let the City Council lower speed limits. Their statement read, 'We’re calling on the New York State legislature to pass two critical bills that would lead to fewer incidents of traffic violence.' They also urged the Department of Transportation to install raised crosswalks and daylighting at intersections, and to convert Nassau and Norman avenues to one-way streets. The officials’ push highlights the deadly gap in accountability and infrastructure that leaves vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
