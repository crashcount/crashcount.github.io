DOT’s Chris Brunson said, “The narrower street width for vehicles will de-incentivize double parking on the corridor.” The redesign removes a travel lane, adds a protected bike lane, and aims to curb driver behavior that leads to crashes. Between 2022 and 2024, 165 crashes on this mile-long stretch caused one death and injured 15 cyclists and 23 pedestrians. Most pedestrian injuries happened while crossing with the light, showing drivers failed to yield. The plan targets excess road capacity and prioritizes vulnerable users on a Vision Zero Priority Corridor.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city rejected Lyft’s plan to add speedometers, demanding immediate compliance. Deputy Mayor Mastro wrote, 'We have requested that you immediately implement this new 15 mph speed limit for Citi Bike e-bikes, and you declined to do so.' Citi Bike agreed to the mandate, though previously voiced concerns. In 2021, e-bike injuries (1,170) and deaths (9) far outpaced those on pedal bikes (236 injuries, 2 deaths). The order follows a crash where a 3-year-old was struck by an e-bike in South Williamsburg. The city will collect public comments before finalizing the rule.
