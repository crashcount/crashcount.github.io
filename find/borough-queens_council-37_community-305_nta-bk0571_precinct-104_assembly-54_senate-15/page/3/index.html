Police are still investigating.</p><p class=mb3>According to amny (published May 13, 2025), a fatal crash on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway left a motorcyclist dead. The article reports, "Police arrested 44-year-old Laura Cordova... for driving without a license and using a vehicle without ignition interlock." The incident took place near Tillary Street just before 10 p.m. on May 10. The motorcyclist, 27-year-old Sean Johnson, struck Cordova's stopped Honda Accord and later died at Brooklyn Hospital Center. Cordova was required to use an ignition interlock device due to a prior conviction but was not charged with DUI. The NYPD Highway Collision Investigation Squad continues to investigate. The case highlights issues of unlicensed driving and compliance with court-ordered safety measures.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
