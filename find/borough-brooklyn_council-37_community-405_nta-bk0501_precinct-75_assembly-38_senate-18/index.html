The Council passed the bill with a veto-proof majority. Council Member Sandy Nurse, the sponsor, called out Adams for breaking his 2022 promise to raise pay standards. The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection backed the bill, saying it would close gaps in pay protections. According to safety analysts, this event concerns labor protections and does not directly affect street safety or infrastructure for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Eighteen caucus members back the bill, aiming to force a vote this year. The matter: 'eliminate parking within 20 feet of an intersection.' Council Member Sandy Nurse called daylighting 'a proven, effective way to make our streets safer.' DOT raised doubts about non-hardened daylighting, but safety analysts say restricting parking near intersections improves visibility, reduces collisions, and protects people on foot and bike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Despite this, his administration 'put the brakes on a potentially life-saving road redesign,' favoring business interests.
