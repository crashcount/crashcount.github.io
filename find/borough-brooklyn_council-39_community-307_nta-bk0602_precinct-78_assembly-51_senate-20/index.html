No elevators. State officials promise lifts. The climb ends. Access rises. Vulnerable riders—elderly, disabled, parents—gain ground. Transit grows safer. Streets may see fewer cars.</p><p class=mb3>""Adding elevators to the station is a huge win for transit equity and for the thousands of riders who rely on this stop every day."" -- Jo Anne Simon</p><p class=mb3>On August 10, 2025, state officials announced elevators for Smith-9th Street station in Gowanus, Brooklyn. The station, nearly 90 feet above ground, is the city’s tallest and lacks elevators. The matter: 'New York City's tallest subway station will soon have elevators, ending the difficult climb to the platform.' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes led the announcement. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon praised the move. MTA chief accessibility officer Quemuel Arroyo backed the upgrade. Adding elevators boosts access for people with mobility challenges. It makes transit a real option, shifting trips away from cars and easing danger for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure sits with the Transportation Committee. Council Member Julie Won introduced it after deadly crashes in her district. Eighteen caucus members back the bill, aiming to force a vote this year. The matter: 'eliminate parking within 20 feet of an intersection.' Council Member Sandy Nurse called daylighting 'a proven, effective way to make our streets safer.' DOT raised doubts about non-hardened daylighting, but safety analysts say restricting parking near intersections improves visibility, reduces collisions, and protects people on foot and bike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
