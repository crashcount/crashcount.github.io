The bill, stalled for years in Albany, gained urgency after a fatal Brooklyn crash on April 1, 2025. Gallagher, joined by State Senator Andrew Gounardes and city Comptroller Brad Lander, rallied at Borough Hall, urging swift passage. The bill targets drivers with 11 or more license points in 24 months, or six camera violations in a year. Gallagher said, 'A lot of what happens when it comes to getting a bill to the top of the list is really through a movement and folks fighting for the bill.' Gounardes added, 'It’s no longer simply enough to shake our heads in despair when these preventable tragedies occur—it’s time for us to act.' The legislation mirrors past efforts like the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Act, aiming to hold reckless drivers accountable and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, not a council bill but a DOT action, covers a seven-mile route along Bailey Avenue, Sedgwick Avenue, Depot Place, Exterior Street, E. 135th Street, Lincoln Avenue, and Bruckner Boulevard. The DOT cited access issues with state and private landowners, abandoning Mayor Adams’s earlier promise of a true waterfront path. The official summary states: 'protected bike lanes on streets near the waterfront, rather than a true waterfront greenway.' Advocates like Chauncy Young and Laura Solis welcomed protected lanes but lamented the loss of a car-free riverside route. Mayor Adams claimed the project would help undo highway devastation in the Bronx. Still, the plan leaves vulnerable road users exposed to traffic, not shielded by water’s edge.

They called for increased federal funding for the MTA’s $68.4 billion capital plan, citing that New York’s transit system carries 43% of U.S. riders but receives only 17% of federal formula funds. The letter urges, 'Mass transit must be federally funded at a level commensurate to its importance.' Stewart-Cousins, mentioned as a key signatory, previously rejected the capital plan due to a $35 billion shortfall. The group asks for $14 billion in federal support, up from $13 billion in the last plan. The MTA warns that without this funding, critical infrastructure—power, signaling, accessibility—remains at risk. The request is urgent.

The CBC calls for a 6 percent hike in fares, tolls, and vehicle fees—higher than the planned 4 percent. Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie said tax hikes are on the table. Governor Hochul’s office backs a payroll tax hike, but the CBC wants it regionalized. The CBC’s Andrew Rein said, “We have to prioritize state-of-good-repair, basic modernization, and delay some of the system expansions.” The report warns that failing to fund maintenance will gut service, repeating past crises.

The measure follows the passage of Sammy’s Law, which lets the city set its own speed limits. The Department of Transportation cited ten severe injuries and one death in Dumbo over five years. The new zone covers streets packed with pedestrians, from Furman to Navy and Hudson, and John to Sands and the BQE. Restler said, 'Data has shown that a one mile per hour increase in speed results in a nearly three percent increase in mortality.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez added, 'Lowering vehicle speed limits by even a few miles per hour could be the difference between life or death in a traffic crash.' The change will take effect after a public comment period. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso called for more slow zones in high-crash neighborhoods. The city plans to expand 20 mph limits to over 250 locations by the end of 2025.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Sirens followed.</p><p class=mb3>The NY Daily News (March 15, 2025) reports two Staten Island police officers crashed their cruiser into a closed restaurant while responding to an emergency. The officers 'lost control of their marked cruiser and slammed into the front of a Mexican restaurant' after swerving to avoid a car making a U-turn. Both officers sustained minor injuries. Hours earlier in Manhattan, a Dodge Charger 'spinning out of control' struck a police officer, pinning him against his patrol vehicle. Witness Abi Aguirre described, 'He crashed into a sanitation car... then he's doing circles and then he crashed out with a police car.' Both the officer and the driver were hospitalized. The incidents highlight risks from high-speed responses and erratic driving, raising questions about street design and emergency protocols.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report, required by the City Council, reveals the city missed mandates for protected bike lanes (29.3 of 50 miles) and bus lanes (17.9 of 30 miles) for the third year running. The matter summary states: 'New York City has failed to meet legally required benchmarks for redesigning streets for bikes, buses, and pedestrians due to a lack of resources and political interference.' Mayor Eric Adams is named as the main obstacle. The report cites staff shortages, shrinking divisions, and political pushback—especially the mayor’s role in killing the Fordham Road busway. Former DOT commissioner Polly Trottenberg warned the plan needed more funding and a new approach. Advocates and officials say Adams’s lack of support left the city’s most vulnerable road users exposed. The law’s promise is broken.
