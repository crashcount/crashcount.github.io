The proposal, approved unanimously by Community Board 6's Transportation Committee, removes car lanes for a protected bike lane, a dedicated bus lane, and pedestrian improvements. The DOT will install parking-protected bike lanes, painted sidewalk extensions, and pedestrian islands. The official matter summary states: 'The proposal will reduce the roadway from six or seven lanes for cars to three moving lanes, two parking lanes, plus a bus lane and a bike lane.' DOT Project Manager Esteban Doyle said the plan reallocates space to match actual use. Community members praised the move. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not specify what design was implemented or how it affected pedestrians and cyclists, so no safety impact can be determined.' Installation is set for summer or fall 2025.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Assembly Transportation Chair William Magnarelli cited due process concerns. Brandy Nannini, Ben Furnas, and Frank Harris condemned the inaction.

The plan, supported by Council Members Lincoln Restler, Shahana Hanif, Crystal Hudson, and Rita Joseph, aims to improve transit and pedestrian safety. The matter summary states: 'A proposed center-running bus lane on Flatbush Avenue... is being considered by the NYC Department of Transportation (DOT) as a way to improve transit, calm traffic, and enhance pedestrian safety.' The project faces delays and political pushback, including the removal of a protected bike lane after developer objections. A safety analyst notes: 'Center-running bus lanes typically reduce conflicts between buses, cars, pedestrians, and cyclists, calm traffic, and can enable street redesigns that improve safety and comfort for vulnerable road users.' The DOT will present a detailed plan in the fall. The final decision rests with Mayor Adams.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

After hitting Esiyok, Ali continued, injuring a cyclist, two more pedestrians, and crashing into a van.

The $9 toll stands. Streets stay crowded. The fight moves to court. Safety projects hang in the balance. The city waits. The deadline looms.</p><p class=mb3>Patch reported on May 27, 2025, that District Judge Lewis Liman issued a temporary restraining order blocking the U.S. Department of Transportation from withholding federal funding as leverage against New York City's congestion pricing program. The judge's order 'bars the DOT from engaging in any retaliatory measures' and prevents cancellation of the toll, which charges drivers $9 to enter Manhattan below 60th Street. Federal officials had threatened to withhold funds for road and street safety projects if the city continued the program. The order lasts until June 9, keeping the toll in place and leaving critical infrastructure funding uncertain. The article highlights the standoff between federal authorities and city leaders, with safety and mobility projects at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
