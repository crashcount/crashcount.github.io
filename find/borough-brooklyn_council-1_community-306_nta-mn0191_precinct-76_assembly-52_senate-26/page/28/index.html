Lawmakers talk, but danger endures.</p><p class=mb3>This policy analysis, published March 28, 2022, reviews the E-BIKE Act and related state bills. The E-BIKE Act, once part of the Build Back Better Act, proposed a federal tax credit for e-bike buyers. Congress reduced the credit from $1,500 to $900 and limited eligibility, stalling progress. The article states, 'By replacing car trips, e-bikes can simultaneously lower emissions, improve street safety, and boost riders' health.' John MacArthur, a transportation program manager, notes that local and state lawmakers now lead with rebates and incentives. Council members and legislators in Vermont, Colorado, California, Washington, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Oklahoma have introduced or supported bills for e-bike rebates. Despite the momentum, no current state proposal pairs incentives with new bike infrastructure. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians and cyclists—remain at risk as car dominance continues and federal action lags.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

State Senator Andrew Gounardes, district 26, echoed Adams: 'It makes no sense that the city cannot control its own destiny on these streets.' Adams admitted NYPD traffic enforcement lags, with summonses down by more than half since 2019. Twenty-seven pedestrians have died so far this year—three more than last year.

State Senator Andrew Gounardes echoed Adams, questioning why lawmakers outside the city control local street safety. Adams admitted NYPD traffic enforcement has dropped and pledged to prioritize it.

Marte pledged support for urgent changes. The op-ed notes that pedestrians are 65% of users but get as little as 10% of street space.

City officials stay silent.</p><p class=mb3>On March 2, 2022, cycling groups Bike New York and Bike South Brooklyn sounded the alarm over the crumbling Ocean Parkway bike path in Brooklyn. In a letter to the Parks Department and Department of Transportation, they wrote: "Asphalt is heaving and cracking at many points from the northern end of the bikeway to Avenue R... These conditions will worsen as long as they are not repaired or addressed." The advocates criticized the slow pace of repairs, noting the southern section will not be fixed until 2023. Jon Orcutt, Bike New York Advocacy Director, said, "Parks' inability to move projects like these or stay ahead of decay poses big problems for an expanded citywide greenway system." The letter urges long-term maintenance plans and calls for safer slip street designs, demanding drivers stop before crossing bike lanes. No city officials responded. The advocates cite a recent cyclist fatality as proof of the deadly risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'City Covers Up Failure After Cyclist Death, With Hastily Made Repairs After Months of 311 Complaints,' details how residents filed at least eight 311 complaints to the Department of Transportation and 14 to the Department of Environmental Protection since 2019. Both agencies failed to fix the hazard. Only after Wen-Chiang’s death did city workers patch the road, but the repair was rushed and left uneven, creating a new danger. DOT spokesman Vin Barone called it 'a tragedy' and said an investigation is underway. DEP claimed the subsurface infrastructure was sound. No council members are named.

The sedan was changing lanes while the pick-up truck was going straight ahead. The collision caused a head injury and concussion to the right rear passenger, a 27-year-old woman, who was conscious and not ejected. The report lists 'Following Too Closely' as the contributing factor for both vehicles. The pick-up truck sustained damage to its center back end, and the sedan's left front bumper was damaged. No safety equipment was noted for the injured passenger. The drivers were licensed and operating their vehicles legally, but their failure to maintain safe distance led to the crash.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The announcement, covered by Streetsblog NYC, focused on broad climate issues. Advocates, including Jaqi Cohen and Kevin Garcia, pressed the new office to prioritize transportation emissions, quoting, 'improving transit options and creating access for environmental justice communities, while also curbing harmful diesel emissions.' Aggarwala voiced support for congestion pricing, pedestrianization, and bus lanes, promising collaboration with the Department of Transportation. Transportation emissions have dropped only 5% since 2007, while car ownership rises. Advocates urge the climate team to work with DOT on bus and bike lanes, last-mile delivery, and cargo bikes to meet climate and justice goals.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Planners shift focus. Streets change. Fewer cars, more homes. Demand-based pricing rises. Public space gets new life. The old rules crumble. The car’s grip loosens. Vulnerable road users watch the system bend.</p><p class=mb3>This policy analysis, published January 31, 2022, reviews the swift rollback of mandatory parking minimums across U.S. cities and states. The article, 'Analysis: The Decline and Fall of Mandatory Parking Minimums,' highlights reforms like removing off-street parking requirements, charging demand-based prices, and investing parking revenue in public services. Cities such as South Bend, Sacramento, Berkeley, Minneapolis, and others lead the charge. State-level changes in Oregon, California, and Connecticut follow. The analysis credits UCLA Professor Donald Shoup’s influence. No council bill number or committee is cited, as this is a legislative trend, not a single bill. The piece notes, 'Minimum parking requirements are on the way out.' These reforms embed parking changes within broader housing and zoning efforts, aiming to cut car dependency and boost affordable housing. No direct safety analyst note is included, but the trend signals a shift in urban priorities that could reshape streets for all users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal, discussed on January 28, 2022, has not advanced to a formal committee or bill stage. The matter: 'Who Wants To Give The MTA Half A Billion Dollars?' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes backs progressive funding, saying, 'Funding high-ridership bus routes and the subway such that transit options would be arriving every six minutes is something we need to be pushing for.' Comptroller Brad Lander and advocates like the Riders Alliance demand $500 million per year to avoid fare hikes and boost service. The push is clear: more frequent, affordable transit keeps vulnerable New Yorkers out of harm’s way.

Vulnerable lives pay.</p><p class=mb3>This editorial, published January 27, 2022, argues for a much higher congestion pricing toll than the $13–$15 range under discussion. Contributor Charles Komanoff, using his Balanced Transportation Analyzer, finds that an $80 toll would maximize net societal benefit, nearly $10 billion yearly. The article states: 'A $13 or $15 congestion toll might be all the politicians think they can achieve, but such a low fee will fail to maximize the net societal benefit.' Komanoff’s analysis shows the current plan extracts only half the possible benefit while charging less than a fifth of the optimal toll. No council member is named; this is an expert’s call to action. The piece notes that higher tolls could fund subway safety upgrades and faster trains, but the city’s political will remains weak.

A 75-year-old pedestrian was hit midblock by a driver in a Lincoln Corsair. Gallagher wrote, 'Extremely distressing to see another serious crash injuring a pedestrian on McGuinness. I’m thinking about the victim and continuing to fight for our improvements, which can’t come soon enough.' The street, notorious for speeding and poor crossings, is slated for a $39 million redesign after years of advocacy and deadly crashes. The Make McGuinness Safe Coalition and residents have pushed for a road diet, bike lanes, and traffic calming.

In ‘assertive’ mode, Teslas tailgate, perform unsafe passes, and roll through stops—illegal actions in most states. Phil Koopman, an autonomous vehicle expert, said, “Basically, Tesla is programming its cars to break laws.” The report highlights a regulatory gap: U.S. law punishes drivers, not manufacturers. Some states shield automakers, while others seek accountability. NHTSA investigates, but action lags. Tesla faces no immediate recall.
