The bill, backed by New Yorkers for Transportation Equity, was introduced last year and is under consideration. The measure’s summary promises to 'improve air quality and reduce fatal crashes.' Gounardes, representing Brooklyn’s western edge, champions the shift: 'A new approach will not only protect our climate, but also make New York a safer, more affordable place to live.' Analysis from the Rocky Mountain Institute projects 593 fewer traffic deaths each year, with thousands more lives saved through active transportation. The bill’s focus is clear: less driving, more safety, cleaner air, and real savings for families.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan will close the current narrow walkway this fall and replace it with an eight-foot-wide path for cyclists and pedestrians by year’s end. The project is part of a broader push to make three MTA bridges accessible to non-drivers. MTA Construction and Development President Jamie Torres-Springer said, 'The MTA has made great progress in planned capital improvements to pedestrian and bike accessibility on bridges.' Local cyclist Allegra LeGrande called the move overdue, noting, 'If they build it they will come.' The project includes a cantilevered ramp for wheelchair access and improved exits. While the path is closed, a shuttle bus may run for six weeks. The overhaul answers years of calls for safe, direct bike connections between the Bronx and Manhattan, and throws down a challenge to city agencies to fix the patchwork of local bike paths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Departments of Sanitation and Transportation used narrow plows to clear bike lanes, including the East River bridges and key protected paths. Commissioner Jessica Tisch said, "We put salt on every street, every highway, every bike lane in the city, we've done multiple passes at it." The DOT boasted about clearing the Brooklyn Bridge bike path before sunrise. Citi Bike stayed open. But sidewalks, left to property owners, remained treacherous. Mayor Adams praised road crews while standing by snow-covered pedestrian space. Commissioner Tisch warned, "We want those sidewalks safe tomorrow." The city’s effort favored cyclists and drivers. Pedestrians were left behind, forced to wait for landlords to shovel.

Gounardes warns, 'If we’re just going to use that money to double down on the transportation of the past, on just purely automobile usage, we’re making a great mistake.' Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance says the bill is about shifting priorities to climate and equity. Advocates note that over 90 percent of recent infrastructure funds went to roads, not transit. The measure would require revisions or offsets for projects that don’t cut driving. Gov. Hochul’s office declined comment. The bill aims to halt the cycle of road expansion, rising traffic, and mounting deaths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Sanitation will install stationary curbside trash enclosures for buildings with 31 or more units in Manhattan Community Board 9 by spring 2025. The policy, championed by Mayor Adams, follows a pilot that cut rat sightings by 68 percent. Adams called the new side-loading truck 'the future of New York City garbage collection.' The plan replaces about 150,000 parking spots—five percent of the city’s total—with trash containers. Smaller buildings will use wheeled bins on sidewalks. Advocates support the move, urging shared containers to keep sidewalks clear. Some warn that too many bins could harm businesses and streetscapes. The city will study environmental impacts before rollout. The expansion aims to reclaim space from cars, clear sidewalks, and improve safety for pedestrians and other vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He stresses that larger vehicles are far more likely to kill other road users. He argues that electrification and smaller cars alone cannot cut emissions or deaths enough.
