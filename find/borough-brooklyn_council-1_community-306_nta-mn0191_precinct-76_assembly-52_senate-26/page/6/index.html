The letter called the block a 'missing link in Brooklyn’s protected bike lane network.' Brooklyn Community Board 2 backed the demand. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and Borough Commissioner Keith Bray offered only vague replies. The block’s exclusion traces to a mayoral advisor’s intervention for developer Two Trees. Advocates like Kathy Park Price slammed the city: 'Private interests are able to redesign our streets, prioritizing vehicles over safety at a critical corridor.' Despite unanimous support, DOT keeps the street dangerous. The city’s inaction leaves cyclists exposed and the community frustrated.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The driver died at the scene, unidentified and burned beyond recognition. The officers failed to report the crash to supervisors and signed off for the day. Both were suspended as the NYPD and Attorney General investigate. The incident follows a recent NYPD policy change that bars pursuits for non-violent crimes.

These devices cap speed at 5 mph over the limit for those with 11 or more license points in 24 months or six camera tickets in a year. The rally followed a fatal Gravesend crash that killed a mother and her two daughters. Hanif and other lawmakers called current enforcement—ticketing, suspensions, fines, jail—ineffective.

Gounardes added, 'It’s no longer simply enough to shake our heads in despair when these preventable tragedies occur—it’s time for us to act.'

Advocates, including Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives, blame Albany’s delay in passing Senator Andrew Gounardes’s bill to require speed-limiting devices for repeat offenders.

The plan, not a council bill but a DOT action, covers a seven-mile route along Bailey Avenue, Sedgwick Avenue, Depot Place, Exterior Street, E. 135th Street, Lincoln Avenue, and Bruckner Boulevard. The DOT cited access issues with state and private landowners, abandoning Mayor Adams’s earlier promise of a true waterfront path. The official summary states: 'protected bike lanes on streets near the waterfront, rather than a true waterfront greenway.' Advocates like Chauncy Young and Laura Solis welcomed protected lanes but lamented the loss of a car-free riverside route. Mayor Adams claimed the project would help undo highway devastation in the Bronx. Still, the plan leaves vulnerable road users exposed to traffic, not shielded by water’s edge.

They called for increased federal funding for the MTA’s $68.4 billion capital plan, citing that New York’s transit system carries 43% of U.S. riders but receives only 17% of federal formula funds. The letter urges, 'Mass transit must be federally funded at a level commensurate to its importance.' Stewart-Cousins, mentioned as a key signatory, previously rejected the capital plan due to a $35 billion shortfall. The group asks for $14 billion in federal support, up from $13 billion in the last plan. The MTA warns that without this funding, critical infrastructure—power, signaling, accessibility—remains at risk. The request is urgent.

The CBC recommends slashing $17 billion, scrapping expansion plans like the Interborough Express, and boosting city and state contributions by $9 billion. The CBC calls for a 6 percent hike in fares, tolls, and vehicle fees—higher than the planned 4 percent. Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie said tax hikes are on the table. Governor Hochul’s office backs a payroll tax hike, but the CBC wants it regionalized. The CBC’s Andrew Rein said, “We have to prioritize state-of-good-repair, basic modernization, and delay some of the system expansions.” The report warns that failing to fund maintenance will gut service, repeating past crises.

The measure follows the passage of Sammy’s Law, which lets the city set its own speed limits. The Department of Transportation cited ten severe injuries and one death in Dumbo over five years. The new zone covers streets packed with pedestrians, from Furman to Navy and Hudson, and John to Sands and the BQE. Restler said, 'Data has shown that a one mile per hour increase in speed results in a nearly three percent increase in mortality.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez added, 'Lowering vehicle speed limits by even a few miles per hour could be the difference between life or death in a traffic crash.' The change will take effect after a public comment period. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso called for more slow zones in high-crash neighborhoods. The city plans to expand 20 mph limits to over 250 locations by the end of 2025.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The program, described as 'bus-mounted camera tickets to drivers who double-park along bus routes or park in bus stops,' has issued over 400,000 tickets in five months. The ACE system grew from 623 buses on 14 routes to 1,000 buses on 34 routes by November. MTA spokesperson Laura Cala-Rauch said the program 'is having a big impact on speeding buses and improving the quality of life for New Yorkers.' Data from Jehiah Czebotar shows cameras now issue 76.4% of bus lane and stop tickets—93% by December. Bus speeds rose 5%, crashes involving buses dropped 20%, and emissions fell up to 10%. Persistent violators remain, with some drivers racking up five tickets. Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein called for escalating fines and legislative changes to target repeat offenders. The ACE program marks a shift toward automated, consistent enforcement, but loopholes for chronic blockers persist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
