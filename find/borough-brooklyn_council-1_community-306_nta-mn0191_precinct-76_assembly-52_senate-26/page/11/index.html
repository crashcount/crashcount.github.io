It’s necessary to have a lane that is especially for the bikes,' said Cruz Rosas-Ponzon. Advocacy groups, including Transportation Alternatives, and delivery worker organizations highlight the deadly risk for working-class immigrants and deliveristas.

Stewart-Cousins is mentioned as a key recipient. The bill would force agencies to prioritize projects for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit riders over highway expansion.

The study summary states, 'America would reap massive public health and emissions-reduction benefits from electrifying its bus fleet.' Researcher Sofia Martinez said, 'We definitely need to be advocates for electrification, and for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants in any way we can.' The study urges more federal subsidies to speed up the transition. Even replacing aging diesel buses as they retire would cut 35 million tons of CO2. The report stresses the greatest public health gains would come from electrifying buses in the most densely populated neighborhoods, where diesel pollution hits hardest.

The law, passed in the state budget, excludes wide, multi-lane roads in the outer boroughs. Adams said, 'I do believe as New Yorkers we need to slow down,' but repeatedly referred to preventable crashes as 'accidents,' a term advocates reject for removing driver responsibility. The City Council must legislate any citywide speed limit change, while the Department of Transportation (DOT) can adjust limits on specific streets after community input. Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers and Speaker Adrienne Adams pledged to 'collaborate and negotiate' with City Hall. Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi stressed the need for street redesign and legal reform, noting, 'This is not a problem that goes away on its own.' Despite new authority, the Adams administration has lagged on safe street infrastructure.

Barriers remain for many.</p><p class=mb3>On May 1, 2024, the MTA and city officials launched a 90-day OMNY pilot for 50 Fair Fares participants. The pilot, announced by MTA Chief Customer Officer Shanifah Rieara, aims to expand OMNY access for low-income riders. Fair Fares gives half-priced rides to New Yorkers earning up to 120 percent of the federal poverty line. The bill’s matter: 'New Yorkers who participate in the city's half-priced transit program Fair Fares will finally be able to use OMNY.' Mayor Adams and the City Council raised eligibility last year, but advocates want broader access. MTA Chairman Janno Lieber called OMNY key for proof-of-payment checks. David Jones, Community Service Society CEO and MTA Board member, supports OMNY for Fair Fares and urges non-police fare enforcement. The pilot follows delays tied to vending machine deployment. About 800,000 New Yorkers qualify for Fair Fares, but only 331,000 are enrolled. The city and MTA plan to expand OMNY to all Fair Fares users by year’s end.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
