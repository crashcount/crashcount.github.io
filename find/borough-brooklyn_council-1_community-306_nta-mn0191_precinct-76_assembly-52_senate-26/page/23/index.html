The request follows complaints after Schermerhorn Street’s redesign, which added a protected bike lane but made all crossings one-way southbound, causing gridlock and blocking access for services. The Community Board’s Transportation and Public Safety Committee, chaired by Sid Meyer, voted to support the change and insisted DOT maintain and protect the Bond Street bike lane with a physical barrier. Restler said, 'We believe that this proposal will improve traffic flow and enhance the public’s access to essential services, deliveries, and residences.' DOT is reviewing the proposal. The matter centers on the impact of traffic changes on residents and the need to safeguard vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Their size crushes, their height blinds. A tax on these machines would slow the arms race. Money raised could build safer streets. Fewer SUVs, fewer deaths. The danger is clear. The fix is simple. Lawmakers must act.</p><p class=mb3>This policy advocacy, highlighted at the 2022 Vision Zero Cities conference, calls for taxing large vehicles to protect vulnerable road users. The proposal, supported by Transportation Alternatives and Streetsblog NYC, urges policymakers to use tax revenue to fund safer infrastructure. The article states, 'one efficient policy would be to tax large vehicles and use the revenue to build the infrastructure needed for safer streets.' The analysis draws a direct line between the rise of SUVs and pickups and the surge in pedestrian deaths. It notes that the largest vehicles are the deadliest, especially for those on foot or bike. The piece argues that taxing these vehicles would not only discourage their use but also shift the burden of their societal costs back onto their owners. The model follows Washington, D.C.'s recent move to scale registration fees by vehicle size and dedicate funds to safety programs. The message is blunt: fewer giant vehicles, more lives saved.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, supported by NYPD and DOT, never reached a vote before Rodriguez’s term ended and has not been reassigned. The bill summary states it 'would require drivers of motor vehicles to maintain a minimum distance of three feet when overtaking a bicycle.' Rodriguez sponsored the bill. Legal experts Daniel Flanzig and Steve Vaccaro criticized the lack of enforcement and the absence of a defined safe passing law, noting that most of the country already has such protections. Flanzig called the law essential to prevent tragedies like the death of Kala Santiago, who was killed by a truck driver on Parkside Avenue.

Councilmember Charles Allen (Ward 6) introduced the bill, joined in support by Christina Henderson (At-large) and Janeese Lewis George (Ward 4). Committee Chair Mary Cheh (Ward 3) acknowledged the program’s high cost—an estimated $163 million in fiscal year 2025—but called the community benefit 'more than worth it.'

The city’s promise fades.</p><p class=mb3>On October 2, 2022, Councilmember Oswald Feliz of District 15 opposed the Department of Transportation’s plan to convert segments of Fordham Road to bus and delivery-only lanes. Feliz asked DOT to pause the redesign for at least 12 months, citing concerns about traffic diversion and business impacts. The matter, reported as 'Eric Adams’ ambitious bus lane plans hit roadblock on NYC’s Fordham Road,' details how Feliz’s opposition blocks a key part of Mayor Adams’ pledge to build 20 new miles of bus lanes. DOT’s proposal aimed to restrict private vehicle traffic and prioritize buses and deliveries, a move supported by transit advocates and local polls. But Feliz’s action keeps the status quo: crowded streets, slow buses, and danger for those outside cars.

The warnings proved hollow.</p><p class=mb3>This report covers the installation of a protected bike lane on Skillman Avenue in Queens, completed in fall 2018. The project faced fierce opposition, with critics predicting economic ruin for local businesses. Streetsblog obtained sales tax data from the Department of Finance, showing that, after the bike lane went in, Skillman Avenue’s main commercial stretch saw a 12 percent increase in sales and a net gain of three businesses. The article states: 'The economy of Skillman Avenue grew after the city built the new lane.' Department of Transportation spokeswoman Mona Bruno praised the redesign, saying, 'It's thrilling to see the neighborhood flourish with safer and more sustainable streets.' Crash data show a 24 percent drop in crashes and a 28 percent drop in injuries after installation. The findings challenge the myth that bike lanes hurt business and highlight the safety gains for cyclists and pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, discussed at a Citizens Union breakfast, centered on the future of the Open Restaurants program. Adams said, "Outdoor dining, in my perspective, should be sidewalk. The street extensions were designed to be temporary." The City Council is currently developing legislation to allow restaurants to use parking lanes, but Adams’s comments signal resistance. Council Member Erik Bottcher countered, calling the use of road space for dining "an overall positive development." Adams’s stance ignores the reality that most city sidewalks are too narrow for sidewalk-only dining, squeezing pedestrians and limiting restaurant survival. Advocates and groups like Transportation Alternatives and Open Plans criticized her position, urging the Council to reclaim public space from cars and support vibrant, safe streets for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
