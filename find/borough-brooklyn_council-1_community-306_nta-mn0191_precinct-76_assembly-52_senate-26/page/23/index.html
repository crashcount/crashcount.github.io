Their size crushes, their height blinds. A tax on these machines would slow the arms race. Money raised could build safer streets. Fewer SUVs, fewer deaths. The danger is clear. The fix is simple. Lawmakers must act.</p><p class=mb3>This policy advocacy, highlighted at the 2022 Vision Zero Cities conference, calls for taxing large vehicles to protect vulnerable road users. The proposal, supported by Transportation Alternatives and Streetsblog NYC, urges policymakers to use tax revenue to fund safer infrastructure. The article states, 'one efficient policy would be to tax large vehicles and use the revenue to build the infrastructure needed for safer streets.' The analysis draws a direct line between the rise of SUVs and pickups and the surge in pedestrian deaths. It notes that the largest vehicles are the deadliest, especially for those on foot or bike. The piece argues that taxing these vehicles would not only discourage their use but also shift the burden of their societal costs back onto their owners. The model follows Washington, D.C.'s recent move to scale registration fees by vehicle size and dedicate funds to safety programs. The message is blunt: fewer giant vehicles, more lives saved.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Justice denied.</p><p class=mb3>In 2019, then-Council Member Ydanis Rodriguez introduced a bill requiring drivers to keep a minimum three-foot distance when overtaking cyclists. The bill, supported by NYPD and DOT, never reached a vote before Rodriguez’s term ended and has not been reassigned. The bill summary states it 'would require drivers of motor vehicles to maintain a minimum distance of three feet when overtaking a bicycle.' Rodriguez sponsored the bill. Legal experts Daniel Flanzig and Steve Vaccaro criticized the lack of enforcement and the absence of a defined safe passing law, noting that most of the country already has such protections. Flanzig called the law essential to prevent tragedies like the death of Kala Santiago, who was killed by a truck driver on Parkside Avenue. Without this law, cyclists remain at risk, and drivers rarely face consequences.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, championed by Councilmember Lincoln Restler, followed years of complaints about blocked, unprotected lanes and frequent crashes. The matter, described as a 'complete transformation of the look and feel of the corridor,' converted Schermerhorn from a chaotic two-way street to a one-way with parking-protected bike lanes. Restler, who once failed to ride the stretch without leaving the lane due to illegal parking, called the redesign 'real safety in downtown Brooklyn.'

Council action is not involved, but the testimony exposes systemic failure. Police blamed the victim: 'The police report blamed the victim: I caused my own pain.'

The bill promises, as its summary states, to put '$100 per month on District residents' SmarTrip cards' and to invest millions in bus and streetcar improvements, especially for underserved neighborhoods. Councilmember Charles Allen (Ward 6) introduced the bill, joined in support by Christina Henderson (At-large) and Janeese Lewis George (Ward 4). Committee Chair Mary Cheh (Ward 3) acknowledged the program’s high cost—an estimated $163 million in fiscal year 2025—but called the community benefit 'more than worth it.' The bill also creates a $10 million Transit Equity fund. The measure now heads to the Committee of the Whole for further review and two rounds of voting. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson has not yet scheduled a hearing.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Feliz asked DOT to pause the redesign for at least 12 months, citing concerns about traffic diversion and business impacts. The matter, reported as 'Eric Adams’ ambitious bus lane plans hit roadblock on NYC’s Fordham Road,' details how Feliz’s opposition blocks a key part of Mayor Adams’ pledge to build 20 new miles of bus lanes. DOT’s proposal aimed to restrict private vehicle traffic and prioritize buses and deliveries, a move supported by transit advocates and local polls. But Feliz’s action keeps the status quo: crowded streets, slow buses, and danger for those outside cars.

The project faced fierce opposition, with critics predicting economic ruin for local businesses. Streetsblog obtained sales tax data from the Department of Finance, showing that, after the bike lane went in, Skillman Avenue’s main commercial stretch saw a 12 percent increase in sales and a net gain of three businesses. The article states: 'The economy of Skillman Avenue grew after the city built the new lane.' Department of Transportation spokeswoman Mona Bruno praised the redesign, saying, 'It's thrilling to see the neighborhood flourish with safer and more sustainable streets.' Crash data show a 24 percent drop in crashes and a 28 percent drop in injuries after installation.

The street extensions were designed to be temporary." The City Council is currently developing legislation to allow restaurants to use parking lanes, but Adams’s comments signal resistance. Council Member Erik Bottcher countered, calling the use of road space for dining "an overall positive development." Adams’s stance ignores the reality that most city sidewalks are too narrow for sidewalk-only dining, squeezing pedestrians and limiting restaurant survival.

Tickets soared 70 percent in three weeks. Most violations hit at night and weekends—times once uncovered. Officials say the surge proves drivers speed when unchecked. The city claims this crackdown will save lives.</p><p class=mb3>On August 1, 2022, New York City activated speed cameras 24/7 after a legislative deal in Albany. In the first three weeks, cameras issued 513,777 tickets—70 percent more than before. The bill, championed by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, removed harsher penalties but kept round-the-clock enforcement. The matter summary states, 'speed safety cameras are working as they should—catching more speeding drivers and combatting reckless driving.' Council members and advocates, including Elizabeth Adams and Jehiah Czebotar, backed the move. They point to data showing most extra tickets came at night and weekends, exposing a hidden threat to pedestrians and cyclists. Officials insist the expansion will save lives and curb reckless driving.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Eleven pedestrians and four cyclists have died here since 1995. Advocates demand a full redesign. The city promises more action after these quick fixes.</p><p class=mb3>On August 31, 2022, the Department of Transportation announced interim safety improvements for McGuinness Boulevard in Greenpoint. The street has seen 1,594 crashes, 44 cyclist injuries, 67 pedestrian injuries, and three deaths since 2013. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher announced the changes, which include daylighting intersections, banning left turns at key avenues, and adding painted pedestrian extensions. Gallagher said, 'Quick, iterative incremental changes will be a great way to reduce injuries and fatalities rather than waiting for an entire overhaul.' Council Member Lincoln Restler praised the upgrades as 'a step in the right direction.' Bronwyn Breitner of Make McGuinness Safe Coalition called for a full-scale redesign, reallocating space from cars to people. The city will revisit the corridor plan this winter after installing these measures in the fall.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
