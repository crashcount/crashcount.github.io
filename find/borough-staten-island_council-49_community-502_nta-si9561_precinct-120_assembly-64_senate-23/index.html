The Senate passed the measure 38-21; three city senators—Stephen Chan, Andrew Lanza, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton—voted no. The Assembly passed it 110-31, with nine city lawmakers—Alec Brook-Krasny, Lester Chang, Simcha Eichenstein, Michael Novakhov, Stacey Pheffer Amato, Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Reilly, David Weprin, Kalman Yeger—opposing. The Streetsblog NYC article, 'Ye Shall Know Their Names! Meet the Dirty Dozen City Pols Who Voted Against Speed Camera Program,' quotes lawmakers dismissing speed cameras as revenue grabs or burdens. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action, so no direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists can be assessed.'

The study, covered by Barbara Russo-Lennon, found a 25% drop in Manhattan traffic jams, with smaller but real declines in the Bronx and New Jersey. The report states: 'Congestion pricing is delivering clear benefits, saving people time and the aggravation of being stuck in traffic.' Council Member Frank Morano and State Sen. Jessica Scarcella-Spanton criticized the program, citing Staten Island’s smaller gains and health concerns. MTA Chair Janno Lieber defended the policy, pointing to improved drive times and transit use. Safety analysts note congestion pricing reduces car traffic, lowers crash risk for pedestrians and cyclists, encourages mode shift, and supports safer, more equitable streets. The program’s future now rests with the federal courts.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Mayor Eric Adams said over 100,000 'ghost vehicles' have been seized since 2022, including cars with fake or missing plates. Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch stated, 'This morning is not just about crushing mopeds. It is about crushing the criminal activity and quality of life activities that come with them.' The crackdown targets vehicles often used by delivery workers but also linked by officials to traffic violations and other offenses. A Citi Bike was destroyed among the pile, though officials did not explain why. The event highlighted ongoing enforcement actions and raised questions about policy impacts on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan allows cameras on seven bridges and two tunnels, ticketing drivers who exceed speed limits. Fines start at $50 for a first offense, rising to $75 and $100 for repeat violations within 18 months. Governor Hochul's office called the program 'one more way the governor is working to improve safety on our roads and bridges for workers and travelers alike.' MTA Bridges and Tunnels President Catherine Sheridan said, 'We want to make sure that our maintenance workers and contractors are safe.' The program, part of the $254 billion state budget, will be reviewed again in 2031.
