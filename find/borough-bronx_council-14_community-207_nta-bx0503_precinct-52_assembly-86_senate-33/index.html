Not one week passes without sirens. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. A man lost his leg on East 183rd. A child was crushed at Grand Concourse. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not.</p><h2 id=the-latest-crashes-no-end-in-sight>The Latest Crashes: No End in Sight</h2><p>Just last week, a 71-year-old woman died after a car driven by a 79-year-old man slammed into two vehicles and a pole. Seven others were hurt. &ldquo;I saw one lady was out on the ground. They was giving her medical attention, checking her body. She was laid out,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/op-city-crash-multiple-people-injured-including-1-critically-bronx/17075710/>said Samuel Cherry</a>. The street was quiet, except for the sound of grief. The cause is still under investigation. No arrests. No answers.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p>Pedestrians and passengers take the worst of it. Cars and SUVs caused most injuries, but trucks, mopeds, and bikes all left their mark. A 50-year-old man lost his leg. A baby was left incoherent after being struck by a sedan. The city calls these incidents &ldquo;accidents.&rdquo; But the pattern is clear. The pain is relentless.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h2><p>Local leaders have taken some steps. State Senator Gustavo Rivera voted yes on a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters, aiming to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>boost street safety by curbing repeat speeders</a>. Assembly Member Yudelka Tapia co-sponsored a similar bill. Council Member Oswald Feliz backed new bus lanes on Tremont Avenue, but <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/07/29/fordham-rd-still-hell-for-bus-riders-after-mayor-adams-scrubbed-a-better-road-design>opposed stronger safety upgrades on Fordham Road</a>. The work is not done. The streets are not safe.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-demand-more>Call to Action: Demand More</h2><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to finish the job. Lower the speed limit. Build real protection for people walking and biking. Hold repeat offenders accountable. Do not wait for the next siren.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
