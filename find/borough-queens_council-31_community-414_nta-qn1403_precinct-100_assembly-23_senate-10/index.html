Fifty-three injured.</strong> That is the toll in Breezy Point-Belle Harbor-Rockaway Park-Broad Channel over the past year. The dead do not come back. The injured carry scars—some seen, some not. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City crash data</a></p><p><strong>Pedestrians are not spared.</strong> In December, a 79-year-old man was struck while emerging from behind a parked car. He survived, but with a torn head and blood on the street. In March, a child was killed on the North Channel Bridge. The data does not say his name. It only says: head injury, internal, apparent death. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash records</a></p><p><strong>Crashes do not slow.</strong> In the last twelve months, there were 115 crashes. Three were fatal. Three left people with injuries so severe they may never walk the same.

Cars and SUVs are the main weapons. In the last year, sedans and SUVs killed and maimed. Trucks and buses did not kill, but they have before. Bikes did not kill anyone here, but they are not the threat. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Vehicle involvement data</a></p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p><strong>The city talks of Vision Zero.</strong> There are new speed cameras, new laws, and promises. But in these streets, the blood keeps coming. Sammy’s Law passed. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the limit here is not yet 20. The cameras are not everywhere. The deaths are not stopping. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Vision Zero progress</a></p><p><strong>Local leaders have the power.</strong> They can demand lower speeds. They can push for more cameras, safer crossings, and real redesigns. They can act, or they can wait for the next call in the night.</p><h3 id=act-nowor-count-the-dead>Act Now—Or Count the Dead</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand more cameras.

The suit claims the redesign would "jeopardize" safety and hinder emergency access, despite DOT data showing 190 injuries and two deaths in the area since 2020. DOT says the project targets "unpredictable vehicle movements" and double parking, with design elements "found on streets across the city." The agency says it incorporated feedback from 90% of local businesses.

The promise of a people-first neighborhood dies.</p><p class=mb3>On August 7, 2025, Eastern Queens Greenway condemned the city’s decision to scale back the Creedmoor redevelopment. The plan, once a bold vision for a car-free, walkable neighborhood, was gutted after pressure from local politicians like Assembly Member Ed Braunstein and Council Member Joann Ariola. The original proposal called for 2,775 homes and limited parking. Now, density drops by 27 percent. Empire State Development claims compromise, but the statement is aspirational and lacks concrete safety measures for pedestrians or cyclists. Vulnerable road users remain exposed. The city missed its chance.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
