Rollins allegedly ran over Gary Charlotin, who was crossing Hempstead Ave., then stopped for two minutes before fleeing. According to Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz, Rollins 'proceeded to speed away from the scene while dragging the victim's body, while the victim was still alive.' Bystanders pleaded for the driver to stop. The incident highlights the lethal consequences of driver inattention and failure to yield, as well as the dangers posed by drivers who flee crash scenes.

The project, backed by the Economic Development Corporation and Council Member Rafael Salamanca, aims to move food by boat and e-cargo trike instead of trucks. The matter summary states: 'Replacing truck trips with boat trips and cargo bikes is a key feature of the city's urgent push to shift cargo trips out of big trucks.' EDC President Andrew Kimball said, 'The goal is, over time, to move more and more of this food out of Hunts Point not by truck, but by water with e-cargo trikes.' The dock will remove one thousand trucks per month from South Bronx streets. Officials plan to expand docks citywide. The bill’s status is an active infrastructure rollout, not a legislative vote.
