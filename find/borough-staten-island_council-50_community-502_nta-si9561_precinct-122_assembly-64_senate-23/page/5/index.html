Borelli (District 51) joined a bipartisan group at City Hall to oppose the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's congestion pricing plan. The rally, covered by Crain's New York, featured lawmakers including Robert Holden, Kalman Yeger, Nicole Malliotakis, and Ritchie Torres. The group argued the plan would 'disproportionately harm working- and middle-class New Yorkers, increase air pollution in outer boroughs, and raise costs for businesses and consumers.' Borelli called it 'bad policy for New York City.' The event did not advance a formal bill but marked a public stand against congestion pricing. The MTA and Governor Hochul support the plan to reduce traffic and fund transit. The Traffic Mobility Review Board continues to review feedback.

The measure, handled by the Transportation Committee, allows speed cameras to operate 24/7. The matter summary: 'The City Council approved Albany's extension and expansion of New York's speed camera program, allowing cameras to operate 24/7, but not before several council members voiced opposition.' Chairwoman Selvena Brooks-Powers urged action, saying, 'We must use all the tools at our disposal.' Council Members Joan Ariola, Vickie Paladino, and David Carr opposed, calling cameras a financial burden. Eric Dinowitz defended the program: 'If you don't want a speeding ticket, don't speed.' The vote came after a year of high road deaths, with special risk near schools.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
