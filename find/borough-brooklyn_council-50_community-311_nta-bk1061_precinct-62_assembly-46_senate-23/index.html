Since 2022, Fort Hamilton has seen 262 crashes. One person is dead. 167 are hurt. No one walks away unchanged. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. In the last year alone, 47 people were injured. Not one death, but too many close calls.</p><p>No cyclist or pedestrian is safe from the machines. The records show injuries to the young and old. A three-year-old boy, bruised in the back seat. An 83-year-old man, neck battered in a U-turn gone wrong. The road does not care about age. It only takes.</p><h3 id=the-stories-behind-the-numbers>The Stories Behind the Numbers</h3><p>The data is cold. The stories are not. On Poly Place, a 21-year-old man died. The cause: improper lane use, a motorcycle against an SUV. The record says only: &ldquo;Internal.&rdquo; No more details. No more life. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>On Belt Parkway, a 48-year-old man broke his face in a crash. The record lists &ldquo;fracture&rdquo; and &ldquo;conscious.&rdquo; He lived. Others do not.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-silence>Leadership: Action and Silence</h3><p>Local leaders have voted on safety, but not always for it. State Senator Jessica Scarcella-Spanton voted yes to create safety zones, a small step. But she also voted no on safer school speed zones, standing in the way of children’s safety. Assembly Member Alec Brook-Krasny did the same. Assembly Member Brook-Krasny <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>opposed safer school speed zones for children</a>.</p><p>When leaders fail, the danger grows. The road stays hungry.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every injury, every death, is a choice made by those in power. Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand slower speeds, more cameras, real protection for people outside cars.</p><p>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The time to act is now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The city planned to move cyclists next to car traffic, but the court granted an emergency restraining order after advocates appealed. Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives called the lane a 'critical safety project.' City Hall insists the reconfiguration is legal and claims the appeal delays 'easing the safety concerns plaguing Williamsburg parents.' The protected lane, installed in October 2024, separates cyclists from moving vehicles.

Data shows real relief, not empty promises.</p><p class=mb3>On June 18, 2025, the Regional Plan Association released a report on congestion pricing’s impact. The study, covered by Barbara Russo-Lennon, found a 25% drop in Manhattan traffic jams, with smaller but real declines in the Bronx and New Jersey. The report states: 'Congestion pricing is delivering clear benefits, saving people time and the aggravation of being stuck in traffic.' Council Member Frank Morano and State Sen. Jessica Scarcella-Spanton criticized the program, citing Staten Island’s smaller gains and health concerns. MTA Chair Janno Lieber defended the policy, pointing to improved drive times and transit use. Safety analysts note congestion pricing reduces car traffic, lowers crash risk for pedestrians and cyclists, encourages mode shift, and supports safer, more equitable streets. The program’s future now rests with the federal courts.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'before this bike lane from 2018 to 2022 this is the area that had the second largest numbers of pedestrian fatalities and crashes in the city.' The lane faced opposition from some Hasidic leaders, citing children running into the lane from illegally parked cars and buses. Despite tweaks—school bus zones, daylighted corners, no standing areas—drivers kept parking illegally, blocking sightlines and endangering children. The city rarely removes protected lanes, but Adams acted after political pressure. Moving the lane to Classon Avenue, as some demand, would force cyclists onto a chaotic BQE ramp. The decision highlights persistent driver violations and policy gaps that leave vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
