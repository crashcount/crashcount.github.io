The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, installed these barriers in fall 2023, aiming to 'harden' bike lanes in a borough with few safe cycling routes. Cyclists like Joseph Rienti say the barriers are better than nothing, but drivers now park at both ends, forcing riders into car traffic. Rienti urges better design or enforcement, not removal. Police enforcement is almost nonexistent: less than 2 percent of 76,000 complaints led to tickets. City Council, including Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, has not advanced a bill allowing citizen reporting of blocked lanes, despite majority support. DOT spokeswoman Mona Bruno promises to work with police, but for now, the barriers fail to protect vulnerable cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Rollout not before 2025.</p><p class=mb3>The MTA’s Queens Bus Network Redesign, announced December 12, 2023, proposes $30 million in service upgrades and expands local routes from 83 to 91. The plan, under review since 2020, aims to boost 10-minute-or-better service for 200,000 more residents, raising coverage from 60.1% to 68.9%. The official summary states the redesign will 'streamline and speed up service.' Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers voiced 'serious concerns' about disadvantages for her district, especially with congestion pricing. Queens Borough President Donovan Richards, once critical, now supports the draft after public outreach. State Senator Leroy Comrie noted Brooks-Powers wants clarity for her community, not outright rejection. The redesign awaits further input and is expected no sooner than 2025. No safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The effort, known as daylighting, aims to improve visibility and pedestrian safety. Adams said, 'Protecting New Yorkers is my most sacred responsibility as mayor.' Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers praised daylighting as 'a proven safety measure.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez stressed that daylighting must include physical infrastructure to prevent reckless turns. The Department of Transportation will also add raised crosswalks, extended sidewalks, and leading pedestrian signals at 1,000 intersections next year. The city will expand speed restriction technology in its fleet and increase data transparency. Advocates and community boards have long called for these changes. With nearly 47,000 intersections citywide, the plan will take decades to reach every corner.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, covered by Streetsblog NYC, quotes Adams: the fee is 'the beginning of the conversation' and exemptions must be considered. Councilmember Selvena Brooks-Powers, chair of the Transportation Committee, echoed concerns, saying the toll 'is going to put definitely a hardship on many of my constituents.' Experts Bruce Schaller and Danny Pearlstein criticized Adams, urging him to champion the program’s benefits for transit riders and the environment. The mayor’s office later clarified his comments focused on city workers in city vehicles. The article notes that while a small fraction of Brooks-Powers’s constituents drive into Manhattan, all would benefit from improved transit. Adams’s wavering undermines momentum for a policy proven to reduce traffic and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The company now focuses on its growing electric taxi fleet, boasting 500 Teslas and over 1,500 drivers. Advocates mourned the loss, calling it a bad day for car-free travel.

Few cars seized. Violations continued. Brooks-Powers promises scrutiny. Lander demands tougher action. Streets remain perilous. The city weighs next steps as reckless drivers keep rolling.</p><p class=mb3>On September 22, 2023, the Department of Transportation issued a report recommending the end of the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program (DVAP). The program, designed to target repeat red light and speeding offenders, required violators to take a safety course or risk vehicle seizure. The report, reviewed by Council Transportation Chair Selvena N. Brooks-Powers (District 31), found little impact: 'A program meant to crack down on dangerous drivers did not dramatically reduce their behavior.' Only half completed the course, violations persisted, and just 12 vehicles were seized. Brooks-Powers stated, 'Holding reckless drivers accountable and keeping our streets safe for all New Yorkers remains a priority.' Comptroller Brad Lander criticized DOT for abandoning the effort, urging the city to strengthen, not scrap, DVAP. The report also called for state laws to suspend registrations or install speed governors for repeat offenders, but such measures have stalled in Albany.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
