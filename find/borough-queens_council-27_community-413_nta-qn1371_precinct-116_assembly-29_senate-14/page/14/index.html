It follows backlash to the 2019 draft and pandemic delays. The redesign boosts routes from 77 to 85, adds 20 new lines, and drops the revenue-neutral rule. Hundreds of stops will be cut to speed service. The MTA and NYC DOT picked 49 corridors for upgrades like bus lanes. The official summary states the plan 'incorporates feedback from over 11,000 customer comments and aims to address previous criticisms.' MTA Chair Janno Lieber said, 'We know we need to get it right this time.' Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and advocates like Riders Alliance back the effort but call for more equity and engagement.

The law aims to bypass restrictive federal guidelines that block safety fixes. Council members and residents blasted DOT for slow, arbitrary action and years of denied requests, sometimes only reversed after tragedy.

Community Board 3’s Michelle Kuppersmith highlighted the need for political will. Still, the delay leaves vulnerable road users at risk, as the city also postponed pedestrian space on the Queensboro Bridge.

This data certainly proves what we've been saying all along,"" -- Donovan J. Richards</p><p class=mb3>This Streetsblog NYC analysis, published February 14, 2022, reviews New York’s speed and red light camera programs. The report finds, “New York City's speed cameras are evenly distributed and not disproportionately concentrated in low-income communities of color.” Queens Borough President Donovan Richards says, “Cameras don't discriminate.” Marco Conner DiAquoi of Transportation Alternatives adds, “We don’t see any correlation between the demographics of a zip code and the number of speeding violations there.” Council Member Gale Brewer calls for more red light cameras. Wilfredo Florentino, Brooklyn Community Board 5, says, “Just placing cameras ain't gonna cut it.” The analysis shows that dangerous, wide arterials in communities of color drive up traffic violence. Advocates and officials agree: automated enforcement helps, but only street redesigns will end the bloodshed. The Department of Transportation still withholds exact camera locations.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

This data certainly proves what we've been saying all along,"" -- Donovan J. Richards</p><p class=mb3>On February 14, 2022, Council Member Adrienne Adams (District 28) was mentioned in a Streetsblog analysis titled, "New York’s Speed Cameras Aren’t Racist — But the City’s Road Design Is." The report, not tied to a specific bill, reviewed automated enforcement and street design. It found speed cameras are evenly distributed and reduce crashes, but dangerous road design still puts lives at risk. Adams and other leaders called for more cameras and urgent street redesigns, echoing the article’s summary: 'Cameras have led to fewer crashes, injuries, and fatalities, but high numbers of tickets in some neighborhoods are attributed to unsafe road design, not camera placement.' Community voices stressed that automated enforcement helps, but cannot replace permanent fixes to deadly streets. The Department of Transportation’s lack of transparency on camera locations remains a concern. Adams and others demand systemic change to protect vulnerable New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
