The matter, covered by the New York Post, states: 'Cabán—who was elected to office on a platform advocating less car use and cracking down on dangerous driving—received four tickets in the past 13 months for speeding her vehicle in school zones.' Ariola, joined by Councilman Robert Holden, accused Cabán of hypocrisy, highlighting the disconnect between Cabán’s advocacy for street safety and her own driving record. Cabán’s policy platform includes converting 25% of city roadways for people, building 1,000 miles of car-free streets, and expanding bus and bike lanes. No formal council bill or committee action is attached to this event, but the public dispute underscores tensions in the city’s push for safer, less car-dominated streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Richards said, "You can't use the one-size-fits-all approach here. There are really parts of Queens that are transit deserts." He supports removing parking mandates only in high-density, transit-rich areas, not in low-density, car-dependent neighborhoods. Community board leaders and civic groups in Queens joined him, arguing the reform threatens their way of life. Richards's stance contrasts with Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Bronx officials, who support ending parking minimums. The decision preserves car dominance in Queens, leaving vulnerable road users at risk and blocking safer, people-first streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move slashes funding for the 2020-24 MTA capital plan, which was to be partly paid by congestion pricing. The report highlights that many companies losing contracts are in districts represented by lawmakers who either support the pause or have stayed silent. Senator Patricia Canzoneri-Fitzpatrick called congestion pricing 'simply another tax' and demanded repeal. Assemblyman Gary Pretlow praised the pause, saying it allows time to address 'communities' concerns.' Frank Russo, president of Ozone Park Lumber, warned, 'You can't just say, 'We're not going to buy supplies and equipment.'' Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany said, 'Congestion pricing is an economic booster.' The pause means less money for transit, fewer jobs, and more risk for vulnerable road users who rely on safe, reliable public transportation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal aims to increase housing near transit, allow mixed-use zoning, and eliminate parking mandates. Council Members Joann Ariola and Vicki Paladino led opposition, calling the plan an 'unmitigated disaster' and disputing housing data. Ariola argued, 'That's what they bought in the suburbs for.' Other Queens officials and residents echoed fears for single-family homeowners and suburban 'character.' In contrast, Borough President Donovan Richards's spokesperson and some residents supported the reforms, citing the city's affordability crisis. The majority of public testimony favored the proposal, but entrenched opposition from Queens officials remains strong. No safety analyst assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure covers just 0.13% of city streets, possibly reaching 0.8% if regional slow zones expand. The first such zone will be south of Canal Street in lower Manhattan. DOT can only lower limits street by street unless the City Council acts. Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers confirmed no citywide bill exists. Council Member Christopher Marte welcomed the slow zone in his district, citing rampant speeding off the bridges. Advocates and officials demand faster, broader action, saying, 'Twenty is plenty wherever you'll find people, and in New York that's everywhere.' DOT says it will prioritize areas near schools and neighborhoods with more non-white and low-income residents. The rollout is slow.

The measure, led by Council Member Lincoln Restler, follows internal debate and negotiation, with some members pushing for 1,325 intersections and others preferring fewer. The final number represents a four-fold increase, covering about 4 percent of city intersections. The Council's resolution, described as a 'home rule' message, aims to prevent the program from sunsetting and to improve safety for all road users. Restler stated, 'This will expand it to about 4 percent of intersections, and it will make our city safer.' Assembly Member Jeff Dinowitz called the expansion a victory, while advocates like Sara Lind of Open Plans noted no deaths at camera-protected intersections since 1994. Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers highlighted the need to ensure cameras improve communities and street safety, raising concerns about fairness in enforcement.
