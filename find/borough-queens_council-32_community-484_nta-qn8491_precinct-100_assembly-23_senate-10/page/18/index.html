The effort, not tied to a council bill, was revealed as city policy. The campaign aims to cut traffic violence through billboards and media buys. The official summary states it targets driver behavior. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, chair of the Transportation Committee, acknowledged the need for infrastructure investments over media campaigns. Jessie Singer, journalist and author, called the campaign a waste, arguing the city should focus on redesigning intersections. A recent study found similar efforts in Texas increased crash risk. The Department of Transportation could not provide evidence of effectiveness. Advocates agree education matters, but stress that engineering and infrastructure are more crucial for safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No more excuses.</p><p class=mb3>On May 2, 2022, the City Council’s Sanitation Committee, chaired by Council Member Sandy Nurse, held a hearing on the delayed implementation of commercial waste zones, a reform established by a 2019 law. The matter, titled 'Advocates Warn Against Further Delays on Commercial Waste Zones,' drew sharp criticism after the Department of Sanitation granted private carters a three-month extension to comply with new requirements. Nurse stated, 'Our communities cannot afford any more delays.' Advocates and Families for Safe Streets highlighted the deadly toll: reckless commercial haulers have killed more than two dozen people in recent years. The reform aims to cut truck traffic, reduce pollution, and require life-saving side guards on heavy trucks by 2024. Lauren Pine, a crash survivor, said, 'Commercial waste zone reform can not come fast enough.' The hearing underscored that every delay keeps vulnerable New Yorkers at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The resolution states: 'Providing instruction in bicycle and traffic safety in schools, starting at an early age and continuing throughout students' years in school, would be an effective measure to both promote cycling and prevent bicycle accidents and other safety incidents.' Bottcher criticized the Department of Education for failing to follow the law, noting only a handful of schools offer bike lessons. Bottcher said, 'We want to see that program enlarged significantly.' Advocates support the push but warn that education alone is not enough. Julie Huntington stressed, 'This announcement must come with an investment in building protected bike lanes and safe routes to school to keep our new riders safe.' Bottcher put the responsibility on drivers: 'Drivers are in the vehicle that weighs thousands of pounds... if they hit someone with their car, it’s very likely they could take their life.' The council’s action highlights a gap between policy and real safety for children on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Alexa Avilés led the call: "We want $3.1 billion, a little tiny fraction of the [nearly $100-billion] city budget, to make sure our streets belong to us, and to make sure New Yorkers are safe." Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers, Carlina Rivera, Lincoln Restler, Sandy Nurse, Chi Ossé, Crystal Hudson, Shekar Krishnan, and Amanda Farías joined her. Traffic fatalities rose 44 percent in the first quarter of 2022, the deadliest start since Vision Zero began.

Queens Borough President Donovan Richards said, 'Fully electrifying our bus fleet is a critical step forward to preserving our environment and protecting our families.' MTA Chairman Janno Lieber called mass transit 'the antidote to climate change.' The rollout, however, is slow. High electricity costs and limited charging infrastructure stall progress. New York State has budgeted $1.1 billion for 500 electric buses in its 2020-2024 capital plan.

Danger persists.</p><p class=mb3>On April 22, 2022, the NYC Department of Transportation announced a plan to move Q60 buses from the service road to a dedicated mainline lane along Queens Boulevard, between Roosevelt Avenue and Union Turnpike. The project, under the 'Great Streets' program, is split into four phases, with construction for later phases delayed until at least 2024. The matter summary states: 'transform the currently barren median into a linear park to create a safe and easy way of traversing neighborhoods.' Queens Borough President Donovan Richards pledged $1 million to the first phase, stating, 'it really creates an unsafe scenario, especially for pedestrians and cyclists.' DOT spokesman Vin Barone said the redesign 'greatly improv[es] pedestrian safety while also drawing a huge number of new cyclists.' Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives called the delays 'unacceptable.' The plan includes upgraded bike lanes, bus stops, and bus-only lanes, but also adds curbside parking, which could increase congestion.

She racked up 22 speed violations and one red light ticket. Her district sees high rates of pedestrian deaths. She pledges to do better. Tickets paid. No license impact.</p><p class=mb3>Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, chair of the NYC Council's Transportation Committee, was cited for speeding in school zones 17 times in less than a year. The violations occurred between May 2020 and April 2022. Brooks-Powers represents Southeast Queens, an area plagued by pedestrian and motorist fatalities. The matter surfaced in April 2022, with Brooks-Powers admitting responsibility for most tickets. She stated, 'public safety is very important to me,' and pledged to improve. Under the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program, she must complete a safety course or risk car impoundment. Her tickets have been paid, so her car was not towed. Camera tickets do not affect her license. Brooks-Powers says she is working with advocates to address traffic violence and congestion, but her record highlights the ongoing danger for vulnerable road users in her district.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, passed in 2019, aims for 250 protected bike lanes and 150 bus lanes. The Council wants to double these targets: 500 miles each of protected bike and bus lanes, plus 38 million square feet of new pedestrian plazas. Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers said the goal is 'to make our thoroughfares safer and more accessible, while increasing New York's pedestrian plazas footprint.' The Council’s proposal comes as the mayor’s $98.5-billion budget lacks dedicated funding for these safety upgrades. Advocates for bus and bike infrastructure support the Council’s push. The mayor says he is reviewing the proposal and remains committed to street safety and transit improvements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
