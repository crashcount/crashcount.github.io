The oldest, a senior. <strong>No one is spared.</strong></p><p>A 30-year-old man was crushed by a sedan on the Bronx River Parkway. A moped driver, age 27, ejected and killed. Another driver, 42, dead behind the wheel.

They talk about cameras and enforcement. But the dead do not hear talk. They do not see the press releases. In April, a man lay in the street after a road rage assault. An ambulance struck him as he waited for help.

The bill, sponsored by Council Member Oswald Feliz, lets companies comply by funding trade-in programs or subsidizing bike-share memberships. The matter summary states: 'require app-based delivery companies to provide their workers with certified e-bikes or underwrite their access.' The law covers all delivery apps and sets targets by company size. Workers cannot be deactivated for lacking compliant bikes.
