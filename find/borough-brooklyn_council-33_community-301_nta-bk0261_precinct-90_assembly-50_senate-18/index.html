Two seriously hurt.</strong> In three and a half years, the Brooklyn Navy Yard has seen 102 crashes. Fifty-four people have been injured. One did not go home. Two were left with wounds that do not heal fast. These are not numbers. They are lives, broken on the road. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the worst of it.</strong> A 59-year-old woman was killed crossing Kent Avenue. The SUV kept going. A cyclist, 24, was thrown from his bike after a car cut him off. Another cyclist, 39, hit by a sedan, left bleeding in the street. A 53-year-old woman, walking, hit by a car at the crosswalk. The pattern is plain. The most vulnerable pay the price.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p><strong>The city talks about Vision Zero.</strong> They say every life matters. They say they are redesigning intersections and lowering speed limits. But in the Navy Yard, the pace is slow. The crashes keep coming. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. They have not used it here. Speed cameras work, but only where they are turned on. Laws lapse. Programs expire. The street stays the same.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>No one should die crossing the street.</strong> The city can act. The council can demand lower speed limits. The mayor can order more cameras and redesigns. Albany can keep the cameras running. But nothing changes unless people demand it.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer speeds. Demand real protection for people who walk and bike.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
