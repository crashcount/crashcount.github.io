It keeps growing.</p><h3 id=queens-boulevard-and-roosevelt-names-on-a-map-bodies-on-the-line>Queens Boulevard and Roosevelt: names on a map, bodies on the line</h3><p>Queens Boulevard logs two deaths and 54 injuries. Roosevelt Avenue holds one death and 35 injuries. Together they tell one story: speed and mass win; flesh loses.</p><p>A 42‑year‑old on a motorcycle died on Queens Boulevard after contact with a box truck on Aug. 10, 2022. The record shows ejection and crush injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City data</a> marks it as fatal (CrashID 4554092).</p><p>A 38‑year‑old man, walking outside a crosswalk at Roosevelt and 70th, was struck and killed by a 2011 Ford SUV before dawn on Apr. 23, 2024. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City data</a> logs the pedestrian as “Apparent Death” (CrashID 4719380).</p><p>On the BQE, a 33‑year‑old pedestrian died on July 13, 2023. The file lists “Internal” injuries after a Ford SUV going straight. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City data</a> records the fatality (CrashID 4646702). The corridor is our top injury hotspot.</p><p>These are not accidents. They are impacts. They happen where the map already glows red: <a href=#>Queens Boulevard</a> and <a href=#>Roosevelt Avenue</a> in our dataset’s top intersections, and the <a href=#>BQE</a> that cuts through it.</p><h3 id=when-and-why-it-happens>When and why it happens</h3><p>Harm spikes at the edges of day. Injuries stack at 8 a.m., 9 a.m., and again from late afternoon into night. Deaths hit at 5 a.m., 6 a.m., 4 p.m., and 10 p.m., then keep coming through the evening, per the hourly distribution.</p><p>What drives the damage here: “other” factors dominate with 2 deaths and 210 injuries. Pedestrian or cyclist “error” appears in the log too, but the bodies show the power imbalance: SUVs are tied to two pedestrian deaths and 48 pedestrian injuries; trucks add nine more pedestrian hits. The vehicle rollup is blunt: cars and SUVs account for the largest share of harm to people on foot.</p><p>On Aug. 7, 2025 at 69th Street and Woodside Avenue, a U‑turning sedan with Oklahoma plates met a southbound Harley. The rider, 62, went down with crush injuries to his leg. The log cites failure to yield. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City data</a> fixes the time and place (CrashID 4833478).</p><h3 id=promises-pressure-and-the-slow-road-to-change>Promises, pressure, and the slow road to change</h3><p>Leaders can move when they are pressed. The Queensboro Bridge finally split people walking from people biking in May 2025 after months of delay. “After years of advocacy… [complete the work to open new, dedicated pedestrian paths],” said State Senator Michael Gianaris, while noting the unexplained holdup. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-completes-long-stalled-plan-to-separate-bikes-and-pedestrians-on-queensboro-bridge>Gothamist</a>. In April, electeds warned City Hall that further delay would “unnecessarily put at risk” thousands who still shared a cramped lane. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/09/pols-demand-adams-open-queensboro-bridge-pedestrian-path>Streetsblog</a>.</p><p>At the state level, Albany moved on chronic speeders. Senator Gianaris voted yes in committee for S4045 to require intelligent speed assistance for drivers who pile up violations. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>. Assembly Member Steven Raga co‑sponsors the Assembly version. <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?bn=A7979&amp;term=2023">Open States</a>.</p><p>City Council also pushed to clear illegal blockers. A resolution urges Albany to pass A.5440 to ticket owner‑liability parking violations by camera, with Raga tied to the state bill and Council Member Lincoln Restler sponsoring the resolution. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council Legistar</a>.</p><h3 id=what-would-make-woodside-safer-now>What would make Woodside safer now</h3><p>Start at the hot corridors.</p><ul><li>Harden turns and add daylighting on Queens Boulevard and Roosevelt Avenue. Protect the crosswalks drivers hit again and again. Use failure‑to‑yield stings where the log shows turning conflicts.</li><li>Build physical separation and traffic calming near the BQE ramps and frontage, where one death and 199 injuries cluster. Keep speed down before the merge.</li><li>Target repeat hotspots at 69th Street and Woodside Avenue with no‑U‑turn controls and curb work. The Aug. 7 crash tells you why.</li></ul><p>Then finish the citywide work.</p><ul><li>Lower speeds everywhere. Sammy’s Law gave NYC the power to set slower limits. A citywide 20 mph default cuts force at the point of impact.</li><li>Fit chronic violators with speed limiters. S4045/A7979 is built for the 1.5% who do the worst harm.</li></ul><p>This neighborhood’s file is already thick. The numbers do not grieve. People do.</p><p>If you want it to stop, start here: <a href=/take_action/>take action</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Council Member Julie Won and Mayor Ravi Bhalla called the report a scare tactic, urging citywide daylighting to save lives. DOT’s compromise with pro-car officials weakens protections. As safety analyst notes, this shift prioritizes cars over people, undermining vulnerable road user safety and citywide mode shift goals.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
