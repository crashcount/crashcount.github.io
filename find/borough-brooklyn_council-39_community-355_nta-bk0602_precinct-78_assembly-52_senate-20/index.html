Since 2022, <strong>one person has died and seven have been seriously injured</strong> in Park Slope. There have been <strong>698 injuries in 1,459 crashes</strong>. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old. They only count the bodies.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs hit hardest.</strong> They killed one, seriously hurt two, and left 115 more injured. Taxis took another life and broke two more bodies. Trucks and buses added seven more injuries. Bikes and mopeds, too, left their mark—eight injuries each, one serious from a bike. No one is spared. Not the old, not the young.</p><h3 id=the-latest-wounds>The Latest Wounds</h3><p>The violence does not pause. In the last year, <strong>136 people were injured in 239 crashes</strong>. Three were hurt so badly they may never walk the same. No deaths this year, but the luck will not hold. The last death was a pedestrian, struck by a taxi. She was 72. She died at the intersection. The city moved on.</p><h3 id=leaders-steps-and-silences>Leaders: Steps and Silences</h3><p>Council Member Shahana Hanif has co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks and speed up protected bike lanes. She signed on to the SAFE Streets Act.

Call your assembly member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand real protection for people, not cars.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for the next siren.

He said, 'Summer Streets is bigger and better than ever—and New Yorkers are begging for more.' Meyer supports car-free events but criticizes their limited scale. No council bill or committee action is attached. A safety analyst notes: expanding Summer Streets increases car-free space, encourages walking and cycling, and improves safety by reducing vehicle conflicts and promoting mode shift. But the limited reach means citywide benefits remain out of grasp.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Kuntzman wrote, 'That's objectively a horrendous record of reckless driving through city school zones.' He noted that if Sen. Andrew Gounardes's 'Stop Super Speeder' bill had passed, Cuomo would face a mandatory speed limiter. No council bill or committee action is involved. The safety analyst notes this is an individual’s behavior, not a policy change, so there is no direct impact on pedestrian or cyclist safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Ruiz was sitting by the curb when struck. Two nephews, ages 12 and 17, were also injured. Cando told police he 'lost control' during the stunt. He was arrested and charged with criminally negligent homicide, reckless endangerment, and reckless driving.
