The rally, covered by Streetsblog NYC, saw few delivery workers attend. The matter summary reads: 'Advocates for delivery workers rallied on May Day in support of two pro-delivery worker bills, but many workers stayed home due to fears of deportation.' De La Rosa called for closing the Instacart loophole and ending discrimination. The chilling effect of immigration enforcement left the most at-risk workers absent. Safety analysts warn: when vulnerable workers avoid advocacy, their ability to demand safer streets and fair conditions shrinks.

Many stayed home, fearing deportation. Instacart workers, mostly immigrants, remain excluded from wage protections. Council Member De La Rosa demanded equity. The law’s loophole leaves workers exposed, underpaid, and afraid. The fight for fair pay continues.</p><p class=mb3>On May 2, 2025, the City Council, led by Council Member Carmen De La Rosa, rallied for two bills: Intro 1133 and Intro 1135. Both aim to expand minimum wage protections to all delivery workers, including those for third-party grocery services like Instacart. The rally, held on May Day, highlighted the vulnerability of immigrant delivery workers, many of whom stayed home due to heightened deportation fears. De La Rosa declared, 'These workers are already being discriminated against and marginalized in our city. Let’s not make their lives harder by allowing a loophole in the law to take money out of their pockets.' The bills seek to close the 'Instacart loophole' and ensure equity for all delivery workers. The Council also passed a bill raising the cap on fees delivery apps can charge restaurants, which will result in Relay workers receiving the $21.44 minimum wage.

The law requires the Department of Transportation to consult with the Fire Department before approving open street applications, bicycle lane projects, or major transportation projects. The official matter title states the law amends the city code to require DOT to consult with FDNY and notify affected firehouses before moving forward. Primary sponsor Kalman Yeger, with co-sponsors including Joann Ariola, Robert Holden, Lynn Schulman, and others, pushed the bill through. The law expands notification and comment rights for firehouses and community boards, adding new steps before any street or lane changes. No safety analyst assessed the direct impact on vulnerable road users. The law’s effect: more agencies weigh in, but the process for safer streets grows longer and more complex.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The cyclist, who wore a helmet, was left unconscious with severe facial lacerations. The report states the crash occurred when a driver, traveling straight ahead, collided with the cyclist, crumpling the car’s right front quarter panel. Police explicitly cite 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the primary contributing factor. The narrative describes the aftermath: the cyclist lying in the cold, bloodied and unmoving, while the street remained unchanged. No contributing factors are attributed to the cyclist’s behavior. The crash highlights the ongoing systemic danger faced by vulnerable road users when drivers fail to pay attention.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
