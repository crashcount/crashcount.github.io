Rodriguez</p><p class=mb3>On 2025-08-14, NYC DOT released “Greater Greenways: New York City’s Greenway Plan.” Status: executive policy plan released. No bill number. No Council committee. Focus: Brooklyn links, a 25-mile waterfront route, Eastern Parkway fixes, and an IBX-aligned greenway. BKReader’s Kaya Laterman reported the rollout. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and Deputy Mayor Jeff Roth backed the push. No council members were cited. The plan promises wider, safer space for walkers and riders through industrial corridors and across creek gaps. Safety impact: positive. Separated, continuous routes reduce conflicts with cars, support mode shift and safety in numbers, and can improve cross-borough equity if the city builds.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Crash risk falls.</p><p class=mb3>"We say everyone deserves a greenway. Having access to greenways is not a privilege; it's a human right." -- Ydanis A. Rodriguez</p><p class=mb3>On August 13, 2025, the Adams administration announced the Greater Greenways plan. The city aims to 'dramatically expand the network of bike and pedestrian pathways through natural spaces and waterfronts around the Five Boroughs.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and Mayor Eric Adams led the push. No council bill number or committee is listed. The plan promises over 40 miles of new greenways, connecting neighborhoods and parks. Safety analysts note: expanding dedicated bike and pedestrian pathways separates vulnerable users from traffic, slashing crash risk and encouraging more people to walk or bike.

New rules demand registration, worker IDs, safety gear. Reflective vests, tracking, and penalties loom. Systemic street danger remains. Burden shifts to workers.</p><p class=mb3>On August 9, 2025, Mayor Eric Adams and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez proposed new rules for app-based delivery companies. The plan, now open for public comment, would require companies to register with DOT, assign unique ID cards to workers, and provide mandatory safety training and gear. Adams said, 'Our administration is committed to creating safer, more sustainable streets for everyone.' The rules demand reflective vests and reporting of vehicle types. Critics warn of risks to undocumented workers. A safety analyst notes: while training and gear may help individuals, the policy fails to address systemic traffic dangers and shifts responsibility onto vulnerable workers instead of drivers or city infrastructure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They raced the M34 bus across 34th Street to expose slow bus speeds. The event asked: 'Is it faster to walk across town or take the bus?' Russo-Lennon and others backed bus improvements, highlighting how cars choke streets and trap riders. The demonstration drew support from Council Members Erik Bottcher and Keith Powers, and city officials.

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez backed the plan, but only Amazon and Net-Zero Logistics used their hubs. UPS trucks kept blocking streets. DOT threatens to revoke unused permits.

Battery fires killed 18 last year. Streets stay risky. New rules come slow.</p><p class=mb3>West Side Spirit (2025-07-10) reports NYC DOT will deploy 45 unarmed 'peace officers' by 2028 to enforce laws on e-bikes, mopeds, scooters, and illegal car parking in bike lanes. The new Department of Sustainable Delivery aims to address unsafe batteries—122 fires this year, 18 deaths last year. Mayor Adams says the department will 'keep pedestrians safe, and hold delivery app companies accountable.' DOT Commissioner Rodriguez adds it will 'crack down on a range of illegal behavior.' The move follows criticism of NYPD targeting individual riders and highlights gaps in current enforcement and battery safety policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets stay clogged. Pedestrians and bus riders lose. Car dominance remains. Safety and equity stalled.</p><p class=mb3>On July 3, 2025, the Adams administration paused the 34th Street busway project, as reported by Streetsblog NYC. The matter, described as a 'highly-anticipated 34th Street busway,' had support from Council Members Erik Bottcher, Keith Powers, and others. Bottcher called it 'transformative,' promising fewer crashes and faster buses. Powers slammed the last-minute reversal. Safety analysts warn: canceling the busway preserves car dominance, discourages transit, and keeps streets unsafe for pedestrians and cyclists. The project’s future is uncertain. Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, now in its 18th year, will stretch from the Brooklyn Bridge to Inwood, covering Manhattan’s full length. Car-free Saturdays run from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. on August weekends, with additional routes in Queens, Staten Island, Bronx, and Brooklyn. Rodriguez said, 'the city's venerable Summer Streets program is all grown up.' David Meyer reported the news.
