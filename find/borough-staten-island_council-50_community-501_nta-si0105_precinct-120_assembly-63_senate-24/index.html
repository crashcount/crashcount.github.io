Leaders Shrug. How Many More Before They Act?</h1><p class="byline f6 silver">Written July 18, 2025 <em>(Revised August 6, 2025 – Updated period stats)</em></p></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>Westerleigh-Castleton Corners: Jan 1, 2022 - Jul 18, 2025</h2><h2 id=the-deaths-keep-coming>The Deaths Keep Coming</h2><p>A sixteen-year-old boy on a scooter died on College Avenue. His name was Nacere Ellis. He was hit by a Hyundai Tucson on June 29. He suffered head trauma and never made it home. The driver, seventy-nine, stayed at the scene. No charges. Police are still investigating. <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>The Brooklyn Paper reported the facts</a>.</p><p>In the last twelve months, one person died and four were seriously injured in Westerleigh-Castleton Corners. Nearly two hundred more were hurt. The numbers do not bleed, but people do.</p><h2 id=patterns-in-the-wreckage>Patterns in the Wreckage</h2><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage. Since 2022, cars and SUVs killed four people here. Trucks and buses injured more. Bikes caused three injuries, but no deaths. The old and the young are not spared. Children under eighteen were injured twenty-five times in the past year. Two were seriously hurt.</p><h2 id=leaders-votes-and-silence>Leaders: Votes and Silence</h2><p>Local leaders have a choice. In June, State Senator Andrew Lanza voted no on a bill to require speed-limiting tech for repeat speeders—he opposed a law that would have curbed the worst drivers <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>according to the official record</a>. Assembly Member Sam Pirozzolo voted no on extending school speed zones, turning his back on child safety. The bills passed anyway, but not with their help.</p><p>No public statement. No plan for safer crossings. No push for lower speed limits. The silence is loud.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p>This is not fate. Every crash is a policy failure. Every injury is a choice made by someone in power. The dead cannot speak. The living must.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ellis suffered head trauma as a result of the crash.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>The Brooklyn Paper</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;No arrests have been made, but the NYPD Highway District&rsquo;s Collision Investigation Squad is continuing its investigation.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>The Brooklyn Paper</a></p></blockquote><p>Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people outside cars. Do not wait for another child’s name to be written in the police log.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Nearly 6,000 tickets in months. Riders face courts for minor moves. Cars escape harsher scrutiny. Streets stay dangerous. Frustration mounts.</p><p class=mb3>ABC7 reported on July 23, 2025, that NYPD issued nearly 6,000 tickets to cyclists in recent months, up from 561 earlier in the year. These are not simple fines but criminal summonses, forcing court appearances for violations like riding the wrong way or in bus lanes. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said, "New Yorkers are telling us that even as crime falls, that they still don't feel safe." Critics, including Transportation Alternatives, argue that cyclists face harsher penalties than drivers, with Charlie Baker noting, "A 50-pound bike gets a criminal court date, a 6,000-pound car gets a ticket." The crackdown highlights enforcement gaps and calls for more protected bike lanes and better regulation of delivery vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Donlon cites deaths and injuries, including cyclist Amanda Servedio. The suit alleges 398 crashes and 315 injuries in 2024—a 47% jump. Donlon's allegations highlight how high-speed chases increase risk to pedestrians and cyclists, introducing unpredictable, dangerous driving and eroding public trust in safe, equitable enforcement.

The reports state, 'Years of bus priority projects have barely improved speeds because New York City leaders have not implemented real bus rapid transit (BRT).' Colon, reporting for Streetsblog NYC, supports comprehensive BRT and opposes the city’s piecemeal fixes. Mayor Adams and city agencies have not acted on key recommendations. The safety analyst notes: the lack of real BRT means missed chances for mode shift and street equity, but does not directly worsen conditions for pedestrians and cyclists; the status quo remains unchanged.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Bottcher called it 'transformative,' promising fewer crashes and faster buses. Powers slammed the last-minute reversal.

The toll will be measured in blood, not words.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13 and June 17, 2025, the New York State Senate and Assembly voted on reauthorizing New York City's school zone speed camera program. The Senate passed the measure 38-21; three city senators—Stephen Chan, Andrew Lanza, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton—voted no. The Assembly passed it 110-31, with nine city lawmakers—Alec Brook-Krasny, Lester Chang, Simcha Eichenstein, Michael Novakhov, Stacey Pheffer Amato, Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Reilly, David Weprin, Kalman Yeger—opposing. The Streetsblog NYC article, 'Ye Shall Know Their Names! Meet the Dirty Dozen City Pols Who Voted Against Speed Camera Program,' quotes lawmakers dismissing speed cameras as revenue grabs or burdens. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action, so no direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists can be assessed.' Still, the votes signal disregard for proven tools that protect those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
