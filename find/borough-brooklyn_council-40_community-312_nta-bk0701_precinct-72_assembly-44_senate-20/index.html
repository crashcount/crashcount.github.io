No one died, but the numbers do not tell the whole story. Each bruise, each broken bone, is a life changed. <strong>Injuries cut across every age group.</strong> Children, adults, the old—all marked by the same violence.</p><p>On May 27, a 28-year-old cyclist was hit at 7th Avenue and 19th Street. The crash left him with a head injury. The cause: failure to yield. The car kept going straight. The bike kept going straight. Only one body broke. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>The numbers pile up. <strong>Since 2022, 249 people have been injured in 430 crashes here.</strong> Two were serious. No deaths, but the luck will not hold. Most injuries come from cars and SUVs—14 pedestrian injuries in three years. Trucks and buses hurt three. Bikes and mopeds, three more. The street does not care who you are.</p><p>A cyclist, age 60, was left with severe face wounds after being hit by a sedan on Greenwood Avenue this May. Another cyclist, 23, suffered deep cuts to his leg after a bike-on-bike crash on Prospect Park Southwest. The pain is not abstract. It is flesh and blood.</p><h3 id=leaders-words-and-silence>Leaders: Words and Silence</h3><p><strong>Local leaders have spoken, but action is slow.</strong> State Senator Zellnor Myrie rode a bike through Brooklyn and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/16/the-dave-colon-challenge-zellnor-myrie-wants-his-own-bike-now>said the city should make cycling as easy and safe as possible for everyone</a>. Council Member Shahana Hanif is <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/12/cyclist-launches-class-action-suit-for-bogus-nypd-red-light-tickets>&ldquo;exploring&rdquo; ways to restore civil summonses for cyclists</a>, after police kept ticketing them for legal riding. But the streets remain the same.</p><p>Bills to force repeat speeders to slow down sit in Albany. Local leaders have co-sponsored some, missed votes on others. <strong>The violence continues.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every crash is preventable. Every injury is a failure of will. Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat speeders. <strong>Do not wait for the first death.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

This change eliminates the physical barrier that separated cyclists from moving vehicles.

She wrote, 'Modification of the bike lane is not a major transportation project.'

He argues the cap forces cyclists to ride slower than car traffic, putting them in harm’s way. Kevin Duggan reported the statement for Streetsblog NYC.

The Department of Transportation installed the protected lane after five pedestrian deaths in 2021 and 2022. Local lawmakers protested the removal, calling the process hasty.
