The plan, not a council bill but a DOT action, covers a seven-mile route along Bailey Avenue, Sedgwick Avenue, Depot Place, Exterior Street, E. 135th Street, Lincoln Avenue, and Bruckner Boulevard. The DOT cited access issues with state and private landowners, abandoning Mayor Adams’s earlier promise of a true waterfront path. The official summary states: 'protected bike lanes on streets near the waterfront, rather than a true waterfront greenway.' Advocates like Chauncy Young and Laura Solis welcomed protected lanes but lamented the loss of a car-free riverside route. Mayor Adams claimed the project would help undo highway devastation in the Bronx. Still, the plan leaves vulnerable road users exposed to traffic, not shielded by water’s edge.

The letter urges, 'Mass transit must be federally funded at a level commensurate to its importance.' Stewart-Cousins, mentioned as a key signatory, previously rejected the capital plan due to a $35 billion shortfall. The group asks for $14 billion in federal support, up from $13 billion in the last plan.

The CBC calls for a 6 percent hike in fares, tolls, and vehicle fees—higher than the planned 4 percent. Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie said tax hikes are on the table. Governor Hochul’s office backs a payroll tax hike, but the CBC wants it regionalized. The CBC’s Andrew Rein said, “We have to prioritize state-of-good-repair, basic modernization, and delay some of the system expansions.” The report warns that failing to fund maintenance will gut service, repeating past crises.

The measure follows the passage of Sammy’s Law, which lets the city set its own speed limits. The Department of Transportation cited ten severe injuries and one death in Dumbo over five years. The new zone covers streets packed with pedestrians, from Furman to Navy and Hudson, and John to Sands and the BQE. Restler said, 'Data has shown that a one mile per hour increase in speed results in a nearly three percent increase in mortality.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez added, 'Lowering vehicle speed limits by even a few miles per hour could be the difference between life or death in a traffic crash.' The change will take effect after a public comment period. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso called for more slow zones in high-crash neighborhoods.

Mayor Eric Adams is named as the main obstacle. The report cites staff shortages, shrinking divisions, and political pushback—especially the mayor’s role in killing the Fordham Road busway.

Delarosa faces charges of manslaughter, leaving the scene, fleeing police, and possession of stolen property. The crash highlights the lethal risk of high-speed police pursuits and the dangers posed by stolen vehicles in dense urban areas. Memorial posters for Hughley remain in his building.

The program, launched in fall 2023, uses sensors to detect overweight trucks and issue $650 fines. According to the city, overweight truck crossings on the Queens-bound BQE dropped from 7,920 daily to about 3,041 per month—a 60% reduction. The sensors are set to expand to the Staten Island-bound side this year. Restler said, "Weigh-in-Motion technology has successfully eliminated 60% of the overweight truck traffic on the Queens bound BQE." The Department of Transportation and Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez praised the program's impact and called it a potential national model.

The change, reported by Streetsblog NYC, limits car-free hours to Saturdays only from May to September—a 50 percent cut from last year’s already reduced schedule. The program, once a weekend staple from spring to fall, now faces its smallest footprint yet. Alex Morano, a volunteer organizer, called the rollback 'really unfortunate,' stressing the street’s value to the neighborhood. Saskia Haegens, Chair of the Prospect Heights Neighborhood Development Corporation, urged full city funding, saying the program is 'transformative.' Organizers blame insufficient city support, with less than half the cost covered this year. The Department of Transportation claims $10 million in annual support and promises a permanent redesign, but for now, cars win back space.

Non-residents needn’t be banned from parking here, just charged for it, with the money going to the MTA.' The editorial highlights rampant illegal vehicle registrations and the dangers they pose, including uninsured cars and increased risk for cyclists. The proposal urges charging both residents and visitors for parking, with higher rates in dense, wealthy areas. The plan aims to reduce congestion, generate MTA revenue, and reclaim curb space for safer uses.

Data from Jehiah Czebotar shows cameras now issue 76.4% of bus lane and stop tickets—93% by December. Bus speeds rose 5%, crashes involving buses dropped 20%, and emissions fell up to 10%. Persistent violators remain, with some drivers racking up five tickets. Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein called for escalating fines and legislative changes to target repeat offenders.
