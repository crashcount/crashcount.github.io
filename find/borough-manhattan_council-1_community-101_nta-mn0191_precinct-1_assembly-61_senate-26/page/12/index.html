The article, titled "New App Helps Reckless Drivers Thumb Their Noses at City’s Speed Cameras," details how the app lets drivers evade enforcement and dispute tickets. Safe-streets groups, including Transportation Alternatives and engineer Jehiah Czebotar, condemned the app. Jacob deCastro of Transportation Alternatives said, "If drivers want to avoid speeding tickets, they simply should not speed." Czebotar added, "Any demand for notifications to help drivers avoid speed cameras is proof that actually enforcing the speed limit does change driver behavior for the better." The NYPD warned that such apps undermine public safety. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes is pushing to reauthorize and expand the speed camera program. The app, and others like it, threaten vulnerable road users by making streets less safe.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Gounardes stressed urgency: 'We cannot leave Albany without reauthorizing the speed cameras.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez’s late push for home rule caused confusion, risking the program’s renewal. The bill is under negotiation as the legislative session nears its end.

The matter, described as 'home rule for the city on speed cameras,' stalled after City Hall did not send a formal request. Gounardes, shifting focus, now pushes to renew and expand the city’s automated enforcement before cameras go dark in July. Assembly Member William Magnarelli, chair of the Transportation Committee, blamed City Hall for inaction. Mayor Eric Adams and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez voiced support for home rule, but Albany holds the power. Advocates and victims’ families decry the repeated need to beg for basic safety tools. The Crash Victim Rights and Safety Act, including Sammy’s Law for lower speed limits, remains in limbo. Without home rule, New York City’s most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, children—face continued risk from political delays.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Fifty-nine people died in three months. Pedestrians and children bore the brunt. Advocates and Senator Gounardes call for urgent street redesigns and expanded camera enforcement. City Hall and Albany face mounting pressure.</p><p class=mb3>On April 20, 2022, advocates and Senator Andrew Gounardes (District 26) sounded the alarm as traffic deaths in New York City surged. The report, titled 'Advocates demand action as NYC traffic deaths rise 44% in 2022,' revealed 59 deaths in the year's first quarter, the highest since Vision Zero began in 2014. Pedestrians and minors suffered most. Gounardes declared, 'It is unacceptable that there have been more traffic fatalities this year than since Vision Zero began.' Transportation Alternatives called for Mayor Adams to back a $3.1 billion DOT street redesign plan and for Albany to grant NYC home rule over traffic cameras. Advocates demand more bike lanes, safer intersections, and unrestricted camera enforcement. The push aims to end the deadly toll on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event targeted New York City’s sluggish bus service and the high cost of MTA fares. The rally demanded Mayor Adams speed up bus commutes, install at least 30 miles of new bus lanes in 2022, and expand the Fair Fares program for low-income riders. Marte declared, 'It shouldn't just be a vote to get 30 miles of additional bus lanes. That should be the minimum.' The rally pressed the city to prioritize bus lanes, bike lanes, and pedestrian-oriented streets, echoing the Streets Master Plan. No formal bill was under consideration, but the council and advocates pushed for $3.1 billion in funding for these changes. The action highlights the urgent need for safer, faster, and more affordable transit for vulnerable New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
