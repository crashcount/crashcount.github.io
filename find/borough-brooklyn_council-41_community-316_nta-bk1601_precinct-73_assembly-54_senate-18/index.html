In the last twelve months, 285 people were hurt in crashes here. Five were left with serious injuries. Children, elders, cyclists, men and women—none spared. The numbers are not just numbers. They are broken bones, torn skin, and lives that do not heal.</p><p>Just last week, a cyclist was left bleeding from the head at Somers Street and Broadway. A bus passed too close. The man was left incoherent, blood pooling on the pavement. He was forty. He survived.

No one is safe—not on foot, not on two wheels, not at any hour.</p><h2 id=leaders-votes-and-silence>Leaders: Votes and Silence</h2><p><strong>Local leaders have taken some steps.</strong> State Senator Jabari Brisport voted yes to extend school speed zones and co-sponsored the bill to curb repeat speeders. Assembly Member Latrice Walker did the same. But the work is not done. Parking is still allowed up to the crosswalk in much of the district. Council Member Darlene Mealy co-sponsored a bill to ban it, but the law is not yet in force. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>see votes</a></p><p><strong>Some leaders speak, but the streets stay the same.</strong> As one advocate <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>said after another Brooklyn crash</a>, &ldquo;We wait until someone dies. We wait until a tragedy. We wait to say, &lsquo;oh my gosh, how could this possibly have happened?&rsquo; We let this happen time and time again.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every injury is a failure.

The 14-year-old cyclist was injured with a leg fracture and was conscious at the scene. According to the police report, contributing factors included “Driver Inattention/Distraction.” The data also flags “Following Too Closely” in relation to the crash. Vehicle records show center front-end damage to the sedan and rear-end damage to the bike, indicating a strike from behind while the cyclist turned.

The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection backed the bill, saying it would close gaps in pay protections.

The bill, sponsored by Council Member Sandy Nurse, matches earlier raises for restaurant deliveristas. The matter summary: 'the NYC Council approved on Monday a pay increase for app-based grocery-delivery workers.' Speaker Adrienne Adams and Justin Brannan backed higher EMT pay, but the bill leaves FDNY EMTs earning less than delivery workers. Safety analysts found no direct impact on pedestrians or cyclists: 'The pay increase for app-based delivery workers does not directly affect the safety of pedestrians or cyclists, nor does it impact street design, mode shift, or driver accountability.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The lane, installed after high crash rates and pedestrian deaths, was set for removal until the court's emergency order. The Department of Transportation admitted, "The City risks legal liability for knowingly reducing safety on a Vision Zero priority corridor." Advocates and families appealed, citing the lane’s role in protecting vulnerable road users. The legal battle highlights the tension between city policy, resident concerns, and the need for proven safety infrastructure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
