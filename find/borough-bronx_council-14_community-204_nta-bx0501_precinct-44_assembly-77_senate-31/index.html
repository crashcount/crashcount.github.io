The riders were thrown to the road and later died at local hospitals. Officials named them as Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19, and Enrique Martinez, 21, both from the Bronx, in early reports from Monday. The southbound lanes closed for hours. One man was taken into custody at the scene. Later, prosecutors charged him with vehicular manslaughter and DWI. He is 21. His name is Mauricio Neyra Yuyes, of White Plains, according to charging documents and police briefings. He was released without bail as the case moves.</p><p>Gothamist wrote: “Police have arrested and charged a man with vehicular manslaughter and driving while intoxicated in a multivehicle crash on a Bronx highway that killed two people.” It also reported a criminal complaint noting “a strong odor of alcohol on his breath” and that he stood unsteadily after the crash. Family members faced the court the next day. One sister said: “He was drunk. Think about how he took two lives.”</p><ul><li><a href=https://gothamist.com/news/2-killed-1-taken-into-custody-in-multivehicle-bronx-river-parkway-crash-nypd-says>Initial NYPD details and closures</a></li><li><a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Charges: vehicular manslaughter and DWI</a></li><li><a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>Family’s words in court</a></li></ul><p>“Two men on motorcycles were killed,” NYPD told CBS. Police later clarified the machines as mopeds in early statements; other reports said scooters. Two lives, either way. The road did not care.</p><p>—</p><p>Night after night, the math does not bend</p><p>In University Heights (South)–Morris Heights, nights are when bodies break. From midnight to 2 a.m., crashes pile up, with two deaths logged in that window. Another fatal hour comes at 6 a.m., then 6 p.m., then 11 p.m. That drumbeat is in the city’s own ledger. Most injuries hit people inside cars. But pedestrians take the hardest blows: four killed here since 2022, 122 hurt. Bicyclists, 57 injured. Moped and other small‑motor riders, two dozen injured. No armor. No margin.</p><p>The worst corridors are named. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Major Deegan Expressway</a> shows two deaths and 148 injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Jerome Avenue</a> shows one death and 55 injuries. A man was killed walking on the Deegan in June 2024. Another pedestrian died at a Deegan ramp in 2023. A 44‑year‑old woman died on Macombs Road this month. Each case is a line in a spreadsheet. Each line is a life.</p><p>The city tags causes as “other” for most deaths here. Inattention is next. Speed is listed in a few injuries. Labels don’t stop steel.</p><p>—</p><p>Two riders down. A system shrugs</p><p>Police said the Parkway crash started with a pass that failed. Then a hit. Then two more. The men were ejected and died. The driver was charged and released pending the case. “My client is prepared to contest these charges,” his lawyer said. The highway reopened. Morning traffic filled the gap.</p><p>Families came to court. “Two people were killed,” a sister said. “He was drunk.” The words hung there. The case may change.

The city can set safer limits. It has not done so citywide. Start there.</p><p>Stop the worst drivers from ever hitting this fast. The Senate moved a bill to force speed limiters on chronic violators. Assembly leaders have matching language. Sponsors say it targets those who rack up tickets and points and keep going.

Bronx Democrat Pierina Sanchez introduced the measure, stating, 'I am the daughter and granddaughter of street vendors.' The bill aims to replace criminal charges with fines and remove barriers for thousands of vendors. Mayor Eric Adams opposes lifting the cap, citing sidewalk crowding. The matter summary: 'change may be coming for the thousands of street vendors operating in New York City.' Safety analysts note that easing restrictions can boost pedestrian activity and street presence, creating 'safety in numbers' and calming traffic. This could improve safety for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
