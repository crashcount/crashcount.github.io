Eight left with serious wounds.</strong> In Crotona Park East, the numbers do not lie. Since 2022, the streets have claimed three lives and left eight more with injuries that do not heal fast. In the last twelve months, 137 people were hurt in 197 crashes, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. No one died this year, but the wounds keep coming. The pain does not stop.</p><p>A man, 48, crushed by a taxi on Boone Avenue. A moped rider, 44, left with a torn face on Boston Road. A bus, a sedan, an SUV—each one a weapon in the wrong hands. Pedestrians, cyclists, and riders pay the price. The street does not care who you are. It only takes.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-waiting>Leadership: Words and Waiting</h3><p><strong>The city talks of Vision Zero. The city says one death is too many.</strong> But in Crotona Park East, the work is not done. Speed cameras work, but only where they are turned on. Lower speed limits save lives, but only if leaders use the power they have. The law lets them set 20 mph limits now. They have not done it here. The silence is loud.</p><p>No new bills. No bold redesigns. No public fight for the most vulnerable. The numbers show the cost of delay. Every day without action is another day of risk.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>The disaster is slow, but it is not fate.</strong> Residents and advocates can force change. Call the council. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand more cameras. Demand streets that do not kill. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The city will not act unless you make them.</p><p><strong>Act now. Demand safer streets.</strong> <a href=../../take_action/>Take action today.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
