Five serious injuries. 631 people hurt.</strong> That is the toll of traffic violence in Forest Hills since 2022. These are not just numbers—they are bodies broken, lives changed. In the last year alone, 212 people were injured here. Four suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same again. No one died in the last twelve months, but luck will not hold.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> An 18-year-old was killed by an SUV on the Long Island Expressway. A 16-year-old girl, crossing with the light, was struck by a bus on Yellowstone Boulevard. A cyclist’s face was torn open in a crash with a van on 108th Street. These are not rare events—they are the drumbeat of daily life in Forest Hills. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the data</a>.</p><h3 id=the-vehicles-that-wound-and-kill>The Vehicles That Wound and Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs, sedans, trucks, buses, bikes, mopeds.</strong> In Forest Hills, SUVs and cars caused the only death and most serious injuries. Trucks and buses left two people with life-altering wounds. Bikes and mopeds hurt others. The street does not forgive mistakes, and the biggest machines do the most harm.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn’t</h3><p><strong>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero.</strong> The city touts new speed limits, more cameras, and intersection redesigns. But in Forest Hills, the carnage continues. The numbers do not move fast enough. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not used it here. Cameras catch speeders, but only where they are installed. The rest of the streets are left to chance.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every injury, every death, is preventable. Demand more. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to lower the speed limit, build real protection for people on foot and bike, and keep the cameras running. Do not wait for another body in the road. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Surveillance video showed Servedio "went flying off her bicycle and slammed into a parked BMW while Fiseku sped off." Police ended their pursuit to help Servedio, who died at Elmhurst Hospital. Fiseku was on supervised release for a prior federal conviction at the time. The article highlights that Fiseku had three passengers and was fleeing police, raising questions about police pursuit protocols and the risks to vulnerable road users.
