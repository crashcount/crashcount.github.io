Danger surged.</p><p class=mb3>On September 29, 2023, Council Member Lincoln Restler (District 33) spotlighted the devastation as extreme flooding crippled New York City’s transit. The event, titled 'Extreme weather event (flooding) impacts on NYC transportation,' showed buses stranded, subways flooded, and streets impassable. Restler was mentioned as a key voice demanding action. The article’s summary reads: 'We Have the 'End of Days' Flooding Pics You Need Right Now.' The city’s emergency response faltered. The MTA and DOT failed to protect riders and walkers. Streets and drainage buckled. Leadership, including the mayor, stayed out of sight. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, transit riders, and cyclists—faced the brunt of systemic neglect. No safety analyst weighed in, but the images and accounts show a city unprepared for crisis.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The case stems from a November 11, 2022 arrest after White removed a plastic cover from a license plate he believed was obscured to dodge traffic cameras. The complaint, citing false arrest and retaliation, states: "Mr. White now brings this suit seeking redress for the violations of his own rights, as well as seeking changes to Defendant City's policies and practices around responding appropriately, and without retaliation, to civilian complaints about illegal 'ghost cars,' 'ghost plates,' and other traffic misconduct." The suit names Sholem Klein, head of the Rockaway Nassau Safety Patrol, as the complainant who called police. The Brooklyn DA later dropped charges against White.

The driver, Faheem Shabazz, had a record of speeding violations. Gounardes, a safe streets advocate, said, 'That's really what this conversation should be about—how are we holding people accountable when they have violations to their record and zero consequences for it.' He supports lowering speed limits and tougher penalties but stressed that enforcement is lacking. Senator Iwen Chu urged the NYC DOT to study the area for safety upgrades, stating, 'We must recognize that our streets need to be designed with safety in mind.' The DOT is reviewing the intersection. The call is clear: repeat offenders face little consequence, and street design still puts pedestrians at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as 'DOT continues to ignore dangers it created on Brooklyn’s Fourth Ave,' centers on DOT’s decision to replace bike lanes with a second car lane, violating a city law that requires temporary bike lanes during such work. Council Members Lincoln Restler, Alexa Aviles, Shahana Hanif, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, State Senator Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, and groups like Bike New York and Transportation Alternatives sent a letter demanding the bike lane’s return and physical barriers to stop illegal parking on pedestrian islands. The letter urges DOT to 'ensure curb lanes be preserved for safe cyclist passage' and to 'deploy quick-build physical elements' for pedestrian safety. DOT has not responded. Cyclists and pedestrians remain at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Despite over 34,000 drivers meeting the threshold in the last year, only about 1,200 took the course in three years. DOT has not explained the reporting delay or provided outcome data.

The official summary claims 'new improvements' and uses language of equity and sustainability. Advocates like Janet Gallant and Ben Crowther call it 'greenwashing' and a 'marketing ploy.'

Cyclists pay.</p><p class=mb3>""The administration cannot fall further behind on the NYC Streets Plan’s legal requirements to build protected places for people to bike in every neighborhood of our city."" -- Charles Fall</p><p class=mb3>On August 9, 2023, a cyclist was killed by a hit-and-run dump truck driver in Council District 17, Bronx. The incident marks the 21st cyclist death this year, the highest since Vision Zero began in 2014. The matter highlights that only 1.64% of district streets have protected bike lanes, far below the city average. Jada Yeboah, Bronx/Uptown Organizer for Transportation Alternatives, condemned the city's failure: "Inaction is killing New Yorkers of color." She demanded Mayor Adams meet legal requirements for protected bike lanes, noting only five miles have been built in the Bronx out of 50 required citywide this year. The Bronx ranks third in traffic fatalities, eighth in injuries among 51 districts. The city's inaction leaves cyclists exposed. The toll mounts.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The map must show disruptions, detours, hazards, and closures in real time. The bill summary states: 'Cyclists deserve the same attention and information already given to the city's drivers and transit riders in the form of notifications, updates, and well-marked detours.' Council Member Carlina Rivera sponsored the bill and led its passage. Rivera and Bike New York’s Jon Orcutt wrote, 'Disruption of any city bikeway requires public information, working detours and operational attention—not just an unheralded shut-down.' The law aims to end the chaos and danger of sudden bike lane closures, giving half a million daily riders the information they need to stay safe and keep moving.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Adriano Espaillat worked behind closed doors to stall Fordham Road bus lane improvements. Bronx lawmakers, once supportive, fell silent or opposed. The project, meant to speed up buses for 85,000 riders, now faces more delays. Vulnerable riders remain stuck in slow, dangerous traffic.</p><p class=mb3>On August 3, 2023, Rep. Adriano Espaillat quietly lobbied Bronx officials against proposed Fordham Road bus lane upgrades. The project, under city review since 2022, aimed to speed up buses for 85,000 daily riders by installing dedicated busways or offset lanes. According to Streetsblog, Espaillat leaned on younger electeds to align with Council Member Oswald Feliz, a vocal critic. 'He defers to the local elected officials, and all of them seem to be in agreement,' said Espaillat’s chief of staff, Aneiry Batista. Lawmakers who once supported the upgrades grew silent or opposed them after Espaillat’s intervention. The Department of Transportation, MTA, and governor’s office met with Espaillat to discuss the project, but delays persisted. The opposition from Feliz and business groups led DOT to scrap the most ambitious safety options. Riders, many without cars, remain exposed to slow, hazardous conditions as cars block bus lanes and traffic crawls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
