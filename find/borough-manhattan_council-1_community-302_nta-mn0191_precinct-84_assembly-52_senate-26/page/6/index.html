The project, described as a 'modern maritime port and mixed-use community hub,' aims to overhaul the industrial waterfront with new housing and shipping facilities. Council Member Alexa Avilés, representing District 38, serves as vice chair of the Brooklyn Marine Terminal Taskforce, leading community engagement. The plan includes an $80 million city investment and a $15 million state investment in cold storage to reduce truck traffic. Rep. Jerry Nadler criticized the move, warning that shrinking the Red Hook Container Port could increase truck traffic and harm jobs. The final vision will be shaped by community input. No formal safety analysis for vulnerable road users has been released.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

On May 15, 2024, more than a dozen local officials sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, urging passage before session’s end in June. The letter, organized by Local Progress, states: 'This means projects that expanded cycling infrastructure, pedestrian walkways, and public transit were prioritized over outdated highway expansions and lane widening.' State Senator Andrew Gounardes sponsors the bill. Alex Marion, Syracuse city auditor, signed on, saying, 'If we can reduce the vehicle miles traveled, we can look at the space of streets differently.' The bill would force planners to consider car miles in every project, shifting focus from car movement to safer, people-first streets. The policy could help undo decades of harm from highways that split communities and reinforce segregation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Adams administration and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez have pushed for more cameras.

The measure remains in committee. The bill responds to a fatal flaw: 'We have no mechanism right now, under law, to crack down on extremely reckless drivers,' said Brooklyn State Sen. Andrew Gounardes. The current law lets drivers rack up dozens of camera tickets and keep driving, since no points are added to licenses. Gianaris’s bill aims to close this loophole.
