The resolution was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. Only 117 out of 493 subway stations are accessible.

The announcement, covered by Streetsblog NYC, focused on broad climate issues. Advocates, including Jaqi Cohen and Kevin Garcia, pressed the new office to prioritize transportation emissions, quoting, 'improving transit options and creating access for environmental justice communities, while also curbing harmful diesel emissions.' Aggarwala voiced support for congestion pricing, pedestrianization, and bus lanes, promising collaboration with the Department of Transportation. Transportation emissions have dropped only 5% since 2007, while car ownership rises.

The article, 'Analysis: The Decline and Fall of Mandatory Parking Minimums,' highlights reforms like removing off-street parking requirements, charging demand-based prices, and investing parking revenue in public services. Cities such as South Bend, Sacramento, Berkeley, Minneapolis, and others lead the charge. State-level changes in Oregon, California, and Connecticut follow. The analysis credits UCLA Professor Donald Shoup’s influence. No council bill number or committee is cited, as this is a legislative trend, not a single bill. The piece notes, 'Minimum parking requirements are on the way out.' These reforms embed parking changes within broader housing and zoning efforts, aiming to cut car dependency and boost affordable housing. No direct safety analyst note is included, but the trend signals a shift in urban priorities that could reshape streets for all users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Contributor Charles Komanoff, using his Balanced Transportation Analyzer, finds that an $80 toll would maximize net societal benefit, nearly $10 billion yearly. The article states: 'A $13 or $15 congestion toll might be all the politicians think they can achieve, but such a low fee will fail to maximize the net societal benefit.' Komanoff’s analysis shows the current plan extracts only half the possible benefit while charging less than a fifth of the optimal toll. No council member is named; this is an expert’s call to action. The piece notes that higher tolls could fund subway safety upgrades and faster trains, but the city’s political will remains weak.

A 75-year-old pedestrian was hit midblock by a driver in a Lincoln Corsair. Gallagher wrote, 'Extremely distressing to see another serious crash injuring a pedestrian on McGuinness. I’m thinking about the victim and continuing to fight for our improvements, which can’t come soon enough.' The street, notorious for speeding and poor crossings, is slated for a $39 million redesign after years of advocacy and deadly crashes. The Make McGuinness Safe Coalition and residents have pushed for a road diet, bike lanes, and traffic calming. The Department of Transportation is gathering public feedback, with construction expected later this year.

The article, titled “Why Tesla Can Program Its Cars to Break Road Safety Laws,” exposes how Tesla’s October 2021 software update lets drivers select aggressive profiles. In ‘assertive’ mode, Teslas tailgate, perform unsafe passes, and roll through stops—illegal actions in most states. Phil Koopman, an autonomous vehicle expert, said, “Basically, Tesla is programming its cars to break laws.” The report highlights a regulatory gap: U.S. law punishes drivers, not manufacturers. Some states shield automakers, while others seek accountability. NHTSA investigates, but action lags. Tesla faces no immediate recall. The result: automated vehicles threaten pedestrians and cyclists, while lawmakers and regulators look away.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They challenged policing as a fix. They called for social services, not crackdowns. Riders and the unhoused share the system. Boards shape whether transit is safe for all, or just some.</p><p class=mb3>On January 6, 2022, a panel at the Railvolution conference, moderated by former BART GM Grace Crunican, brought together Monica Tibbits-Nutt (former MBTA board) and Christof Spieler (former Houston Metro board) to discuss transit board policy. The session, titled 'Building a Better Transit Board,' focused on how agencies address homelessness. Tibbits-Nutt argued, 'as long as we continue to have these discussions in just that safety standpoint... we’re not going to be able to address any of these issues.' Spieler added, 'they have a right to be on the bus as much as anyone else.' Both opposed policing as the main response and urged boards to involve social services. The discussion underscored that transit boards can either foster inclusive safety or reinforce exclusion and danger for vulnerable riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
