Over 130,000 reckless drivers dodge speed-limiter rules. Only the worst offenders face consequences. Pedestrians and cyclists stay exposed. Lawmakers chose drivers over safety. The city’s deadliest keep rolling. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On June 11, 2025, the New York State Senate amended the Super Speeder Bill, sponsored by Sen. Andrew Gounardes (D-Bay Ridge). The bill originally required drivers with six or more speed or red-light camera tickets in a year to install speed-limiting devices. The Senate raised the threshold to sixteen speed-camera tickets, and removed red-light violations from the count. Streetsblog NYC reports, 'the state Senate moved to help more than 130,000 reckless drivers avoid accountability.' Gounardes defended the change, saying it would allow the program to grow slowly. Assembly Member Michaell Novakhov (R-Midwood) argued the threshold was too low. The amendment means only 17,000 drivers, not 150,000, will face restrictions. According to safety analysts, this move undermines deterrence, increases risk to pedestrians and cyclists, and signals that dangerous driving is tolerated. Vulnerable road users remain at risk. The bill’s status now sets a weaker standard for accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal, approved unanimously by Community Board 6's Transportation Committee, removes car lanes for a protected bike lane, a dedicated bus lane, and pedestrian improvements. The DOT will install parking-protected bike lanes, painted sidewalk extensions, and pedestrian islands. The official matter summary states: 'The proposal will reduce the roadway from six or seven lanes for cars to three moving lanes, two parking lanes, plus a bus lane and a bike lane.' DOT Project Manager Esteban Doyle said the plan reallocates space to match actual use. Community members praised the move. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not specify what design was implemented or how it affected pedestrians and cyclists, so no safety impact can be determined.'

The bill, heard in the Assembly Transportation Committee, would have required drivers with six or more camera-issued speeding tickets in a year to install a device preventing them from exceeding the speed limit by more than five miles per hour. Advocates, including Amy Cohen of Families for Safe Streets, called the Assembly's move 'outrageous.' Senate sponsor Andrew Gounardes vowed to keep fighting. Assembly Transportation Chair William Magnarelli cited due process concerns. Brandy Nannini, Ben Furnas, and Frank Harris condemned the inaction. According to safety analysts, the event marks no direct change for pedestrian or cyclist safety, as the bill did not pass and no new protections were enacted.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, supported by Council Members Lincoln Restler, Shahana Hanif, Crystal Hudson, and Rita Joseph, aims to improve transit and pedestrian safety. The matter summary states: 'A proposed center-running bus lane on Flatbush Avenue... is being considered by the NYC Department of Transportation (DOT) as a way to improve transit, calm traffic, and enhance pedestrian safety.' The project faces delays and political pushback, including the removal of a protected bike lane after developer objections. A safety analyst notes: 'Center-running bus lanes typically reduce conflicts between buses, cars, pedestrians, and cyclists, calm traffic, and can enable street redesigns that improve safety and comfort for vulnerable road users.' The DOT will present a detailed plan in the fall. The final decision rests with Mayor Adams.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
