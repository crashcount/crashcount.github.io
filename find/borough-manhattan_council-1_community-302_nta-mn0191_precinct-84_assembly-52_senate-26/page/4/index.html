The resolution, introduced March 7, 2024, calls for 'the registration of bicycles with electric assist used for commercial purposes and creates liability for employers for certain violations.' Council Member James F. Gennaro leads as primary sponsor, joined by Gale A. Brewer, Christopher Marte, Alexa Avilés, Farah N. Louis, and Justin L. Brannan. The bill would require commercial e-bikes to be registered and display visible license information. Employers, not delivery workers, would be fined for violations like sidewalk riding. The council frames this as a way to identify dangerous vehicles and hold companies accountable, aiming to reduce injuries and deaths among pedestrians and cyclists.

The bills, now before committee, aim to expand bike parking and storage in city parks and buildings. The matter summary states: 'A package of bills before the City Council would create more bike parking and storage in local parks and city-owned buildings to protect against theft.' Marte, the sponsor, said, 'The city is transforming to be a more bike-friendly place, but to increase that safety, to increase that accessibility, we need to make sure that we have bike storage that people can feel confident of where they're gonna leave their bikes.' Emily Jacobi of Transportation Alternatives backed the bills, noting, 'These bills will expand bike parking and bike accessibility across New York City.' The bills target the gap between car and bike parking, aiming to give cyclists safer, more reliable options.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill states: "requiring the installation of speed humps on roadways adjacent to any park equal or greater than one acre." Lincoln Restler leads as primary sponsor, joined by seventeen co-sponsors including Joseph, Feliz, Louis, Marte, and others. The Department of Transportation must install speed humps on qualifying streets unless the commissioner finds it unsafe or inconsistent with DOT guidelines. The bill remains in committee. If passed, it would take effect 180 days after becoming law. The measure aims to slow traffic near parks, where walkers and children cross.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
