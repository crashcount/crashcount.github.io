Adams called for meetings with precincts and targeting dangerous intersections. But he gave no specifics on enforcement, legislative changes, or expanding the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program. Advocates like Eric McClure (StreetsPAC) and Sara Lind (Open Plans) welcomed the words but demanded concrete action, especially from the NYPD. The city’s current laws limit its power to remove dangerous drivers.

The plan, part of the 'Great Streets' project, keeps eight car lanes and installs only lightly protected bike lanes with mountable curbs. Samuel Santaella, the author, writes: 'the department has discriminated against thousands of bikers and 13,630 pre-pandemic daily bus riders in order to privilege the needs of 40,000 daily motorists.' Santaella opposes the current DOT plan and urges a redesign: reduce car lanes to four, add center-running bus lanes, fully separated bikeways, and wider sidewalks. He warns that mountable curbs let drivers invade bike lanes, putting cyclists at risk. Bus riders see little benefit, still stuck behind double-parked cars. The piece demands the city stop favoring drivers and start protecting vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, part of ongoing budget talks, aims to fund hundreds of miles of protected bike and bus lanes, plus concrete barriers. Council Member Lincoln Restler of District 33, a member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, praised the move as 'a very clear commitment to addressing street safety across the five boroughs.' The proposal supports the Streets Master Plan, which mandates 250 miles of protected bike lanes and 150 miles of protected bus lanes in five years. Restler emphasized that the funding will harden bike lanes, replacing paint with physical barriers to keep cars out and protect cyclists. The Council had requested $3.1 billion, but Restler called the $900 million a dramatic investment.

The city promises to focus on underserved neighborhoods, aiming for equity. Still, most operations rely on volunteers, not city workers. Car owners protest the loss of parking.

State Sen. Andrew Gounardes called the grade unacceptable, urging passage of his road-sharing training bill and support for Sen. Brad Hoylman’s bill to lower speed limits. Gounardes also pushed to keep speed cameras active. Advocates like Jon Orcutt acknowledged progress, such as the MTA’s bike strategy and new greenway funding, but stressed the need for stronger laws.

Decades of rising car ownership brought longer, not shorter, trips. Streets stay dangerous. Pollution and risk fall hardest on communities of color. The answer is not more cars. It is safer streets.</p><p class=mb3>This policy analysis, released April 20, 2022, reviews a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. The report, titled 'Study: Car Ownership Doesn’t Always Cut Black Workers’ Commutes,' finds that despite an increase in car ownership among Black workers—from 76% in 1980 to 85% in 2019—average commute times grew longer, not shorter. The study states, 'it may not be possible to speed up city commutes with automotive strategies alone.' The gap in commute times between Black and White workers persists, especially in large, segregated cities. The article warns that subsidizing driving will make streets more polluted and dangerous, with the heaviest toll on communities of color. It calls for investment in bus rapid transit, trains, and active transportation, and for building communities where jobs and housing are close. No council member is named; this is a research release, not a legislative action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
