Eight seriously hurt.</strong> One thousand crashes since 2022. Pedestrians, cyclists, children—none spared. The numbers are not just numbers. They are bodies on the pavement, sirens in the night, families waiting in hospital halls.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs killed three. Trucks and buses killed two.</strong> The rest fell to bikes, mopeds, and the endless churn of metal. In the last year alone, two more lives lost, four left with wounds that do not heal. Seventy-one injured since January. The slow grind does not stop.</p><h3 id=the-latest-blows>The Latest Blows</h3><p>On June 2, a driver made a U-turn at East 4th and Avenue D. He aimed his car at a man and hit him. The victim survived. The driver vanished into the dark. Police are still looking. No arrests. No answers. <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/driver-strikes-lower-east-side-pedestrian-06022025/>&ldquo;The driver made a U-turn, then rammed the vehicle into a 29-year-old man.&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=promises-and-delays>Promises and Delays</h3><p>The city says it wants zero deaths. It passed Sammy’s Law. It can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not done so. Cameras catch speeders, but Albany drags its feet on renewing the law. The numbers show what delay costs: more dead, more broken.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—and Not Done</h3><p>The city built new crosswalks. It added bike lanes. It talks about Vision Zero. But the dead keep coming. The law lets leaders act. They have not acted fast enough.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do><strong>What You Can Do</strong></h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras stay on. Demand streets that do not kill.</strong></p><p>Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home. The street does not care. Only action will stop the bleeding.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

More vehicles in bus lanes mean more risk for people walking, biking, and waiting at curbs. Danger grows where curb chaos reigns.</p><p class=mb3>Bill Int 1339-2025 sits with the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure since July 14, 2025. The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code...exempting ambulettes from certain bus lane restrictions and allowing them to double park to assist passengers,' would let ambulettes drive, stop, and double-park in bus lanes to help passengers. Council Member Julie Menin sponsors, joined by Linda Lee, Frank Morano, Eric Dinowitz, Lynn C. Schulman, Kamillah Hanks, Carlina Rivera, and Chris Banks. Allowing more vehicles to double-park and block bus lanes increases risk for pedestrians and cyclists at the curb. The city’s most vulnerable will face more conflict and less safe space.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
