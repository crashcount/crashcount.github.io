Nine more are seriously injured.</strong> Since 2022, there have been <strong>over 1,500 crashes</strong> and <strong>more than 900 injuries</strong>. The dead include a child, an elder, and too many whose names are now only numbers in a file. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>The violence is relentless. <strong>SUVs and cars lead the body count</strong>—three deaths, 159 injuries. Trucks and buses add more. Bikes and mopeds leave their own scars. Pedestrians are struck at intersections, on crosswalks, on the open street. No one is spared.</p><h3 id=the-faces-behind-the-numbers>The Faces Behind the Numbers</h3><p>A 101-year-old woman was killed crossing with the signal. The driver was unlicensed.

The record says &ldquo;view obstructed.&rdquo; The record does not say who waited at the hospital, or who did not come home.</p><p>A man, 53, was killed by a distracted driver.

The city has the power to lower speed limits, redesign streets, and force out repeat offenders. But power unused is as deadly as a speeding car.</p><p><strong>Call your council member.

Last week, a speeding driver ran a red light, killing two pedestrians. The article quotes Adams, who once called Third Avenue 'extremely intimidating' and said it 'must be at the top of our list.' Despite this, his administration 'put the brakes on a potentially life-saving road redesign,' favoring business interests. Attorney Peter Beadle notes, 'they had a plan ready to go and then it was pulled back.' The city could face legal action for failing to act despite knowing the risks, echoing a 2017 state court ruling on municipal liability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streetsblog quotes Ben Furnas: 'The Adams administration is going to have to spend their night preparing their legal case, not ripping out a critical safety project.'

On June 26, 2025, Zohran Mamdani won the Democratic primary for NYC mayor. The matter, as reported by Sophia Lebowitz, states Mamdani's platform: 'make buses fast and free, add more protected bike lanes, and increase car-free public space.' Mamdani promises political will for proven safety measures. No specific legislation or committee action yet. The safety analyst notes: 'The event describes a political nomination outcome without reference to any specific transportation policy or legislation, so it has no direct impact on pedestrian or cyclist safety.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lawmakers dragged their feet. No new laws for safer streets. Pedestrians and cyclists left exposed. The car stays king. The status quo kills. Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>""Sometimes we can’t account for whether or not the trucks actually got down the block, or whether or not cars are obstructing them," Cunningham told Streetsblog. "That destroys our catch basins because they don’t get clean."" -- Brian Cunningham</p><p class=mb3>The 2025 Albany legislative session ended June 25, with lawmakers failing to pass key street safety bills. The Streetsblog NYC report reads: "Our elected officials in Albany have failed the livable streets movement again." Despite support for measures like speed camera reauthorization, most bills to protect pedestrians and cyclists died in committee or never reached the floor. Assembly Member Amy Sohn and others criticized the lack of action. The only major win was extending the city’s speed camera program. A safety analyst notes: 'Failure to advance livable streets policies likely maintains the status quo, which typically prioritizes car-centric infrastructure and neglects the safety and needs of pedestrians and cyclists.' The session’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users at risk. No progress. No protection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
