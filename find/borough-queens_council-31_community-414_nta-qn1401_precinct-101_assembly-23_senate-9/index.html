Richards</p><p class=mb3>On August 8, 2025, Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and Council Member Vickie Paladino, joined by State Sen. John Liu and others, called for flood-related street signage and storm mitigation in Bay Terrace. They urged the Department of Transportation to act after flash floods submerged the Cross Island Parkway. The matter, described as a 'call for flood-related street signage and storm mitigation efforts,' saw Richards call signage a 'small step' and Paladino stress the need for warnings. The safety analyst notes these efforts may help general conditions but do not address the core safety needs of pedestrians and cyclists or shift burdens away from vulnerable users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Riders wait.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist (2025-07-08) reports new bus lanes are coming to Hillside Avenue, Queens. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said the corridor suffers from 'an inconsistent, patchwork design' and blocked lanes. Buses crawl at four miles per hour due to congestion. Only a third of road space serves buses, though 83% of transit users ride them. The project adds camera-enforced bus lanes, parking, and loading zones. Policy shifts road space from private cars to public transit, aiming to speed up service for 215,000 daily riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
