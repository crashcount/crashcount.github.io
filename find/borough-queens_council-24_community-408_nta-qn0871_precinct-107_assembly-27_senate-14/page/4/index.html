The resolution urges the New York State Legislature to 'adopt the same exemptions as FMCSA for approved digital mirror systems with respect to operation in intrastate commerce.' The federal FMCSA allows digital mirror systems in place of traditional mirrors for interstate trucks, citing improved field of vision and blind spot elimination. New York State does not yet allow these systems for trucks operating only within the state. Gennaro’s action aims to align state law with federal safety standards, which the FMCSA says may offer equal or greater safety than old mirrors. The measure remains in committee, awaiting further action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
