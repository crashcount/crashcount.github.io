City leaders say the next step is lower speeds and stopping chronic speeders. That is already our fight. Sammy’s Law lets New York City set lower limits, and bills in Albany would force the worst repeat offenders to install speed limiters. The Senate bill is S 4045. It moved in June with yes votes from local Senators, per the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>official file</a>.</p><p>Citywide changes sit on the table. The city can lower default limits. The state can require intelligent speed assistance for drivers who rack up violations. The tools exist. Lives do not come back.</p><h3 id=do-one-thing-today>Do one thing today</h3><p>Two young men died on a parkway built for speed. The list is longer than this page.
