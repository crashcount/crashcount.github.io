The effort, known as daylighting, aims to improve visibility and pedestrian safety. Adams said, 'Protecting New Yorkers is my most sacred responsibility as mayor.' Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers praised daylighting as 'a proven safety measure.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez stressed that daylighting must include physical infrastructure to prevent reckless turns. The Department of Transportation will also add raised crosswalks, extended sidewalks, and leading pedestrian signals at 1,000 intersections next year. The city will expand speed restriction technology in its fleet and increase data transparency. Advocates and community boards have long called for these changes. With nearly 47,000 intersections citywide, the plan will take decades to reach every corner.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, covered by Streetsblog NYC, quotes Adams: the fee is 'the beginning of the conversation' and exemptions must be considered. Councilmember Selvena Brooks-Powers, chair of the Transportation Committee, echoed concerns, saying the toll 'is going to put definitely a hardship on many of my constituents.' Experts Bruce Schaller and Danny Pearlstein criticized Adams, urging him to champion the program’s benefits for transit riders and the environment. The mayor’s office later clarified his comments focused on city workers in city vehicles. The article notes that while a small fraction of Brooks-Powers’s constituents drive into Manhattan, all would benefit from improved transit. Adams’s wavering undermines momentum for a policy proven to reduce traffic and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The company now focuses on its growing electric taxi fleet, boasting 500 Teslas and over 1,500 drivers. Advocates mourned the loss, calling it a bad day for car-free travel.

Adams promised 75 miles of new protected bike lanes each year but delivered just 26.3 miles in 2022, missing the 30-mile benchmark and falling far short of the 50-mile requirement for 2023. Danny Harris, executive director of Transportation Alternatives, accused Adams of putting 'politics over people' and called on Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers and colleagues to pass Intro 417, which would eliminate a three-month delay in bike lane construction. DOT spokesman Chris Browne defended the administration, citing nearly 100 street projects. But the report is clear: delays and broken promises leave cyclists exposed and dying.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers and Kamillah Hanks did not comment. Activists and officials noted DOT’s automated cameras failed to bill 1.2 million violations last year due to temp tags, leaving dangerous drivers unaccountable.
