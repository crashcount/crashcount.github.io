The MTA claimed, 'There is less traffic and quicker streets,' citing a 16% drop in Midtown traffic and faster bus times. Ariola dismissed the data as 'fugazi.' The plan, imposed by the state, began January 5 with a $9 toll per car. Critics, including Ariola, Staten Island Borough President Vito Fossella, and Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, questioned the numbers and economic impact. Susan Lee of New Yorkers Against Congestion Taxes noted, 'January is usually the slowest month,' and warned that some areas saw more congestion as drivers dodged tolls. The council’s debate highlights deep skepticism about the plan’s real effect on city streets and the daily safety of those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Governor Kathy Hochul signed this and other safety bills into law. Charter bus passengers ages 8 to 16 must now wear seatbelts, a response to a fatal crash in Orange County.

Critics say it slows life-saving street redesigns. Advocates warn it props up car culture and blocks safer bike lanes. The bill risks more sidewalk riding and fewer safe crossings.</p><p class=mb3>Intro 103, now before the City Council, would require the Department of Transportation to notify Council members every time a single parking spot is repurposed—for car-share, bike corrals, or Citi Bike docks. The bill, sponsored by Council Member Joann Ariola, claims residents need notice before losing parking. But DOT and street safety advocates slam the measure as a bureaucratic drag on urgent safety fixes. Council Member Lincoln Restler calls it 'additional hoops and hurdles' for street safety. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso says, 'I don’t know why we entertain any effort to stop or slow-roll safe street design.' Open Plans and StreetsPAC argue the bill props up car dominance and blocks safer, more sustainable streets. The bill could make it harder to move bike infrastructure off sidewalks, risking more sidewalk riding and fewer safe crossings for pedestrians. Similar bills (Intro 606, Intro 104) face the same criticism.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, now entering its last public feedback phase, will be reviewed by the MTA Board in early winter 2025 and implemented by late summer. The proposal includes over $30 million in new funding, 17 new local routes, and increased frequency for 17 lines, but also service reductions on 29 routes. The main highlight is the introduction of 'rush' routes to connect riders to rail faster. MTA Chair Janno Lieber said, 'Every change to a route has an impact on the schedule... and we did it.' Queens Borough President Donovan Richards voiced support, stating, 'I'm ready. We're ready.' The process began in 2019 and was shaped by extensive community input.

The redesign stretches from Queens Plaza to Hillside Avenue, creating the city’s longest protected bike lane. The DOT reports a 68% drop in fatalities and a 35% reduction in injuries since 2015. The redesign adds parking-protected bike lanes, pedestrian islands, and improved signals. The next phase, funded in part by Won, will replace painted lanes with concrete, add raised medians, and increase accessibility.
