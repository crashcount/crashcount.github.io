Richards said, "You can't use the one-size-fits-all approach here. There are really parts of Queens that are transit deserts." He supports removing parking mandates only in high-density, transit-rich areas, not in low-density, car-dependent neighborhoods. Community board leaders and civic groups in Queens joined him, arguing the reform threatens their way of life. Richards's stance contrasts with Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Bronx officials, who support ending parking minimums. The decision preserves car dominance in Queens, leaving vulnerable road users at risk and blocking safer, people-first streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Thousands of jobs vanish. Local companies lose out. Lawmakers in affected districts stay silent or cheer. Trains and buses face deep cuts. Riders, workers, and streets pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On July 24, 2024, Governor Hochul’s official pause on congestion pricing triggered a $12 billion loss in MTA contracts, according to a Reinvent Albany report. The move slashes funding for the 2020-24 MTA capital plan, which was to be partly paid by congestion pricing. The report highlights that many companies losing contracts are in districts represented by lawmakers who either support the pause or have stayed silent. Senator Patricia Canzoneri-Fitzpatrick called congestion pricing 'simply another tax' and demanded repeal. Assemblyman Gary Pretlow praised the pause, saying it allows time to address 'communities' concerns.' Frank Russo, president of Ozone Park Lumber, warned, 'You can't just say, 'We're not going to buy supplies and equipment.'' Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany said, 'Congestion pricing is an economic booster.' The pause means less money for transit, fewer jobs, and more risk for vulnerable road users who rely on safe, reliable public transportation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso criticized neighborhoods that refuse new housing, saying it increases pressure on poorer areas. Arlene Schlesinger, a Queens resident, voiced strong opposition, especially to lifting parking mandates and adding accessory dwelling units.

The matter, described as 'Body found in fifth apparent drowning off NYC beach as pols call for more lifeguard hours,' highlights the deadly gap in city safety policy. Brannan, along with Council Member Shekar Krishnan and Borough Presidents Donovan Richards and Antonio Reynoso, urged the city to extend the beach season, increase lifeguard shifts, and offer universal swimming lessons. The city has only 870 lifeguards, far short of the 1,500 needed. Vulnerable swimmers remain at risk while officials debate.

The measure covers just 0.13% of city streets, possibly reaching 0.8% if regional slow zones expand. The first such zone will be south of Canal Street in lower Manhattan. DOT can only lower limits street by street unless the City Council acts. Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers confirmed no citywide bill exists. Council Member Christopher Marte welcomed the slow zone in his district, citing rampant speeding off the bridges. Advocates and officials demand faster, broader action, saying, 'Twenty is plenty wherever you'll find people, and in New York that's everywhere.' DOT says it will prioritize areas near schools and neighborhoods with more non-white and low-income residents. The rollout is slow. Most streets remain unchanged.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, proposed by Council Member Mercedes Narcisse, seeks to end criminal penalties for crossing streets outside crosswalks. The matter summary states officials argue, 'keeping it illegal protects pedestrian safety.' DOT First Deputy Commissioner Margaret Forgione testified against full legalization, supporting only a reduction to a civil offense. NYPD Deputy Chief Thomas Alps defended targeted enforcement in high-crash areas. Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers questioned the law's fairness, noting most tickets go to Black and Brown New Yorkers.

Debate continues over equity and coverage.</p><p class=mb3>On June 6, 2024, the City Council passed a resolution urging the state to expand New York City's red light camera program from 150 to 600 intersections. The measure, led by Council Member Lincoln Restler, follows internal debate and negotiation, with some members pushing for 1,325 intersections and others preferring fewer. The final number represents a four-fold increase, covering about 4 percent of city intersections. The Council's resolution, described as a 'home rule' message, aims to prevent the program from sunsetting and to improve safety for all road users. Restler stated, 'This will expand it to about 4 percent of intersections, and it will make our city safer.' Assembly Member Jeff Dinowitz called the expansion a victory, while advocates like Sara Lind of Open Plans noted no deaths at camera-protected intersections since 1994. Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers highlighted the need to ensure cameras improve communities and street safety, raising concerns about fairness in enforcement. The Department of Transportation called the Council's action a critical step.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Three strikes trigger a mandatory safety course. Ignore the course, lose your bike. DOT will track results. Three-year pilot. Enforcement, not education, leads.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0874-2024 sits in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced May 16, 2024, by Council Members Ariola (primary), Hanks, Hudson, Louis, Mealy, and Banks, the bill orders DOT to launch a pilot abatement program for unsafe pedal-assist bicycle operators. The bill summary states: 'Pedal-assist bicycle operators who accrue 3 or more moving violations under city law would be required to take a safe pedal-assist bicycle operation course offered by DOT.' Noncompliance means bike impoundment. DOT must report on course completions, impounds, and program effectiveness. The pilot sunsets after three years. The bill aims to curb reckless riding through strict enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
