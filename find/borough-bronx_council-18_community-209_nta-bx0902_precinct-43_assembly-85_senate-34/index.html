Five left with injuries that will not heal.</strong> In the last three years, the streets of Soundview-Clason Point have not been quiet. The numbers do not flinch: <strong>697 crashes, 334 injuries, 3 deaths</strong>—all in a place where children walk to school and elders cross to the bodega. No one is spared. In the last year alone, 89 people were hurt, 3 of them seriously. The youngest, under 18, took 13 of those blows. The oldest, over 75, were not safe either.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>A car slams into parked cars on Seward Avenue. Metal screams. People are thrown. Robert Perez is pushed six feet by the force. He says, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/driver-stolen-vehicle-slams-parked-cars-bronx-fleeing-police/16181891/>&ldquo;It pushed me six feet. I hit my leg and my back. So, I don&rsquo;t even know what to do. I panicked. And the lady behind me, I think she fainted.&rdquo;</a> The driver runs. The pain stays. The shock lingers. The street is never the same.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the worst of it.</strong> Cars and SUVs are the main weapons. In the last three years, they killed two and seriously injured one. Trucks and buses added another serious injury. Bikes and mopeds are not spared, but they do not kill here. The street is a gauntlet for the unprotected.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p>The city talks of Vision Zero. The state passes laws. But in Soundview-Clason Point, the blood dries slow. <strong>No local leader has stood up in public to demand more.</strong> No new protections. No bold redesigns. The silence is heavy. The danger is not.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Demand lower speed limits. Demand protected crossings. Demand cameras that never sleep. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
