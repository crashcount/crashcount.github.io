Officers first noticed the vehicle due to stolen plates and tried to pull it over on Cropsey Avenue. The driver fled, leading police to set up a blockade. As the car tried to pass, an officer fired one round, striking the driver. The wounded man crashed into a police car and was later pronounced dead at Brookdale Hospital. The passenger was unharmed and taken into custody. The incident highlights the risks of high-speed chases and roadblocks in dense urban areas, where bystanders and officers face sudden danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident happened late Wednesday night as Salcedo-Chevalier stood by the loading dock. Both he and the driver worked for a freight contractor, not Amazon. The driver, 40, remained at the scene. No criminal charges were filed at the time of reporting. An Amazon spokesperson called it a 'horrible tragedy' and said the company was cooperating with police. The article quotes a coworker: 'He was 34 years old. He had two daughters. He was killed on the job.' The crash highlights the dangers faced by workers in busy warehouse loading zones, where large vehicles maneuver in tight spaces.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
