A van veers. Metal slams metal. Flesh breaks. <strong>Zhihong Shi, age 31, dies on Atlantic Avenue.</strong> Two others, ages 67 and 48, survive but are broken. The van driver, 35, had a medical episode. No charges. No comfort. Only loss. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/29/man-killed-woodhaven-queens-crash-driver-medical-episode/>Police confirmed, &ldquo;A 31-year-old man was killed after he and two others were struck by an out-of-control van driver having a medical episode.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>In the last 12 months, Woodhaven saw 216 crashes.</strong> 117 people were hurt. No one should call this normal. No one should call this fate. In the past three years, three people have died on these streets. Two were pedestrians. One was a passenger. The numbers do not bleed, but the families do.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> Trucks, sedans, SUVs—they strike, they kill, they move on. In the last three years, cars and trucks killed two people. Bikes and mopeds left others bruised and battered. The city counts the bodies. The city moves on.</p><p>A 63-year-old woman, working in the street, was crushed by a dump truck at Woodhaven and Atlantic. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The report lists only &ldquo;crush injuries.&rdquo;</a> No further words. No comfort.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-silence>Leadership: Promises and Silence</h3><p><strong>Local leaders talk of Vision Zero.</strong> They promise safer streets. They tout new laws. But the blood dries faster than the paint. Speed cameras work only where they are installed. Lower speed limits mean nothing if drivers ignore them. <strong>No recent public statements from local officials address these deaths.</strong></p><p>The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so. The cameras that catch speeders could go dark if Albany does not act. The silence is loud. The clock ticks.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay is a choice. Every injury is a warning. <strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras. Demand action.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Primary sponsor Sean Ryan led the charge, joined by Joseph P. Addabbo Jr., Samra Brouk, Leroy Comrie, Patricia Fahy, Pete Harckham, Robert Jackson, Liz Krueger, and Christopher Ryan. The vote split, with a block of senators in support and a handful opposed. The bill aims to force streets to serve everyone, not just drivers.

The plan, discussed at a community board meeting, would have barred cyclists from Beach 108th to Beach 73rd Street during summer months. Council Member Joann Ariola, representing District 32, expressed relief at the reversal, stating, 'I’m glad that the Parks Department is going to continue allowing Rockaway residents to enjoy their bikes on the boardwalk this summer, but now we need real enforcement.' Instead of a ban, the Parks Department will increase signage and enforcement, especially near concessions. The community board voted 30-1 for new signs and called for marked bike lanes, an 8 mph speed limit, and clearer right-of-way rules. Board chair Dolores Orr stressed these safety improvements have been needed since the boardwalk’s post-Sandy rebuild.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No daylighting near schools. No lower bike lane speed limits. No new e-bike rules. City and state leaders bickered. Streets stay dangerous. Pedestrians and cyclists remain exposed. The system failed them again.</p><p class=mb3>On May 9, 2025, during New York State’s $254-million budget negotiations, lawmakers rejected Governor Hochul’s proposed street safety measures. The legislature dropped a mandate for daylighting—banning parking at corners near elementary schools—deferring instead to New York City, where Council Member Julie Won’s universal daylighting bill faces opposition from the Department of Transportation. Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, herself a crash survivor, vowed to keep fighting for daylighting, saying, 'I think daylighting would have helped me.' Hochul’s proposals to let the city set lower bike lane speed limits and to reclassify heavy e-bikes as mopeds were also cut. Critics argued these would not address core safety issues. The Adams administration opposes a City Council bill for e-bike registration and plates, while State Sen. Jenifer Rajkumar’s state version would shift licensing to the DMV. As Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives put it, 'A daylighting requirement would have made intersections safer around elementary schools, and it’s disappointing that this provision was cut from the New York State budget.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
