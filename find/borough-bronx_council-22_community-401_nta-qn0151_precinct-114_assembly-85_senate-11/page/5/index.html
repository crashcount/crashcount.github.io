The workshop addressed a 'significant increase in traffic-related deaths, including several high-profile fatalities involving cyclists and pedestrians.'

Cabán stated, 'If it saves lives, it’s worth doing.' DOT officials, including Queens Borough Commissioner Nicole Garcia and senior program manager Kyle Gorman, presented plans for 31st Avenue and collected resident feedback on dangerous driving, lack of protected bike lanes, and unsafe intersections. The DOT pledged to return with a proposal.

This corridor is a Vision Zero priority but only has an unprotected bike lane. The crash marks the 11th cyclist death in New York City this year, a record high for this point in the year. Council Member Tiffany Cabán called the loss 'wave after wave of grief and heartbreak' and demanded safer streets for pedestrians and cyclists. Transportation Alternatives Executive Director Danny Harris urged Mayor Adams and DOT Commissioner Rodriguez to invest in safe streets and fulfill the NYC Streets Plan’s legal requirements. Advocates noted the Department of Transportation failed to expand bike and bus lanes as required last year. The call is clear: the city must act now to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
