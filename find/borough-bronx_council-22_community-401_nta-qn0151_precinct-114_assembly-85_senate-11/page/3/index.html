Introduced December 19, 2024, it urges the MTA to make the Access-A-Ride On-Demand E-Hail Pilot Program permanent. The resolution states: 'The Council of the City of New York calls on the MTA to make permanent the Access-A-Ride On-Demand E-Hail Pilot Program.' Council Member Nantasha M. Williams leads as primary sponsor, joined by Menin, Riley, Cabán, Brannan, and Hanif. The program, launched in 2017, lets people with disabilities and seniors book paratransit rides on demand, not days in advance. Ridership jumped from 7,386 to 22,372 monthly trips in one year. The council wants the MTA to expand access and improve service. The resolution centers vulnerable riders, demanding transit that meets their needs.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The MTA’s 2025-29 capital program, discussed at the Capital Program Committee meeting, remains unfunded after Governor Hochul’s indefinite delay of congestion pricing. The matter centers on the need for new rail cars, power stations, and repairs to tracks and tunnels. MTA President of Construction and Development Jamie Torres-Springer stressed, 'We need to achieve 100 percent state-of-good-repair.' State Senator Jeremy Cooney challenged the governor to restore funding or implement congestion pricing within 100 days. Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein urged, 'Gov. Hochul must start congestion pricing now to rebuild trust.' The MTA is $15 billion short on its 2020-24 plan, with no clear path forward.
