A car jumped the curb on 35th Avenue, crushing her femur and leaving her with a head wound. Her classmate, fourteen, was hit too. A man, fifty-eight, limped away with bruised legs. The driver had no license. Police called it &ldquo;reckless endangerment, reckless driving and driving without a license&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/04/us-news/out-of-control-nyc-driver-hits-two-kids-1-adult-during-evening-rush-leaving-girl-7-with-broken-femur-cops/>said the NYPD</a>. The sidewalk offered no safety.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>167 people were injured and one killed</strong> on Astoria (Central) streets.

No charges. No comfort.</p><p>In the same year, a cyclist was killed at 34th Avenue and 37th Street. Another was struck on 36th Street. Pedestrians crossing with the signal were hit by turning SUVs.

Cameras catch speeders, but only if Albany keeps them running. Local leaders talk of Vision Zero, but the blood on the crosswalks says the work is not done. <strong>No recent public statements from District 22 or Queens CB1 address these latest crashes.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit.

Transit lost.</p><p class=mb3>"We should never have it where any one of us feels confident about smoking the bus in a race, but today I feel very confident because of how slow these buses are. These are the slowest buses in the United States of America." -- Zohran Mamdani</p><p class=mb3>On August 8, 2025, Council Member Barbara Russo-Lennon and mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani joined transit advocates in Midtown. They raced the M34 bus across 34th Street to expose slow bus speeds. The event asked: 'Is it faster to walk across town or take the bus?' Russo-Lennon and others backed bus improvements, highlighting how cars choke streets and trap riders. The demonstration drew support from Council Members Erik Bottcher and Keith Powers, and city officials. The safety analyst notes this was a demonstration, not a policy change, so it does not directly affect pedestrian or cyclist safety or system-wide outcomes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
