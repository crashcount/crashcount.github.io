In the last twelve months, <strong>120 neighbors were injured in 175 crashes</strong>. Not one death, but five left with wounds so deep they count as serious. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. A man loses his leg on East 183rd. A child, not yet old enough to speak, is crushed by a sedan on Grand Concourse. The street does not care who you are.</p><h3 id=the-toll-of-machines>The Toll of Machines</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs strike most often.</strong> Sedans alone left at least ten pedestrians hurt, two with serious injuries. SUVs, buses, mopeds—they all take their share. No bikes killed or maimed, but the threat is constant. The roll call of pain is long: 463 injured since 2022, five with wounds that will not heal. The numbers are cold, but the truth is colder.</p><h3 id=leaders-speak-but-streets-stay-deadly>Leaders Speak, But Streets Stay Deadly</h3><p>The city says it is fighting back. &ldquo;NYPD officers will be highly visible on New York City roadways… to deter unsafe driving and, when necessary, to take appropriate enforcement action,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/police-looking-for-suspect-in-fatal-hit-and-run-on-major-deegan-expressway-nypd-says>said Police Commissioner Edward Caban</a>.

Mayor Eric Adams said, "there’s going to be a whole rule making process to make sure that we comply and follow the laws." Critics argue the plan singles out e-bikes while ignoring faster, heavier vehicles. Ben Furans of Transportation Alternatives called it "half-baked and ill-conceived," noting that "bikes and cars sharing the same road would be subject to different speed limits and consequences." Janet Schroeder of the E-Bike Safety Alliance doubts the rule will matter without real enforcement. The NYPD already issues thousands of criminal summonses to cyclists for minor violations, raising questions about fair and effective policy.
