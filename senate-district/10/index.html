Nearly 1,800 injured.</strong> That is the toll in Senate District 10 over the last year. These are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors—the sound of glass breaking at dawn, the smell of burning fuel on the Belt Parkway.</p><p>On July 5, a BMW tore across the divider near Cross Bay Boulevard and went airborne. Two people died. Three more were thrown from the wreck. A survivor <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/nyc-bmw-driver-in-fatal-belt-parkway-crash-was-swerving-to-avoid-motorcyclist-friend-says/>described</a> how &ldquo;they went airborne and into the barrier.&rdquo; The car caught fire. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/07/noah-thompson-bmw-driver-passenger-jewel-perez-die-queens-belt-parkway-wreck/>Police confirmed</a> that no one in the BMW wore a seat belt.

Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds killed none. This violence is not random. It is a pattern—speed, distraction, and divided highways. The Belt Parkway, North Conduit, Rockaway Boulevard: names that mean danger to anyone not behind the wheel.</p><h3 id=what-has-senator-sanders-done>What Has Senator Sanders Done?</h3><p>Senator James Sanders has voted for safer street design. In June 2024, he voted yes on a bill to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>require complete streets</a> that protect everyone, not just drivers. He has supported more transit for Queens and pushed for the <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/07/queenslink-transit-supporters-press-case-at-city-hall>QueensLink rail project</a>. But when the governor paused congestion pricing—cutting funds for transit and safety—Sanders <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/07/24/hochuls-congestion-pricing-pause-will-cost-area-companies-billions>supported the pause</a>. The silence on lowering speed limits to 20 mph is loud. The dead do not care about politics. They care about action.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day without change is another day for another crash. Call Senator Sanders. Demand a default 20 mph speed limit. Demand real investment in safe streets, not just studies and speeches. The bodies are piling up. <strong>Act before the next one hits the ground.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Change comes fast.</p><p class=mb3>On December 31, 2024, New York announced new transportation laws for 2025. Senator James Sanders sponsored a ban on car lease turn-in fees, stating, "The legislation prohibits charging a turn-in fee at the expiration of the term of a vehicle lease, the basis of which is solely for administrative, handling or clerical charges." Governor Kathy Hochul signed this and other safety bills into law. Charter bus passengers ages 8 to 16 must now wear seatbelts, a response to a fatal crash in Orange County. Sammy's Law, enacted in 2024, lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph, and even 10 mph on redesigned streets. The Department of Transportation will target 250 locations, focusing on school zones. The MTA launches congestion pricing in Manhattan, with funds set for transit upgrades. Hochul said, "These enhancements to our roads and bridges will improve mobility for motorists, pedestrians and cyclists alike."</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
