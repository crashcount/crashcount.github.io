According to the police report, the 1996 Honda sedan was 'making left turn' while the cyclist was 'going straight ahead.' The report lists 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' as the contributing factor. The narrative states: 'A 1996 Honda turned left. A bike came straight. Metal hit bone. The rider, 27, flew. No helmet. His leg crushed. He lay conscious on cold asphalt, bleeding into the gray morning.' The point of impact was the sedan’s left front bumper, striking the center front of the bicycle. The cyclist was ejected and suffered crush injuries to his lower leg. The police report does not cite any cyclist behavior as a contributing factor, but notes the cyclist was not wearing a helmet. The crash underscores the danger when drivers fail to yield or use lanes properly.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Charter bus seatbelts, lower speed limits, and congestion pricing hit the streets. Senator Sanders and Governor Hochul push for safer roads. School zones, bridges, and bus riders see new protections. Change comes fast.</p><p class=mb3>On December 31, 2024, New York announced new transportation laws for 2025. Senator James Sanders sponsored a ban on car lease turn-in fees, stating, "The legislation prohibits charging a turn-in fee at the expiration of the term of a vehicle lease, the basis of which is solely for administrative, handling or clerical charges." Governor Kathy Hochul signed this and other safety bills into law. Charter bus passengers ages 8 to 16 must now wear seatbelts, a response to a fatal crash in Orange County. Sammy's Law, enacted in 2024, lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph, and even 10 mph on redesigned streets. The Department of Transportation will target 250 locations, focusing on school zones. The MTA launches congestion pricing in Manhattan, with funds set for transit upgrades. Hochul said, "These enhancements to our roads and bridges will improve mobility for motorists, pedestrians and cyclists alike."</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
