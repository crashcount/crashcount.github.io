The impact killed a 51-year-old woman and left a baby boy with broken legs. Both victims were pedestrians and, as the report states, 'not in the roadway' at the time of the crash. The police report cites 'Traffic Control Disregarded' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as contributing factors for both drivers. The narrative underscores that 'the drivers missed the signs,' highlighting systemic failures in driver compliance with traffic controls. The collision’s violence—'metal screamed'—left one woman dead from crush injuries and a child with severe leg trauma. The report does not list any victim behavior as a contributing factor. The focus remains on driver error and the lethal consequences for those outside the vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The incident occurred as the man 'stepped from behind a parked car.' The report states the sedan was 'backing unsafely,' directly citing this driver action as a contributing factor. The narrative details, 'Steel struck skull. He fell. Blood spread on the cold street.' Despite the impact, the vehicle showed 'no damage.' The pedestrian remained conscious at the scene, his 'head torn open.' The police report also lists 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a secondary factor, but the primary focus remains on the unsafe reversing maneuver by the driver. The collision underscores the lethal risk posed when drivers back unsafely, especially in areas with limited visibility.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
