Police said two drivers hit him. He died there in South Ozone Park (<a href=https://qns.com/2025/09/man-killed-belt-parkway-south-ozone-park/>amNY</a>; <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>He is one of <strong>46 people killed</strong> in traffic in Senate District 10 since Jan 1, 2022, by our count from city crash records (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). This year isn’t easing. Through the year to date, crashes are up 7.7% and injuries up 8.0% from last year. Deaths rose from 4 to <strong>13</strong> — a 225% jump (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-pattern-does-not-blink>The pattern does not blink</h3><p>One month earlier, a 52‑year‑old man crossed South Conduit Avenue near JFK in the dark.

The next step is reining in the worst repeat speeders. The Senate’s <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045)</strong> would force chronic violators to use in‑car speed limiters.

As the vehicle turned, it struck a 36-year-old woman who was crossing the intersection with the signal. The report states, 'She crossed with the light. The Toyota turned left. Metal met chest. She dropped to the pavement. Crush injuries.' The pedestrian suffered severe chest injuries and fell to the ground. The SUV sustained no damage, and the report notes silence after the impact.
