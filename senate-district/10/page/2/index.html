A BMW vaulted the divider. Metal tore. Two people were ejected and killed. Four more were left broken. The cause: speed. The record shows it again and again—speed, the weight of steel, and the silence after. In the last twelve months, 16 people died on these streets. Over 2,350 were injured. Thirty-one suffered injuries so severe they will never be the same. The youngest lost was just 22. The oldest, 78. No one is spared. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><h3 id=the-system-fails-again-and-again>The System Fails, Again and Again</h3><p>The carnage is not random. It is policy. It is the absence of action. Just days ago, two NYPD cruisers collided in Edgemere, Queens, racing to a call. Four officers went to the hospital. The intersection is a tangle of roads under the A train. The news <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/nypd-crash-edgemere-queens/>reported</a>, &ldquo;Two police vehicles were badly damaged from the collision.&rdquo; The cause is under review. The risk is always there. The next time, it could be a child in the crosswalk.</p><p>A year ago, a 14-year-old girl named Fortune Williams died when an unlicensed teen, driving over 100 mph, lost control and crashed. Her mother <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/queens-teen-sentenced-to-up-to-4-years-for-fatal-crash-with-14-year-old-girl>said</a>, &ldquo;I wish they would never have given him that car&mldr; because if they didn&rsquo;t give him that car, my daughter would still be here right now.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=what-has-senator-sanders-done>What Has Senator Sanders Done?</h3><p>Senator James Sanders has voted for bills to create safety zones and expand ignition interlock monitoring. He voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>legislation</a>. He backed the extension of school speed zones. He has supported studies for new rail lines to connect transit deserts. But when congestion pricing was paused—cutting funds for safer streets—he did not stand up for the most vulnerable. The deaths keep coming.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p>Call Senator Sanders. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat speeders. Demand streets built for people, not cars.</p><p>Every day of delay is another life lost. The numbers are not just numbers. They are names. They are families. They are us.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Senator James Sanders sponsored a ban on car lease turn-in fees, stating, "The legislation prohibits charging a turn-in fee at the expiration of the term of a vehicle lease, the basis of which is solely for administrative, handling or clerical charges." Governor Kathy Hochul signed this and other safety bills into law. Charter bus passengers ages 8 to 16 must now wear seatbelts, a response to a fatal crash in Orange County. Sammy's Law, enacted in 2024, lets the city lower speed limits to 20 mph, and even 10 mph on redesigned streets. The Department of Transportation will target 250 locations, focusing on school zones. The MTA launches congestion pricing in Manhattan, with funds set for transit upgrades.
