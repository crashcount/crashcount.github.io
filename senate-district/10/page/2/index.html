A car hit him and ran. “A hit-and-run driver killed a 52-year-old man crossing a Queens street near Kennedy Airport early Wednesday, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/13/queens-hit-and-run-driver-kills-52-year-old-man-near-jfk-airport/>police said</a>.” “The operator of the vehicle <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/police-investigate-hit-run-death-springfield-gardens-queens-john-kennedy-international-airport/17524816/>fled the scene</a> after hitting the man.”</p><p>Cops looked for cameras. “The driver sped off without stopping. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/13/queens-hit-and-run-driver-kills-52-year-old-man-near-jfk-airport/>No arrests have been made</a>.”</p><p>These roads do not rest. Since 2022, SD 10 records show 38 people dead, 6,722 injured, and 65 severely hurt, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash records</a>. That is 10,770 <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crashes</a> in less than four years. This year alone, deaths are up 1,000% versus this time last year, the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>data</a> show. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crashes</a> are up 43% year to date.</p><p>Earlier this month in the Rockaways, even the response became part of the toll. “Two police cruisers <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-crash-4-nypd-officers-injured-2-cruisers-collided-rockaways/17438473/>collided</a> while responding to a call in the Rockaways.” Four officers went to Jamaica Hospital, stable and lucky.</p><p>In June, State Senator James Sanders voted yes in committee on <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>, a bill to rein in repeat speeders. He also voted yes to extend school speed zones in mid-June. These are steps. The killing continues.</p><p>What must happen now: Demand speed control for the worst offenders. Push S 4045 to the floor. Press for safe crossings on deadly corridors by JFK and along the Belt. Make leaders feel the weight of every hit-and-run they allow to go unpunished.</p><p>Call, write, show up. Do not let this fade.
