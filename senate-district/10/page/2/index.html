Nearly 1,800 injured.</strong> That is the toll in Senate District 10 over the last year. These are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors—the sound of glass breaking at dawn, the smell of burning fuel on the Belt Parkway.</p><p>On July 5, a BMW tore across the divider near Cross Bay Boulevard and went airborne. Two people died. Three more were thrown from the wreck. A survivor <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/nyc-bmw-driver-in-fatal-belt-parkway-crash-was-swerving-to-avoid-motorcyclist-friend-says/>described</a> how &ldquo;they went airborne and into the barrier.&rdquo; The car caught fire. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/07/noah-thompson-bmw-driver-passenger-jewel-perez-die-queens-belt-parkway-wreck/>Police confirmed</a> that no one in the BMW wore a seat belt.

Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds killed none. This violence is not random. It is a pattern—speed, distraction, and divided highways. The Belt Parkway, North Conduit, Rockaway Boulevard: names that mean danger to anyone not behind the wheel.</p><h3 id=what-has-senator-sanders-done>What Has Senator Sanders Done?</h3><p>Senator James Sanders has voted for safer street design. In June 2024, he voted yes on a bill to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>require complete streets</a> that protect everyone, not just drivers. He has supported more transit for Queens and pushed for the <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/07/queenslink-transit-supporters-press-case-at-city-hall>QueensLink rail project</a>. But when the governor paused congestion pricing—cutting funds for transit and safety—Sanders <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/07/24/hochuls-congestion-pricing-pause-will-cost-area-companies-billions>supported the pause</a>. The silence on lowering speed limits to 20 mph is loud. The dead do not care about politics. They care about action.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day without change is another day for another crash. Call Senator Sanders. Demand a default 20 mph speed limit. Demand real investment in safe streets, not just studies and speeches. The bodies are piling up. <strong>Act before the next one hits the ground.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The impact killed a 51-year-old woman and left a baby boy with broken legs. Both victims were pedestrians and, as the report states, 'not in the roadway' at the time of the crash. The police report cites 'Traffic Control Disregarded' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as contributing factors for both drivers. The narrative underscores that 'the drivers missed the signs,' highlighting systemic failures in driver compliance with traffic controls. The collision’s violence—'metal screamed'—left one woman dead from crush injuries and a child with severe leg trauma. The report does not list any victim behavior as a contributing factor.

The incident occurred as the man 'stepped from behind a parked car.' The report states the sedan was 'backing unsafely,' directly citing this driver action as a contributing factor. The narrative details, 'Steel struck skull. He fell. Blood spread on the cold street.' Despite the impact, the vehicle showed 'no damage.' The pedestrian remained conscious at the scene, his 'head torn open.' The police report also lists 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a secondary factor, but the primary focus remains on the unsafe reversing maneuver by the driver. The collision underscores the lethal risk posed when drivers back unsafely, especially in areas with limited visibility.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The report lists 'Following Too Closely' as the contributing factor, highlighting driver error as the cause of the crash. Inside the taxi, a 50-year-old woman riding in the right rear seat suffered a head injury with severe bleeding but remained conscious. The narrative notes, 'A Ford SUV slammed into a slowing taxi. In the back seat, a 50-year-old woman bled from the head.' No evidence in the report suggests any passenger behavior contributed to the crash. The focus remains on the SUV driver's failure to maintain safe distance, resulting in direct harm to a vulnerable passenger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Thousands of jobs vanish. Local companies lose out. Lawmakers in affected districts stay silent or cheer. Trains and buses face deep cuts. Riders, workers, and streets pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On July 24, 2024, Governor Hochul’s official pause on congestion pricing triggered a $12 billion loss in MTA contracts, according to a Reinvent Albany report. The move slashes funding for the 2020-24 MTA capital plan, which was to be partly paid by congestion pricing. The report highlights that many companies losing contracts are in districts represented by lawmakers who either support the pause or have stayed silent. Senator Patricia Canzoneri-Fitzpatrick called congestion pricing 'simply another tax' and demanded repeal. Assemblyman Gary Pretlow praised the pause, saying it allows time to address 'communities' concerns.' Frank Russo, president of Ozone Park Lumber, warned, 'You can't just say, 'We're not going to buy supplies and equipment.'' Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany said, 'Congestion pricing is an economic booster.' The pause means less money for transit, fewer jobs, and more risk for vulnerable road users who rely on safe, reliable public transportation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
