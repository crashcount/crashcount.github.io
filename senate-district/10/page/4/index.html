Since January 2022, <strong>38 people have died</strong> and <strong>64 have been seriously injured</strong> in crashes. The numbers do not bleed, but the streets do. In the last year alone, deaths jumped from 1 to 11—a thousand percent rise. The names fade. The pain does not.</p><p>Just last month, a BMW vaulted the median on the Belt Parkway. Six people were hurt. A 22-year-old woman was thrown from the car and killed. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>She never made it home</a>. Speed was the cause. It always is.</p><p>On June 10th, a 25-year-old man died after his motorcycle struck a parked SUV on 121st Street. No warning. No second chance. The city records another death. The family gets a hole that never heals.</p><h3 id=police-policy-and-the-price-of-delay>Police, Policy, and the Price of Delay</h3><p>Even the police are not spared. On August 4th, two NYPD cruisers collided in Edgemere while racing to a call. Four officers were rushed to the hospital. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-crash-4-nypd-officers-injured-2-cruisers-collided-rockaways/17438473/>&ldquo;The officers were responding to a call for shots fired nearby when they crashed.&rdquo;</a> The cause is under investigation. The intersection remains dangerous.</p><h3 id=what-has-senator-sanders-done>What Has Senator Sanders Done?</h3><p>State Senator James Sanders has voted for bills to create safety zones and curb repeat speeders. In June, he voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force the worst offenders to install speed-limiting devices. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>He backed school speed zone extensions</a>. These are steps. But the blood keeps flowing.</p><p>Sanders has also supported QueensLink, a plan to bring rail and park space to transit deserts. But he backed the pause on congestion pricing, a move that means less money for transit and more cars on the road. The city needs fewer cars, not more. The children need safe crossings, not empty promises.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>The crisis is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Senator Sanders. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand the Stop Super Speeders Act becomes law. Demand streets where children can cross and live. The dead do not get another chance. The living do. <a href=../../take_action/>Act now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, highlighted the proposal's promise: 'both new train service and park land.' State Sen. James Sanders led the call, declaring, 'Yes, we want a park and yes we want a light rail. We can have both.' Mike Scala, another advocate, stressed public support for a combined approach. The QueensLink faces competition from the QueensWay, a park-only plan with $35 million in city funding. The MTA has not committed, citing high costs and ongoing needs assessment. No formal council bill or committee action is recorded yet.
