Metal burns. On July 5th, a BMW lost control on the Belt Parkway near Howard Beach. The car hit the divider, went airborne, and slammed into oncoming traffic. Two young lives ended. Five more people were left broken or burned. Police said, &ldquo;No one in the doomed BMW was wearing a seat belt&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/07/noah-thompson-bmw-driver-passenger-jewel-perez-die-queens-belt-parkway-wreck/>NY Daily News</a>). The fire left nothing but wreckage and grief.</p><p>This is not rare. In the last twelve months, 14 people died and 1,979 were injured in crashes across SD 10. Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians are all at risk (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-numbers-that-dont-lie>The Numbers That Don’t Lie</h3><p>The carnage is steady. Thirty-six dead. 6,198 injured. Sixty left with wounds that will never heal. Most are struck by cars and SUVs. Some are thrown from motorcycles. A few are hit while walking or riding a bike. The numbers do not care about age. Children under 18: two dead, 598 hurt. Elders over 75: three dead, 119 hurt (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The Belt Parkway is a killing field. Speed and loss of control are common. In April, a Mazda SUV changed lanes too fast. The driver died. In February, a Toyota sedan sped down the Parkway. The driver was ejected and killed. The pattern repeats. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=what-has-senator-sanders-done>What Has Senator Sanders Done?</h3><p>Senator James Sanders has voted for bills to curb repeat speeders and expand safety zones. In June, he voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force the worst repeat offenders to install speed-limiting devices (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). He also voted to extend school speed zones, aiming to protect children on their way to class. These are steps, not solutions.</p><p>But the blood keeps flowing. The streets are not safe. The laws are not enough. Every day of delay means another family shattered.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Jewel was a loving, energetic mother who dreamed of entering the medical field so she could help others the way she always helped others&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/07/noah-thompson-bmw-driver-passenger-jewel-perez-die-queens-belt-parkway-wreck/>NY Daily News</a>).</p></blockquote><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more>Call to Action: Demand More</h3><p>Call Senator Sanders. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph citywide speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat speeders. Demand streets built for people, not just cars.</p><p>Do not wait for another crash. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
