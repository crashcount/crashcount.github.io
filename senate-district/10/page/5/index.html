Nearly 1,800 injured.</strong> That is the toll in Senate District 10 over the last year. These are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors—the sound of glass breaking at dawn, the smell of burning fuel on the Belt Parkway.</p><p>On July 5, a BMW tore across the divider near Cross Bay Boulevard and went airborne. Two people died. Three more were thrown from the wreck. A survivor <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/nyc-bmw-driver-in-fatal-belt-parkway-crash-was-swerving-to-avoid-motorcyclist-friend-says/>described</a> how &ldquo;they went airborne and into the barrier.&rdquo; The car caught fire. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/07/noah-thompson-bmw-driver-passenger-jewel-perez-die-queens-belt-parkway-wreck/>Police confirmed</a> that no one in the BMW wore a seat belt. The crash closed the parkway, but not the wound.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-speed-steel-and-silence>The Pattern: Speed, Steel, and Silence</h3><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the killing.</strong> In three years, cars and SUVs in SD 10 have killed 11 people and injured more than 650 on foot. Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds killed none. This violence is not random. It is a pattern—speed, distraction, and divided highways. The Belt Parkway, North Conduit, Rockaway Boulevard: names that mean danger to anyone not behind the wheel.</p><h3 id=what-has-senator-sanders-done>What Has Senator Sanders Done?</h3><p>Senator James Sanders has voted for safer street design. In June 2024, he voted yes on a bill to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>require complete streets</a> that protect everyone, not just drivers. He has supported more transit for Queens and pushed for the <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/07/queenslink-transit-supporters-press-case-at-city-hall>QueensLink rail project</a>. But when the governor paused congestion pricing—cutting funds for transit and safety—Sanders <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/07/24/hochuls-congestion-pricing-pause-will-cost-area-companies-billions>supported the pause</a>. The silence on lowering speed limits to 20 mph is loud. The dead do not care about politics. They care about action.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day without change is another day for another crash. Call Senator Sanders. Demand a default 20 mph speed limit. Demand real investment in safe streets, not just studies and speeches. The bodies are piling up. <strong>Act before the next one hits the ground.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The pedestrian was not at an intersection and was crossing without a signal, but the report does not cite this as a contributing factor. The crash left the man conscious but badly hurt.
