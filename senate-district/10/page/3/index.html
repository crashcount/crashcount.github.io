His SUV leaves the road, hits a tree, and the night goes quiet. Police find him alone, seatbelt cut by the crash, airbag spent. No arrests. No answers. Just another name lost to speed and steel. <a href=https://qns.com/2025/04/brooklyn-motorist-killed-belt-parkway-ozone-park/>Police from the 106th Precinct in South Ozone Park responded to a 911 call of a motor vehicle collision on the westbound Belt Parkway just west of 130th Street just after 10:30 p.m.</a></p><p>In February, a minivan veered off Brookville Boulevard.

He backed <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>Senate Bill S 9718</a>, calling for complete street design principles to protect all users. He supported <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/new-traffic-laws-in-new-york-slated-for-2025/>new laws to lower speed limits and require seatbelts for young bus riders</a>. But the crisis does not wait for bills to become action.</p><p>Sanders has also pushed for more transit options, backing the <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/04/04/op-ed-keeping-poor-residents-in-transit-deserts-is-getting-expensive>QueensLink rail reactivation</a> and <a href=https://nypost.com/2024/05/16/us-news/queens-lawmakers-demand-more-mta-bus-service-to-manhattan-before-15-congestion-toll-begins/>demanding better bus service</a>. Yet, when <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/07/24/hochuls-congestion-pricing-pause-will-cost-area-companies-billions>congestion pricing was paused</a>, he did not fight for the transit funding that could have made streets safer for those who walk and ride.</p><h2 id=the-road-ahead-action-not-words>The Road Ahead: Action, Not Words</h2><p><strong>Most deaths come from cars and trucks.</strong> In three years, 33 people have died, 57 have been seriously hurt, and nearly 6,000 have been injured in SD 10.
