A friend added, “He&rsquo;s a basketball player, the best basketball player.” The city data lists unsafe speed. The press shows a police van in chase before the hit.

STOP THE WORST.</p><p>The city now has the power to set safer speeds. It can drop the default limit on local streets.

The report states the child, a male pedestrian, suffered severe bleeding to his face and was conscious after the impact. The narrative notes, 'A baby boy, face bloodied, struck by the rear of a westbound bus. He cried. He lived. The bus did not stop.' The driver of the bus continued without stopping at the scene. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified,' offering no further detail on driver error, but the failure to remain at the scene is clear. No mention is made of any pedestrian actions contributing to the crash. The report centers the harm: a child, struck and left behind, while the bus and city moved on.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
