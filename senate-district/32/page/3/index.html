A black Mercedes came fast, did not stop, and hit him. He flew, then fell. The car dragged him half a block. The driver kept going. His mother said, <strong>&ldquo;That car deliberately went straight speeding, didn&rsquo;t stop, hit my son all the way up into the air and came down, dragged him half a block, they killed my son&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bronx-pedestrian-killed-heartbroken-family-mourns-father-3-nyc-hit-run/16394341/>told ABC7</a>).</p><p>This was not the only loss. In the last year, <strong>six people died</strong> in crashes in SD 32. <strong>1,636 were injured</strong>. <strong>Twenty-five suffered serious injuries</strong>. Most were walking. Some were children. The street does not care who you are. The numbers do not lie.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-speed-steel-and-silence>The Pattern: Speed, Steel, and Silence</h2><p>The dead do not speak. Their families do. <strong>&ldquo;Great father, great person—everybody in the community loved him&mldr; Everybody is missing Kelvin.

In three years, cars and SUVs caused <strong>nine deaths</strong> and over <strong>850 injuries</strong> to people on foot or bike. Trucks and buses hit too. The sidewalk is not safe. The crosswalk is not safe. The numbers rise, the bodies fall.</p><h2 id=what-has-senator-sepúlveda-done>What Has Senator Sepúlveda Done?</h2><p>Senator Luis Sepúlveda voted <strong>yes</strong> on bills for school speed cameras (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8117>S 8117</a>), safer street design (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2022/S3897>S 3897</a>), and funding for complete streets (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S840>S 840</a>). He backed the <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act</strong> (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>), which would force repeat dangerous drivers to slow down. He co-sponsored a bill to expand camera enforcement (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S7336>S 7336</a>).</p><p>But he also sponsored a bill to require licenses and insurance for e-scooter riders (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S5801>S 5801</a>). Paperwork for cyclists and delivery workers. No such burden for the drivers who kill.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-demand-more>The Next Step: Demand More</h2><p><strong>The crisis is not over.</strong> The deaths keep coming. The laws are not enough. <strong>Call Senator Sepúlveda. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people, not paperwork for the vulnerable.</strong></p><p>Every day of delay is another family broken.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
