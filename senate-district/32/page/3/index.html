The report states the driver was unlicensed and failed to yield the right-of-way. The collision occurred at midnight, with the vehicle’s center front end impacting the pedestrian’s head, causing severe bleeding. The report lists 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Unsafe Speed' as contributing factors. The pedestrian was left conscious but bleeding heavily beneath the streetlights.
