In the last year alone, five people died and 1,491 were injured in crashes. Twenty-five suffered wounds so grave they may never walk the same. The dead are not numbers. They are fathers, mothers, children. On May 10, 2025, a black Mercedes tore down Webster Avenue. It hit Kelvin Mitchell, a father of three, and dragged him half a block. The driver did not stop. Mitchell’s mother said, “That car deliberately went straight speeding, didn’t stop, hit my son all the way up into the air and came down, dragged him half a block, they killed my son.” <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bronx-pedestrian-killed-heartbroken-family-mourns-father-3-nyc-hit-run/16394341/>ABC7</a></p><p>Just weeks before, a 31-year-old woman was killed crossing with the signal at East 167th and Washington. Three SUVs. One life gone. The pattern repeats. The sidewalk is not safe. The crosswalk is not safe. The numbers do not lie: Over 8,000 crashes since 2022.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p>The pain is not abstract. It is a mother waiting for her son to come home. It is a sister who will never hear her brother’s laugh again. “Great father, great person—everybody in the community loved him. Everybody knew Kelvin. He grew up in his neighborhood his whole life and he’s gonna be greatly missed.” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/11/sister-of-bronx-man-killed-by-hit-and-run-mercedes-driver-has-faith-driver-will-be-caught/>NY Daily News</a></p><p>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt. SUVs and sedans do most of the killing. In this district, cars and trucks caused 8 deaths and hundreds of injuries. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll, but the metal and speed of cars do the worst damage.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Senator Luis Sepúlveda has voted for safer street design <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>S 9718</a> and co-sponsored bills for pedestrian safety ratings <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S1675>S 1675</a>. But he also sponsored a bill to require e-scooter licenses and insurance <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S5801>S 5801</a>—a move that burdens the most vulnerable and does little to stop the carnage from cars. The street is still a battlefield. The policies are not enough.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</h3><p>Call Senator Sepúlveda. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people on foot and on bikes. Do not wait for another body in the crosswalk. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice. Make them choose life.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
