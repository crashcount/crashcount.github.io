The car came fast. It did not stop. It hit him, dragged him half a block. His name was Kelvin Mitchell. He was a father. His mother said, <strong>&ldquo;That car deliberately went straight speeding, didn&rsquo;t stop, hit my son all the way up into the air and came down, dragged him half a block, they killed my son&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bronx-pedestrian-killed-heartbroken-family-mourns-father-3-nyc-hit-run/16394341/>told ABC7</a>).</p><p>This is not rare. In the last twelve months, <strong>six people died</strong> on the streets of Senate District 32. <strong>1,636 were injured. 25 were left with serious wounds.</strong> Most were walking. Some were children. The numbers do not stop. The pain does not stop.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-cars-speed-and-silence>The Pattern: Cars, Speed, and Silence</h2><p>The cars do not care if you are young or old. <strong>SUVs and sedans killed nine.</strong> Trucks and buses hit dozens more.

The sidewalk was not safe (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/car-crashes-into-sidewalk-shed-in-the-bronx/>reported CBS New York</a>).</p><p>A sister spoke for the dead: <strong>&ldquo;Great father, great person—everybody in the community loved him.

He backed more speed cameras in school zones. He co-sponsored bills for safety zones and a vehicle pedestrian safety rating. These are steps. But the killing goes on. The law moves slow. The street moves fast.</p><h2 id=what-must-happen-now>What Must Happen Now</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> The dead do not get a second chance. Call Senator Sepúlveda. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat speeders.
