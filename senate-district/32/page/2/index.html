The police report does not list any contributing factors or driver errors, but the absence of the vehicle and driver underscores the hit-and-run nature of this crash. No information is provided about the victim's actions or location prior to the collision. The report centers on the violence of the impact and the failure of the driver to remain at the scene.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
