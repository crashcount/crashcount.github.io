The report states the woman was 'crossing with the signal' at the intersection. The driver was traveling at 'unsafe speed' and 'disregarded traffic control,' as cited in the contributing factors. The sedan was heading south and made no attempt to yield. The victim suffered fatal crush injuries to her entire body and died at the scene. The police report makes clear the driver’s lack of license and failure to obey traffic signals were central to the deadly impact. The victim’s actions—crossing with the signal—are noted only after the driver’s violations.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
