Twenty-five left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong> In the last year alone, 1,636 people were hurt in 2,320 crashes across Senate District 32. The numbers do not slow. The pain does not fade. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>On July 3, a car jumped the curb in Melrose and slammed into a sidewalk shed.

The living carry scars.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>State Senator Luis Sepúlveda has voted yes on bills to curb repeat speeders and extend school speed zones. He co-sponsored a bill to expand camera enforcement. These are steps. But the blood on the street says it is not enough. The city now has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so. The most dangerous drivers still roam free.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>Every day without action is another day of loss.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call Senator Sepúlveda. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat offenders.
