The car did not stop. It hit him, dragged him half a block, and kept going. His name was Kelvin Mitchell. He was a father. His mother said, <strong>&ldquo;That car deliberately went straight speeding, didn&rsquo;t stop, hit my son all the way up into the air and came down, dragged him half a block, they killed my son&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bronx-pedestrian-killed-heartbroken-family-mourns-father-3-nyc-hit-run/16394341/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>This was not the only death.

The wounded carry it forever.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-cost>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Cost</h3><p>Most deaths came from cars and SUVs. <strong>Eight killed, 13 seriously hurt</strong>. Trucks and buses left seven people with grave injuries. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes added to the toll. No one is safe. Not the young, not the old. Children under 18 were injured <strong>156 times</strong> in a year.

He co-sponsored a bill to rate cars for pedestrian safety (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S1675>S 1675</a>). He also sponsored a bill to require e-scooter riders to get licenses and insurance (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S5801>S 5801</a>). Some bills help. Some shift blame to those with the least power.

According to the police report, 'an unlicensed sedan slammed into two motorcycles from behind. A 24-year-old rider flew from his seat. His back crushed. His helmet held, but it was not enough. The road was dark. The driver was distracted.' The sedan driver was unlicensed and listed as inattentive or distracted. These driver errors—'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and lack of a valid license—are called out in the data. One motorcycle rider, age 24, suffered crush injuries to his back after being ejected. Both motorcycle riders wore helmets, but the impact overwhelmed all protection. The crash left vulnerable road users exposed to deadly risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
