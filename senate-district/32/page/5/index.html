Six people were hurt. No warning. No time to run. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/car-crashes-into-sidewalk-shed-in-the-bronx/>Six people were injured when a car crashed into a sidewalk shed Thursday morning</a>, the report said. The street did not forgive.</p><p>On May 10th, Kelvin Mitchell, a father, was killed by a hit-and-run driver on Webster Avenue. His mother stood at the scene. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/14/police-chase-linked-to-fatal-hit-and-run-in-bronx>&ldquo;They killed my son. I need justice for my son,&rdquo;</a> she said. The car kept going. The city did not stop it.</p><p>In the last year, SD 32 saw <strong>over 1,600 crashes, 1,157 injuries, and 22 serious injuries</strong>. Three people died. Most were walking or riding. Most never saw it coming. The numbers are not just numbers. They are names, faces, families.</p><h3 id=patterns-of-violence>Patterns of Violence</h3><p>Speed is the weapon. In one case, a driver tore through a 25-mph zone at 77 mph and killed a cab driver. In another, a worker was pinned between cars and left to die. The stories repeat. The pain does not fade.</p><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the killing. In three years, cars and trucks caused <strong>9 deaths and 17 serious injuries</strong> to people on foot or bike. Motorcycles and mopeds hurt dozens more. Bikes, too, but the toll is lower. The street is a gauntlet. The odds are not in your favor.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>State Senator Luis Sepúlveda has voted for bills to curb repeat speeders and extend school speed zones. He co-sponsored a bill to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>expand camera enforcement</a>. These are steps. But the blood keeps flowing. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not used it. The most dangerous drivers still roam free.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-make-them-hear-you>Call to Action: Make Them Hear You</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Senator Sepúlveda. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat speeders. Demand streets where a child can walk and live. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
