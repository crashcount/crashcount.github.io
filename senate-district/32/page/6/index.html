Video shows the hit, the drag, the flight. His mother’s words are a blade: <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/14/police-chase-linked-to-fatal-hit-and-run-in-bronx>“They killed my son.”</a> He was 43.

A Toyota SUV hit her. She died there. Three SUVs are logged in the case file; one was parked, one had Arizona plates.

The car hit Mitchell and kept going.
