A black Mercedes came fast. It did not stop. It hit him, threw him into the air, dragged him half a block, and sped away. His mother said, <strong>&ldquo;That car deliberately went straight speeding, didn&rsquo;t stop, hit my son all the way up into the air and came down, dragged him half a block, they killed my son&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bronx-pedestrian-killed-heartbroken-family-mourns-father-3-nyc-hit-run/16394341/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>He was a father.

Since 2022, the district has seen 26 deaths and over 5,200 injuries. Most victims are people on foot. Most drivers keep going.</p><p>SUVs and sedans do the most harm. <strong>Cars and trucks caused 9 deaths and over 850 injuries to pedestrians</strong>. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll. The violence is steady. The pain is spread wide.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>State Senator Luis Sepúlveda has voted for and co-sponsored bills to curb repeat speeders and extend speed cameras in school zones (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). He backed the &ldquo;Stop Super Speeders Act&rdquo; and measures to keep cameras rolling. These are steps. But the streets are still killing. The laws are not enough. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph now. It has not. The blood keeps running.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat offenders. Join groups like Transportation Alternatives and Families for Safe Streets. Do not wait for another name on a stone.</p><p><strong>The dead cannot speak. You can.
