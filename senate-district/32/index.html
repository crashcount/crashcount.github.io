A black Mercedes comes fast. The car does not stop. It hits him, drags him half a block. His name is Kelvin Mitchell. He was a father. He is gone. His mother <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bronx-pedestrian-killed-heartbroken-family-mourns-father-3-nyc-hit-run/16394341/>said</a>, &ldquo;That car deliberately went straight speeding, didn&rsquo;t stop, hit my son all the way up into the air and came down, dragged him half a block, they killed my son.&rdquo;</p><p>In the last twelve months, five people have died on the streets of Senate District 32. Over 1,500 have been injured. Twenty-six suffered wounds so grave they may never walk the same. The dead are not numbers. They are fathers, mothers, children. They are missed. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/11/sister-of-bronx-man-killed-by-hit-and-run-mercedes-driver-has-faith-driver-will-be-caught/>&ldquo;Everybody is missing Kelvin.

He <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S1675>co-sponsored</a> a bill to rate cars for pedestrian safety. But he also <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/03/01/to-the-barricades-grassroots-effort-needed-to-blunt-boneheaded-bike-block-bill>pushed</a> a bill that would slow down new bike lanes, making it harder to build the infrastructure that saves lives. He is now <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S5801>sponsoring</a> a bill to require licenses and insurance for e-scooter riders. These rules do not stop speeding cars. They do not protect the child in the crosswalk.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p>The crisis is not fate. It is policy. Every day, another family risks loss. Call Sepúlveda. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand more protected crossings. Demand action that protects people, not just drivers. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
