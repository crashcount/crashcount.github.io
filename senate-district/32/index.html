Two memorials now mark the spot where he fell.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC reported on May 14, 2025, that Kelvin Mitchell, a 43-year-old father, was killed by a hit-and-run driver in the Bronx. Witnesses and video show a police van chasing a speeding Mercedes before the crash, raising questions about NYPD pursuit policy. The article notes, 'A police van was in pursuit of the speeding Mercedes, according to video obtained by Streetsblog.' The NYPD’s policy restricts chases to serious crimes and discourages them in residential areas, yet the pursuit occurred near homes and a bodega. The department declined to comment. The crash highlights risks from high-speed chases and inconsistent enforcement of pursuit guidelines.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
