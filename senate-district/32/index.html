Over 1,800 injured. In the last year alone, the streets of Senate District 32 have not let up. Just last month, a car slammed into a sidewalk shed in Melrose, injuring six people. The news was blunt: “Six people were injured when a car crashed into a sidewalk shed Thursday morning” <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/car-crashes-into-sidewalk-shed-in-the-bronx/>reported CBS New York</a>. The shed was meant to shield pedestrians. It did not.</p><p>A father was killed in a hit-and-run on East 169th Street. His mother’s words cut through the noise: “That car deliberately went straight speeding, didn&rsquo;t stop, hit my son all the way up into the air and came down, dragged him half a block, they killed my son” <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bronx-pedestrian-killed-heartbroken-family-mourns-father-3-nyc-hit-run/16394341/>she told ABC7</a>. The driver fled. The family is left with the silence.</p><h2 id=the-numbers-behind-the-names>The Numbers Behind the Names</h2><p>In three years, 26 people have died. 5,549 have been hurt. Most were walking, biking, or riding in cars. SUVs and sedans did the most harm—over 900 crashes, 9 deaths, and hundreds of injuries. Trucks and buses followed. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left their own scars. Children are not spared: 594 injured, 12 seriously. The old are not spared: 1 death, 208 injuries for those 65–74. The disaster is slow, but it is steady. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h2><p>State Senator Luis Sepúlveda has voted for bills to curb repeat speeders and extend school speed zones. He co-sponsored the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force the worst offenders to install speed limiters. He voted yes to create more safety zones. These are steps. But the carnage continues. The city still waits for a 20 mph speed limit. Dangerous intersections remain unchanged for years. Families still grieve.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-demand-more>Call to Action: Demand More</h2><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Call Senator Sepúlveda. Call your council member. Tell them to finish the job: lower the speed limit, redesign the deadly crossings, and keep the most dangerous drivers off the road. Every day of delay is another life risked. Do not wait for another name to join the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
