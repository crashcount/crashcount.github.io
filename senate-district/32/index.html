Since 2022, <strong>26 people have died</strong> and <strong>74 have been seriously injured</strong> in crashes here. In the last twelve months alone, six more lives ended and 26 more bodies were broken. The dead are not numbers. They are sons, daughters, fathers, neighbors.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a car slammed into a sidewalk shed in Melrose, injuring six. The news was brief: &ldquo;Six people were injured when a car crashed into a sidewalk shed Thursday morning in the Melrose section of the Bronx,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/car-crashes-into-sidewalk-shed-in-the-bronx/>reported CBS New York</a>. No names. No faces. Only pain left behind.</p><p>In May, a black Mercedes sped down Webster Avenue. It hit Kelvin Mitchell, a father of three, and dragged him half a block. The driver did not stop. His mother said, &ldquo;That car deliberately went straight speeding, didn&rsquo;t stop, hit my son all the way up into the air and came down, dragged him half a block, they killed my son,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bronx-pedestrian-killed-heartbroken-family-mourns-father-3-nyc-hit-run/16394341/>she told ABC7</a>. His sister said, &ldquo;Everybody is missing Kelvin. It’s not gonna be the same over here without him,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/11/sister-of-bronx-man-killed-by-hit-and-run-mercedes-driver-has-faith-driver-will-be-caught/>she told the NY Daily News</a>.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists bear the brunt.</strong> Most deaths come from cars and SUVs. In this district, SUVs and sedans killed at least nine people on foot. Trucks and buses add to the toll. Bikes and mopeds are not spared, but the street belongs to the biggest and fastest.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>State Senator Luis Sepúlveda has taken some steps. He voted yes on a bill to require &ldquo;complete street&rdquo; design, aiming to protect all users, not just drivers. He co-sponsored a bill to post pedestrian safety ratings for cars. But he also sponsored a bill to require e-scooter riders to get licenses and insurance—another barrier for those with the least power, while the deadliest drivers face little change.</p><p><strong>The crisis is not over.</strong> The numbers do not lie. The bodies do not lie. The silence of leaders is a choice.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>Call Senator Sepúlveda. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real street redesigns. Demand action against repeat reckless drivers.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name on a slab. The street will not change itself.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report states the taxi 'slides on wet asphalt' and that 'brakes fail,' resulting in the vehicle’s left front bumper striking the pedestrian. The man suffered severe crush injuries to his neck and was found conscious but gravely hurt in the street. The police report lists 'Pavement Slippery' and 'Brakes Defective' as contributing factors to the crash. No driver error beyond these mechanical and environmental failures is cited, but the systemic danger is clear: a vehicle unable to stop, a vulnerable pedestrian left exposed, and a city street transformed into a site of trauma. The report does not attribute any contributing factors to the pedestrian’s behavior.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
