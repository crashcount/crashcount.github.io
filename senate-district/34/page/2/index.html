Eighteen left with life-changing wounds.</strong> In the last year alone, the streets of Senate District 34 have not let up. The numbers do not flinch: 1,165 injured, 1,731 crashes. The dead include children, elders, and riders who never made it home.</p><p>Just weeks ago, Nathaniel Martinez, 31, was thrown from his motorcycle and killed when an SUV turned left across his path on Pelham Parkway. The driver stayed. Nathaniel did not. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/29/motorcycle-rider-dies-crash-bronx-near-bruckner-expressway/>&ldquo;The Equinox driver stayed at the scene, and both she and Martinez were transported by EMS to Jacob Medical Center, where Martinez died from severe internal injuries.&rdquo;</a> No arrest. No justice. The road keeps moving.</p><p>On the Hutchinson River Parkway, an 18-year-old woman was left broken on the asphalt after a chain-reaction crash. The moped driver fled. She clung to life in the hospital. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/21/woman-passenger-18-clings-to-life-after-falling-off-moped-in-bronx-crash-driver-speeds-off/>&ldquo;Police said the moped driver sped away from the 3:45 a.m. crash&mldr; leaving the young woman to die on the road.&rdquo;</a> Six others were hurt. The city calls these accidents. The families know better.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> In three years, they killed nine, left 12 with serious injuries, and hurt hundreds more. Trucks and buses wounded dozens. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll, but the weight of steel and speed is what crushes bodies and hope.</p><p>Children are not spared. Two under 18 died this year. The old are not spared. Two over 65 died. The violence does not discriminate, but the system does. The most vulnerable pay the highest price.</p><h3 id=what-has-senator-fernandez-done>What Has Senator Fernández Done?</h3><p>Senator Nathalia Fernández has voted for tougher laws. She backed the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. She voted to extend school speed zones. These are steps. But the carnage continues. The bills are not enough. The streets are not safe.</p><h3 id=what-next-demand-more-demand-now>What Next? Demand More. Demand Now.</h3><p><strong>Call Senator Fernández. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against reckless drivers. Demand streets built for people, not cars.</strong></p><p>Every day of delay is another family shattered. The blood on the road is not an accident. It is a choice. Make them choose life.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The crash occurred at 20:03. The pedestrian died at the scene, suffering fatal head injuries. The police report explicitly lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor in the collision. The vehicle, a 2022 Jeep registered in New Jersey, was traveling straight ahead when it struck the man in the intersection. The report also notes the pedestrian was 'crossing against the signal,' but this detail follows the primary fault of driver inattention. The deadly impact underscores the ongoing danger posed by inattentive drivers on New York City streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Police attribute the crash to 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way.'
