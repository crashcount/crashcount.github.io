The livery driver died.</p><p>On 2025-06-28 a left turn onto the I-95 ramp on Pelham Parkway struck a motorcycle. Nathaniel Martinez, 31, later died of severe internal injuries, police and reporters said (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/29/motorcycle-rider-dies-crash-bronx-near-bruckner-expressway/>NY Daily News, 2025-06-29</a>). Earlier that weekend, before dawn on 2025-06-21, a multi-vehicle crash on the Hutchinson River Parkway ejected scooter riders and left seven people hurt, one critically (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/hutchinson-river-parkway-accident-bronx-involving-moped-driver-injures-7/16808062/>ABC7, 2025-06-22</a>).</p><p>The toll in SD 34</p><p>Since 2022, Senate District 34 has recorded 30 deaths and 58 serious injuries, according to NYC crash data (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Year to date, crashes are up 21% and injuries up 39% versus last year. The district has 1,281 crashes, 882 injuries, 15 serious injuries and 5 deaths this year to date (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). These are not statistics. They are people.</p><p>Patterns and causes</p><p>The crashes here follow the familiar script: speeding, risky left turns, failure to yield, and driver inattention. Slippery pavement appears in multiple reports, too. SUVs and cars dominate the harm: the district’s vehicle rollup shows far more injuries from sedans and SUVs than from trucks, buses, motorcycles or bikes. That means heavier vehicles keep doing the worst damage.</p><p>Hotspots</p><p>Danger concentrates on Pelham Parkway and the Hutchinson River Parkway. These corridors see abrupt turns, high speeds, and multi-vehicle chain reactions that shred riders and pedestrians.</p><p>What your senator did — and what’s missing</p><p>State Senator Nathalia Fernández voted yes in committee on S 4045 in June — the bill to require intelligent speed‑assistance devices for repeat violators (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>File S 4045, 2025-06-11/12</a>). She also voted to extend school speed zones in June. Those votes matter. Now the state must pass the measure, fund it, and force the worst offenders to comply.</p><p>Local fixes that work</p><p>Make turns safer. Harden left turns with protected phases and leading pedestrian intervals (LPIs). Daylight intersections by removing parking near crosswalks. Add curb extensions and slower lane widths. Target enforcement where repeat speeding and red‑light violations cluster. Expand 24‑hour speed cameras and pair them with street redesign, not just fines.</p><p>Citywide solutions</p><p>Local findings point to two citywide fixes. First, lower New York City’s default speed limit to 20 mph to cut the force of every crash. Second, require intelligent speed‑assistance or limiters for habitual speeders — the small share of drivers who cause outsized harm. S 4045 moves in that direction; finish the job.</p><p>What you can do today</p><p>Call your Council member and State Senator Nathalia Fernández. Demand a 20 mph default, targeted street redesign on Pelham Parkway and the Hutchinson River Parkway, and speed limiters for repeat offenders. Cite the record: 30 deaths in SD 34 since 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Don’t let another knock on the door be the price of waiting.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Only silence and the old man alone in the dark, another pedestrian left behind in the Bronx night.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, an 81-year-old pedestrian was struck while crossing at the corner of Westchester Avenue and Metcalf Avenue in the Bronx. The report states the man was found unconscious with a head injury and severe bleeding. No driver remained at the scene, and no vehicle description was provided. The report notes, 'No driver stayed. No car described.' The pedestrian was left alone, with no witnesses or aid from the motorist responsible. The absence of any driver information or vehicle details underscores the systemic danger faced by pedestrians, especially when drivers flee and accountability vanishes. The police report does not list any contributing factors related to the victim's behavior.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The report states she suffered a neck injury and severe bleeding but remained conscious at the scene. Police attribute the crash to 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way.' The driver, licensed and operating a 2015 Honda sedan, looked away during the turn, according to the narrative. The vehicle sustained no damage. The woman’s action—'Crossing With Signal'—is noted in the report, but only after the driver’s errors are cited as contributing factors. The collision underscores the persistent danger left-turning vehicles pose to pedestrians in city intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the crash occurred at 1:35 a.m. The pedestrian was not at an intersection and was engaged in 'other actions in roadway' when the collision happened. The report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the primary contributing factor. The impact caused fatal injuries to the pedestrian’s entire body. No evidence in the police report suggests any contributing behavior by the victim prior to the crash. The driver’s failure to pay attention behind the wheel is the only cited cause, underscoring the persistent danger drivers pose to people on foot.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The report states, 'He flew from the bike, landed hard. His skull hit Bronx concrete. Blood on the street. He died there, alone, in the late morning sun.' The police narrative lists 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a contributing factor, but does not cite any driver-specific errors or violations. The cyclist was ejected from his bike and suffered fatal head injuries. The report does not mention helmet use or any other cyclist behavior as a contributing factor. The deadly impact underscores the vulnerability of people on bikes when confronted by heavy vehicles in city traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The impact was direct and severe, leaving the pedestrian unconscious with a head injury and severe bleeding. The police report states the driver was unlicensed at the time of the crash. The vehicle, a Mitsubishi sedan, hit the pedestrian head-on at the intersection. The report notes the pedestrian was 'crossing against the signal,' but the most significant systemic danger cited is the presence of an unlicensed driver operating a motor vehicle. The narrative describes a quiet street turned violent, with the victim left motionless in the crosswalk. The report does not list any additional contributing factors from the driver, but the lack of a valid license is a critical failure in the system meant to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Both vehicles struck center-front. The report states, 'Distraction guided them,' and lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the primary contributing factor for both operators. One rider, age 65, suffered severe facial bleeding and was partially ejected from his vehicle, though he wore a helmet. The report also notes 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' as a contributing factor for this injured rider. Both vehicles were traveling straight ahead before the crash. The data highlights the systemic danger posed by distracted operation and improper lane use, especially when riders are unlicensed.
