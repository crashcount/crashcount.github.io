Fourteen left with injuries that will never heal.</strong> In the last year alone, Senate District 34 saw 1,062 people hurt in 1,650 crashes. Two children died. Two more under 24. The old and the young, all struck down. The street does not care who you are.</p><h3 id=the-names-behind-the-numbers>The Names Behind the Numbers</h3><p>On a cold February night, a 17-year-old boy and a 14-year-old girl rode a dirt bike through Soundview. They collided with a minivan. The boy died. The girl survived. His family waited for his call that never came. “He was here yesterday morning, sitting on the bed and watching TV. I spoke to him last around 4 p.m.” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/25/dirt-bike-minivan-bronx-crash-juan-alexander-quizhpi-naranjo/>said his mother</a>. The driver stayed. No charges. The investigation drags on. The street is silent again.</p><p>A month later, an ambulance and a box truck collided at Pelham Parkway South and Williamsbridge Road. The truck flipped. Three people went to the hospital. “Three people were hurt: the box truck driver and two ambulance workers,” <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/ambulance-box-truck-collide-injuring-3-people-morris-park-bronx/16177097/>reported ABC7</a>. The cause is still under investigation. The intersection remains unchanged.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-and-silence>Leadership: Votes and Silence</h3><p><strong>Senator Nathalia Fernández has voted for safety.</strong> She backed bills to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>), to redesign streets for all users (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>S 9718</a>), and to expand speed cameras in school zones. She co-sponsored a bill to require safer street design on every state-funded project (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S131>S 131</a>). These are steps. But the bodies keep coming. <strong>No law yet has made the street safe for the child crossing at dusk, or the old man with groceries.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by lawmakers, by city planners, by those who set the speed and draw the lines. Call Senator Fernández. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand that every street be built for the living, not for the dead.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. Act now.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
