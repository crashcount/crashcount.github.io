Forty-seven left with serious wounds.</strong> In three and a half years, more than 6,000 crashes tore through these Bronx streets. Children, elders, riders, walkers—none spared. In the last year alone, two children died. Two more under 24. One man, 75, was crossing with the light when an SUV turned and crushed him. He never made it home. The driver was distracted. The man is gone. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>A moped crash on Metcalf Avenue left a 17-year-old dead, a 14-year-old girl thrown to the pavement. His family waited for a call that never came. &ldquo;He was here yesterday morning, sitting on the bed and watching TV,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/25/dirt-bike-minivan-bronx-crash-juan-alexander-quizhpi-naranjo/>his mother said</a>. The girl survived. He did not.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the damage.</strong> Nine killed by cars and SUVs. Trucks and buses, too, leave bodies and broken bones. Motorbikes and mopeds add to the toll. The streets are not safe for the young or the old. The numbers do not lie. They do not comfort.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Senator Nathalia Fernández has voted for safer streets. She backed bills to force speed limiters on repeat offenders, to redesign roads for people, not just cars, and to expand speed cameras near schools. She co-sponsored a law to require &ldquo;complete street&rdquo; design on every project that takes public money. These are steps. They are not enough. The dead do not come back. The wounded do not heal fast.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day without action is another day the street claims a life. Call Senator Fernández. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never sleep. Demand streets built for people, not for speed. Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
