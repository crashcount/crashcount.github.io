The crash occurred at 2:00 PM, with both vehicles traveling southeast. The police report cites 'Tire Failure/Inadequate' and 'Following Too Closely' as contributing factors. The motorcyclist, operating a 2004 Suzuki, was partially ejected from his bike and suffered severe lacerations to his legs. The narrative states, 'A tire gave out. He flew partway off. Legs torn. Awake. Bleeding.' The report further notes the rider wore no protective gear. Driver actions—specifically following too closely—are listed as primary causes. The pickup truck sustained damage to its left rear bumper, while the motorcycle’s front end was crushed.
