Over a thousand injured.</strong> That’s the toll in Senate District 34 in the last year alone. The numbers do not flinch: 18 people left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The dead include children, elders, riders, and walkers. Each one gone in a moment. Each one a hole left behind.</p><p>Just days ago, a 31-year-old man on a motorcycle was killed on Pelham Parkway. A driver in a Chevrolet Equinox turned left onto the I-95 ramp and struck him. The driver stayed. The man died at the hospital. There was no arrest. The NYPD is still investigating. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/29/motorcycle-rider-dies-crash-bronx-near-bruckner-expressway/>&ldquo;The Equinox driver stayed at the scene, and both she and Martinez were transported by EMS to Jacob Medical Center, where Martinez died from severe internal injuries.&rdquo;</a></p><p>On the Hutchinson River Parkway, an 18-year-old woman was thrown from a moped in a chain-reaction crash. The driver who should have protected her sped away, leaving her broken on the road. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/21/woman-passenger-18-clings-to-life-after-falling-off-moped-in-bronx-crash-driver-speeds-off/>&ldquo;Police said the moped driver sped away from the 3:45 a.m. crash&mldr; leaving the young woman to die on the road.&rdquo;</a></p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>The most vulnerable pay the highest price.</strong> In the last three years, 27 people have died in crashes here. Nearly 3,500 have been hurt. Cars and SUVs are the main killers—responsible for nine deaths and more than 400 injuries to pedestrians. Trucks and buses injured dozens more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll, but the weight of death comes on four wheels.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h2><p>Senator Nathalia Fernández has voted for bills to curb repeat speeders and redesign streets for safety. She backed the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force the worst offenders to install speed limiters. She voted for complete street design and for more speed cameras in school zones. These are steps forward. But the carnage continues. Every week brings new names to the list.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Senator Fernández. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against reckless drivers. Demand streets built for people, not just cars. Do not wait for another name to be added to the roll of the dead.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
