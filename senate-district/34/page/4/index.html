The livery driver died.</p><p>On 2025-06-28 a left turn onto the I-95 ramp on Pelham Parkway struck a motorcycle. Nathaniel Martinez, 31, later died of severe internal injuries, police and reporters said (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/29/motorcycle-rider-dies-crash-bronx-near-bruckner-expressway/>NY Daily News, 2025-06-29</a>). Earlier that weekend, before dawn on 2025-06-21, a multi-vehicle crash on the Hutchinson River Parkway ejected scooter riders and left seven people hurt, one critically (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/hutchinson-river-parkway-accident-bronx-involving-moped-driver-injures-7/16808062/>ABC7, 2025-06-22</a>).</p><p>The toll in SD 34</p><p>Since 2022, Senate District 34 has recorded 30 deaths and 58 serious injuries, according to NYC crash data (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Year to date, crashes are up 21% and injuries up 39% versus last year. The district has 1,281 crashes, 882 injuries, 15 serious injuries and 5 deaths this year to date (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). These are not statistics. They are people.</p><p>Patterns and causes</p><p>The crashes here follow the familiar script: speeding, risky left turns, failure to yield, and driver inattention. Slippery pavement appears in multiple reports, too. SUVs and cars dominate the harm: the district’s vehicle rollup shows far more injuries from sedans and SUVs than from trucks, buses, motorcycles or bikes. That means heavier vehicles keep doing the worst damage.</p><p>Hotspots</p><p>Danger concentrates on Pelham Parkway and the Hutchinson River Parkway. These corridors see abrupt turns, high speeds, and multi-vehicle chain reactions that shred riders and pedestrians.</p><p>What your senator did — and what’s missing</p><p>State Senator Nathalia Fernández voted yes in committee on S 4045 in June — the bill to require intelligent speed‑assistance devices for repeat violators (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>File S 4045, 2025-06-11/12</a>). She also voted to extend school speed zones in June. Those votes matter. Now the state must pass the measure, fund it, and force the worst offenders to comply.</p><p>Local fixes that work</p><p>Make turns safer. Harden left turns with protected phases and leading pedestrian intervals (LPIs). Daylight intersections by removing parking near crosswalks. Add curb extensions and slower lane widths. Target enforcement where repeat speeding and red‑light violations cluster. Expand 24‑hour speed cameras and pair them with street redesign, not just fines.</p><p>Citywide solutions</p><p>Local findings point to two citywide fixes. First, lower New York City’s default speed limit to 20 mph to cut the force of every crash. Second, require intelligent speed‑assistance or limiters for habitual speeders — the small share of drivers who cause outsized harm. S 4045 moves in that direction; finish the job.</p><p>What you can do today</p><p>Call your Council member and State Senator Nathalia Fernández. Demand a 20 mph default, targeted street redesign on Pelham Parkway and the Hutchinson River Parkway, and speed limiters for repeat offenders. Cite the record: 30 deaths in SD 34 since 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Don’t let another knock on the door be the price of waiting.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
