She is eighteen. The moped that carried her is gone. The driver fled. Seven people are hurt, one clings to life. This is the Bronx, Hutchinson River Parkway, June 2025. The police say, &ldquo;An 18-year-old was in critical condition after being thrown from a moped in the hit-and-run&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/7-hurt-in-crash-on-hutchinson-river-parkway-near-whitestone-bridge/>CBS New York</a>).</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>11 people died</strong> on SD 34 streets. <strong>1,067 were injured</strong>.

They do not care if you are old or young, walking or riding, crossing with the light or against it.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p>The dead are not just numbers. A 75-year-old man, crossing with the signal, is struck by a BMW SUV making a left turn. He tries to wave the driver off. The car does not stop.

The bill requires drivers who rack up eleven or more points in 24 months, or six speed or red-light camera tickets in twelve months, to install intelligent speed assistance devices. Primary sponsor Andrew Gounardes led the push, joined by co-sponsors Samra Brouk, Cordell Cleare, and others. The vote passed with support from senators including Jeremy Cooney, Pete Harckham, and Jessica Ramos. The measure aims to rein in repeat offenders and reduce deadly speeding. The bill’s language is blunt: 'Requires the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices if a driver accumulates eleven or more points on their driving record during a 24 month period, or receives 6 speed camera or red light camera tickets during a twelve month period.'

The report does not list any contributing factors attributed to the driver, but the act of fleeing highlights a systemic danger: drivers leaving injured pedestrians behind. The report notes the pedestrian was 'crossing, no signal, or crosswalk,' but does not cite this as a contributing factor to the crash.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
