The engines do not rest. In Senate District 34, the road keeps taking. In the last twelve months, <strong>12 people died</strong> and <strong>1,165 were injured</strong> in crashes. Eighteen were left with wounds so deep they are called serious. The numbers are not just numbers. They are fathers, daughters, neighbors.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a 31-year-old man rode his motorcycle down Pelham Parkway. A Chevrolet SUV turned left. The crash was sudden. He died at the hospital. The driver stayed. There was no arrest. The police are still investigating. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/29/motorcycle-rider-dies-crash-bronx-near-bruckner-expressway/>&ldquo;The Equinox driver stayed at the scene, and both she and Martinez were transported by EMS to Jacob Medical Center, where Martinez died from severe internal injuries.&rdquo;</a></p><p>On the Hutchinson River Parkway, an 18-year-old woman was thrown from a moped at 4 a.m. She landed on the asphalt. The driver fled. She was left fighting for her life. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/21/woman-passenger-18-clings-to-life-after-falling-off-moped-in-bronx-crash-driver-speeds-off/>&ldquo;Police said the moped driver sped away from the 3:45 a.m. crash&mldr; leaving the young woman to die on the road.&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=the-old-and-the-young>The Old and the Young</h3><p>The violence does not spare the old or the young. In the past year, two children died. Two people over 65 died. The street does not care how old you are. It only cares that you are in its path.</p><p>SUVs and cars are the main killers. They caused <strong>9 deaths</strong> and over <strong>445 injuries</strong> to pedestrians and cyclists. Trucks and buses, motorcycles, mopeds, bikes—they all play their part. But the weight of the harm is steel and speed.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Senator Nathalia Fernández has voted yes on bills to curb repeat speeders and extend school speed zones. She backed the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force the worst offenders to install speed-limiting devices. She voted to protect children near schools. These are steps. But the blood on the road says it is not enough.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more><strong>Call to Action: Demand More</strong></h3><p><strong>Twelve dead in a year. Hundreds maimed.</strong> The road is not safe. Call Senator Fernández. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement. Demand streets where a child can cross without fear. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
