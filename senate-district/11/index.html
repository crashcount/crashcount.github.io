Since 2022, 20 people have died and 59 have been seriously injured in crashes here. The toll is not just numbers. It is a body on Bell Boulevard. It is a child’s bike left at the curb. In the last year alone, five more lives ended. Over a thousand were hurt. The disaster does not pause.</p><p>Just last week, a 15-year-old fleeing police on an e-bike was struck and killed by a Lexus driver with a suspended license and a record of 53 speeding camera violations. The driver tried to run. Police said he had “at least three license suspensions” and the car’s history was long and ugly. The NYPD’s Force Investigation Division is now on the case. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/13/queens-mugging-suspect-15-on-e-bike-fleeing-nypd-cops-fatally-struck-by-hit-run-lexus-driver/>Ali is charged with leaving the scene of a fatal accident, aggravated unlicensed operation of a vehicle and traffic violations, Nassau cops said.</a></p><p>A few days before, a crane slammed into a Q88 bus in Queens Village. Four people were hurt. Emily McKinnon was on board. She <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bus-crane-collide-queens-village-4-people-injured/17016760/>said, &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t see the crane coming&mldr; then the crane just hits us.&rdquo;</a> The bus driver did nothing wrong. The city’s streets are not built for mercy.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-risk>Who Bears the Risk</h3><p>The dead and injured are not just numbers. They are walkers, cyclists, children. In SD 11, cars and SUVs caused the most harm: 3 deaths, 19 serious injuries. Trucks and buses killed one, seriously hurt three. Motorcycles and mopeds left four more broken. Bikes injured but did not kill. The pattern is clear. The larger the vehicle, the greater the risk to the body in the crosswalk.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>State Senator Toby Stavisky has <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted for bills to curb repeat speeders</a> and <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S1675>extend school speed zones</a>. She co-sponsored a bill to rate cars for pedestrian safety. These are steps forward. But the carnage continues. Laws that focus on speed cameras and repeat tickets help, but they do not rebuild the street or slow the next driver. The work is not done.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more>Call to Action: Demand More</h3><p>Every crash is preventable. Every delay is a choice. Call Senator Stavisky. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real street redesigns. Do not wait for the next siren. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is policy.</p><p><a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Prosecutors say Pena drove 83 mph in a 25 mph zone, ran a red light, and struck Justin Diaz, 23, who had the right-of-way. Pena's blood-alcohol content was 0.156%, nearly twice the legal limit, and he tested positive for cocaine and marijuana. The article notes, 'Police charged Pena with vehicular manslaughter, DWI, and refusing to take a breath test.' Surveillance footage confirmed Pena had been drinking for hours before the crash. The incident highlights the lethal consequences of impaired, reckless driving and raises questions about screening and accountability for city employees operating vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The impact left a 20-year-old male moped passenger with severe crush injuries to his entire body. The report states he wore a helmet and did not lose consciousness, but the pain was overwhelming. Both vehicles were reported as going straight ahead before the crash. The police report does not specify contributing factors or assign blame, listing them as 'Unspecified.' However, the narrative details the sedan striking the moped, with the moped absorbing the force at its center back end and the sedan’s left front bumper taking the hit.

The crash threw Berney from his car, killing him at the scene. The other driver was injured. Vennitti, unlicensed, abandoned his Mercedes and fled on foot. Police arrested him a year later. A grand jury indicted Vennitti for leaving the scene of a fatal crash and driving without a license.
