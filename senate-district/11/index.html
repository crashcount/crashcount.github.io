The article highlights the city's power to lower speed limits to 20 mph, granted by the state legislature, but points out that local officials did not mention this in their initial responses.

Systemic danger left another body broken.</p><p class=mb3>A collision occurred on College Point Blvd near 14th Road in Queens at 5:49 a.m., involving a Ford sedan and a southbound cyclist. According to the police report, the sedan was 'making left turn' when it struck the cyclist, who was 'going straight ahead.' The report states, 'Steel met skin. The rider, 32, fell hard. Legs crushed.' The cyclist suffered crush injuries to the lower legs and remained conscious at the scene. Police explicitly list 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor for both the sedan and the crash overall. The sedan’s left front bumper struck the bike’s center front end. The report notes the cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this is mentioned only after driver distraction is cited as the cause. The crash underscores the persistent risk posed by inattentive drivers to vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The impact threw an MTA worker onto the pavement. The driver ran. The worker died. Police found the abandoned car. The driver had no license.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News reported on February 5, 2025, that James Vennitti, 63, was arrested for a deadly hit-and-run on the Whitestone Expressway in Queens. On February 10, 2024, Vennitti allegedly rear-ended David Berney, 43, after Berney and another driver stopped in the middle lane following a minor collision. The crash threw Berney from his car, killing him at the scene. The other driver was injured. Vennitti, unlicensed, abandoned his Mercedes and fled on foot. Police arrested him a year later. A grand jury indicted Vennitti for leaving the scene of a fatal crash and driving without a license. The case highlights the lethal risk of unlicensed driving and the dangers of stopped vehicles on high-speed roads.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
