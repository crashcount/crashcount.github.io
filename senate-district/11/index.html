Three people died: the 84‑year‑old driver and two men near a food truck. Witness George Giakoumis said the car &ldquo;must have been going at least 60+ miles an hour.&rdquo; Abelardo Venancio mourned his brother as &ldquo;the best person you can find in the world.&rdquo; (ABC7, CBS News, Streetsblog NYC).</p><p>On 2025-08-15 a Queens judge sentenced Joseph Lee for driving the wrong way on the Clearview Expressway and striking multiple cars. Queens DA Melinda Katz said, &ldquo;Joseph Lee terrorized other drivers.&rdquo; Two motorists were badly hurt. (amNY).</p><h3 id=the-pattern>The pattern</h3><p>Deaths are up 300% year‑to‑date — 8 this year versus 2 at this point last year (NYC Open Data). In the last 12 months SD 11 recorded 3,349 crashes, 10 deaths and 21 serious injuries (NYC Open Data).</p><p>In January (2025-01-31) a 29‑year‑old crossing with the signal at Hillside Avenue and 212th Street was crushed by a turning box truck. The crash report lists driver inattention and an oversized vehicle as contributing factors (NYC Open Data).</p><p>Cars and SUVs account for the bulk of pedestrian impacts here; trucks are less frequent but can be deadly. The common contributing factors in recent fatal crashes are speeding and driver inattention.</p><p>Hotspots: 19th Avenue & 42nd Street and Hillside Avenue & 212th Street keep appearing in the data and in reporting. Fix those corners first.</p><h3 id=what-your-senator-did>What your senator did</h3><p>State Senator Toby Stavisky voted yes on S 4045, a bill to require speed‑limiting technology for repeat violators, and she co‑sponsored S 1675 to create a pedestrian safety rating for vehicles (Open States: S 4045, S 1675). Those votes matter. They are not enough.</p><h3 id=what-must-change-now-local-and-concrete>What must change now (local and concrete)</h3><p>Lower speeds save lives. City Hall can make local streets safer now. On these blocks we need:</p><ul><li>Signal timing and Leading Pedestrian Intervals (LPIs) at crosswalks on 19th Ave & 42nd St and Hillside Ave & 212th St.</li><li>Daylighting: clear sightlines by banning sidewalk parking near corners and removing visual clutter.</li><li>Hardened turns and curb extensions to slow approaches, plus targeted speed‑enforcement at peak hours.</li></ul><p>Citywide fixes must follow. Make 20 mph the default on residential streets. Require intelligent speed assistance for habitual speeders. S 4045 would force speed‑limiting tech on repeat offenders — pass it. These two actions together cut speed, cut crashes, save lives.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-delay>The cost of delay</h3><p>SD 11 keeps bleeding because officials move too slowly. &ldquo;Traffic violence is not inevitable,&rdquo; says Council Member Tiffany Caban. The data shows it: choices and policies, not fate, shape who lives and who dies.</p><p>Call. Write. Show up. Demand a 20 mph default and mandatory speed limiters for repeat speeders now. Start with this resource: Take Action.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Prosecutors said Pena drove 83 mph in a 25 mph zone, ran a red light, and struck Justin Diaz, 23, who had the right-of-way. Pena's blood-alcohol content was 0.156%, nearly double the legal limit, and he tested positive for cocaine and marijuana. The article states, 'Pena was driving nearly 60 mph above the speed limit after a night of drinking at a bar.' Surveillance footage confirmed the sequence. Two passengers in Pena's car were hospitalized. The crash highlights ongoing risks from impaired and reckless driving, even among public servants.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The impact left a 20-year-old male moped passenger with severe crush injuries to his entire body. The report states he wore a helmet and did not lose consciousness, but the pain was overwhelming. Both vehicles were reported as going straight ahead before the crash. The police report does not specify contributing factors or assign blame, listing them as 'Unspecified.' However, the narrative details the sedan striking the moped, with the moped absorbing the force at its center back end and the sedan’s left front bumper taking the hit.

A grand jury indicted Vennitti for leaving the scene of a fatal crash and driving without a license.
