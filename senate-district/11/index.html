It hit a parked coffee truck. It hit two men. The driver died too. Witness George Giakoumis said the car was “going at least 60+ miles an hour just right through the stop sign.” Two pedestrians, ages 41 and 70, were killed. The 84-year-old driver also died. Three families went home without their men. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/astoria-queens-crash-kills-2-leaves-critical-condition-cars-collide-local-road-new-york/17512236/>ABC7</a> | <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/car-hits-food-truck-in-queens-3-dead/>CBS New York</a></p><p>The city’s own file marks the hour: 8:36 a.m., August 12, 2025. Two pedestrians listed “Not at Intersection.” The Toyota is a sedan. A Volvo is turning. A parked Chevy and VW take blows. Three entries end the same: “Apparent Death.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash 4834594</a></p><p>In January, 18 miles away on Hillside Avenue, a left‑turning box truck struck a 29‑year‑old man in the crosswalk. He had the signal. The truck had size and a blind side. He died. The file lists “Driver Inattention/Distraction” and “Oversized Vehicle.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash 4789587</a></p><p>In this Senate district, ten people have died in the last 12 months.

The best person you can find in the world.” <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/car-hits-food-truck-in-queens-3-dead/>CBS New York</a> | <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/astoria-queens-crash-kills-2-leaves-critical-condition-cars-collide-local-road-new-york/17512236/>ABC7</a></p><p>A small group of drivers does the most harm. Vehicles with <strong>16 camera tickets in 12 months are twice as likely</strong> to kill or seriously injure. <strong>30+ tickets makes the risk fifty‑fold.</strong> One such driver ran a red in Brooklyn this spring and killed a mother and her two daughters. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/20/the-1-5-percent-of-drivers-who-cause-21-percent-of-pedestrian-deaths>Streetsblog</a> | <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/15/brooklyn-driver-with-29-speed-camera-tickets-kills-mother-and-two-daughters>Daily News</a></p><p>Albany moved a bill that would force the worst repeat speeders to install devices that cap speed. The Senate’s S 4045 advanced in June.

Pena's blood-alcohol content was 0.156%, nearly double the legal limit, and he tested positive for cocaine and marijuana. The article states, 'Pena was driving nearly 60 mph above the speed limit after a night of drinking at a bar.' Surveillance footage confirmed the sequence. Two passengers in Pena's car were hospitalized.
