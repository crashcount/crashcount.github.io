The report lists 'View Obstructed/Limited' and 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as contributing factors, explicitly citing driver error as central to the crash. The sedan was starting from parking, while the SUV was going straight ahead. The pedestrian suffered severe injury to his lower leg, resulting in amputation, but remained conscious throughout. The report does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor. The impact and aftermath underscore the lethal consequences of driver inattention and obstructed views on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The driver, licensed in New Jersey, was operating a 2018 FRHT-TRUCK/BUS with one occupant. The report states the driver was inattentive or distracted and failed to observe the pedestrian in time. The vehicle struck a 29-year-old man who was crossing with the signal at the intersection. The point of impact was the truck’s left front bumper. The pedestrian suffered fatal crush injuries and died at the scene. The police report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Oversized Vehicle' as contributing factors. The victim’s behavior—crossing with the signal—is noted only after the driver’s errors.

No chance.</p><p class=mb3>A 15-year-old boy driving a motorscooter was killed in a violent crash with a bus at the corner of 19th Avenue and 43rd Street in Queens, according to the police report. The report states the teen was 'unlicensed and bareheaded' when he struck the bus and was ejected from his motorscooter, suffering fatal head injuries. The bus, registered in New Jersey, was traveling west and was struck on its right front bumper. The police report lists the boy as unlicensed and not wearing any safety equipment. Contributing factors are marked as 'Unspecified' in the report. The narrative emphasizes the severity of the impact and the absence of a helmet, but does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor before listing the lack of helmet use. The focus remains on the systemic dangers present when young, unlicensed individuals operate motor vehicles on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
