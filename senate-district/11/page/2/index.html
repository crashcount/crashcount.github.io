A truck turns left. He does not make it home. In the last twelve months, six people died on the roads of Senate District 11. Nineteen more were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. In total, 1,622 people were hurt—children, elders, workers, neighbors. The numbers do not bleed, but the streets do.</p><p>A 29-year-old was crushed crossing with the light on Hillside Avenue. The truck kept turning. The record says only this: &ldquo;Crush Injuries. Apparent Death.&rdquo; <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>A 15-year-old on a moped was thrown from his seat and died under the wheels of a bus. The record does not mention his name. Only his age, and that he wore no helmet. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=the-vehicles-that-kill>The Vehicles That Kill</h3><p>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage. In three years, they killed at least three people and seriously injured seventeen more. Trucks and buses killed one, left three with life-changing wounds. Motorcycles and mopeds took no lives, but left one person with a serious injury. Not a single bike killed or seriously hurt anyone.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Senator Toby Stavisky voted yes on a bill to force safer street design for all users, not just drivers. The bill passed. It calls for &ldquo;redesigning streets to protect all users, not just drivers.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>legislation</a>. Stavisky also co-sponsored a bill to rate cars for pedestrian safety, but it has not moved. The streets remain the same.</p><p>The dead do not care about bills that sit in committee. The families do. The record shows delay. Five months passed before police charged a driver who killed a 78-year-old man in Bellerose. The charge: failure to yield. The penalty: a desk ticket. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/21/driver-arrested-5-months-after-fatally-striking-78-year-old-man-in-queens/>A driver has been arrested five months after fatally striking a 78-year-old man crossing a heavily traveled Queens intersection, police said Wednesday.</a></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every day the city delays lowering speed limits, every day a bill sits unsigned, another family waits for a knock at the door. Call Senator Stavisky. Call your council member. Demand streets that put people first.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report states the SUV was making a right turn when it struck the cyclist, who was traveling east. The cyclist, a 53-year-old woman, suffered crush injuries to her lower leg after the SUV’s front left quarter panel hit her. She remained conscious but was bleeding on the pavement. According to the police report, 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' was cited as the contributing factor, highlighting a critical driver error. The report notes the cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this detail is listed only after the driver’s failure to yield.

It pushes for complete street design. The aim: safer roads for everyone. Pedestrians, cyclists, and passengers stand to gain. The vote split. Some senators said no. But the bill moved forward. Streets may change.</p><p class=mb3>Senate Bill S 9718, titled "Enables safe access to public roads for all users by utilizing complete street design principles," advanced through the Senate with committee votes on May 28 and June 3, 2024. The bill, sponsored by Sean Ryan (District 61) and co-sponsored by Liz Krueger, Monica Martinez, Jack M. Martins, Anthony H. Palumbo, and Julia Salazar, passed both votes despite opposition. The measure calls for redesigning streets to protect all users, not just drivers. The vote was not unanimous—several senators voted no, but the majority carried it through. The bill’s focus is clear: safer streets for people on foot, on bikes, and in vehicles. No safety analyst note was provided, but the intent is to cut danger at the curb and crosswalk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
