A siren wails. In Senate District 11, five people have died in the last year. Nineteen more suffered injuries so grave the city calls them &ldquo;serious.&rdquo; In all, 1,638 people were hurt in 2,601 crashes. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about age. One child, one elder, one cyclist, one pedestrian—each is a body in the street.</p><h2 id=the-faces-behind-the-numbers>The Faces Behind the Numbers</h2><p>A 78-year-old man tried to cross Jericho Turnpike. He did not make it. Five months later, police charged the driver with failure to yield and failure to exercise due care. The charge is a misdemeanor. The man is still dead. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/21/driver-arrested-5-months-after-fatally-striking-78-year-old-man-in-queens/>Police charged him with failure to yield to a pedestrian and failure to exercise due care, both misdemeanors.</a></p><p>A firefighter ran a red light at 83 miles per hour. He killed a 23-year-old worker who had the right-of-way. His blood-alcohol was twice the legal limit. He was high on cocaine and marijuana. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/28/fdny-terminates-michael-pena-firefighter-busted-in-fatal-booze-fueled-queens-crash/>The victim had the right-of-way, and Pena ran a steady red light, prosecutors say.</a></p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-miles-to-go>Leadership: Steps Forward, Miles to Go</h2><p>Senator Toby Stavisky voted yes on a bill to force safer street designs for all users, not just drivers. The bill passed. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S1675>She also co-sponsored a bill</a> to make carmakers post pedestrian safety ratings online. These are steps. But the blood on the pavement says more is needed. The law still lets drivers off with a ticket for killing a man in a crosswalk. The law still lets speed and size rule the road.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Senator Stavisky. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real penalties for drivers who kill. Demand streets built for people, not just cars. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p><p><strong>Act now.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
