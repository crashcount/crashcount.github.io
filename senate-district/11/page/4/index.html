Since 2022, <strong>20 people have died</strong> and <strong>59 have been seriously injured</strong> in crashes. These are not just numbers—they are fathers, daughters, neighbors. In the last twelve months alone, six more lives ended on these streets. <strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the killing</strong>—three deaths by SUV, one by truck, none by bike. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p>Just last week, a crane slammed into a city bus in Queens Village. Four people were hurt. Emily McKinnon was on the bus. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t see the crane coming&mldr; then the crane just hits us,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was holding on for my life back there.&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bus-crane-collide-queens-village-4-people-injured/17016760/>McKinnon described the crash</a></p><p>A few days before, a police chase ended with a man on an e-bike dead under the wheels of a Lexus. The police said, &ldquo;He was pronounced dead at the scene.&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/12/us-news/knife-wielding-robbery-suspect-on-e-bike-hit-and-killed-by-car-during-nyc-police-chase/>police reported</a></p><h2 id=the-vulnerable-pay-the-price>The Vulnerable Pay the Price</h2><p>The most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, children—bear the brunt. In three years, <strong>over 5,000 people have been injured</strong> in SD 11. The dead include a 19-year-old moped rider, a 29-year-old pedestrian crushed by a truck, and a 64-year-old driver. The street is a lottery. The odds are bad.</p><p>App-based workers gathered in Little Bay Park to mourn their dead. &ldquo;For every name we read aloud at this memorial, there are families left grieving and coworkers left fearing the same fate,&rdquo; said Adaligisa Payero. &ldquo;These deaths were not inevitable; they happened because billion-dollar companies chose profit over safety.&rdquo; <a href=https://qns.com/2025/07/rideshare-and-delivery-drivers-hold-memorial-in-queens-for-colleagues-killed-on-the-job/>Payero said at the memorial</a></p><h2 id=what-has-senator-stavisky-done>What Has Senator Stavisky Done?</h2><p><strong>Senator Toby Stavisky has voted for bills that matter.</strong> She voted yes to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>require safer street designs</a>, to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S1675>expand school speed cameras</a>, and to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S343>boost driver education on pedestrian and cyclist safety</a>. She co-sponsored a bill to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2021/S1078>create a public safety rating for cars</a>. She voted yes on the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, which targets repeat dangerous drivers.</p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The bills are not enough. The street does not care about good intentions.</p><h2 id=what-next>What Next?</h2><p><strong>Call Senator Stavisky. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand enforcement against repeat speeders. Demand streets built for people, not just cars.</strong></p><p>Every day of delay is another family broken.
