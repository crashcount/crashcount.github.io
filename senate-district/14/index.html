Sixteen left with injuries that will not heal.</strong> In the last year alone, SD 14 saw 2,841 crashes. These are not just numbers—they are broken bodies and empty chairs. A 62-year-old man tried to cross Linden Boulevard. A car hit him. The driver fled. Another car ran him over. He died the next day. His family said, &ldquo;Today is a sad day. We lost a brother, father, son, uncle, and cousin. [He] has been snuffed from us by a hit and runner driver&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/30/man-62-killed-in-front-of-his-queens-home-by-hit-and-run-driver-second-motorist/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p><strong>Pedestrians are not safe.</strong> In the last 12 months, 163 children were hurt. Two pedestrians were killed by SUVs. Two more by sedans. Trucks and bikes left others bleeding. The road does not care how old you are or how careful. It only cares how fast and heavy the next car is.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Senator Leroy Comrie has moved on some fronts. He voted yes on a bill to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>force streets to be built for everyone</a>, not just cars. He co-sponsored a bill to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S1675>rate cars for how deadly they are to people on foot</a>. He pushed for a <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4946>&ldquo;yellow alert&rdquo; system to catch hit-and-run drivers</a>.</p><p>But when it came time to back the &ldquo;Idaho stop&rdquo;—a law that would let cyclists treat stop signs as yields, proven to keep them safer—Comrie said no. He <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/14/pain-points-victims-of-road-violence-make-annual-pilgrimage-to-demand-safe-streets>cited worries for seniors</a>. The streets remain the same. The danger does not yield.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay means another family waits for a call that will break them.</strong> The city drags its feet on speed humps and safe crossings. &ldquo;It should never take two years to implement these straight-forward safety measures,&rdquo; said a councilmember <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/11/11/stuckatdot-it-takes-years-and-years-to-get-a-speed-hump-in-this-city/#new_tab>fighting for her own district</a>.</p><p><strong>The crisis is not fate. It is policy.</strong></p><h3 id=act-nowor-count-the-bodies>Act Now—Or Count the Bodies</h3><p>Call Senator Comrie. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras that never go dark. Demand streets built for people, not just cars. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
