Forty-two left with serious injuries.</strong> More than 6,000 hurt since 2022. The dead include children, elders, and workers. The living carry scars.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a 39-year-old man on a scooter was thrown to the pavement at 116th Avenue and Nashville Boulevard. He died at the hospital. Police said, &ldquo;As the van attempted to turn left onto Nashville Boulevard, it collided with the scooter, immediately propelling Lagredelle off the device&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/stand-up-scooter-rider-fatal-queens-collision/>amNY</a>). No arrests. The street stays the same.</p><p>Days later, two riders on a moped collided with a BMW in Jamaica. Both were injured. The NYPD said, &ldquo;two people were riding the moped when it collided with a BMW&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-injured-in-moped-accident-in-jamaica-queens/>CBS New York</a>). No word on charges. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the killing.</strong> In this district, they caused 7 deaths and 10 serious injuries to pedestrians. Trucks and buses killed one, left two with life-changing wounds. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes hurt and maimed, but the carnage is driven by heavy metal and speed (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=what-has-senator-comrie-done>What Has Senator Comrie Done?</h3><p>Senator Leroy Comrie has voted for bills to curb repeat speeders and extend school speed zones. He co-sponsored a bill to rate cars for pedestrian safety. He voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force the worst repeat offenders to install speed limiters. He voted yes to create more safety zones. These are steps forward, but the bodies keep coming.</p><p>Comrie also opposed the &ldquo;Idaho stop&rdquo; bill, citing concerns for seniors (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/14/pain-points-victims-of-road-violence-make-annual-pilgrimage-to-demand-safe-streets>Streetsblog NYC</a>). He supported cutting hours for Jamaica busways, a move that weakens protection for bus riders and walkers (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/11/15/city-makes-jamaica-busways-permanent-but-with-shorter-hours-begins-northern-blvd-bus-lanes>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay means another family shattered.</strong> Call Senator Comrie. Demand a 20 mph speed limit on every street. Demand action against repeat speeders. Demand streets that put people first. The dead cannot speak. You can.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

This package includes the 'Idaho stop' bill and the 'Stop Super-Speeders' bill. The event saw support from several Assembly members and a senator for speed controls, while Sen. Anthony Palumbo and Assembly Member Michael Novakhov opposed the super speeder bill, citing government overreach. Sen. Leroy Comrie opposed the Idaho stop bill, citing concerns for seniors. Separately, Senate bill S533, which aimed to block congestion pricing, was defeated in the Senate Transportation Committee. Chair Jeremy Cooney stressed, 'You have to have a plan. If you don’t have a plan, what are [you] doing to get the $15 billion revenue?' The day highlighted the rift between safety demands and political resistance, with victims' voices at the center.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
