He voted yes on a bill to require <strong>complete street design</strong>—roads built for people, not just cars (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>Senate Bill S 9718</a>). He co-sponsored a bill for a <strong>yellow alert system</strong> to help catch hit-and-run drivers (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4946>S 4946</a>). He also backed a bill to rate cars for pedestrian safety (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S1675>S 1675</a>).</p><p>But when it came to the &ldquo;Idaho stop&rdquo; bill, which would let cyclists treat stop signs as yields, Comrie said no. He cited concerns for seniors, but the law would have made streets safer for people on bikes (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/14/pain-points-victims-of-road-violence-make-annual-pilgrimage-to-demand-safe-streets>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><h3 id=the-work-is-not-done>The Work Is Not Done</h3><p><strong>Every delay means more blood on the street.</strong> The dead cannot speak.

Reporter Elle McLogan notes the plan has stirred debate, with some residents supporting safer passage for cyclists and others expressing concern about traffic changes. The article highlights the ongoing tension between car dominance and the need for protected space for vulnerable road users. While no specific crash or driver error is cited, the coverage underscores the systemic risks faced by cyclists and pedestrians on streets designed for vehicles.
