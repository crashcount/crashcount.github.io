In the last twelve months, seven people died and 1,881 were injured in crashes. Seventeen suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, parents, children. Their names vanish, but the blood on the street remains.</p><p>Just last week, a 39-year-old man on a scooter was killed at 116th Avenue and Nashville Boulevard. The van turned left. The man was thrown to the ground. He died at Long Island Jewish Medical Center. Police said, &ldquo;As the van attempted to turn left onto Nashville Boulevard, it collided with the scooter, immediately propelling Lagredelle off the device,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/stand-up-scooter-rider-fatal-queens-collision/>according to amNY</a>.</p><p>On Linden Boulevard, a 62-year-old man tried to cross. He was struck by a hit-and-run driver, then run over by another car. He died the next day. Police are still searching for the first driver who fled the scene, <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/queens/man-killed-after-hit-run-crash-queens-police-say>according to Patch</a>.</p><h3 id=the-usual-weapons-cars-suvs-and-speed>The Usual Weapons: Cars, SUVs, and Speed</h3><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the killing. In this district, cars and SUVs caused six deaths and over 800 injuries to pedestrians in recent years. Trucks and buses add to the toll. The numbers do not lie. Speed and inattention are the common threads. The street is a gauntlet for anyone not behind a windshield.</p><h3 id=senator-comrie-steps-forward-steps-back>Senator Comrie: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h3><p>Senator Leroy Comrie has taken some steps. He voted yes on a bill to require safer street design for all users (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>S9718</a>). He co-sponsored bills for pedestrian safety ratings and a yellow alert system for hit-and-runs. But when it came to the &ldquo;Idaho stop&rdquo; bill, which would have made it safer for cyclists at intersections, Comrie opposed it, citing concerns for seniors (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/14/pain-points-victims-of-road-violence-make-annual-pilgrimage-to-demand-safe-streets>see the debate</a>).</p><p>The pace of change is slow. The dead keep coming. The city studies, the state debates, and families bury their own.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-demand-now>Call to Action: Demand More, Demand Now</h3><p>Seven dead in a year. Hundreds broken. This is not fate. This is policy. Call Senator Comrie. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real street redesign. Demand action before another name is lost.</p><p>The road will not change itself.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
