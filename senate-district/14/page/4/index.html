Eighteen left with serious injuries. Over two thousand hurt.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, the streets have not spared the old or the young. A 39-year-old man on a scooter, thrown to the ground and killed at an intersection. A 76-year-old woman, dead in the back seat after a lane change on the Cross Island Parkway. A pedestrian, 62, crushed crossing Linden Boulevard. The list goes on. Each number is a name, a family, a life cut short.</p><p>Just weeks ago, two riders on a moped collided with a BMW in Jamaica. The NYPD said, <strong>&ldquo;two people were riding the moped when it collided with a BMW&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-injured-in-moped-accident-in-jamaica-queens/>CBS New York</a>). Days before, a bus slammed into a pole, injuring eight. The city calls these minor injuries. For those on board, it was a morning that did not end as planned (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/8-hurt-in-queens-bus-crash/>CBS New York</a>).</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> In three years, they killed seven, seriously injured ten, and left hundreds more with broken bodies. Trucks and buses add to the toll. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes are not blameless, but the deadliest threat rolls on four wheels. The victims are not just numbers. They are neighbors, elders, children.</p><h3 id=senator-comrie-progress-and-gaps>Senator Comrie: Progress and Gaps</h3><p>Senator Leroy Comrie has taken steps. He voted yes on the <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act</strong>, a bill to force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed-limiting tech (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). He co-sponsored a bill to create a public safety rating for vehicles, shining a light on which cars are most deadly to walkers. But when it came to the &ldquo;Idaho Stop&rdquo;—a measure to let cyclists treat stop signs as yields—he stood in the way, citing concerns for seniors (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/14/pain-points-victims-of-road-violence-make-annual-pilgrimage-to-demand-safe-streets>Streetsblog NYC</a>). The city still waits for faster, broader action. <strong>Every delay means another family at risk.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. These are not accidents.</strong> Every death is a policy failure. Call Senator Comrie. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real street redesigns. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The resolution demands fare parity, no ride caps, and equal service for disabled New Yorkers. Lawmakers say current limits are unjust and restrict mobility.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0002-2022, filed at session's end, came before the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on February 10, 2022. The measure urges passage of S.4037/A.5896, which would 'extend and expand the scope of the MTA On-Demand E-Hail Paratransit Pilot Program.' Council Member Justin L. Brannan led sponsorship, joined by Ayala, Menin, Louis, Hanif, Hudson, Bottcher, Farías, Brooks-Powers, and Brewer. The resolution slams service caps and fare surcharges, calling them 'inequitable and unjust.' It demands that paratransit users get the same fare, hours, and ride freedom as subway and bus riders. The bill would end rationing and financial barriers for disabled New Yorkers who rely on Access-A-Ride. The Council’s action highlights the systemic barriers faced by vulnerable road users and presses for equal, unrestricted access.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

New laws hit drivers who hide plates or fake exemptions. The MTA loses millions to evasion. Lawmakers debate fairness and credits. Enforcement sharpens. Revenue for transit hangs in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>Bill 42, part of Governor Hochul’s 2022 executive budget, aims to enforce congestion pricing by introducing new penalties for toll evasion. The proposal, discussed in the Senate on January 20, 2022, lets the DMV deny registration to vehicles with unpaid tolls and sets fines up to $5,000 for fraudulent exemption claims. The matter summary states: 'Governor Kathy Hochul's executive budget includes several changes to New York's congestion pricing program, which is expected to provide crucial revenue for transit upgrades.' Senator James Skoufis, mentioned in the hearing, pushed for credits for certain drivers. The bill is supported by MTA spokesperson Eugene Resnick and Governor Hochul’s office, who say it will ensure fairness. The MTA reports $4 million lost annually to toll evaders. The review board will finalize fee structures and exemptions. No specific safety impact for vulnerable road users was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He wants the city to hold the line. No more carve-outs.</p><p class=mb3>On January 19, 2022, State Sen. Leroy Comrie, chair of the MTA committee, spoke at a legislative hearing on congestion pricing exemptions. The hearing addressed whether to grant more carve-outs to Manhattan’s congestion tolls. Comrie declared, 'I don't think there should be any exemptions, and I'm going to continue to say that there should be no exemptions.' He pushed back against senators seeking discounts for suburban drivers and city workers. Comrie warned that opening the door to more exemptions would undermine the law’s intent and threaten revenue for transit. He said, 'Once you open up that can of worms, you create major problems, because everybody wants to be exempted for something.' Comrie’s stance: keep the plan strict, protect transit funding, and don’t weaken congestion pricing with special favors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
