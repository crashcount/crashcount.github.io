Forty-two left with serious injuries.</strong> More than 6,000 hurt since 2022. The dead include children, elders, and workers. The living carry scars.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a 39-year-old man on a scooter was thrown to the pavement at 116th Avenue and Nashville Boulevard. He died at the hospital. Police said, &ldquo;As the van attempted to turn left onto Nashville Boulevard, it collided with the scooter, immediately propelling Lagredelle off the device&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/stand-up-scooter-rider-fatal-queens-collision/>amNY</a>). No arrests. The street stays the same.</p><p>Days later, two riders on a moped collided with a BMW in Jamaica. Both were injured. The NYPD said, &ldquo;two people were riding the moped when it collided with a BMW&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-injured-in-moped-accident-in-jamaica-queens/>CBS New York</a>). No word on charges. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the killing.</strong> In this district, they caused 7 deaths and 10 serious injuries to pedestrians. Trucks and buses killed one, left two with life-changing wounds. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes hurt and maimed, but the carnage is driven by heavy metal and speed (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=what-has-senator-comrie-done>What Has Senator Comrie Done?</h3><p>Senator Leroy Comrie has voted for bills to curb repeat speeders and extend school speed zones. He co-sponsored a bill to rate cars for pedestrian safety. He voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force the worst repeat offenders to install speed limiters. He voted yes to create more safety zones. These are steps forward, but the bodies keep coming.</p><p>Comrie also opposed the &ldquo;Idaho stop&rdquo; bill, citing concerns for seniors (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/14/pain-points-victims-of-road-violence-make-annual-pilgrimage-to-demand-safe-streets>Streetsblog NYC</a>). He supported cutting hours for Jamaica busways, a move that weakens protection for bus riders and walkers (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/11/15/city-makes-jamaica-busways-permanent-but-with-shorter-hours-begins-northern-blvd-bus-lanes>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay means another family shattered.</strong> Call Senator Comrie. Demand a 20 mph speed limit on every street. Demand action against repeat speeders. Demand streets that put people first. The dead cannot speak.

The proposal, discussed in the Senate on January 20, 2022, lets the DMV deny registration to vehicles with unpaid tolls and sets fines up to $5,000 for fraudulent exemption claims. The matter summary states: 'Governor Kathy Hochul's executive budget includes several changes to New York's congestion pricing program, which is expected to provide crucial revenue for transit upgrades.' Senator James Skoufis, mentioned in the hearing, pushed for credits for certain drivers. The bill is supported by MTA spokesperson Eugene Resnick and Governor Hochul’s office, who say it will ensure fairness. The MTA reports $4 million lost annually to toll evaders. The review board will finalize fee structures and exemptions. No specific safety impact for vulnerable road users was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Leroy Comrie, chair of the MTA committee, spoke at a legislative hearing on congestion pricing exemptions. The hearing addressed whether to grant more carve-outs to Manhattan’s congestion tolls. Comrie declared, 'I don't think there should be any exemptions, and I'm going to continue to say that there should be no exemptions.' He pushed back against senators seeking discounts for suburban drivers and city workers. Comrie warned that opening the door to more exemptions would undermine the law’s intent and threaten revenue for transit. He said, 'Once you open up that can of worms, you create major problems, because everybody wants to be exempted for something.' Comrie’s stance: keep the plan strict, protect transit funding, and don’t weaken congestion pricing with special favors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
