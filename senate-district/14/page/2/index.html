She fell hard, blood pooling, her leg torn open. The rider kept going. The street bore witness. No damage to the bike. Only flesh.</p><p class=mb3>A woman, age 54, was seriously injured on 165th Street near Jamaica Avenue in Queens when an e-bike rider making a right turn struck her as she stepped down from a car, according to the police report. The report states the e-bike 'did not stop' and that the rider 'kept going.' The woman suffered severe lacerations to her lower leg, with blood visible on the pavement. The police report identifies 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as the sole contributing factor, explicitly attributing the crash to the e-bike rider's actions. The victim was not at an intersection and was in the process of getting on or off a vehicle when struck. No damage was reported to the e-bike. The narrative centers the impact and aftermath, underscoring the consequences of driver error.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
