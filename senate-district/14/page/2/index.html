A woman crosses at dusk. In Senate District 14, the story repeats. <strong>Nine dead in the last year. Eighteen left with injuries so grave they may never walk the same.</strong> Over 2,000 hurt. These are not numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/stand-up-scooter-rider-fatal-queens-collision/>39-year-old man on a scooter was struck and killed</a> at 116th Avenue and Nashville Boulevard. The van turned left. He never got up. Police said, “As the van attempted to turn left onto Nashville Boulevard, it collided with the scooter, immediately propelling Lagredelle off the device.” [amny, 2025-06-30]</p><p>On July 11, an <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/8-hurt-in-queens-bus-crash/>MTA bus slammed into a pole in Queens</a>. Eight people hurt. Metal and glass. The bus did not stop for anyone.</p><p><strong>In the last twelve months, cars and SUVs have done most of the damage:</strong> eight dead, over 800 injured. Trucks and buses, motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes all add to the toll. No street is safe. No hour is sacred.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-the-long-road-ahead>Leadership: Progress and the Long Road Ahead</h3><p>State Senator Leroy Comrie has moved. He <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>co-sponsored the Stop Super Speeders Act</a> and voted yes in committee. The bill would force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. He also <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>backed the extension of school speed zones</a>, a small shield for children on foot.</p><p>But the work is not done. Comrie has <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/14/pain-points-victims-of-road-violence-make-annual-pilgrimage-to-demand-safe-streets>opposed the &ldquo;Idaho stop&rdquo; bill</a>, which would let cyclists treat stop signs as yields. He cited concerns for seniors. The debate drags on while the street claims more.</p><h3 id=the-next-fight-demand-relentless-action>The Next Fight: Demand Relentless Action</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable. Every death is a failure.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits. The state can rein in repeat offenders. But power unused is as deadly as a car left in drive.</p><p><strong>Call Senator Comrie. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph citywide speed limit. Demand action on the Stop Super Speeders Act.</strong> The cost of waiting is counted in bodies.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
