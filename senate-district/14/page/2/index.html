Both died where they stood. A witness said the car &ldquo;slammed into the men&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-pedestrians-1-driver-killed-when-car-slams-into-food-truck-in-queens/>that morning</a>. The street was quiet again by noon, but the families were not.</p><p>A week before, an MTA bus crashed into a pole. Eight people were hurt. The news called it a bus that &ldquo;slammed into a light pole and ticket machine&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/8-hurt-in-queens-bus-crash/>in Queens</a>. No one died that day. Not all are so lucky.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>9 people have died</strong> on the roads of SD 14. <strong>2,400 have been injured.</strong> Nineteen were left with injuries so severe they will never be the same. The dead include children, elders, and people just trying to cross the street. The numbers do not stop. They only rise.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> In this district, they killed 7 people and injured over 900 more. Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left others broken, but the weight of the carnage falls on drivers behind the wheel of cars and SUVs <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>according to NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>The faces change. The pattern does not. Pedestrians and cyclists are struck at intersections, on parkways, near homes. The street does not care if you are young or old. It only takes.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>State Senator Leroy Comrie has voted for bills to curb repeat speeders. He co-sponsored the &ldquo;Stop Super Speeders Act,&rdquo; which would force the worst offenders to install speed limiters after too many violations <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>according to Open States</a>. He voted to extend school speed zones, a step that protects children but leaves many streets unchanged.</p><p>But Comrie has also stood in the way of progress. He opposed the &ldquo;Idaho Stop&rdquo; bill, which would have let cyclists treat stop signs as yields, citing concerns for seniors <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/14/pain-points-victims-of-road-violence-make-annual-pilgrimage-to-demand-safe-streets>as reported by Streetsblog NYC</a>. He supported cutting hours for busways, making it harder for riders to get home safe <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/11/15/city-makes-jamaica-busways-permanent-but-with-shorter-hours-begins-northern-blvd-bus-lanes>according to Streetsblog NYC</a>. The work is not done. The blood is not dry.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by leaders who act or do not act. Call Senator Comrie. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people on foot and on bikes. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p><p><strong>The street remembers. So should we.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Queens Borough President Donovan Richards, once critical, now supports the draft after public outreach.
