A moped, crushed by a BMW. A 76-year-old woman, killed in the back seat on the Cross Island Parkway. In the last twelve months, nine people have died and over 2,000 have been injured in crashes across Senate District 14. Fifteen suffered serious injuries. These are lives cut short, families left with empty chairs.</p><p>Just weeks ago, Shaun Lagredelle was riding his scooter on 116th Avenue. A van turned left. The collision threw him off. He died at the hospital. Police said, <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/stand-up-scooter-rider-fatal-queens-collision/>&ldquo;As the van attempted to turn left onto Nashville Boulevard, it collided with the scooter, immediately propelling Lagredelle off the device before he hit the ground&rdquo;</a>. No arrests. The investigation drags on.</p><p>On June 29, two people riding a moped collided with a BMW in Jamaica. Both were injured. The NYPD said only, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-injured-in-moped-accident-in-jamaica-queens/>&ldquo;two people were riding the moped when it collided with a BMW&rdquo;</a>. No word on charges. No word on change.</p><h3 id=the-system-favors-speed-not-safety>The System Favors Speed, Not Safety</h3><p>Cars and SUVs do the most harm. In the past three years, they killed seven and injured hundreds of pedestrians. Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll. The dead include the old, the young, the ones just trying to cross the street.</p><h3 id=what-has-senator-comrie-done>What Has Senator Comrie Done?</h3><p>Senator Leroy Comrie has <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>voted for safer street design</a>—he backed a bill to require complete streets for all users. He co-sponsored a bill for public pedestrian safety ratings on cars. He also sponsored a &ldquo;yellow alert&rdquo; system to help catch hit-and-run drivers. But when it came to the &ldquo;Idaho stop&rdquo; bill, which would have given cyclists safer options at intersections, Comrie opposed it, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/14/pain-points-victims-of-road-violence-make-annual-pilgrimage-to-demand-safe-streets>citing concerns for seniors</a>.</p><p>The pace of change is slow. Each delay means another family waits for news that never comes. Each compromise leaves the most vulnerable exposed.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-demand-it-now>Call to Action: Demand More, Demand It Now</h3><p>Contact Senator Comrie. Contact your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people on foot, on bikes, on scooters. The dead cannot speak. You can. The time for waiting is over.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Rollout not before 2025.</p><p class=mb3>The MTA’s Queens Bus Network Redesign, announced December 12, 2023, proposes $30 million in service upgrades and expands local routes from 83 to 91. The plan, under review since 2020, aims to boost 10-minute-or-better service for 200,000 more residents, raising coverage from 60.1% to 68.9%. The official summary states the redesign will 'streamline and speed up service.' Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers voiced 'serious concerns' about disadvantages for her district, especially with congestion pricing. Queens Borough President Donovan Richards, once critical, now supports the draft after public outreach. State Senator Leroy Comrie noted Brooks-Powers wants clarity for her community, not outright rejection. The redesign awaits further input and is expected no sooner than 2025. No safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
