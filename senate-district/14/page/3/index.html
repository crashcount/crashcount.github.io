A moped, crushed by a BMW. A 76-year-old woman, killed in the back seat on the Cross Island Parkway. In the last twelve months, nine people have died and over 2,000 have been injured in crashes across Senate District 14. Fifteen suffered serious injuries. These are lives cut short, families left with empty chairs.</p><p>Just weeks ago, Shaun Lagredelle was riding his scooter on 116th Avenue. A van turned left. The collision threw him off. He died at the hospital. Police said, <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/stand-up-scooter-rider-fatal-queens-collision/>&ldquo;As the van attempted to turn left onto Nashville Boulevard, it collided with the scooter, immediately propelling Lagredelle off the device before he hit the ground&rdquo;</a>. No arrests. The investigation drags on.</p><p>On June 29, two people riding a moped collided with a BMW in Jamaica. Both were injured. The NYPD said only, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-injured-in-moped-accident-in-jamaica-queens/>&ldquo;two people were riding the moped when it collided with a BMW&rdquo;</a>. No word on charges. No word on change.</p><h3 id=the-system-favors-speed-not-safety>The System Favors Speed, Not Safety</h3><p>Cars and SUVs do the most harm. In the past three years, they killed seven and injured hundreds of pedestrians. Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll. The dead include the old, the young, the ones just trying to cross the street.</p><h3 id=what-has-senator-comrie-done>What Has Senator Comrie Done?</h3><p>Senator Leroy Comrie has <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>voted for safer street design</a>—he backed a bill to require complete streets for all users. He co-sponsored a bill for public pedestrian safety ratings on cars. He also sponsored a &ldquo;yellow alert&rdquo; system to help catch hit-and-run drivers. But when it came to the &ldquo;Idaho stop&rdquo; bill, which would have given cyclists safer options at intersections, Comrie opposed it, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/14/pain-points-victims-of-road-violence-make-annual-pilgrimage-to-demand-safe-streets>citing concerns for seniors</a>.</p><p>The pace of change is slow. Each delay means another family waits for news that never comes. Each compromise leaves the most vulnerable exposed.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-demand-it-now>Call to Action: Demand More, Demand It Now</h3><p>Contact Senator Comrie. Contact your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people on foot, on bikes, on scooters. The dead cannot speak. You can. The time for waiting is over.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Department of Transportation cut Jamaica Avenue’s busway hours from 24/7 to 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily, while Archer Avenue remains round-the-clock. The Northern Boulevard bus lane project, stalled for months after Council Member Francisco Moya lobbied against it, finally began installation.

Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and other local officials pushed for even shorter hours. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez defended the busways, saying, 'strong bus infrastructure is a necessity.' Despite opposition, the city kept some busway hours intact, but caved to business interests, reducing protection for bus riders and vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled "#StuckAtDOT: It Takes Years (and Years) to Get a Speed Hump in this City," details Joseph’s frustration: 'In response to a speed hump request, my office was informed by the DOT that...studies are finalized after two years.' Joseph listed twelve locations needing speed humps; only one was approved, none installed. Eight were denied, several remain under review. Her district saw 1,173 crashes this year, injuring 87 cyclists and 141 pedestrians. Joseph, who lost students to traffic violence, calls the delay 'unacceptable.' DOT says it is reviewing her letter. Advocates demand faster action, saying, 'It should never take two years to implement these straight-forward safety measures.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
