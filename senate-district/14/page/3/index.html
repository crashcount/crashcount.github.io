He died there, age 39. The van that hit him was turning left. Police said, &ldquo;as the van attempted to turn left onto Nashville Boulevard, it collided with the scooter, immediately propelling Lagredelle off the device&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/stand-up-scooter-rider-fatal-queens-collision/>amny</a>). No arrest. The street stayed open. The city moved on.</p><p>Two days later, two people on a moped collided with a BMW in Jamaica. Both were hurt. The NYPD said, &ldquo;two people were riding the moped when it collided with a BMW&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-injured-in-moped-accident-in-jamaica-queens/>CBS New York</a>). No word on charges. No word on changes.</p><p>In the last twelve months, SD 14 saw <strong>9 deaths</strong> and over <strong>2,000 injuries</strong> from crashes. <strong>Eighteen people were seriously hurt</strong>. The dead include children, elders, and people just trying to cross the street.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p>The numbers are blunt. Cars and SUVs killed <strong>7 people</strong> and injured hundreds more. Trucks and buses killed at least one. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left others broken. Pedestrians and cyclists take the worst of it. The streets do not forgive mistakes. The city does not fix what is broken.</p><h2 id=senator-comrie-action-and-silence>Senator Comrie: Action and Silence</h2><p>State Senator Leroy Comrie has voted for bills that matter. He co-sponsored and voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act, a law that would force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed limiters (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). He also backed the extension of school speed zones. These votes save lives. But Comrie has also opposed the &ldquo;Idaho stop&rdquo; bill, which would have let cyclists treat stop signs as yields, citing concerns for seniors (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/14/pain-points-victims-of-road-violence-make-annual-pilgrimage-to-demand-safe-streets>Streetsblog NYC</a>). He supported cutting hours for busways in Jamaica, making transit slower for those who need it most (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/11/15/city-makes-jamaica-busways-permanent-but-with-shorter-hours-begins-northern-blvd-bus-lanes>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p><strong>Every delay, every watered-down law, every hour lost to traffic is another risk for the people who walk, ride, or wait for a bus.</strong></p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>Call Senator Comrie.

The Department of Transportation cut Jamaica Avenue’s busway hours from 24/7 to 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily, while Archer Avenue remains round-the-clock. The Northern Boulevard bus lane project, stalled for months after Council Member Francisco Moya lobbied against it, finally began installation. Council Members Nantasha Williams and Selvena Brooks-Powers opposed the busways, calling for their elimination and citing business concerns. Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and other local officials pushed for even shorter hours. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez defended the busways, saying, 'strong bus infrastructure is a necessity.' Despite opposition, the city kept some busway hours intact, but caved to business interests, reducing protection for bus riders and vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
