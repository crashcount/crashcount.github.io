He voted yes on a bill to require <strong>complete street design</strong>—roads built for people, not just cars (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>Senate Bill S 9718</a>). He co-sponsored a bill for a <strong>yellow alert system</strong> to help catch hit-and-run drivers (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4946>S 4946</a>). He also backed a bill to rate cars for pedestrian safety (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S1675>S 1675</a>).</p><p>But when it came to the &ldquo;Idaho stop&rdquo; bill, which would let cyclists treat stop signs as yields, Comrie said no. He cited concerns for seniors, but the law would have made streets safer for people on bikes (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/14/pain-points-victims-of-road-violence-make-annual-pilgrimage-to-demand-safe-streets>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><h3 id=the-work-is-not-done>The Work Is Not Done</h3><p><strong>Every delay means more blood on the street.</strong> The dead cannot speak.
