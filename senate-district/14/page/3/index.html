A car keeps going. On December 25, a 45-year-old woman was killed at 158th Street and 111th Avenue. She was crossing at the intersection. The driver did not see her. She died in the street. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a>.</p><p>A week later, a 21-year-old man died on Laurelton Parkway. The cause: unsafe speed. He did not make it home for the holiday. The car was demolished. The road was quiet again. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a>.</p><p>In June, a scooter rider named Shaun Lagredelle was thrown from his scooter when a van turned left into him. He died at the hospital. Police said, <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/stand-up-scooter-rider-fatal-queens-collision/>&ldquo;As the van attempted to turn left onto Nashville Boulevard, it collided with the scooter, immediately propelling Lagredelle off the device.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>In the last 12 months, 8 people have died and 16 have been seriously injured in SD 14.</strong> Over 1,800 have been hurt.

Since 2022, there have been <strong>22 deaths and 40 serious injuries</strong> in this district. Cars and SUVs did most of the killing. Trucks, buses, and motorcycles added to the toll. Pedestrians and cyclists are the ones who pay. The stories repeat: unsafe speed, inattention, a turn not yielded.</p><p>A Queens driver dragged a man three blocks after a hit-and-run. The District Attorney <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/03/queens-hit-and-run-crash-arrest-murder-warren-rollins-gary-charlotin/>called it</a> &ldquo;a complete disregard for human life.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=what-has-senator-comrie-done>What Has Senator Comrie Done?</h2><p>Senator Leroy Comrie has voted for safer street design. He backed a bill to require <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>complete streets</a> for all users, not just drivers. He also co-sponsored a bill to create a pedestrian safety rating system for cars. He sponsored a &ldquo;yellow alert&rdquo; bill to help catch hit-and-run drivers. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>See his record</a>.</p><p>But Comrie opposed the &ldquo;Idaho stop&rdquo; bill, which would have let cyclists treat stop signs as yields. He said it was out of concern for seniors. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/14/pain-points-victims-of-road-violence-make-annual-pilgrimage-to-demand-safe-streets>Comrie&rsquo;s statement</a>.</p><p><strong>The work is not done.</strong> The dead keep coming. The streets are not safe. The laws are not enough.</p><h2 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h2><p><strong>Call Senator Comrie. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit.

Some want carve-outs. Others warn exemptions gut the plan. Vulnerable road users wait as drivers fight for special treatment. The final call lands with the Traffic Mobility Review Board.</p><p class=mb3>On August 26, 2022, the council held a public debate on congestion pricing exemptions. The matter, titled 'Everyone’s Suddenly Open To Some Congestion Pricing Exemptions,' drew sharp lines. State Senator Leroy Comrie, once a hardliner against exemptions, now listens to public input. Assembly Member Robert Carroll backs limited carve-outs, saying, 'I think that there should be limited exemptions.' State Senator Andrew Gounardes stresses, 'Obviously we want them to be as limited as possible.' Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine pushes for toll credits and taxi exemptions. Advocacy groups warn against broad carve-outs. The Traffic Mobility Review Board will decide after federal review. The debate centers on who pays and who gets a pass, while the safety of people outside cars hangs in the balance.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
