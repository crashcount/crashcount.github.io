Since 2022, <strong>23 people have died</strong> and <strong>6,160 have been injured</strong> in crashes. <strong>Forty-two suffered serious injuries</strong>—the kind that end a life even if the heart keeps beating. The dead include children, elders, and people just trying to cross the street. The numbers do not rest. In the last year alone, deaths jumped by two-thirds and serious injuries soared fourteen-fold.</p><p>Last month, a 39-year-old man on a scooter was thrown to the pavement at 116th Avenue and Nashville Boulevard. He died in the street. Police said, &ldquo;As the van attempted to turn left onto Nashville Boulevard, it collided with the scooter, immediately propelling Lagredelle off the device&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/stand-up-scooter-rider-fatal-queens-collision/>amNY</a>). Days later, two moped riders collided with a BMW in Jamaica. Both were injured. The NYPD said, &ldquo;two people were riding the moped when it collided with a BMW&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-injured-in-moped-accident-in-jamaica-queens/>CBS New York</a>).</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-risk>Who Bears the Risk</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> In this district, they killed 7, seriously injured 10, and hurt hundreds more. Trucks and buses killed 1, seriously injured 2. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left more bodies and broken bones. The street is not safe for anyone without steel around them.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h3><p>Senator Leroy Comrie has moved on some fronts. He <strong>voted yes</strong> on the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed limiters (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). He also backed the extension of school speed zones. But when it came to the Idaho Stop bill—a measure to let cyclists treat stop signs as yields—he stood against it, citing concerns for seniors (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/14/pain-points-victims-of-road-violence-make-annual-pilgrimage-to-demand-safe-streets>Streetsblog NYC</a>). He has supported busway hour reductions, which means less protection for bus riders and those on foot (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/11/15/city-makes-jamaica-busways-permanent-but-with-shorter-hours-begins-northern-blvd-bus-lanes>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p><strong>The crisis is not over.</strong> The bodies keep coming. The numbers keep rising. The policies are not enough.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Call Senator Comrie. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand full protection for vulnerable road users. Demand action, not delay.</strong> Every day of waiting is another day of blood on the street.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Northern Boulevard bus lane project, stalled for months after Council Member Francisco Moya lobbied against it, finally began installation. Council Members Nantasha Williams and Selvena Brooks-Powers opposed the busways, calling for their elimination and citing business concerns. Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and other local officials pushed for even shorter hours. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez defended the busways, saying, 'strong bus infrastructure is a necessity.' Despite opposition, the city kept some busway hours intact, but caved to business interests, reducing protection for bus riders and vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Her district saw 1,173 crashes this year, injuring 87 cyclists and 141 pedestrians. Joseph, who lost students to traffic violence, calls the delay 'unacceptable.' DOT says it is reviewing her letter.
