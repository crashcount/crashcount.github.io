Seventeen seriously hurt.</strong> In the past year, Senate District 14 has seen 2,801 crashes. These are not just numbers—they are bodies on Linden Boulevard, 116th Avenue, and Nashville Boulevard. On June 26, Shaun Lagredelle, 39, rode his scooter west on 116th. A van turned left. Lagredelle was thrown to the ground and died at the hospital. Police said, &ldquo;As the van attempted to turn left onto Nashville Boulevard, it collided with the scooter, immediately propelling Lagredelle off the device&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/stand-up-scooter-rider-fatal-queens-collision/>police said</a>).</p><p>A few days later, two moped riders collided with a BMW in Jamaica. Both were injured. No charges. No answers. The street stays the same (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-injured-in-moped-accident-in-jamaica-queens/>moped riders collided</a>).</p><p><strong>Pedestrians are not spared.</strong> In April, Christopher Gayton, 62, was crossing Linden Boulevard. A black car hit him and fled. Another car ran him over. He died the next day.

Trucks, bikes, and mopeds trail far behind. The pattern is clear: the danger is not random.</p><p>Senator Leroy Comrie has taken steps. He voted yes on a bill to require safer street designs for all users (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>voted yes on a bill</a>). He co-sponsors bills for pedestrian safety ratings and a yellow alert system to catch hit-and-run drivers. But when it comes to the &ldquo;Idaho stop&rdquo;—a law that would let cyclists treat stop signs as yield—he stood in the way, citing concerns for seniors (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/14/pain-points-victims-of-road-violence-make-annual-pilgrimage-to-demand-safe-streets>stood in the way</a>). The streets remain dangerous for those on foot and on wheels.</p><h3 id=the-call-no-more-waiting>The Call: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another family shattered.</strong> &ldquo;This was a horrific death for the victim,&rdquo; said Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz after a driver dragged a pedestrian three blocks before fleeing (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/03/queens-hit-and-run-crash-arrest-murder-warren-rollins-gary-charlotin/>said Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz</a>). The system is slow. The blood dries. The danger stays.</p><p><strong>Call Senator Comrie. Demand faster action.</strong> Tell him: safer street design, lower speed limits, and real protection for people outside cars. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.
