Sixteen left with injuries that will not heal.</strong> In the last year alone, SD 14 saw 2,841 crashes. These are not just numbers—they are broken bodies and empty chairs. A 62-year-old man tried to cross Linden Boulevard. A car hit him. The driver fled. Another car ran him over. He died the next day. His family said, &ldquo;Today is a sad day. We lost a brother, father, son, uncle, and cousin.

Two pedestrians were killed by SUVs. Two more by sedans. Trucks and bikes left others bleeding. The road does not care how old you are or how careful. It only cares how fast and heavy the next car is.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Senator Leroy Comrie has moved on some fronts. He voted yes on a bill to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>force streets to be built for everyone</a>, not just cars. He co-sponsored a bill to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S1675>rate cars for how deadly they are to people on foot</a>. He pushed for a <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4946>&ldquo;yellow alert&rdquo; system to catch hit-and-run drivers</a>.</p><p>But when it came time to back the &ldquo;Idaho stop&rdquo;—a law that would let cyclists treat stop signs as yields, proven to keep them safer—Comrie said no. He <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/14/pain-points-victims-of-road-violence-make-annual-pilgrimage-to-demand-safe-streets>cited worries for seniors</a>. The streets remain the same. The danger does not yield.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay means another family waits for a call that will break them.</strong> The city drags its feet on speed humps and safe crossings. &ldquo;It should never take two years to implement these straight-forward safety measures,&rdquo; said a councilmember <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/11/11/stuckatdot-it-takes-years-and-years-to-get-a-speed-hump-in-this-city/#new_tab>fighting for her own district</a>.</p><p><strong>The crisis is not fate. It is policy.</strong></p><h3 id=act-nowor-count-the-bodies>Act Now—Or Count the Bodies</h3><p>Call Senator Comrie. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras that never go dark. Demand streets built for people, not just cars. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Northern Boulevard bus lane project, stalled for months after Council Member Francisco Moya lobbied against it, finally began installation. Council Members Nantasha Williams and Selvena Brooks-Powers opposed the busways, calling for their elimination and citing business concerns. Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and other local officials pushed for even shorter hours. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez defended the busways, saying, 'strong bus infrastructure is a necessity.'

Joseph listed twelve locations needing speed humps; only one was approved, none installed. Eight were denied, several remain under review. Her district saw 1,173 crashes this year, injuring 87 cyclists and 141 pedestrians. Joseph, who lost students to traffic violence, calls the delay 'unacceptable.' DOT says it is reviewing her letter.

The discussion, covered by Streetsblog NYC, highlighted shifting positions. State Senator Leroy Comrie, once opposed to exemptions, now listens to public input. Assembly Member Robert Carroll said, "I think that there should be limited exemptions." State Senator Andrew Gounardes added, "Obviously we want them to be as limited as possible." Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine backed toll credits for tunnel users and taxi exemptions. Taxi and for-hire drivers lobbied for relief, citing existing surcharges. Advocacy groups warned against broad carve-outs. The Traffic Mobility Review Board will decide on further exemptions after federal review. No direct safety impact for vulnerable road users was assessed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
