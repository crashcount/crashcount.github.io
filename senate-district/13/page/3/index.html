Since 2022, 21 people have died in crashes here. Thirty-eight more suffered serious injuries. These are not just numbers—they are lives cut short, families broken, futures erased. In the last twelve months alone, three people died and thirteen were left with life-altering wounds.</p><p>Children are not spared. On March 13, 2024, an 8-year-old boy was crushed by a turning truck while crossing with the light at 100th Street and 31st Avenue. He did everything right. The driver did not.</p><p>On May 26, 2025, a driver in an SUV ran a red light on 37th Avenue and struck two little girls, ages four and eight, as they crossed in the crosswalk. The driver fled. The girls survived, but the scars will last. Police said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/two-little-girls-4-and-8-struck-by-driver-who-blew-red-light-in-queens/>&ldquo;The SUV driver fled after the collision and remains on the loose.&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=repeat-offenders-deadly-consequences>Repeat Offenders, Deadly Consequences</h3><p>Speed and recklessness are not rare. They are routine. On February 26, 2025, an off-duty firefighter, drunk and high, drove 83 mph in a 25 mph zone, ran a red light, and killed 23-year-old Justin Diaz. Diaz was driving to work. His brother said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/27/justin-diaz-queens-bmw-driver-michael-pena-drunk-speeding-mercedes-fdny-firefighter-crash/>&ldquo;Justin will never walk the streets again.&rdquo;</a></p><p>The driver had a record: 25 prior school zone speeding tickets. Still, he was free to drive. Still, the system failed.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-gaps>Leadership: Action and Gaps</h3><p>State Senator Jessica Ramos has taken steps. She co-sponsored and voted for the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, which would force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting devices. She <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/queens-parents-struggle-to-get-crossing-guards-after-2-students-killed-in-traffic>called for more crossing guards</a> after children were killed and pushed for daylighting and protected bike lanes. But the carnage continues. Enforcement lags. Promises are slow. The most dangerous drivers remain on the road.</p><h3 id=the-call-demand-more-demand-it-now>The Call: Demand More, Demand It Now</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call Senator Ramos. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real consequences for repeat offenders. Demand streets where children can cross without fear. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On September 27, 2024, State Senator Jessica Ramos, representing Queens District 13, called for urgent action after two students were killed in traffic near P.S. 127. The matter, titled 'Queens parents struggle to get crossing guards after 2 students killed in traffic,' highlights a dire shortage: only 1,500 crossing guards citywide, down from 2,600 in 2019. Ramos supports a bill mandating a crossing guard at every school corner and urges investment in pedestrian scrambles, daylighting, and congestion reduction. She said, 'You would think that this is one of the most basic ways to protect the safety of our children. And yet that seems like an insurmountable task.' Ramos’s advocacy comes as parents face bureaucratic stonewalling and city officials offer piecemeal fixes. The city’s measures—stop signs, bollards, and cement blocks—fall short. Ramos demands full funding and systemic change to protect children on their way to school.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The 21-year-old moped rider suffered severe facial injuries and heavy bleeding after his face hit the sedan’s glass. The police report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the primary contributing factor in the crash. Both vehicles were reportedly traveling straight before the impact, with the moped hitting the center front end and the sedan absorbing the blow on its right side doors. The report notes the moped rider wore no helmet, but this detail is mentioned only after the cited driver error. The crash left the rider conscious but bloodied, underscoring the relentless danger posed by distraction and inattention on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

At arraignment, Barcia was released without surrendering his license. The Queens District Attorney’s office did not seek revocation. State Sen. Jessica Ramos led a rally, citing 'reckless drivers who refuse to yield to pedestrians' and called for stronger pedestrian safety, saying, 'driving is a privilege that can, and should be, taken away.' Adam White, a lawyer for crash victims, said the DA should have insisted Barcia not drive. The rally highlighted rising road deaths—48 killed citywide in early 2024—and called out the city’s failure to protect its most vulnerable.

Barcia faces charges of criminally negligent homicide, failure to yield, failure to exercise due care, and speeding. State Senator Jessica Ramos responded, calling for passage of 'Sammy's Law' to let the city set its own speed limits. Ramos said, 'I fight so hard for improved public transit because there are too many cars on the road, particularly SUVs and pickup trucks that do not allow for full visibility in city streets.' She urged fewer cars, especially large vehicles, and stressed the need for pedestrian safety in the budget. 31st Avenue, where the crash happened, saw 74 crashes and 47 injuries last year, far more than nearby, mostly car-free 34th Avenue.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident, reported by Streetsblog NYC, highlights a surge in pedestrian deaths—nineteen so far this year, with injuries up 2.6 percent. Councilmember Jessica Ramos, referencing two children recently hit in her district, called for scramble crosswalks outside schools and demanded urgent attention to street safety: 'I can’t keep getting calls like this.' Transportation Alternatives condemned the Department of Transportation for installing only two Leading Pedestrian Intervals on Glenwood Road since 2014, despite repeated fatalities. The group urged elected leaders to act now to prevent more deaths. The bill or action is not numbered, but the event underscores systemic failures and the urgent need for citywide safety improvements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
