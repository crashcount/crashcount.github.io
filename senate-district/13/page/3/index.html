The report states, 'A Lexus veered into two parked sedans. Metal tore. A 33-year-old man slumped behind the wheel, lap belt tight, head struck. Evening light caught the silence. He did not move again.' The sole occupant and driver, a 33-year-old man, suffered fatal head injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene. Police identified 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the primary contributing factor. The parked vehicles, a Kia and a Honda, were unoccupied at the time.

An eight-year-old boy was crossing at the intersection with the pedestrian signal when the truck’s right front bumper struck him. The report states the child suffered crush injuries to his entire body and died at the scene. The police report explicitly cites 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as contributing factors. The boy was crossing with the signal, as documented in the report. The driver’s failure to yield during a left turn directly led to the fatal collision. The report centers the driver’s actions as the primary cause of this deadly crash.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The avenue is a known danger.</p><p class=mb3>On March 13, 2024, in East Elmhurst, Queens, a pickup truck driver killed 8-year-old Bayron Palomino Arroyo and injured his 10-year-old brother as they crossed 100th Street. The driver, Jose Barcia, rushed a left turn from 31st Avenue and struck the children, according to NYPD Chief of Transportation Philip Rivera. Barcia faces charges of criminally negligent homicide, failure to yield, failure to exercise due care, and speeding. State Senator Jessica Ramos responded, calling for passage of 'Sammy's Law' to let the city set its own speed limits. Ramos said, 'I fight so hard for improved public transit because there are too many cars on the road, particularly SUVs and pickup trucks that do not allow for full visibility in city streets.' She urged fewer cars, especially large vehicles, and stressed the need for pedestrian safety in the budget. 31st Avenue, where the crash happened, saw 74 crashes and 47 injuries last year, far more than nearby, mostly car-free 34th Avenue.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states: 'A 23-year-old man, rear seat of a 2015 Nissan SUV, was thrown from the car. Head shattered. Body twisted. The SUV rolled on, untouched. He never woke up.' The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified.' The vehicle sustained no damage and continued moving after the passenger was ejected. The victim suffered fatal head injuries and was found unconscious. No driver errors are specified in the report, but the ejection and death of a rear seat passenger underscore the lethal risks present for vehicle occupants. The report does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The report states the SUV was traveling at an 'Unsafe Speed.' The narrative describes the vehicle coming fast, with the impact causing fatal injuries to the pedestrian, who died before emergency responders arrived. The police report lists 'Unsafe Speed' as the contributing factor for the driver. The report also notes the pedestrian was 'Crossing Against Signal,' but this is mentioned only after the driver’s excessive speed is cited. The collision underscores the lethal consequences when drivers operate at unsafe speeds, especially at intersections where pedestrians are present.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The incident, reported by Streetsblog NYC, highlights a surge in pedestrian deaths—nineteen so far this year, with injuries up 2.6 percent. Councilmember Jessica Ramos, referencing two children recently hit in her district, called for scramble crosswalks outside schools and demanded urgent attention to street safety: 'I can’t keep getting calls like this.' Transportation Alternatives condemned the Department of Transportation for installing only two Leading Pedestrian Intervals on Glenwood Road since 2014, despite repeated fatalities. The group urged elected leaders to act now to prevent more deaths. The bill or action is not numbered, but the event underscores systemic failures and the urgent need for citywide safety improvements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
