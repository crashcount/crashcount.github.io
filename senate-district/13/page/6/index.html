Fifteen left with life-changing injuries.</strong> In the last year alone, the streets of Senate District 13 have not let up. The numbers are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, children. Just this July, a 24-year-old motorcyclist died on the Long Island Expressway. He hit an SUV, was thrown into the road, and was run over by another driver who did not stop. Police said, &ldquo;A 24-year-old motorcyclist was killed&mldr; when he crashed into an SUV and was then run over by a driver who did not remain at the scene&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/28/kahyl-pena-queens-motorcyclist-24-dies-crash-long-island-expressway-lie-involving-2-drivers/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>In February, a drunk off-duty firefighter sped through a red light at 83 mph and killed a 23-year-old man on his way to work. The District Attorney said, &ldquo;An FDNY firefighter who was off duty is accused of driving under the influence, running a steady red light and slamming into a 23-year-old motorist, killing him, as he drove more than three times the posted speed limit&mldr; Our shared roadways are not a racetrack&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/off-duty-firefighter-arraigned-man-charged-allegedly-speeding-red-light-hitting-killing-driver-another-vehicle/15961421/>ABC7</a>).</p><p><strong>Children are not spared.</strong> In May, two little girls, ages 4 and 8, were hit in a crosswalk by an SUV that ran a red light.

Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds left dozens hurt. The pattern is clear. The danger is not random. It is built into the streets, the laws, and the lack of enforcement.</p><h3 id=what-has-senator-ramos-done>What Has Senator Ramos Done?</h3><p>State Senator Jessica Ramos has taken steps. She co-sponsored and voted for the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). She has called for more crossing guards, safer street design, and bus lanes. She said, &ldquo;You would think that this is one of the most basic ways to protect the safety of our children. And yet that seems like an insurmountable task&rdquo; (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/queens-parents-struggle-to-get-crossing-guards-after-2-students-killed-in-traffic>Gothamist</a>).</p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The fixes are slow. The streets do not forgive delay.</p><h3 id=act-now-demand-action>Act Now: Demand Action</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call Senator Ramos. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat offenders. Demand safe crossings at every school.</strong></p><p>Every day of delay is another family broken.
