Thirty-eight seriously injured.</strong> In three and a half years, 6,785 crashes tore through Jackson Heights, East Elmhurst, North Corona, and Corona. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. A child crossing with the light, crushed by a turning truck. A young man, Justin Diaz, killed on his way to work by a driver who ran a red at 83 miles per hour. His father said, “His life continues, no matter how much prison time he gets. My son Justin will no longer have a future.” <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/deadly-queens-crash-michael-pena-justin-diaz/>CBS New York</a>.</p><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> Trucks, motorcycles, and bikes add to the toll. The street is a gauntlet. The crosswalk is not safe. The numbers are not just numbers. They are families left with empty chairs.</p><h2 id=leadership-what-ramos-has-done>Leadership: What Ramos Has Done</h2><p>Senator Jessica Ramos has not been silent. She voted yes on bills to force safer street design <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>S 9718</a> and to require speed limiters for repeat offenders <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>. She called for a citywide strategy that puts safety through design first, not more blame on those walking or biking. She pledged 200 miles of protected bike lanes and closing network gaps <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/06/decision-2025-mayoral-candidates-answer-question-3>Streetsblog NYC</a>. She has demanded license revocation for reckless drivers and fully funded crossing guards.</p><p>But the carnage continues. <strong>Every delay, every loophole, every day without action means another family shattered.</strong></p><h2 id=the-next-fight-no-more-waiting>The Next Fight: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Speed kills.</strong> A pedestrian hit at 30 mph is five times more likely to die than at 20. The city can lower speed limits now. Cameras that catch speeders and red-light runners are proven to save lives, but need constant defense in Albany. The work is not done. As Queens DA Melinda Katz said, “Drunk, drugged and reckless driving are dire threats to everyone on our shared roadways.” <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/off-duty-firefighter-arraigned-man-charged-allegedly-speeding-red-light-hitting-killing-driver-another-vehicle/15961421/>ABC7</a></p><p><strong>Call your council member.

The incident occurred when a drunk driver struck and killed a scooter rider on 37th Avenue, a Vision Zero priority corridor in Queens. The official matter summary reads: 'Alleged Queens drunk driver in custody after fatal collision with scooter rider.' Ramos urged residents, 'Please do your part to keep our neighbors safe,' and condemned drunk driving. Councilmember Shekar Krishnan called the death 'senseless.' Despite five pedestrian deaths on this stretch in the past decade, major safety improvements have not been made.
