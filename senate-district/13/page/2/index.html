Thirty-eight seriously injured.</strong> In three and a half years, 6,785 crashes tore through Jackson Heights, East Elmhurst, North Corona, and Corona. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. A child crossing with the light, crushed by a turning truck. A young man, Justin Diaz, killed on his way to work by a driver who ran a red at 83 miles per hour. His father said, “His life continues, no matter how much prison time he gets. My son Justin will no longer have a future.” <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/deadly-queens-crash-michael-pena-justin-diaz/>CBS New York</a>.</p><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> Trucks, motorcycles, and bikes add to the toll. The street is a gauntlet. The crosswalk is not safe. The numbers are not just numbers. They are families left with empty chairs.</p><h2 id=leadership-what-ramos-has-done>Leadership: What Ramos Has Done</h2><p>Senator Jessica Ramos has not been silent. She voted yes on bills to force safer street design <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>S 9718</a> and to require speed limiters for repeat offenders <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>. She called for a citywide strategy that puts safety through design first, not more blame on those walking or biking. She pledged 200 miles of protected bike lanes and closing network gaps <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/06/decision-2025-mayoral-candidates-answer-question-3>Streetsblog NYC</a>. She has demanded license revocation for reckless drivers and fully funded crossing guards.</p><p>But the carnage continues. <strong>Every delay, every loophole, every day without action means another family shattered.</strong></p><h2 id=the-next-fight-no-more-waiting>The Next Fight: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Speed kills.</strong> A pedestrian hit at 30 mph is five times more likely to die than at 20. The city can lower speed limits now. Cameras that catch speeders and red-light runners are proven to save lives, but need constant defense in Albany. The work is not done. As Queens DA Melinda Katz said, “Drunk, drugged and reckless driving are dire threats to everyone on our shared roadways.” <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/off-duty-firefighter-arraigned-man-charged-allegedly-speeding-red-light-hitting-killing-driver-another-vehicle/15961421/>ABC7</a></p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call Ramos. Demand 20 mph limits, more protected lanes, and real accountability.</strong> The dead cannot speak.

Council members are split: Brad Lander supports regulation targeting app companies, not workers; Jessica Ramos and Zohran Mamdani call for better street design; Michael Blake urges targeted safety solutions and more infrastructure.

Streets and subways remain battlegrounds.</p><p class=mb3>On December 3, 2024, at a Riders Alliance forum, six Democratic mayoral candidates—Brad Lander, Zohran Mamdani, Zellnor Myrie, Jessica Ramos, Scott Stringer, and Jim Walden—debated New York City transit policy. The event focused on congestion pricing, set to begin January 5, and subway safety. The matter summary reads: 'NYC mayoral candidates participated in a transit-focused forum... discussing congestion pricing, subway safety, and transit upgrades.' Zellnor Myrie, representing District 20, criticized Mayor Adams for not defending congestion pricing and promised to support it regardless of federal politics. Ramos pushed for congestion pricing revenue to fund the MTA. Stringer called for bus expansion and DOT reform. Walden wanted more police and exemptions for seniors and disabled riders. Lander and Mamdani argued for housing and outreach teams over policing. The forum highlighted sharp divides on how to protect vulnerable New Yorkers on streets and subways.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states he was 'ejected' and suffered 'severe lacerations' to the head after falling from the moving vehicle. The narrative details: 'A 47-year-old man clung to the outside of a dump truck. No belt. No shield. He fell. Skull met asphalt. Blood pooled. The truck rolled on, untouched. The man did not.' The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified.' The vehicle, a 2005 PTRB dump truck registered in New Jersey, sustained no damage and continued westbound, according to the report. The man was not using any safety equipment at the time, but the report does not cite this as a contributing factor. The focus remains on the systemic danger of unsecured riders and the unchecked movement of heavy vehicles through city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On September 27, 2024, State Senator Jessica Ramos, representing Queens District 13, called for urgent action after two students were killed in traffic near P.S. 127. The matter, titled 'Queens parents struggle to get crossing guards after 2 students killed in traffic,' highlights a dire shortage: only 1,500 crossing guards citywide, down from 2,600 in 2019. Ramos supports a bill mandating a crossing guard at every school corner and urges investment in pedestrian scrambles, daylighting, and congestion reduction. She said, 'You would think that this is one of the most basic ways to protect the safety of our children. And yet that seems like an insurmountable task.' Ramos’s advocacy comes as parents face bureaucratic stonewalling and city officials offer piecemeal fixes. The city’s measures—stop signs, bollards, and cement blocks—fall short. Ramos demands full funding and systemic change to protect children on their way to school.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
