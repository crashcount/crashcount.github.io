The event was not a council bill, but a public challenge. Streetsblog asked: 'Now that congestion pricing is operating in New York City, what should the city government do to build on its success in reducing Manhattan traffic?' Scott Stringer, Zellnor Myrie, Jessica Ramos, Brad Lander, and Whitney Tilson responded, each supporting congestion pricing and further transit investment. Streetsblog’s demand was clear—protect vulnerable road users. The safety analyst notes that congestion pricing reduces car traffic, lowers crash risk for pedestrians and cyclists, encourages mode shift, and opens the door for street redesigns that put vulnerable users first. The debate underscores urgency: congestion pricing helps, but more must be done to make streets safe for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The poll, highlighted in Streetsblog NYC, found deep worry among women, seniors, and Bronx residents. The matter summary reads: '77% of NYC voters consider pedestrian safety a serious issue.' Mayoral candidates responded. Ben Furnas (Transportation Alternatives) called for universal daylighting and laws against super speeders, urging street redesign and enforcement. Zellnor Myrie backed robust street designs to separate bikers, pedestrians, and drivers. Jessica Ramos supported protected bike lanes for both analog and e-bikes, calling e-bikes 'a vital tool for reducing car dependency.' Whitney Tilson demanded speed caps and insurance for e-bike riders. Despite some focus on e-bikes, advocates and data point to car and truck drivers as the main source of injury and death.

The tanker was making a right turn while the e-bike rider, a 31-year-old man, continued straight. The police report states the truck’s right front bumper struck the e-bike, crushing the rider’s knee and foot. The report lists 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as a contributing factor, highlighting a critical driver error. The e-bike rider was not wearing a helmet, as noted in the report, but this is mentioned only after the driver’s failure to yield. The tanker sustained no damage, while the e-bike was damaged at the center front end. The man remained conscious at the scene, suffering serious crush injuries. The report’s narrative underscores the violence of the impact and the vulnerability of those outside steel and glass.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The event focused on transit policy. Candidates pledged support for bus lanes, free buses, expanded Fair Fares, and shifting gas tax funds to mass transit. Lander vowed to end subway and street homelessness for the severely mentally ill by connecting them to stable housing. Mamdani promised a world-class bus network. Myrie pushed for citywide bus lanes. Ramos called for automatic Fair Fares registration. Stringer backed more bus routes. Walden opposed fare evasion crackdowns, urging resources go to service instead. All criticized Mayor Adams’ record on bus lanes and congestion pricing. The forum highlighted a united front for safer, more accessible transit, but offered no immediate relief for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
