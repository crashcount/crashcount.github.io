Fifteen left with life-changing injuries.</strong> In the last year alone, the streets of Senate District 13 have not let up. The numbers are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, children. Just this July, a 24-year-old motorcyclist died on the Long Island Expressway. He hit an SUV, was thrown into the road, and was run over by another driver who did not stop. Police said, &ldquo;A 24-year-old motorcyclist was killed&mldr; when he crashed into an SUV and was then run over by a driver who did not remain at the scene&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/28/kahyl-pena-queens-motorcyclist-24-dies-crash-long-island-expressway-lie-involving-2-drivers/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>In February, a drunk off-duty firefighter sped through a red light at 83 mph and killed a 23-year-old man on his way to work. The District Attorney said, &ldquo;An FDNY firefighter who was off duty is accused of driving under the influence, running a steady red light and slamming into a 23-year-old motorist, killing him, as he drove more than three times the posted speed limit&mldr; Our shared roadways are not a racetrack&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/off-duty-firefighter-arraigned-man-charged-allegedly-speeding-red-light-hitting-killing-driver-another-vehicle/15961421/>ABC7</a>).</p><p><strong>Children are not spared.</strong> In May, two little girls, ages 4 and 8, were hit in a crosswalk by an SUV that ran a red light.

Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds left dozens hurt. The pattern is clear. The danger is not random. It is built into the streets, the laws, and the lack of enforcement.</p><h3 id=what-has-senator-ramos-done>What Has Senator Ramos Done?</h3><p>State Senator Jessica Ramos has taken steps. She co-sponsored and voted for the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). She has called for more crossing guards, safer street design, and bus lanes. She said, &ldquo;You would think that this is one of the most basic ways to protect the safety of our children. And yet that seems like an insurmountable task&rdquo; (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/queens-parents-struggle-to-get-crossing-guards-after-2-students-killed-in-traffic>Gothamist</a>).</p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The fixes are slow. The streets do not forgive delay.</p><h3 id=act-now-demand-action>Act Now: Demand Action</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call Senator Ramos. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat offenders. Demand safe crossings at every school.</strong></p><p>Every day of delay is another family broken.

The event, titled 'Decision 2025: Mayoral Question 2 Seeks Answers on Slow Buses,' asked candidates how they would fix New York’s slowest-in-the-nation bus system. Brad Lander, Jessica Ramos, Scott Stringer, Whitney Tilson, Zellnor Myrie, and Zohran Mamdani answered. They called for more bus lanes, stronger enforcement, and faster service. No council bill was introduced; this was a public policy test, not legislation. According to the safety analyst, the event discussed bus speeds but did not specify any policy action affecting pedestrians or cyclists, so no direct safety impact can be assessed. The debate showed urgency but left vulnerable road users waiting for real change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Scott Stringer, Zellnor Myrie, Jessica Ramos, Brad Lander, and Whitney Tilson responded, each supporting congestion pricing and further transit investment.

The poll, highlighted in Streetsblog NYC, found deep worry among women, seniors, and Bronx residents. The matter summary reads: '77% of NYC voters consider pedestrian safety a serious issue.' Mayoral candidates responded. Ben Furnas (Transportation Alternatives) called for universal daylighting and laws against super speeders, urging street redesign and enforcement. Zellnor Myrie backed robust street designs to separate bikers, pedestrians, and drivers. Jessica Ramos supported protected bike lanes for both analog and e-bikes, calling e-bikes 'a vital tool for reducing car dependency.' Whitney Tilson demanded speed caps and insurance for e-bike riders. Despite some focus on e-bikes, advocates and data point to car and truck drivers as the main source of injury and death.

According to the police report, a BMW sedan 'ran the red,' disregarding traffic control. The report lists 'Alcohol Involvement' and 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as contributing factors. The BMW was struck head-on by a Mercedes sedan traveling straight. The 23-year-old BMW driver, unbelted and alone, was killed behind the wheel. The impact was severe enough that a parked Toyota SUV was also damaged. The police narrative describes the aftermath: 'Metal screamed. A parked Toyota caught the edge. The street fell silent.' The report does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor. The crash underscores the deadly consequences of driver actions—specifically, running a red light and alcohol involvement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

State Senator Zellnor Myrie, representing District 20, called for a dedicated busway on Brooklyn's Flatbush Avenue, echoing the success of Manhattan's 14th Street. The forum, hosted by Riders Alliance, saw candidates—including Myrie, Brad Lander, Zohran Mamdani, Jessica Ramos, Scott Stringer, and Jim Walden—debate urgent transit reforms. The matter: 'improving NYC's slow bus service.' Myrie and others backed more bus lanes, fare-free buses, and expanding Fair Fares for low-income riders. Mamdani vowed not to cave to local opposition. All criticized Mayor Adams for stalled bus projects.

Ramos pushed for congestion pricing revenue to fund the MTA. Stringer called for bus expansion and DOT reform. Walden wanted more police and exemptions for seniors and disabled riders.
