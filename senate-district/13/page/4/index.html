Since 2022, 21 people have died in crashes here. Thirty-eight more suffered serious injuries. These are not just numbers—they are lives cut short, families broken, futures erased. In the last twelve months alone, three people died and thirteen were left with life-altering wounds.</p><p>Children are not spared. On March 13, 2024, an 8-year-old boy was crushed by a turning truck while crossing with the light at 100th Street and 31st Avenue. He did everything right. The driver did not.</p><p>On May 26, 2025, a driver in an SUV ran a red light on 37th Avenue and struck two little girls, ages four and eight, as they crossed in the crosswalk. The driver fled. The girls survived, but the scars will last. Police said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/two-little-girls-4-and-8-struck-by-driver-who-blew-red-light-in-queens/>&ldquo;The SUV driver fled after the collision and remains on the loose.&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=repeat-offenders-deadly-consequences>Repeat Offenders, Deadly Consequences</h3><p>Speed and recklessness are not rare. They are routine. On February 26, 2025, an off-duty firefighter, drunk and high, drove 83 mph in a 25 mph zone, ran a red light, and killed 23-year-old Justin Diaz. Diaz was driving to work. His brother said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/27/justin-diaz-queens-bmw-driver-michael-pena-drunk-speeding-mercedes-fdny-firefighter-crash/>&ldquo;Justin will never walk the streets again.&rdquo;</a></p><p>The driver had a record: 25 prior school zone speeding tickets. Still, he was free to drive. Still, the system failed.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-gaps>Leadership: Action and Gaps</h3><p>State Senator Jessica Ramos has taken steps. She co-sponsored and voted for the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, which would force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting devices. She <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/queens-parents-struggle-to-get-crossing-guards-after-2-students-killed-in-traffic>called for more crossing guards</a> after children were killed and pushed for daylighting and protected bike lanes. But the carnage continues. Enforcement lags. Promises are slow. The most dangerous drivers remain on the road.</p><h3 id=the-call-demand-more-demand-it-now>The Call: Demand More, Demand It Now</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call Senator Ramos. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real consequences for repeat offenders. Demand streets where children can cross without fear. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The incident, reported by Streetsblog NYC, highlights a surge in pedestrian deaths—nineteen so far this year, with injuries up 2.6 percent. Councilmember Jessica Ramos, referencing two children recently hit in her district, called for scramble crosswalks outside schools and demanded urgent attention to street safety: 'I can’t keep getting calls like this.' Transportation Alternatives condemned the Department of Transportation for installing only two Leading Pedestrian Intervals on Glenwood Road since 2014, despite repeated fatalities. The group urged elected leaders to act now to prevent more deaths. The bill or action is not numbered, but the event underscores systemic failures and the urgent need for citywide safety improvements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Jessica Ramos blamed app companies for shifting costs onto underpaid deliveristas. Advocacy leaders like Carl Mahaney rejected crackdowns, calling for dedicated space instead.

Tech giants profit. City infrastructure lags. Cars and trucks kill most. Enforcement is scattershot. Officials call for safe lanes, charging stations, and real accountability. The crisis demands a fix beyond punishing workers.</p><p class=mb3>This policy debate, published August 23, 2023, analyzes New York City’s 'moped crisis.' The article, reviewed by Streetsblog NYC, highlights systemic failures: unsafe streets, lack of charging infrastructure, and tech companies shifting risk onto underpaid delivery workers. Council Member Alexa Aviles urges rapid expansion of e-bike charging stations and blames corporate greed. State Senators Jessica Ramos and Brad Hoylman-Sigal call for industry accountability and a standardized, safe delivery vehicle. The matter summary states, 'The city needs a systemic fix, justice for workers and accountability by tech giants.' Advocacy groups reject punitive crackdowns on workers, pushing instead for expanded bike lanes and public infrastructure. The piece concludes that only a multi-pronged, structural approach—never just enforcement—will protect vulnerable road users and delivery workers alike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
