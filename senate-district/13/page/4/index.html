Thirty-eight seriously injured.</strong> In three and a half years, 6,785 crashes tore through Jackson Heights, East Elmhurst, North Corona, and Corona. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. A child crossing with the light, crushed by a turning truck. A young man, Justin Diaz, killed on his way to work by a driver who ran a red at 83 miles per hour. His father said, “His life continues, no matter how much prison time he gets. My son Justin will no longer have a future.” <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/deadly-queens-crash-michael-pena-justin-diaz/>CBS New York</a>.</p><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> Trucks, motorcycles, and bikes add to the toll. The street is a gauntlet. The crosswalk is not safe. The numbers are not just numbers. They are families left with empty chairs.</p><h2 id=leadership-what-ramos-has-done>Leadership: What Ramos Has Done</h2><p>Senator Jessica Ramos has not been silent. She voted yes on bills to force safer street design <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>S 9718</a> and to require speed limiters for repeat offenders <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>. She called for a citywide strategy that puts safety through design first, not more blame on those walking or biking. She pledged 200 miles of protected bike lanes and closing network gaps <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/06/decision-2025-mayoral-candidates-answer-question-3>Streetsblog NYC</a>. She has demanded license revocation for reckless drivers and fully funded crossing guards.</p><p>But the carnage continues. <strong>Every delay, every loophole, every day without action means another family shattered.</strong></p><h2 id=the-next-fight-no-more-waiting>The Next Fight: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Speed kills.</strong> A pedestrian hit at 30 mph is five times more likely to die than at 20. The city can lower speed limits now. Cameras that catch speeders and red-light runners are proven to save lives, but need constant defense in Albany. The work is not done. As Queens DA Melinda Katz said, “Drunk, drugged and reckless driving are dire threats to everyone on our shared roadways.” <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/off-duty-firefighter-arraigned-man-charged-allegedly-speeding-red-light-hitting-killing-driver-another-vehicle/15961421/>ABC7</a></p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call Ramos. Demand 20 mph limits, more protected lanes, and real accountability.</strong> The dead cannot speak.

The move aims to cut deadly conflict between cars and kids. Filed at session’s end, the resolution targets peak arrival and dismissal. Sponsors push Albany to act. Streets remain risky.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0792-2023 was filed by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on September 28, 2023, and closed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. The resolution urges the New York State Legislature and Governor to pass A.5001-A/S.2515-B, which would require scramble crosswalks at intersections near schools during student arrival and dismissal. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, A.5001-A/S.2515-B, in relation to establishing scramble crosswalks leading to and from school buildings during times of student arrival and dismissal.' Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary), Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, Lincoln Restler, and Kevin C. Riley sponsored the measure. The bill responds to persistent crashes near schools and the loss of hundreds of crossing guards. Scramble crosswalks, also called Barnes Dances, stop all traffic so pedestrians cross in every direction. The council’s action highlights the ongoing danger children face on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'The City Needs a Systemic Fix, Justice for Workers and Accountability by Tech Giants,' exposes how delivery workers, squeezed by low pay and unsafe roads, turn to illegal mopeds. Council Member Alexa Aviles demanded rapid expansion of e-bike charging stations and resources for workers. State Sen. Jessica Ramos blamed app companies for shifting costs onto underpaid deliveristas. Advocacy leaders like Carl Mahaney rejected crackdowns, calling for dedicated space instead. Jon Orcutt criticized City Hall’s blindspot on traffic rules. The debate centered on expanding bike lanes, building charging infrastructure, holding tech companies accountable, and buyback programs for unsafe batteries. No direct safety analyst assessment was provided, but the discussion highlights deep systemic failures endangering vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article, reviewed by Streetsblog NYC, highlights systemic failures: unsafe streets, lack of charging infrastructure, and tech companies shifting risk onto underpaid delivery workers. Council Member Alexa Aviles urges rapid expansion of e-bike charging stations and blames corporate greed. State Senators Jessica Ramos and Brad Hoylman-Sigal call for industry accountability and a standardized, safe delivery vehicle.

The panel found the $2-billion monorail would not outperform improved bus service. Instead, two new bus routes will serve the airport: an upgraded Q70 Select Bus Service with a dedicated BQE lane, and a new non-stop bus rapid transit line from Astoria-Ditmars Boulevard using electric buses and transit signal priority. The total cost is about $500 million, far less than any rail option. State Senator Jessica Ramos, district 13, praised the decision, saying, 'My neighbors who live around LaGuardia deserve transit that is for them, not whatever that boondoggle was.' The AirTrain faced mounting opposition for its cost, indirect route, and lack of transparency. The new bus plan aims to serve millions of riders annually and can be implemented within two to five years.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The decision followed an expert panel review, which found the $2 billion monorail would not outperform expanded bus service. Instead, the panel recommended two new bus routes: an upgraded Q70 Select Bus Service with a dedicated BQE lane, and a nonstop bus rapid transit line from Astoria-Ditmars Boulevard to all LaGuardia terminals, using electric buses and transit signal priority. The matter summary states: 'Gov. Hochul and the Port Authority have canceled the controversial Cuomo-era LaGuardia AirTrain project, opting instead for two new, improved bus connections to the airport.' State Senator Jessica Ramos welcomed the move, saying, 'My neighbors who live around LaGuardia deserve transit that is for them, not whatever that boondoggle was.' Advocates and elected officials praised the shift, though some called for even stronger bus priority and further transit expansion in Queens.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Jessica Ramos and colleagues sent a letter to city and state DOTs urging action against the 'demonization' of e-bikes and e-scooters. The letter, signed by Ramos and State Sen. Liz Krueger, demanded more education on safe riding and battery use, warning, 'We cannot allow a narrative to build against a vital, green, and growing mode of transportation.' Ramos criticized City Hall for failing to post speed limits and design streets for e-mobility. Krueger backed battery safety bills, while Councilman Bob Holden pushed for outright bans, citing deaths and injuries. The senators warned that inaction could lead to blanket bans, hitting delivery workers hardest. The city’s plan for safe charging hubs faces local opposition. DOT claims a 'holistic approach,' but vulnerable riders remain at risk as agencies drag their feet.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
