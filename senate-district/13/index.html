Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>The 2025 Albany legislative session ended June 25, with lawmakers failing to pass key street safety bills. The Streetsblog NYC report reads: "Our elected officials in Albany have failed the livable streets movement again." Despite support for measures like speed camera reauthorization, most bills to protect pedestrians and cyclists died in committee or never reached the floor. Assembly Member Amy Sohn and others criticized the lack of action. The only major win was extending the city’s speed camera program. A safety analyst notes: 'Failure to advance livable streets policies likely maintains the status quo, which typically prioritizes car-centric infrastructure and neglects the safety and needs of pedestrians and cyclists.' The session’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users at risk. No progress. No protection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, described as a 'much-compromised redesign,' keeps two car lanes, scraps a bus lane, and offers no space for cyclists. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called it a 'pedestrian-first corridor,' but critics, including Riders Alliance spokesman Danny Pearlstein, slammed the move as a 'huge corporate giveaway at New Yorkers' expense.' The redesign widens sidewalks and adds planters and seating, but cars still dominate. Council members and advocates oppose the car-first approach.

The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, featured Scott Stringer, Zellnor Myrie, Jessica Ramos, Brad Lander, Zohran Mamdani, and Whitney Tilson. Stringer pledged to move the city away from car dependence and build infrastructure for biking and transit. Myrie called for removing parking mandates to boost housing and speed up buses. Ramos supported repurposing parking for safer streets and green space. Lander pushed for eliminating parking minimums citywide and dynamic curbside management. Mamdani criticized the vast space given to cars. Only Tilson promised to preserve free street parking. The candidates’ stances show a clear divide: most want to reclaim streets for people, not vehicles. The debate signals a shift toward policies that could reduce car dominance and improve safety for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
