Thirty-six left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 3,700 hurt since 2022. The streets run through <a href=/neighborhood/bk0101/>Greenpoint</a>, <a href=/neighborhood/qn0103/>Astoria</a>, <a href=/neighborhood/mn0603/>Murray Hill</a>, and more. The pain is spread wide, but it lands hardest on the most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, children.</p><p>Just this spring, a 49-year-old man was killed crossing India Street in Greenpoint. The e-bike that struck him kept going. He died from severe bleeding, his body broken on the pavement. The crash report reads only: &ldquo;Apparent Death&rdquo; and &ldquo;Severe Bleeding&rdquo; (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>A few months earlier, a woman in Astoria was struck and killed while riding her bike. The truck kept moving. Her helmet could not save her. The record says: &ldquo;Ejected. Apparent Death.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>The violence is relentless.</strong> Cars, trucks, bikes, mopeds—all play their part. But the deadliest wounds come from the largest machines. Cars and trucks caused most of the deaths. Bikes and mopeds, too, have left families grieving.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>State Senator Kristen Gonzalez has not been silent. She has backed bills to force safer street design, to bring cameras to bike lanes, and to require new safety tech in cars. She <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>voted yes on a law</a> to make streets safer for everyone, not just drivers. She <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S5008>co-sponsored a bill</a> to use cameras to keep cars out of bike lanes.</p><p>After a repeat speeder left a woman dying in Greenpoint, Gonzalez joined others to <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/02/22/serious-crash-in-greenpoint>demand &ldquo;lowering the speed limit and enforcing real accountability for dangerous drivers&rdquo;</a>. She <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/02/25/greenpoint-woman-dies-from-injuries-sustained-in-crash>called for raised crosswalks, daylighting, and one-way conversions</a> to protect people on foot and bike.</p><p>But laws move slow. Streets change slower. Each day of delay is another day of risk. The city and state have the tools. They must use them now.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call Senator Gonzalez. Call your council member. Demand lower speed limits. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand action, not words. The blood on the street is not yet dry.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The proposal, discussed at a heated community board meeting, remains active and is set for installation after summer repaving. Council Member Tiffany Caban, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, and Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas endorsed the plan in a letter, stating it would 'protect pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers while making our streets safer and less congested.' DOT spokesman Will Livingston said the design improves safety and supports local businesses. Despite opposition from some business owners, the plan moves forward.

The lawmakers wrote, 'The reasons given for this delay are not satisfactory, as all communications from the DOT have indicated that the project is complete and ready to open to the public.' They warned, 'Any further delays to this project that is otherwise ready to open will unnecessarily put at risk the thousands of New Yorkers who cycle and walk the current shared path every day.' The project, in the works since at least 2017, remains stalled. Cyclists and pedestrians are forced to share a cramped, hazardous lane.

Witness Jack Collins said, "He died basically on the spot." The e-bike rider remained at the scene; no arrests were made as the investigation continued. The article notes that the intersection is a known trouble spot, with Collins stating, "It's not a unicorn incident. It's happened a lot." The report highlights systemic issues: delivery app pressures, lack of regulation, and a street design that encourages risky moves. City data shows e-bikes account for a small share of traffic deaths, but the policy debate continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states the e-bike driver was 'unlicensed' and identifies 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as a contributing factor. The impact occurred at the center front end of the e-bike, causing severe head injuries and fatal bleeding to the pedestrian. The police report describes the victim as 'crossing, no signal, or crosswalk' and 'not at intersection,' but the primary focus remains on the unlicensed status of the e-bike operator and the disregard for traffic control. The narrative details a quiet night interrupted by the crash, with the victim left motionless on the pavement. No other contributing factors from the pedestrian are cited in the report.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The measure, supported by 40 groups and nearly all local elected officials, marks the first neighborhood-wide slow zone request since the passage of Sammy's Law. The board's action follows letters from Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez, and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velazquez to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. They cited CB1's high fatality rate—3.27 deaths per 10,000 residents, above the city average. The board's vote was contentious, with pro-driving members opposing the change. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno acknowledged the support and promised more information on slow zones for outer boroughs. Council Member Lincoln Restler later joined the call for lower speeds. The measure now awaits DOT action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Nydia Velázquez led a Queens town hall to rally opposition against Trump Administration policies, including the federal move to block New York City's congestion pricing plan. The event, held at Sunnyside Community Services, featured Council Member Julie Won (District 26) and other local officials. The panel condemned the rollback of protections for immigrants and the firing of NLRB board member Gwynne A. Wilcox. Velázquez declared, 'We’ll see him in court,' after Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy revoked federal approval for congestion pricing. She pledged to fight budget cuts targeting vulnerable communities and criticized tax breaks for the wealthy. Julie Won joined the call for grassroots activism.
