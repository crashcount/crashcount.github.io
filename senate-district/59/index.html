Thirty-six left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 3,600 hurt since 2022. The dead include cyclists, pedestrians, children. The living carry scars. In the last year alone, five lost their lives. More than a thousand were injured. Two children struck in Astoria. A seven-year-old girl with a broken femur, her head bloodied on the sidewalk. A 14-year-old girl and a man, both hit, both lucky to live. The driver was unlicensed. The car did not stop. Police <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/04/us-news/out-of-control-nyc-driver-hits-two-kids-1-adult-during-evening-rush-leaving-girl-7-with-broken-femur-cops/>reported an out-of-control unlicensed driver rammed into two kids and one adult outside a Queens charter school</a>.</p><p>On India Street, a man stepped from his car. An e-bike ran the stop sign. He died there. A witness <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-by-e-bike-delivery-worker-who-blew-stop-sign-in-greenpoint-witnesses-say>said he died basically on the spot</a>. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a unicorn incident. It&rsquo;s happened a lot.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=what-has-been-done>What Has Been Done</h2><p><strong>Senator Kristen Gonzalez has not been silent.</strong> She backed the <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/03/06/greenpoint-and-williamsburg-beg-dot-for-20mph-slow-zone>call for a 20 mph speed limit in Greenpoint and Williamsburg</a>, joining local officials and community boards after another fatal year. She <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>voted yes on a bill to force safer street designs statewide</a>. She <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S5008>co-sponsored a bill for automated bike lane enforcement</a>, and another to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S3832>require advanced safety tech in all vehicles</a>. After a repeat speeder nearly killed a woman in Greenpoint, Gonzalez and others <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/02/22/serious-crash-in-greenpoint>demanded Albany pass laws to force speed controls on the worst drivers and let the city lower speed limits</a>. They called for raised crosswalks, daylighting, and one-way conversions. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/02/22/serious-crash-in-greenpoint>Lowering the speed limit and enforcing real accountability for dangerous drivers are urgent steps we must take to protect New Yorkers</a>, they said.</p><p>But the street does not wait for laws. The city delays. The mayor <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/09/pols-demand-adams-open-queensboro-bridge-pedestrian-path>stalls safety redesigns</a>. The bridge path stays closed. The blood dries on the curb.</p><h2 id=what-must-come-next>What Must Come Next</h2><p><strong>Every day without action is another day of risk.</strong> Call Gonzalez. Call your council member. Demand the city use its new power to lower speed limits. Demand Albany pass the bills that force reckless drivers off the road. Demand the mayor open the bridge, fix the streets, and protect the people who walk and ride. <strong>Do not wait for another child’s shoe in the crosswalk.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Prosecutors say Ali drank for nearly six hours at three Manhattan bars, reaching a blood alcohol content of .158, almost twice the legal limit. After hitting Esiyok, Ali continued, injuring a cyclist, two more pedestrians, and crashing into a van. The family’s lawsuit cites New York’s Dram Shop Act, which holds bars liable for serving visibly drunk patrons who later cause harm. The article quotes the family’s lawyer: “The family is devastated.

The Department of Transportation had planned to open the dedicated walkway on March 16, but the mayor's office intervened, citing the need for a briefing. The lawmakers wrote, 'The reasons given for this delay are not satisfactory, as all communications from the DOT have indicated that the project is complete and ready to open to the public.' They warned, 'Any further delays to this project that is otherwise ready to open will unnecessarily put at risk the thousands of New Yorkers who cycle and walk the current shared path every day.' The project, in the works since at least 2017, remains stalled. Cyclists and pedestrians are forced to share a cramped, hazardous lane.

The narrative states, 'He swerved for a ghost — a car that never touched him.'

The toll stirs anger, hope, and a fight over who pays and who breathes.</p><p class=mb3>On January 3, 2025, congestion pricing (no bill number cited) will begin in Manhattan after a federal judge allowed the toll to proceed. The policy charges most drivers $9 to enter south of 60th Street during peak hours. The matter, titled 'Congestion pricing set to begin at midnight Sunday as federal judge clears path for Manhattan toll,' has drawn sharp lines. Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30, Queens) opposes the toll, warning, 'I don't know how my district is going to be impacted.' He fears more cars parking in Queens and unclear pollution risks. Council Member Kristy Marmorato (Bronx) calls it a 'cash grab.' In contrast, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez and Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas support the measure, citing cleaner air, safer streets, and transit upgrades. González-Rojas says, 'Congestion pricing isn't about penalizing anyone—it's about modernizing our transportation system and tackling climate change.' The judge ordered further study on environmental impacts, but the toll begins as scheduled.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
