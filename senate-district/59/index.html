In the last 12 months, eight people died and 24 suffered serious injuries in crashes here. The numbers do not tell you about the silence after the sirens. They do not tell you about the 65-year-old e-bike rider, struck down on Second Avenue just last week. The driver fled. The cyclist was left with a broken skull and a flashing red light in the road. Police said, <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/driver-arrested-after-hitting-65-year-old-e-biker-on-second-ave-XF4896347>&ldquo;He now faces charges of leaving the scene of an accident that caused serious injury and driving without a license.&rdquo;</a></p><p>On the FDR Drive, a firefighter fell from his motorcycle and was run over.

The road did not care.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-who-pays-the-price>The Pattern: Who Pays the Price</h3><p>Over 4,100 people have been injured in SD 59 since 2022. Most were not behind the wheel. Children, seniors, cyclists, and pedestrians pay the price. Cars and trucks caused the most pain: 661 pedestrian injuries and deaths. Motorcycles and mopeds, 42. Bikes, 55. The city keeps counting. The bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=leadership-what-has-been-done-what-must-be-done>Leadership: What Has Been Done, What Must Be Done</h3><p>Senator Kristen Gonzalez has not been silent. She co-sponsored the bill to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters and <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes to curb repeat offenders</a>. She backed the push for lower speed limits and protected bike lanes. She joined calls to open the Queensboro Bridge path and to bring a 20 mph slow zone to Greenpoint and Williamsburg. But the work is not finished. Every day of delay means another family waits for the call.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call Senator Gonzalez. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat offenders. Demand streets that put people before cars.</p><p>The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice. Change it.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The proposal, discussed at a heated community board meeting, remains active and is set for installation after summer repaving. Council Member Tiffany Caban, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, and Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas endorsed the plan in a letter, stating it would 'protect pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers while making our streets safer and less congested.' DOT spokesman Will Livingston said the design improves safety and supports local businesses. Despite opposition from some business owners, the plan moves forward. Safety analysts note: 'Protected bike lanes are proven to reduce injuries and fatalities for cyclists and pedestrians, encourage mode shift, and improve street equity by reallocating space from cars to vulnerable users.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled 'Relates to requiring the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices for repeated violation of maximum speed limits,' mandates these devices for drivers who rack up eleven or more points in 24 months, or six speed or red light camera tickets in a year. The measure aims to curb repeat dangerous driving. Senators including Jamaal Bailey, Jabari Brisport, and others voted yes.

The city’s policy stands, unmoved by the law.</p><p class=mb3>According to the New York Post (May 13, 2025), cyclist Oliver Casey Esparza filed a federal lawsuit against the NYPD, alleging officers wrongfully ticket cyclists for running red lights even when they follow pedestrian crossing signals, as permitted by a 2019 City Council law. The suit claims, 'the city maintains a policy and practice of detaining, ticketing, and prosecuting cyclists who lawfully ride through an intersection when the pedestrian control signal indicates white/walk.' Esparza received a $190 summons at Third Avenue and East 42nd Street, Manhattan, despite acting within the law. The lawsuit names current and former NYPD commissioners, accusing them of knowingly violating civil rights. The article notes a sharp rise in tickets for cyclists in early 2025. The NYPD declined to comment. The case highlights a gap between city law and police enforcement, raising questions about policy compliance and systemic accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
