Sixteen seriously hurt.</strong> In just the first eight months of this year, the streets of Senate District 59 have claimed more lives than last year—a 250% jump in deaths. The numbers do not flinch: since January 2022, <strong>22 people have died and 45 have suffered life-altering injuries</strong> in 8,414 crashes. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, parents, children. On July 29, a 65-year-old man riding his e-bike on Second Avenue was struck by a 21-year-old unlicensed driver in a Nissan SUV. The driver fled, leaving the man with a shattered skull on the pavement. Police found him later. He told them he ran because he had no license. <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/driver-arrested-after-hitting-65-year-old-e-biker-on-second-ave-XF4896347>He now faces charges of leaving the scene of an accident that caused serious injury and driving without a license.</a></p><h3 id=the-pattern-who-pays-the-price>The Pattern: Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> They caused 666 injuries or deaths to pedestrians here. Trucks and buses added 60 more. Motorcycles and mopeds, 43. Bikes, 55. The old, the young, the ones on foot or two wheels—they pay the price. The street does not care if you are careful. It only cares if you are exposed.</p><h3 id=leadership-what-has-been-done-what-must-be-done>Leadership: What Has Been Done, What Must Be Done</h3><p>State Senator Kristen Gonzalez has not been silent. She co-sponsored and voted yes on the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, a bill to force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. She backed the push for a 20 mph slow zone in Greenpoint and Williamsburg, where the death rate is among the city&rsquo;s worst. She joined calls to open the Queensboro Bridge pedestrian path and to defend protected bike lanes in Astoria, even as businesses sued to block them. The city, she said with others, must act: <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/09/pols-demand-adams-open-queensboro-bridge-pedestrian-path>&ldquo;Any further delays to this project that is otherwise ready to open will unnecessarily put at risk the thousands of New Yorkers who cycle and walk the current shared path every day.&rdquo;</a></p><p>But the blood keeps coming. The numbers keep rising. <strong>No law, no ribbon-cutting, no press release will bring back the dead.</strong></p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand the Stop Super Speeders Act become law. Demand protected bike lanes and open bridges.</strong></p><p><strong>Every day you wait is another day someone does not come home.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
