A week before, a convertible struck a child crossing East 14th. In the last year alone, six people have died and over 1,150 have been injured in crashes across Senate District 59. Twenty-one suffered injuries so severe they may never fully recover. The numbers do not bleed, but the streets do.</p><h2 id=patterns-that-kill-policies-that-stall>Patterns That Kill, Policies That Stall</h2><p>The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, parents. A 36-year-old woman, crushed by a pickup on 34th Avenue. A 49-year-old man, struck by a bus at 3rd Avenue and 28th Street. A pedestrian, a cyclist, a child—each erased in a moment. Cars and trucks caused the most harm, but buses, bikes, and mopeds all left bodies behind. The violence is relentless. It does not pause for policy.</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-bills-and-the-work-ahead>Leadership: Votes, Bills, and the Work Ahead</h2><p>State Senator Kristen Gonzalez has not been silent. She co-sponsored and voted for the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed limiters. She backed the extension of school speed zones. After a deadly crash in Greenpoint, she joined other officials to demand lower speed limits and real accountability for reckless drivers. Their words were plain: “Lowering the speed limit and enforcing real accountability for dangerous drivers are urgent steps we must take to protect New Yorkers.” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/02/22/serious-crash-in-greenpoint>demanded lower speed limits and accountability</a>.</p><p>But the work is not done. Speed kills. Delay kills. Every day without stronger laws and safer streets is another day someone does not come home.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p>Call your lawmakers. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand passage of the Stop Super Speeders Act. Demand streets where a child can cross without fear.</p><p>No more waiting. No more names turned into numbers. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice. Change it.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

DOT spokesman Will Livingston said the design improves safety and supports local businesses. Despite opposition from some business owners, the plan moves forward.

Passenger Malnick described, "A bolt hit and then right away just the sound of glass exploding and glass all over me." The incident echoes previous cases: in 2019, falling debris from elevated tracks struck vehicles three times in a month. The MTA responded then by intensifying inspections, but the problem persists. The agency now says it is investigating and will inspect the area.

Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On April 9, 2025, seven elected officials—including Council Members Julie Won and Julie Menin—sent a public letter demanding Mayor Adams open the long-promised Queensboro Bridge pedestrian path. The Department of Transportation had planned to open the dedicated walkway on March 16, but the mayor's office intervened, citing the need for a briefing. The lawmakers wrote, 'The reasons given for this delay are not satisfactory, as all communications from the DOT have indicated that the project is complete and ready to open to the public.' They warned, 'Any further delays to this project that is otherwise ready to open will unnecessarily put at risk the thousands of New Yorkers who cycle and walk the current shared path every day.' The project, in the works since at least 2017, remains stalled. Cyclists and pedestrians are forced to share a cramped, hazardous lane. City Hall insists on more review, while advocates plan a protest ribbon-cutting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Police charged her with reckless driving and driving without a license.
