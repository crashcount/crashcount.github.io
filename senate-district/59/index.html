In the last twelve months, six people died and twenty-one suffered serious injuries in crashes here. The dead do not get second chances. The injured carry scars the rest of us cannot see. In all, there were 2,285 crashes and 1,167 injuries—each one a life bent or broken.</p><p>A man was killed by a bus at E 28th and 3rd. A cyclist died on 34th Avenue. A pedestrian was struck down in Greenpoint. The numbers do not flinch: cars and trucks caused the most harm, but bikes and mopeds left their mark too. The disaster is slow, but it is relentless.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-votes-and-the-weight-of-action>Leadership: Words, Votes, and the Weight of Action</h3><p>State Senator Kristen Gonzalez has not been silent. She backed the <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/03/06/greenpoint-and-williamsburg-beg-dot-for-20mph-slow-zone>call for a 20 mph slow zone</a> in Greenpoint and Williamsburg, joining other officials to demand lower speeds after a string of deaths. She co-sponsored <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S5008>bills for automated bike lane enforcement</a> and <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S3832>advanced vehicle safety tech</a>. She voted yes on a <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>law to force safer street design</a>. When a repeat speeder struck a woman in Greenpoint, Gonzalez and others <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/02/22/serious-crash-in-greenpoint>said: “Lowering the speed limit and enforcing real accountability for dangerous drivers are urgent steps we must take to protect New Yorkers.”</a></p><p>But the work is not done. The city drags its feet on opening safe paths. Promises pile up. The dead do not wait.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-that-do-not-lie>The Numbers That Do Not Lie</h3><p>Most victims are not in cars. In the last year, children, cyclists, and pedestrians paid the highest price. A single crash can end a life or leave a family shattered. The numbers are not just numbers. They are names, faces, and empty chairs at dinner tables.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p>Call your leaders. Demand action. Lower the speed limit. Build real protection for people on foot and on bikes. Enforce the laws against the drivers who do the most harm. Do not let another year pass with the same old blood on the street.</p><p>Contact Senator Gonzalez. Contact your council member. Join the fight.</p><p>The disaster is not fate. It is policy. It can be stopped.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The proposal, discussed at a heated community board meeting, remains active and is set for installation after summer repaving. Council Member Tiffany Caban, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, and Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas endorsed the plan in a letter, stating it would 'protect pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers while making our streets safer and less congested.' DOT spokesman Will Livingston said the design improves safety and supports local businesses. Despite opposition from some business owners, the plan moves forward. Safety analysts note: 'Protected bike lanes are proven to reduce injuries and fatalities for cyclists and pedestrians, encourage mode shift, and improve street equity by reallocating space from cars to vulnerable users.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He claims police issue red-light summonses to cyclists who cross intersections with the white pedestrian walk signal, despite a 2019 law permitting this. The article quotes Transportation Alternatives: “That 5-7 second head start can mean the difference between being hit by a turning car and being seen by a turning car.” Esparza says officers ignore the rule, issuing criminal summonses instead of traffic tickets. The suit highlights a gap between city policy and street enforcement, raising questions about NYPD training and the city’s commitment to safe cycling.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project sits finished. Cyclists and walkers still cram into a narrow, crash-prone lane. Delays keep thousands at risk. City Hall stalls. Advocates plan protest. Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On April 9, 2025, seven elected officials—including Council Members Julie Won and Julie Menin—sent a public letter demanding Mayor Adams open the long-promised Queensboro Bridge pedestrian path. The Department of Transportation had planned to open the dedicated walkway on March 16, but the mayor's office intervened, citing the need for a briefing. The lawmakers wrote, 'The reasons given for this delay are not satisfactory, as all communications from the DOT have indicated that the project is complete and ready to open to the public.' They warned, 'Any further delays to this project that is otherwise ready to open will unnecessarily put at risk the thousands of New Yorkers who cycle and walk the current shared path every day.' The project, in the works since at least 2017, remains stalled. Cyclists and pedestrians are forced to share a cramped, hazardous lane. City Hall insists on more review, while advocates plan a protest ribbon-cutting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article notes that the intersection is a known trouble spot, with Collins stating, "It's not a unicorn incident. It's happened a lot." The report highlights systemic issues: delivery app pressures, lack of regulation, and a street design that encourages risky moves.

The report states the e-bike driver was 'unlicensed' and identifies 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as a contributing factor. The impact occurred at the center front end of the e-bike, causing severe head injuries and fatal bleeding to the pedestrian. The police report describes the victim as 'crossing, no signal, or crosswalk' and 'not at intersection,' but the primary focus remains on the unlicensed status of the e-bike operator and the disregard for traffic control. The narrative details a quiet night interrupted by the crash, with the victim left motionless on the pavement. No other contributing factors from the pedestrian are cited in the report.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The measure, supported by 40 groups and nearly all local elected officials, marks the first neighborhood-wide slow zone request since the passage of Sammy's Law. The board's action follows letters from Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez, and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velazquez to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. They cited CB1's high fatality rate—3.27 deaths per 10,000 residents, above the city average. The board's vote was contentious, with pro-driving members opposing the change. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno acknowledged the support and promised more information on slow zones for outer boroughs. Council Member Lincoln Restler later joined the call for lower speeds. The measure now awaits DOT action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The panel condemned the rollback of protections for immigrants and the firing of NLRB board member Gwynne A. Wilcox. Velázquez declared, 'We’ll see him in court,' after Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy revoked federal approval for congestion pricing. She pledged to fight budget cuts targeting vulnerable communities and criticized tax breaks for the wealthy. Julie Won joined the call for grassroots activism.
