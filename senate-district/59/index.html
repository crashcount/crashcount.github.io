Thirty-six suffered wounds so grave they may never walk the same. The dead do not get a second chance. The living carry scars.</p><p><strong>Just this spring, a man was killed by an e-bike rider who ran a stop sign in Greenpoint.</strong> A cyclist died on 34th Avenue, struck by a truck. A 15-year-old boy fell from a subway train at Queensboro Plaza. His family never planned for a funeral. &ldquo;We were blindsided. We never planned for a funeral for a child.

She has called for lower speed limits, for speed control, for real enforcement. After a woman was killed by a repeat speeder in Greenpoint, Gonzalez joined others to <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/02/22/serious-crash-in-greenpoint>demand two critical bills that would lead to fewer incidents of traffic violence</a>—one to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting devices, and another to let the city lower speed limits. &ldquo;Lowering the speed limit and enforcing real accountability for dangerous drivers are urgent steps we must take to protect New Yorkers,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/02/22/serious-crash-in-greenpoint>she said</a>.</p><p>Gonzalez has voted yes on bills to require safer street design and co-sponsored laws for automated bike lane enforcement and advanced vehicle safety tech. She backed the <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/03/06/greenpoint-and-williamsburg-beg-dot-for-20mph-slow-zone>push for a 20 mph slow zone in Greenpoint and Williamsburg</a>, and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/09/pols-demand-adams-open-queensboro-bridge-pedestrian-path>demanded the city open the Queensboro Bridge pedestrian path</a>. But the pace of change is slow. The bodies keep coming.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay, every watered-down law, every blocked redesign means another mother, another child, another cyclist is left in the street. <strong>Call your lawmakers. Demand the 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat offenders. Demand streets built for people, not just cars.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another funeral.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The NYPD is investigating this and two other incidents: a person struck by a J train and another killed while walking between cars on a No. 2 train. The events highlight ongoing dangers in the subway system and raise questions about platform and train safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation had planned to open the dedicated walkway on March 16, but the mayor's office intervened, citing the need for a briefing. The lawmakers wrote, 'The reasons given for this delay are not satisfactory, as all communications from the DOT have indicated that the project is complete and ready to open to the public.' They warned, 'Any further delays to this project that is otherwise ready to open will unnecessarily put at risk the thousands of New Yorkers who cycle and walk the current shared path every day.' The project, in the works since at least 2017, remains stalled. Cyclists and pedestrians are forced to share a cramped, hazardous lane.

Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On March 6, 2025, Brooklyn Community Board 1 voted 18-15 to request a 20 mph speed limit for Greenpoint and Williamsburg. The measure, supported by 40 groups and nearly all local elected officials, marks the first neighborhood-wide slow zone request since the passage of Sammy's Law. The board's action follows letters from Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez, and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velazquez to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. They cited CB1's high fatality rate—3.27 deaths per 10,000 residents, above the city average. The board's vote was contentious, with pro-driving members opposing the change. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno acknowledged the support and promised more information on slow zones for outer boroughs. Council Member Lincoln Restler later joined the call for lower speeds. The measure now awaits DOT action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Nydia Velázquez led a Queens town hall to rally opposition against Trump Administration policies, including the federal move to block New York City's congestion pricing plan. The event, held at Sunnyside Community Services, featured Council Member Julie Won (District 26) and other local officials. The panel condemned the rollback of protections for immigrants and the firing of NLRB board member Gwynne A. Wilcox. Velázquez declared, 'We’ll see him in court,' after Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy revoked federal approval for congestion pricing. She pledged to fight budget cuts targeting vulnerable communities and criticized tax breaks for the wealthy. Julie Won joined the call for grassroots activism. The town hall spotlighted the threat to New York’s sovereignty and the urgent need to defend city streets and programs from federal interference.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The narrative states, 'He swerved for a ghost — a car that never touched him.'
