Same ending.</p><p>On Second Avenue near 15th Street, a 21-year-old in a 2024 Nissan Rogue hit a 65-year-old man on an Arrow 9 e‑bike around 6 p.m. The driver fled. Police later arrested him and said he confessed to driving without a license. The cyclist suffered severe head trauma and was found unconscious as EMS worked on him. He was rushed to Bellevue. The NYPD Collision Investigation Squad is on the case, and the charges include leaving the scene and unlicensed driving, according to <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/30/hit-and-run-rogue-driver-caught-after-seriously-injuring-cycling-senior-in-heart-of-the-city>Streetsblog NYC</a> and the <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/driver-arrested-after-collision-with-e-biker-on-second-ave-XF4896347>West Side Spirit</a>. City open data lists the crash with the cyclist later listed as killed and the SUV driver cited for traffic control disregard <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>in the dataset</a>.</p><p>A few days earlier on the FDR, a 31-year-old FDNY firefighter fell from his motorcycle and was then struck by a vehicle that did not remain. Police said he died at the scene before 4 a.m. near E. 25th Street. “He was struck by an unknown vehicle that did not remain on the scene,” police said, as reported by <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/31-year-old-firefighter-matthew-goicochea-killed-overnight-motorcycle-crash-fdr-drive-fdny-says/17279439/>ABC7</a> and the <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/decorated-firefighter-killed-after-falling-off-motorcycle-getting-hit-by-car-on-fdr-drive-GG4877945>West Side Spirit</a>. The city’s crash file records his death and notes “Driver Inattention/Distraction” in the sequence of events for the motorcycle, with an unspecified striking vehicle <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>in the dataset</a>.</p><p>On Franklin and India in Greenpoint, a 49-year-old man walking outside an intersection was hit by an e‑bike and died. The operator was unlicensed, per the city’s files. The record lists “severe bleeding” and death at the scene <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>in the dataset</a>.</p><p>Three corners. One fix.</p><p>Deaths in SD 59 did not stop with these names. In the last 12 months, this district saw 2,673 crashes, <strong>9 deaths</strong>, and 1,388 injuries, with 23 serious injuries, according to the city’s open data rollup. Year to date, crashes are up 16.5% over last year, deaths are up to 7 from 2, and serious injuries have nearly doubled. The toll hits across ages, with the 45–54 band logging four deaths so far this year <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>in the stats</a>.</p><p>Pedestrians here are struck by cars, SUVs, trucks, buses, and bikes. The district’s current totals show pedestrians killed by bikes (2), trucks (1), and buses (1), with hundreds more injured by sedans and SUVs <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>in the stats</a>. One mode does not own this crisis. Speed and mass do.</p><p>Officials know what works — do they?</p><p>Albany passed tools. City Hall drifts. The City can lower speeds under Sammy’s Law, and slow zones are on the table. Brooklyn CB1 asked for a 20 mph area-wide limit in Greenpoint and Williamsburg, backed by Sen. Kristen Gonzalez and others, who cited CB1’s high fatality rate. DOT said more info was coming on outer‑borough slow zones, reported by <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/03/06/greenpoint-and-williamsburg-beg-dot-for-20mph-slow-zone>Streetsblog NYC</a>. And the Queensboro Bridge path, promised, stayed shut until lawmakers pressed the Mayor. “The reasons given for this delay are not satisfactory,” they wrote, warning further delay would “unnecessarily put at risk” people forced to share a cramped lane, per <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/09/pols-demand-adams-open-queensboro-bridge-pedestrian-path>Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p><p>The state Senate moved on the worst repeat drivers. Sen. Gonzalez co‑sponsored and voted “yes” in committee for S 4045 to require intelligent speed limiters for repeat camera violators and high‑point drivers. The bill advanced through committee votes on June 11 and 12, 2025, per the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Senate file</a>. Streets safety groups say a tiny pool of drivers cause outsized harm; camera repeaters are far more likely to kill, as documented by <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/20/the-1-5-percent-of-drivers-who-cause-21-percent-of-pedestrian-deaths>Streetsblog NYC</a>. The city’s speed cameras were renewed to run 24/7 through 2030, as covered in our <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a> brief.</p><p>Street by street, the work crawls. On 31st Street in Astoria, DOT vowed to defend protected bike lanes and traffic calming in court. “We stand firmly behind this project and will defend our work in court,” a DOT spokesman said, as noted by <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/08/dot-stands-by-astoria-safety-project-despite-foes-anti-bike-lawsuit>Streetsblog NYC</a>. Electeds including Sen. Gonzalez backed the plan earlier in June, calling for designs that “protect pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers,” per <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/20/dot-stands-by-astoria-bike-lane-plan-despite-foes-childish-outbursts>Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p><p>Relentless math.</p><ul><li>In this district: <strong>8,490 crashes</strong> since 2022, with <strong>22 deaths</strong> and 4,186 injuries.</li><li>In the last 12 months: <strong>2,673 crashes</strong>, <strong>9 deaths</strong>, 1,388 injuries.</li><li>Year to date vs. last year: crashes up 16.5%, deaths up 250%, serious injuries up 78% <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>in the stats</a>.</li></ul><p>One more body on Second Avenue.

He struck Abdulhekim Esiyok in the crosswalk. Bars kept pouring drinks for the driver. Blood alcohol soared. Esiyok died at Bellevue. The driver hit more people before stopping. The city’s system failed again.</p><p class=mb3>According to the New York Post (2025-06-07), Abdulhekim Esiyok, a 23-year-old Turkish immigrant, was killed while crossing Third Avenue after Mahbub Ali, allegedly intoxicated, drove into him. Prosecutors say Ali drank for nearly six hours at three Manhattan bars, reaching a blood alcohol content of .158, almost twice the legal limit. After hitting Esiyok, Ali continued, injuring a cyclist, two more pedestrians, and crashing into a van. The family’s lawsuit cites New York’s Dram Shop Act, which holds bars liable for serving visibly drunk patrons who later cause harm. The article quotes the family’s lawyer: “The family is devastated. They’re still in disbelief.” The case highlights failures in both driver responsibility and alcohol-serving oversight.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Rahimi, the driver, said, "We were driving right off here. Something fell off the train, damaging the windshield." Passenger Malnick described, "A bolt hit and then right away just the sound of glass exploding and glass all over me." The incident echoes previous cases: in 2019, falling debris from elevated tracks struck vehicles three times in a month. The MTA responded then by intensifying inspections, but the problem persists. The agency now says it is investigating and will inspect the area. The repeated incidents highlight ongoing risks from aging infrastructure above city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
