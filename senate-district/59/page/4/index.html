Same ending.</p><p>On Second Avenue near 15th Street, a 21-year-old in a 2024 Nissan Rogue hit a 65-year-old man on an Arrow 9 e‑bike around 6 p.m. The driver fled. Police later arrested him and said he confessed to driving without a license. The cyclist suffered severe head trauma and was found unconscious as EMS worked on him. He was rushed to Bellevue. The NYPD Collision Investigation Squad is on the case, and the charges include leaving the scene and unlicensed driving, according to <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/30/hit-and-run-rogue-driver-caught-after-seriously-injuring-cycling-senior-in-heart-of-the-city>Streetsblog NYC</a> and the <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/driver-arrested-after-collision-with-e-biker-on-second-ave-XF4896347>West Side Spirit</a>. City open data lists the crash with the cyclist later listed as killed and the SUV driver cited for traffic control disregard <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>in the dataset</a>.</p><p>A few days earlier on the FDR, a 31-year-old FDNY firefighter fell from his motorcycle and was then struck by a vehicle that did not remain. Police said he died at the scene before 4 a.m. near E. 25th Street. “He was struck by an unknown vehicle that did not remain on the scene,” police said, as reported by <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/31-year-old-firefighter-matthew-goicochea-killed-overnight-motorcycle-crash-fdr-drive-fdny-says/17279439/>ABC7</a> and the <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/decorated-firefighter-killed-after-falling-off-motorcycle-getting-hit-by-car-on-fdr-drive-GG4877945>West Side Spirit</a>. The city’s crash file records his death and notes “Driver Inattention/Distraction” in the sequence of events for the motorcycle, with an unspecified striking vehicle <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>in the dataset</a>.</p><p>On Franklin and India in Greenpoint, a 49-year-old man walking outside an intersection was hit by an e‑bike and died. The operator was unlicensed, per the city’s files. The record lists “severe bleeding” and death at the scene <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>in the dataset</a>.</p><p>Three corners. One fix.</p><p>Deaths in SD 59 did not stop with these names. In the last 12 months, this district saw 2,673 crashes, <strong>9 deaths</strong>, and 1,388 injuries, with 23 serious injuries, according to the city’s open data rollup. Year to date, crashes are up 16.5% over last year, deaths are up to 7 from 2, and serious injuries have nearly doubled. The toll hits across ages, with the 45–54 band logging four deaths so far this year <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>in the stats</a>.</p><p>Pedestrians here are struck by cars, SUVs, trucks, buses, and bikes. The district’s current totals show pedestrians killed by bikes (2), trucks (1), and buses (1), with hundreds more injured by sedans and SUVs <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>in the stats</a>. One mode does not own this crisis. Speed and mass do.</p><p>Officials know what works — do they?</p><p>Albany passed tools. City Hall drifts. The City can lower speeds under Sammy’s Law, and slow zones are on the table. Brooklyn CB1 asked for a 20 mph area-wide limit in Greenpoint and Williamsburg, backed by Sen. Kristen Gonzalez and others, who cited CB1’s high fatality rate. DOT said more info was coming on outer‑borough slow zones, reported by <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/03/06/greenpoint-and-williamsburg-beg-dot-for-20mph-slow-zone>Streetsblog NYC</a>. And the Queensboro Bridge path, promised, stayed shut until lawmakers pressed the Mayor. “The reasons given for this delay are not satisfactory,” they wrote, warning further delay would “unnecessarily put at risk” people forced to share a cramped lane, per <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/09/pols-demand-adams-open-queensboro-bridge-pedestrian-path>Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p><p>The state Senate moved on the worst repeat drivers. Sen. Gonzalez co‑sponsored and voted “yes” in committee for S 4045 to require intelligent speed limiters for repeat camera violators and high‑point drivers. The bill advanced through committee votes on June 11 and 12, 2025, per the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Senate file</a>. Streets safety groups say a tiny pool of drivers cause outsized harm; camera repeaters are far more likely to kill, as documented by <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/20/the-1-5-percent-of-drivers-who-cause-21-percent-of-pedestrian-deaths>Streetsblog NYC</a>. The city’s speed cameras were renewed to run 24/7 through 2030, as covered in our <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a> brief.</p><p>Street by street, the work crawls. On 31st Street in Astoria, DOT vowed to defend protected bike lanes and traffic calming in court. “We stand firmly behind this project and will defend our work in court,” a DOT spokesman said, as noted by <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/08/dot-stands-by-astoria-safety-project-despite-foes-anti-bike-lawsuit>Streetsblog NYC</a>. Electeds including Sen. Gonzalez backed the plan earlier in June, calling for designs that “protect pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers,” per <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/20/dot-stands-by-astoria-bike-lane-plan-despite-foes-childish-outbursts>Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p><p>Relentless math.</p><ul><li>In this district: <strong>8,490 crashes</strong> since 2022, with <strong>22 deaths</strong> and 4,186 injuries.</li><li>In the last 12 months: <strong>2,673 crashes</strong>, <strong>9 deaths</strong>, 1,388 injuries.</li><li>Year to date vs. last year: crashes up 16.5%, deaths up 250%, serious injuries up 78% <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>in the stats</a>.</li></ul><p>One more body on Second Avenue.

The event, covered on September 18, 2023, drew over 200 residents and was organized by Western Queens elected officials. The workshop addressed a 'significant increase in traffic-related deaths, including several high-profile fatalities involving cyclists and pedestrians.' Councilwoman Tiffany Cabán, State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, and Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani called the deaths preventable and demanded urgent changes. Cabán stated, 'If it saves lives, it’s worth doing.' DOT officials, including Queens Borough Commissioner Nicole Garcia and senior program manager Kyle Gorman, presented plans for 31st Avenue and collected resident feedback on dangerous driving, lack of protected bike lanes, and unsafe intersections. The DOT pledged to return with a proposal. No formal bill number or committee was cited; the event focused on immediate community engagement and systemic change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Protected bike lanes will come, but car lanes stay open during peak hours. The plan falls short of full safety measures. The road remains dangerous. Victims still count. No one is satisfied.</p><p class=mb3>On August 16, 2023, Mayor Adams announced a compromise redesign for McGuinness Boulevard, a notorious Brooklyn corridor. The Department of Transportation will install curbside protected bike lanes and reduce car lanes from two to one in each direction on most of the strip. However, north of Calyer Street, two lanes for cars will remain open during weekdays, reverting to parking lanes at night and on weekends. The plan, shaped after lobbying by business interests and mayoral adviser Ingrid Lewis-Martin, mixes two previous DOT proposals. Mayoral spokesman Charles Lutvak said, 'Traffic safety is a key priority for Mayor Adams, and we are delivering with a redesign of McGuinness Boulevard that will make this corridor safer for all road users.' Local officials, including Council Member Lincoln Restler, called it a 'critical step' but noted it lacks key safety elements. The compromise leaves gaps. Since 2021, 62 people have been injured on this stretch. The carnage continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Hanif, along with Lincoln Restler, Alexa Avilés, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Crystal Hudson, joined borough, state, and federal colleagues in this push. They propose a credit system to balance costs between DOT bridges and MTA tunnels, aiming to protect neighborhoods like the Brooklyn waterfront and the BQE corridor from traffic surges. The MTA declined comment. The Board will soon set final toll rates and rules. The federal government has approved the congestion pricing plan, with tolls for cars expected between $9 and $23.

They reject piecemeal fixes. They call out decades of harm. The state’s refusal leaves neighborhoods exposed. The city’s hands are tied. The highway’s danger remains. Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On February 10, 2023, eighteen Brooklyn lawmakers issued a joint letter demanding New York State Department of Transportation (DOT) participate in comprehensive planning for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens. Jabari Brisport, Julia Salazar, Kristen Gonzalez, Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Members Bobby Carroll, Maritza Davila, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Emily Gallagher, Jo Anne Simon, Marcela Mitaynes, and Council Members Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Lincoln Restler. Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint. Without state action, only city-owned segments see attention. The city’s efforts are limited. The state’s inaction leaves systemic danger unaddressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
