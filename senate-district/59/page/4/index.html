A week before, a convertible struck a child crossing East 14th. In the last year alone, six people have died and over 1,150 have been injured in crashes across Senate District 59. Twenty-one suffered injuries so severe they may never fully recover. The numbers do not bleed, but the streets do.</p><h2 id=patterns-that-kill-policies-that-stall>Patterns That Kill, Policies That Stall</h2><p>The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, parents. A 36-year-old woman, crushed by a pickup on 34th Avenue. A 49-year-old man, struck by a bus at 3rd Avenue and 28th Street. A pedestrian, a cyclist, a child—each erased in a moment. Cars and trucks caused the most harm, but buses, bikes, and mopeds all left bodies behind. The violence is relentless. It does not pause for policy.</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-bills-and-the-work-ahead>Leadership: Votes, Bills, and the Work Ahead</h2><p>State Senator Kristen Gonzalez has not been silent. She co-sponsored and voted for the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed limiters. She backed the extension of school speed zones. After a deadly crash in Greenpoint, she joined other officials to demand lower speed limits and real accountability for reckless drivers. Their words were plain: “Lowering the speed limit and enforcing real accountability for dangerous drivers are urgent steps we must take to protect New Yorkers.” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/02/22/serious-crash-in-greenpoint>demanded lower speed limits and accountability</a>.</p><p>But the work is not done. Speed kills. Delay kills. Every day without stronger laws and safer streets is another day someone does not come home.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p>Call your lawmakers. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand passage of the Stop Super Speeders Act. Demand streets where a child can cross without fear.</p><p>No more waiting. No more names turned into numbers. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice. Change it.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The incident happened near Meeker Avenue, one block from where teacher Matthew Jensen was killed in 2021. The matter, titled 'Locals call for mayor to take immediate action after moped rider injured on McGuinness Boulevard,' highlights the urgent need for the Department of Transportation’s proposed safety redesign. Restler, along with U.S. Rep. Nydia Velázquez, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, and State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, issued a joint statement: 'Lives are being put at risk. We need immediate action by the Mayor's office to implement the Department of Transportation's proposed safety improvements so that everyone in our community can feel confident that McGuinness Boulevard will not cause more tragedies.' The safety plan remains blocked, leaving vulnerable road users exposed to ongoing danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Hanif, along with Lincoln Restler, Alexa Avilés, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Crystal Hudson, joined borough, state, and federal colleagues in this push. They propose a credit system to balance costs between DOT bridges and MTA tunnels, aiming to protect neighborhoods like the Brooklyn waterfront and the BQE corridor from traffic surges. The MTA declined comment. The Board will soon set final toll rates and rules. The federal government has approved the congestion pricing plan, with tolls for cars expected between $9 and $23. Over 100 exemption requests, including from taxi and for-hire vehicle drivers, are under review.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On February 10, 2023, eighteen Brooklyn lawmakers issued a joint letter demanding New York State Department of Transportation (DOT) participate in comprehensive planning for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens. Jabari Brisport, Julia Salazar, Kristen Gonzalez, Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Members Bobby Carroll, Maritza Davila, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Emily Gallagher, Jo Anne Simon, Marcela Mitaynes, and Council Members Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Lincoln Restler. Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint. Without state action, only city-owned segments see attention. The city’s efforts are limited. The state’s inaction leaves systemic danger unaddressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

State Senator Kristen Gonzalez blamed 'poorly designed streets,' saying, 'traffic violence is the outcome of poorly designed streets and is a solvable problem.' The area has almost no protected bike lanes. In 2022, Community Board 1 saw 1,979 crashes, injuring 120 cyclists and 163 pedestrians. Politicians and residents demand safer streets, better enforcement, and an end to car dominance.
