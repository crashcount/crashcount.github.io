The Department of Transportation (DOT) had closed the street to traffic during G train repairs, but plans to reopen it to vehicles. The matter, described as a push to 'continue this vital public space project as a permanent fixture,' drew support from Rep. Nydia Velázquez and State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, who sent letters urging DOT to make the plaza permanent. Local organizations, businesses, and over 3,100 petitioners back the effort, citing increased community use and safety. Previous concerns about traffic and safety did not materialize.

Assembly Member Emily Gallagher joined Gonzalez, highlighting the lack of traffic calming on Nassau Avenue, where Aber was killed. Gallagher stated, 'Nothing to slow traffic on Nassau: no signal, stop sign, even a painted crosswalk.' The officials urged immediate installation of pedestrian safety measures and renewed calls for policy changes to protect vulnerable road users.
