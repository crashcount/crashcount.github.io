Thirty-six left with serious injuries.</strong> More than 3,700 hurt since 2022. The wounds are not abstract. They are broken bodies, empty beds, and families who will never be whole again. Just this spring, a 49-year-old man was killed crossing India Street in Greenpoint, struck by an unlicensed e-bike rider who ran a stop sign. The police found him bleeding in the road. He did not get up. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>On 34th Avenue, a woman on a bike was hit and killed. On Bedford Avenue, a crash left a driver dead and a passenger with head injuries. The pattern is clear. <strong>Speed, inattention, and reckless driving keep taking lives.</strong></p><h3 id=lowering-the-speed-limit-and-enforcing-real-accountability>&ldquo;Lowering the Speed Limit and Enforcing Real Accountability&rdquo;</h3><p>The calls for change are not new. After a repeat speeding driver struck a woman in Greenpoint, local leaders spoke out. &ldquo;Lowering the speed limit and enforcing real accountability for dangerous drivers are urgent steps we must take to protect New Yorkers,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/02/22/serious-crash-in-greenpoint>said a joint statement from Senator Kristen Gonzalez and others</a>.</p><p>The same coalition demanded Albany pass laws to force the worst repeat offenders to slow down and to let the city set its own speed limits. They called for raised crosswalks and daylighting at deadly corners. &ldquo;We’re calling on the New York State legislature to pass two critical bills that would lead to fewer incidents of traffic violence,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/02/25/greenpoint-woman-dies-from-injuries-sustained-in-crash>they said</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-pressure>Leadership: Progress and Pressure</h3><p>Senator Kristen Gonzalez has not been silent. She backed bills for <strong>complete street design</strong> and <strong>automated bike lane enforcement</strong>. She called for lower speed limits and better infrastructure after each new death. She co-sponsored laws to require advanced safety tech in cars and to keep drivers out of bike lanes. But the pace is slow. The bodies pile up while the bills wait.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Every death is preventable.</strong> The street does not care who you are. It only takes. Call Senator Gonzalez. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand enforcement against repeat speeders. Demand streets that protect the people who walk and ride. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Following the crash, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, Council Member Lincoln Restler, and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velázquez called for passage of two state bills: one requiring repeat speeding offenders to install intelligent speed assistance devices, and Sammy's Law, which would let the City Council lower speed limits. They also urged the Department of Transportation to install raised crosswalks and daylighting at intersections.

Protected bike lanes will come, but car lanes stay open during peak hours. The plan falls short of full safety measures. The road remains dangerous. Victims still count. No one is satisfied.</p><p class=mb3>On August 16, 2023, Mayor Adams announced a compromise redesign for McGuinness Boulevard, a notorious Brooklyn corridor. The Department of Transportation will install curbside protected bike lanes and reduce car lanes from two to one in each direction on most of the strip. However, north of Calyer Street, two lanes for cars will remain open during weekdays, reverting to parking lanes at night and on weekends. The plan, shaped after lobbying by business interests and mayoral adviser Ingrid Lewis-Martin, mixes two previous DOT proposals. Mayoral spokesman Charles Lutvak said, 'Traffic safety is a key priority for Mayor Adams, and we are delivering with a redesign of McGuinness Boulevard that will make this corridor safer for all road users.' Local officials, including Council Member Lincoln Restler, called it a 'critical step' but noted it lacks key safety elements. The compromise leaves gaps. Since 2021, 62 people have been injured on this stretch. The carnage continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident happened near Meeker Avenue, one block from where teacher Matthew Jensen was killed in 2021. The matter, titled 'Locals call for mayor to take immediate action after moped rider injured on McGuinness Boulevard,' highlights the urgent need for the Department of Transportation’s proposed safety redesign. Restler, along with U.S. Rep. Nydia Velázquez, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, and State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, issued a joint statement: 'Lives are being put at risk. We need immediate action by the Mayor's office to implement the Department of Transportation's proposed safety improvements so that everyone in our community can feel confident that McGuinness Boulevard will not cause more tragedies.' The safety plan remains blocked, leaving vulnerable road users exposed to ongoing danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident, near the site of a 2021 fatality, drew a joint statement from Rep. Nydia Velázquez, Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, and Council Member Lincoln Restler. They called the crash 'entirely predictable' and demanded Mayor Adams immediately implement the Department of Transportation’s stalled safety redesign. The DOT’s plan, which includes narrowing the street and adding a protected bike lane, faces opposition from powerful donors. The mayor’s office claims traffic safety is a priority, but the plan remains in limbo. Advocates and officials say every delay puts more lives at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Their letter to the Traffic Mobility Review Board states: 'No one community should disproportionately bear the burden of the cars and trucks passing through their neighborhood.' Hanif, along with Lincoln Restler, Alexa Avilés, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Crystal Hudson, joined borough, state, and federal colleagues in this push. They propose a credit system to balance costs between DOT bridges and MTA tunnels, aiming to protect neighborhoods like the Brooklyn waterfront and the BQE corridor from traffic surges. The MTA declined comment. The Board will soon set final toll rates and rules. The federal government has approved the congestion pricing plan, with tolls for cars expected between $9 and $23. Over 100 exemption requests, including from taxi and for-hire vehicle drivers, are under review.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
