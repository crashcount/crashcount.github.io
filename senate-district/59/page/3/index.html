Sixteen seriously hurt.</strong> In just the first eight months of this year, the streets of Senate District 59 have claimed more lives than last year—a 250% jump in deaths. The numbers do not flinch: since January 2022, <strong>22 people have died and 45 have suffered life-altering injuries</strong> in 8,414 crashes. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, parents, children. On July 29, a 65-year-old man riding his e-bike on Second Avenue was struck by a 21-year-old unlicensed driver in a Nissan SUV. The driver fled, leaving the man with a shattered skull on the pavement. Police found him later. He told them he ran because he had no license. <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/driver-arrested-after-hitting-65-year-old-e-biker-on-second-ave-XF4896347>He now faces charges of leaving the scene of an accident that caused serious injury and driving without a license.</a></p><h3 id=the-pattern-who-pays-the-price>The Pattern: Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> They caused 666 injuries or deaths to pedestrians here. Trucks and buses added 60 more. Motorcycles and mopeds, 43. Bikes, 55. The old, the young, the ones on foot or two wheels—they pay the price. The street does not care if you are careful. It only cares if you are exposed.</p><h3 id=leadership-what-has-been-done-what-must-be-done>Leadership: What Has Been Done, What Must Be Done</h3><p>State Senator Kristen Gonzalez has not been silent. She co-sponsored and voted yes on the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, a bill to force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. She backed the push for a 20 mph slow zone in Greenpoint and Williamsburg, where the death rate is among the city&rsquo;s worst. She joined calls to open the Queensboro Bridge pedestrian path and to defend protected bike lanes in Astoria, even as businesses sued to block them. The city, she said with others, must act: <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/09/pols-demand-adams-open-queensboro-bridge-pedestrian-path>&ldquo;Any further delays to this project that is otherwise ready to open will unnecessarily put at risk the thousands of New Yorkers who cycle and walk the current shared path every day.&rdquo;</a></p><p>But the blood keeps coming. The numbers keep rising. <strong>No law, no ribbon-cutting, no press release will bring back the dead.</strong></p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand the Stop Super Speeders Act become law. Demand protected bike lanes and open bridges.</strong></p><p><strong>Every day you wait is another day someone does not come home.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Department of Transportation (DOT) had closed the street to traffic during G train repairs, but plans to reopen it to vehicles. The matter, described as a push to 'continue this vital public space project as a permanent fixture,' drew support from Rep. Nydia Velázquez and State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, who sent letters urging DOT to make the plaza permanent. Local organizations, businesses, and over 3,100 petitioners back the effort, citing increased community use and safety. Previous concerns about traffic and safety did not materialize. The plaza is part of a broader movement to reclaim streets for pedestrians in Greenpoint and Williamsburg.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Gallagher stated, 'Nothing to slow traffic on Nassau: no signal, stop sign, even a painted crosswalk.' The officials urged immediate installation of pedestrian safety measures and renewed calls for policy changes to protect vulnerable road users.

Nydia Velázquez called for passage of two state bills: one requiring repeat speeding offenders to install intelligent speed assistance devices, and Sammy's Law, which would let the City Council lower speed limits. They also urged the Department of Transportation to install raised crosswalks and daylighting at intersections. Their statement reads: “Lowering the speed limit and enforcing real accountability for dangerous drivers are urgent steps we must take to protect New Yorkers.”</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the driver failed to yield the right-of-way. The report states, 'A Dodge pickup turned left. A 49-year-old woman crossed in the marked crosswalk. The truck struck her head-on.' The woman suffered fatal head injuries and severe bleeding, dying at the scene. The driver, a licensed man, was not injured and his vehicle sustained no damage. The police report explicitly cites 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as the contributing factor. The victim was crossing without a signal but within a marked crosswalk, as noted in the police report, after the driver’s error. The crash underscores the lethal consequences of driver failure to yield at intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The compromise left two car lanes in each direction during the day. Elected officials—U.S. Rep. Nydia Velázquez, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, and Council Member Lincoln Restler—sent a letter urging DOT to restore the full safety plan, writing, “Nothing has been done to improve conditions for pedestrians.” Advocates say the new design increases crossing distances and leaves cyclists and pedestrians exposed.

The bill would require environmental reviews for warehouses over 50,000 square feet, mandate plans to cut air pollution, and push for zero-emission delivery vehicles. Gonzalez said, 'The unchecked growth of large warehouses in neighborhoods across NYC has worsened air quality, noise pollution, and traffic safety for everyday New Yorkers.' Assembly Member Marcela Mitaynes, a co-sponsor, highlighted the link between warehouse traffic, pollution, and traffic violence. The Red Hook Business Alliance and community advocates back the bill, citing heavy truck traffic, poor air, and threats to safety in working-class neighborhoods.
