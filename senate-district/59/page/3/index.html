Thirty-six left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 3,600 hurt since 2022. The dead include cyclists, pedestrians, children. The living carry scars. In the last year alone, five lost their lives. More than a thousand were injured. Two children struck in Astoria. A seven-year-old girl with a broken femur, her head bloodied on the sidewalk. A 14-year-old girl and a man, both hit, both lucky to live. The driver was unlicensed. The car did not stop. Police <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/04/us-news/out-of-control-nyc-driver-hits-two-kids-1-adult-during-evening-rush-leaving-girl-7-with-broken-femur-cops/>reported an out-of-control unlicensed driver rammed into two kids and one adult outside a Queens charter school</a>.</p><p>On India Street, a man stepped from his car. An e-bike ran the stop sign. He died there. A witness <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-by-e-bike-delivery-worker-who-blew-stop-sign-in-greenpoint-witnesses-say>said he died basically on the spot</a>. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a unicorn incident. It&rsquo;s happened a lot.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=what-has-been-done>What Has Been Done</h2><p><strong>Senator Kristen Gonzalez has not been silent.</strong> She backed the <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/03/06/greenpoint-and-williamsburg-beg-dot-for-20mph-slow-zone>call for a 20 mph speed limit in Greenpoint and Williamsburg</a>, joining local officials and community boards after another fatal year. She <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>voted yes on a bill to force safer street designs statewide</a>. She <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S5008>co-sponsored a bill for automated bike lane enforcement</a>, and another to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S3832>require advanced safety tech in all vehicles</a>. After a repeat speeder nearly killed a woman in Greenpoint, Gonzalez and others <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/02/22/serious-crash-in-greenpoint>demanded Albany pass laws to force speed controls on the worst drivers and let the city lower speed limits</a>. They called for raised crosswalks, daylighting, and one-way conversions. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/02/22/serious-crash-in-greenpoint>Lowering the speed limit and enforcing real accountability for dangerous drivers are urgent steps we must take to protect New Yorkers</a>, they said.</p><p>But the street does not wait for laws. The city delays. The mayor <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/09/pols-demand-adams-open-queensboro-bridge-pedestrian-path>stalls safety redesigns</a>. The bridge path stays closed. The blood dries on the curb.</p><h2 id=what-must-come-next>What Must Come Next</h2><p><strong>Every day without action is another day of risk.</strong> Call Gonzalez. Call your council member. Demand the city use its new power to lower speed limits. Demand Albany pass the bills that force reckless drivers off the road. Demand the mayor open the bridge, fix the streets, and protect the people who walk and ride. <strong>Do not wait for another child’s shoe in the crosswalk.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Nydia Velázquez called for passage of two state bills: one requiring repeat speeding offenders to install intelligent speed assistance devices, and Sammy's Law, which would let the City Council lower speed limits.

The bill would require environmental reviews for warehouses over 50,000 square feet, mandate plans to cut air pollution, and push for zero-emission delivery vehicles. Gonzalez said, 'The unchecked growth of large warehouses in neighborhoods across NYC has worsened air quality, noise pollution, and traffic safety for everyday New Yorkers.' Assembly Member Marcela Mitaynes, a co-sponsor, highlighted the link between warehouse traffic, pollution, and traffic violence. The Red Hook Business Alliance and community advocates back the bill, citing heavy truck traffic, poor air, and threats to safety in working-class neighborhoods.

Cyclists and pedestrians have died. Drivers speed, double-park, and ignore signals. Councilwoman Cabán and others demand urgent action. DOT vows to return with a safety plan.</p><p class=mb3>On September 14, 2023, the Department of Transportation held a public street safety workshop in Astoria, Queens, following a surge in traffic violence. The event, covered on September 18, 2023, drew over 200 residents and was organized by Western Queens elected officials. The workshop addressed a 'significant increase in traffic-related deaths, including several high-profile fatalities involving cyclists and pedestrians.' Councilwoman Tiffany Cabán, State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, and Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani called the deaths preventable and demanded urgent changes. Cabán stated, 'If it saves lives, it’s worth doing.' DOT officials, including Queens Borough Commissioner Nicole Garcia and senior program manager Kyle Gorman, presented plans for 31st Avenue and collected resident feedback on dangerous driving, lack of protected bike lanes, and unsafe intersections. The DOT pledged to return with a proposal. No formal bill number or committee was cited; the event focused on immediate community engagement and systemic change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation's new plan, described as a 'compromised version,' adds protected bike lanes but keeps two car lanes during peak hours from Calyer Street to the Pulaski Bridge. The matter, titled 'Relief in Greenpoint as compromise reached on McGuinness Boulevard redesign,' reflects years of advocacy for safer streets. Restler, along with Borough President Reynoso and others, welcomed the changes and pledged to push for swift implementation. Advocacy group Make McGuinness Safe criticized the compromise as 'less effective and less safe,' blaming business opposition for watering down the original plan. The compromise marks a partial win for vulnerable road users, but falls short of the full road diet advocates demanded.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No one is satisfied.</p><p class=mb3>On August 16, 2023, Mayor Adams announced a compromise redesign for McGuinness Boulevard, a notorious Brooklyn corridor. The Department of Transportation will install curbside protected bike lanes and reduce car lanes from two to one in each direction on most of the strip. However, north of Calyer Street, two lanes for cars will remain open during weekdays, reverting to parking lanes at night and on weekends. The plan, shaped after lobbying by business interests and mayoral adviser Ingrid Lewis-Martin, mixes two previous DOT proposals. Mayoral spokesman Charles Lutvak said, 'Traffic safety is a key priority for Mayor Adams, and we are delivering with a redesign of McGuinness Boulevard that will make this corridor safer for all road users.' Local officials, including Council Member Lincoln Restler, called it a 'critical step' but noted it lacks key safety elements. The compromise leaves gaps. Since 2021, 62 people have been injured on this stretch. The carnage continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
