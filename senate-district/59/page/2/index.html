Thirty-six left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 3,600 hurt since 2022. The dead include cyclists, pedestrians, children. The living carry scars. In the last year alone, five lost their lives. More than a thousand were injured. Two children struck in Astoria. A seven-year-old girl with a broken femur, her head bloodied on the sidewalk. A 14-year-old girl and a man, both hit, both lucky to live. The driver was unlicensed. The car did not stop. Police <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/04/us-news/out-of-control-nyc-driver-hits-two-kids-1-adult-during-evening-rush-leaving-girl-7-with-broken-femur-cops/>reported an out-of-control unlicensed driver rammed into two kids and one adult outside a Queens charter school</a>.</p><p>On India Street, a man stepped from his car. An e-bike ran the stop sign. He died there. A witness <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-by-e-bike-delivery-worker-who-blew-stop-sign-in-greenpoint-witnesses-say>said he died basically on the spot</a>. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a unicorn incident. It&rsquo;s happened a lot.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=what-has-been-done>What Has Been Done</h2><p><strong>Senator Kristen Gonzalez has not been silent.</strong> She backed the <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/03/06/greenpoint-and-williamsburg-beg-dot-for-20mph-slow-zone>call for a 20 mph speed limit in Greenpoint and Williamsburg</a>, joining local officials and community boards after another fatal year. She <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>voted yes on a bill to force safer street designs statewide</a>. She <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S5008>co-sponsored a bill for automated bike lane enforcement</a>, and another to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S3832>require advanced safety tech in all vehicles</a>. After a repeat speeder nearly killed a woman in Greenpoint, Gonzalez and others <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/02/22/serious-crash-in-greenpoint>demanded Albany pass laws to force speed controls on the worst drivers and let the city lower speed limits</a>. They called for raised crosswalks, daylighting, and one-way conversions. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/02/22/serious-crash-in-greenpoint>Lowering the speed limit and enforcing real accountability for dangerous drivers are urgent steps we must take to protect New Yorkers</a>, they said.</p><p>But the street does not wait for laws. The city delays. The mayor <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/09/pols-demand-adams-open-queensboro-bridge-pedestrian-path>stalls safety redesigns</a>. The bridge path stays closed. The blood dries on the curb.</p><h2 id=what-must-come-next>What Must Come Next</h2><p><strong>Every day without action is another day of risk.</strong> Call Gonzalez. Call your council member. Demand the city use its new power to lower speed limits. Demand Albany pass the bills that force reckless drivers off the road. Demand the mayor open the bridge, fix the streets, and protect the people who walk and ride. <strong>Do not wait for another child’s shoe in the crosswalk.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The driver, Stanley Manel, was charged with failure to yield and failure to exercise due care. Gonzalez, representing District 59, called for the state to pass stricter traffic laws targeting drivers with multiple school zone speed camera violations, noting Manel's history of speeding. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher joined Gonzalez, highlighting the lack of traffic calming on Nassau Avenue, where Aber was killed. Gallagher stated, 'Nothing to slow traffic on Nassau: no signal, stop sign, even a painted crosswalk.' The officials urged immediate installation of pedestrian safety measures and renewed calls for policy changes to protect vulnerable road users. The incident marks the first traffic fatality in Northern Brooklyn in 2024, underscoring systemic failures in street design and enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The group—Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, Council Member Lincoln Restler, and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velázquez—called for passage of two state bills: one mandating intelligent speed assistance devices for drivers with six or more speeding tickets in a year, and 'Sammy’s Law,' which would let the City Council lower speed limits. Their statement read, 'We’re calling on the New York State legislature to pass two critical bills that would lead to fewer incidents of traffic violence.' They also urged the Department of Transportation to install raised crosswalks and daylighting at intersections, and to convert Nassau and Norman avenues to one-way streets.
