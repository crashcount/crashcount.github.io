Forty-one have been seriously injured.</strong> The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old. In the last twelve months alone, six more lives ended. Over a thousand were hurt. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><p>A man, 49, was killed by a bus at 3rd Avenue and East 28th. A cyclist, 36, died on 34th Avenue. A pedestrian, 49, was struck down by an e-bike on India Street. A 15-year-old boy fell from a subway train at Queensboro Plaza. The city moves on. The families do not.</p><h3 id=the-system-fails-again-and-again>The System Fails, Again and Again</h3><p><strong>Most of these deaths could have been stopped.</strong> The drivers who kill are often repeat offenders. The streets are built for speed, not safety. The city knows this. The state knows it too. &ldquo;This was as avoidable as it is tragic,&rdquo; <a href=https://licpost.com/bronx-boy-killed-subway-surfing-queensboro-plaza-long-island-city>said NYC Transit President Demetrius Crichlow</a> after the boy died at Queensboro Plaza. The words are cold. The loss is not.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Senator Kristen Gonzalez has not been silent. She backed the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, which would force the worst repeat offenders to slow down. She co-sponsored a <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S3304>bill for automated bike lane enforcement</a>, and another to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S3832>mandate safety tech in all vehicles</a>. She called for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/02/22/serious-crash-in-greenpoint>lower speed limits</a> and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/20/dot-stands-by-astoria-bike-lane-plan-despite-foes-childish-outbursts>better street design</a>. But the pace is slow. The bills crawl. The bodies pile up.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day someone dies.</strong> Call Senator Gonzalez. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand the city use its new power to slow the streets. Demand that repeat speeders are taken off the road. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The policy charges most drivers $9 to enter south of 60th Street during peak hours. The matter, titled 'Congestion pricing set to begin at midnight Sunday as federal judge clears path for Manhattan toll,' has drawn sharp lines. Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30, Queens) opposes the toll, warning, 'I don't know how my district is going to be impacted.' He fears more cars parking in Queens and unclear pollution risks. Council Member Kristy Marmorato (Bronx) calls it a 'cash grab.' In contrast, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez and Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas support the measure, citing cleaner air, safer streets, and transit upgrades. González-Rojas says, 'Congestion pricing isn't about penalizing anyone—it's about modernizing our transportation system and tackling climate change.' The judge ordered further study on environmental impacts, but the toll begins as scheduled.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The cyclist hit the pedestrian head-on, causing severe head trauma; the victim lay semiconscious on the asphalt with a cracked skull. The cyclist did not remain at the scene and continued riding north. The report notes the pedestrian stepped into the street without a signal, but does not list any driver errors or contributing factors beyond 'Unspecified.' The critical driver error highlighted is the cyclist's failure to stop after the crash, as detailed: 'The rider did not stop. The bike rode on.' This incident underscores the persistent dangers faced by pedestrians on New York City streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation (DOT) had closed the street to traffic during G train repairs, but plans to reopen it to vehicles. The matter, described as a push to 'continue this vital public space project as a permanent fixture,' drew support from Rep. Nydia Velázquez and State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, who sent letters urging DOT to make the plaza permanent. Local organizations, businesses, and over 3,100 petitioners back the effort, citing increased community use and safety. Previous concerns about traffic and safety did not materialize. The plaza is part of a broader movement to reclaim streets for pedestrians in Greenpoint and Williamsburg.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The driver, Stanley Manel, was charged with failure to yield and failure to exercise due care. Gonzalez, representing District 59, called for the state to pass stricter traffic laws targeting drivers with multiple school zone speed camera violations, noting Manel's history of speeding. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher joined Gonzalez, highlighting the lack of traffic calming on Nassau Avenue, where Aber was killed. Gallagher stated, 'Nothing to slow traffic on Nassau: no signal, stop sign, even a painted crosswalk.' The officials urged immediate installation of pedestrian safety measures and renewed calls for policy changes to protect vulnerable road users. The incident marks the first traffic fatality in Northern Brooklyn in 2024, underscoring systemic failures in street design and enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
