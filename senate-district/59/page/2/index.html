Since January 2022, <strong>21 people have died</strong> and <strong>4,135 have been injured</strong> in crashes here. <strong>Forty-five of those injuries were serious.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, eight people lost their lives. The dead do not get a second chance. The injured carry it with them.</p><p>Just last week, a 65-year-old man rode his e-bike down Second Avenue. A 21-year-old, driving a Nissan Rogue without a license, struck him and fled. The cyclist was left with severe head trauma, &ldquo;unconscious when paramedics arrived and they immediately started doing CPR and quickly put him in the ambulance&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/30/hit-and-run-rogue-driver-caught-after-seriously-injuring-cycling-senior-in-heart-of-the-city>Streetsblog NYC</a>). The driver later told police he ran because &ldquo;he did not have a license&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/driver-arrested-after-hitting-65-year-old-e-biker-on-second-ave-XF4896347>West Side Spirit</a>).</p><p>A week before, a firefighter died on the FDR Drive. He fell from his motorcycle and was struck by a car. The driver did not stay. The city lost a man who had once pulled others from fire. Now, his name is another line in a report.</p><h3 id=patterns-that-kill>Patterns That Kill</h3><p>The numbers do not lie. <strong>Cars and trucks</strong> caused the most harm: 1 death, 475 minor injuries, 183 moderate injuries, 6 serious injuries. <strong>Motorcycles and mopeds</strong>: 0 deaths, 32 minor injuries, 11 moderate. <strong>Bikes</strong>: 2 deaths, 37 minor, 13 moderate, 3 serious. The violence is not random. It is relentless.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Senator Kristen Gonzalez has not been silent. She <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>co-sponsored and voted yes</a> on a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting devices. She <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/03/06/greenpoint-and-williamsburg-beg-dot-for-20mph-slow-zone>backed the push</a> for a 20 mph slow zone in Greenpoint and Williamsburg, writing to DOT with other officials after a deadly year. She <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/08/dot-stands-by-astoria-safety-project-despite-foes-anti-bike-lawsuit>stood with local leaders</a> to demand protected bike lanes in Astoria, even as businesses sued to stop them.</p><p>But the blood keeps coming. The city and state move slow. Each delay is another family broken.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-donow>What You Can Do—Now</h3><p><strong>Call Senator Gonzalez. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed limiters for repeat offenders. Demand protected bike lanes and daylight at every corner.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The street will not wait.

The Department of Transportation had planned to open the dedicated walkway on March 16, but the mayor's office intervened, citing the need for a briefing. The lawmakers wrote, 'The reasons given for this delay are not satisfactory, as all communications from the DOT have indicated that the project is complete and ready to open to the public.' They warned, 'Any further delays to this project that is otherwise ready to open will unnecessarily put at risk the thousands of New Yorkers who cycle and walk the current shared path every day.' The project, in the works since at least 2017, remains stalled. Cyclists and pedestrians are forced to share a cramped, hazardous lane.

The measure, supported by 40 groups and nearly all local elected officials, marks the first neighborhood-wide slow zone request since the passage of Sammy's Law. The board's action follows letters from Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez, and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velazquez to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. They cited CB1's high fatality rate—3.27 deaths per 10,000 residents, above the city average. The board's vote was contentious, with pro-driving members opposing the change. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno acknowledged the support and promised more information on slow zones for outer boroughs. Council Member Lincoln Restler later joined the call for lower speeds.

The incident involved a convertible traveling north striking the right rear bumper of a westbound sedan.

The woman, riding as a front passenger and secured by a lap belt and harness, was injured when the convertible hit the sedan, shattering glass. The report does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor. The focus remains on driver actions: alcohol use and failure to obey traffic controls.

The report states the rider was 'partially ejected' and suffered 'crush injuries' to his leg, remaining conscious at the scene. The police cite 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Following Too Closely' as contributing factors in the crash. The motorcycle's point of impact was the left front bumper, colliding with the Jeep's center back end. The rider was wearing a helmet, as documented in the report.

The policy charges most drivers $9 to enter south of 60th Street during peak hours. The matter, titled 'Congestion pricing set to begin at midnight Sunday as federal judge clears path for Manhattan toll,' has drawn sharp lines. Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30, Queens) opposes the toll, warning, 'I don't know how my district is going to be impacted.' He fears more cars parking in Queens and unclear pollution risks. Council Member Kristy Marmorato (Bronx) calls it a 'cash grab.' In contrast, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez and Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas support the measure, citing cleaner air, safer streets, and transit upgrades. González-Rojas says, 'Congestion pricing isn't about penalizing anyone—it's about modernizing our transportation system and tackling climate change.' The judge ordered further study on environmental impacts, but the toll begins as scheduled.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
