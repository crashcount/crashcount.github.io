Since 2022, 19 people have died in traffic crashes here. Forty-one more suffered serious injuries. In the last year alone, six people died, and over a thousand were hurt. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old. They only rise.</p><p>A man is killed by a bus at an intersection. A cyclist is struck down by a turning truck. A pedestrian is left bleeding on the asphalt. The details change. The outcome does not. Every death is a family broken, a life ended for nothing.</p><h2 id=the-system-fails-the-vulnerable>The System Fails the Vulnerable</h2><p>Cars and trucks do most of the killing. They account for the largest share of deaths and injuries. But the danger is everywhere. Bikes, mopeds, buses—all can maim or kill. The city adds bike lanes, lowers speed limits, installs cameras. Still, the bodies pile up.</p><p>After a woman was killed by a repeat speeder in Greenpoint, leaders called for action. &ldquo;Lowering the speed limit and enforcing real accountability for dangerous drivers are urgent steps we must take to protect New Yorkers,&rdquo; said a coalition including Senator Kristen Gonzalez (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/02/22/serious-crash-in-greenpoint>called for action</a>). But the speeders keep coming. The crosswalks are still unprotected. The law moves slow. The cars move fast.</p><h2 id=leadership-progress-and-pressure>Leadership: Progress and Pressure</h2><p>Senator Kristen Gonzalez has backed bills to curb repeat speeders and clear bike lanes. She voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force chronic violators to install <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>speed limiters</a>. She co-sponsored a bill for <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S3304>automated bike lane enforcement</a>. She joined calls for lower speed limits and safer street design after <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/02/25/greenpoint-woman-dies-from-injuries-sustained-in-crash>fatal crashes</a>.</p><p>But laws on paper do not stop a car in the crosswalk. Advocates must keep the pressure on. Every delay means another name on the list. Every compromise is another mother left waiting at the hospital. &ldquo;We’re calling on the New York State legislature to pass two critical bills that would lead to fewer incidents of traffic violence,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/02/25/greenpoint-woman-dies-from-injuries-sustained-in-crash>Gonzalez and others said</a> after another death.</p><h2 id=act-now-demand-more-than-words>Act Now: Demand More Than Words</h2><p>The crisis is not over. Call Senator Gonzalez. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed limiters for repeat offenders. Demand daylighted intersections and protected bike lanes. Do not wait for another funeral.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The impact occurred at the center front end of the e-bike, causing severe head injuries and fatal bleeding to the pedestrian. The police report describes the victim as 'crossing, no signal, or crosswalk' and 'not at intersection,' but the primary focus remains on the unlicensed status of the e-bike operator and the disregard for traffic control.

The measure, supported by 40 groups and nearly all local elected officials, marks the first neighborhood-wide slow zone request since the passage of Sammy's Law. The board's action follows letters from Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez, and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velazquez to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. They cited CB1's high fatality rate—3.27 deaths per 10,000 residents, above the city average. The board's vote was contentious, with pro-driving members opposing the change. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno acknowledged the support and promised more information on slow zones for outer boroughs. Council Member Lincoln Restler later joined the call for lower speeds. The measure now awaits DOT action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The policy charges most drivers $9 to enter south of 60th Street during peak hours. The matter, titled 'Congestion pricing set to begin at midnight Sunday as federal judge clears path for Manhattan toll,' has drawn sharp lines. Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30, Queens) opposes the toll, warning, 'I don't know how my district is going to be impacted.' He fears more cars parking in Queens and unclear pollution risks. Council Member Kristy Marmorato (Bronx) calls it a 'cash grab.' In contrast, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez and Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas support the measure, citing cleaner air, safer streets, and transit upgrades. González-Rojas says, 'Congestion pricing isn't about penalizing anyone—it's about modernizing our transportation system and tackling climate change.'

The moped rider, a 33-year-old man, suffered chest crush injuries and was partially ejected from his vehicle. He remained conscious at the scene. The police report lists 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Unsafe Speed' as contributing factors in the crash. The Jeep’s right side doors bore the brunt of the impact. The moped’s front end was destroyed. The moped rider was unlicensed, but the report centers driver error—failure to yield—as a primary cause. The violence of the crash left the street quiet, the aftermath marked by twisted metal and injury.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation (DOT) had closed the street to traffic during G train repairs, but plans to reopen it to vehicles. The matter, described as a push to 'continue this vital public space project as a permanent fixture,' drew support from Rep. Nydia Velázquez and State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, who sent letters urging DOT to make the plaza permanent. Local organizations, businesses, and over 3,100 petitioners back the effort, citing increased community use and safety. Previous concerns about traffic and safety did not materialize.
