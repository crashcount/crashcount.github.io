Sixteen seriously hurt.</strong> In just the first eight months of this year, the streets of Senate District 59 have claimed more lives than last year—a 250% jump in deaths. The numbers do not flinch: since January 2022, <strong>22 people have died and 45 have suffered life-altering injuries</strong> in 8,414 crashes. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, parents, children. On July 29, a 65-year-old man riding his e-bike on Second Avenue was struck by a 21-year-old unlicensed driver in a Nissan SUV. The driver fled, leaving the man with a shattered skull on the pavement. Police found him later. He told them he ran because he had no license. <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/driver-arrested-after-hitting-65-year-old-e-biker-on-second-ave-XF4896347>He now faces charges of leaving the scene of an accident that caused serious injury and driving without a license.</a></p><h3 id=the-pattern-who-pays-the-price>The Pattern: Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> They caused 666 injuries or deaths to pedestrians here. Trucks and buses added 60 more. Motorcycles and mopeds, 43. Bikes, 55. The old, the young, the ones on foot or two wheels—they pay the price. The street does not care if you are careful. It only cares if you are exposed.</p><h3 id=leadership-what-has-been-done-what-must-be-done>Leadership: What Has Been Done, What Must Be Done</h3><p>State Senator Kristen Gonzalez has not been silent. She co-sponsored and voted yes on the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, a bill to force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. She backed the push for a 20 mph slow zone in Greenpoint and Williamsburg, where the death rate is among the city&rsquo;s worst. She joined calls to open the Queensboro Bridge pedestrian path and to defend protected bike lanes in Astoria, even as businesses sued to block them. The city, she said with others, must act: <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/09/pols-demand-adams-open-queensboro-bridge-pedestrian-path>&ldquo;Any further delays to this project that is otherwise ready to open will unnecessarily put at risk the thousands of New Yorkers who cycle and walk the current shared path every day.&rdquo;</a></p><p>But the blood keeps coming. The numbers keep rising. <strong>No law, no ribbon-cutting, no press release will bring back the dead.</strong></p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand the Stop Super Speeders Act become law. Demand protected bike lanes and open bridges.</strong></p><p><strong>Every day you wait is another day someone does not come home.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Department of Transportation had planned to open the dedicated walkway on March 16, but the mayor's office intervened, citing the need for a briefing. The lawmakers wrote, 'The reasons given for this delay are not satisfactory, as all communications from the DOT have indicated that the project is complete and ready to open to the public.' They warned, 'Any further delays to this project that is otherwise ready to open will unnecessarily put at risk the thousands of New Yorkers who cycle and walk the current shared path every day.' The project, in the works since at least 2017, remains stalled. Cyclists and pedestrians are forced to share a cramped, hazardous lane. City Hall insists on more review, while advocates plan a protest ribbon-cutting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The impact occurred at the center front end of the e-bike, causing severe head injuries and fatal bleeding to the pedestrian. The police report describes the victim as 'crossing, no signal, or crosswalk' and 'not at intersection,' but the primary focus remains on the unlicensed status of the e-bike operator and the disregard for traffic control.

The measure, supported by 40 groups and nearly all local elected officials, marks the first neighborhood-wide slow zone request since the passage of Sammy's Law. The board's action follows letters from Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez, and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velazquez to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. They cited CB1's high fatality rate—3.27 deaths per 10,000 residents, above the city average. The board's vote was contentious, with pro-driving members opposing the change. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno acknowledged the support and promised more information on slow zones for outer boroughs. Council Member Lincoln Restler later joined the call for lower speeds. The measure now awaits DOT action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cars pay to cross south of 60th. Lawmakers split. Some call it a burden. Others hail cleaner air, safer streets, and better transit. The toll stirs anger, hope, and a fight over who pays and who breathes.</p><p class=mb3>On January 3, 2025, congestion pricing (no bill number cited) will begin in Manhattan after a federal judge allowed the toll to proceed. The policy charges most drivers $9 to enter south of 60th Street during peak hours. The matter, titled 'Congestion pricing set to begin at midnight Sunday as federal judge clears path for Manhattan toll,' has drawn sharp lines. Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30, Queens) opposes the toll, warning, 'I don't know how my district is going to be impacted.' He fears more cars parking in Queens and unclear pollution risks. Council Member Kristy Marmorato (Bronx) calls it a 'cash grab.' In contrast, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez and Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas support the measure, citing cleaner air, safer streets, and transit upgrades. González-Rojas says, 'Congestion pricing isn't about penalizing anyone—it's about modernizing our transportation system and tackling climate change.' The judge ordered further study on environmental impacts, but the toll begins as scheduled.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The impact from the taxi’s right front bumper caused severe lacerations to her pelvis. The report states she remained conscious and bleeding at the scene. The narrative notes, 'The cab kept straight. The road kept moving. No one stopped.' Driver inattention or distraction is listed as a contributing factor, highlighting systemic danger for pedestrians on high-speed corridors. The police report also cites 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a contributing factor, but only after noting the driver’s inattention. The woman was not at an intersection, according to the report.
