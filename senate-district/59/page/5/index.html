Since January 2022, <strong>21 people have died</strong> and <strong>4,135 have been injured</strong> in crashes here. <strong>Forty-five of those injuries were serious.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, eight people lost their lives. The dead do not get a second chance. The injured carry it with them.</p><p>Just last week, a 65-year-old man rode his e-bike down Second Avenue. A 21-year-old, driving a Nissan Rogue without a license, struck him and fled. The cyclist was left with severe head trauma, &ldquo;unconscious when paramedics arrived and they immediately started doing CPR and quickly put him in the ambulance&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/30/hit-and-run-rogue-driver-caught-after-seriously-injuring-cycling-senior-in-heart-of-the-city>Streetsblog NYC</a>).

He fell from his motorcycle and was struck by a car. The driver did not stay. The city lost a man who had once pulled others from fire. Now, his name is another line in a report.</p><h3 id=patterns-that-kill>Patterns That Kill</h3><p>The numbers do not lie. <strong>Cars and trucks</strong> caused the most harm: 1 death, 475 minor injuries, 183 moderate injuries, 6 serious injuries. <strong>Motorcycles and mopeds</strong>: 0 deaths, 32 minor injuries, 11 moderate. <strong>Bikes</strong>: 2 deaths, 37 minor, 13 moderate, 3 serious. The violence is not random. It is relentless.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Senator Kristen Gonzalez has not been silent. She <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>co-sponsored and voted yes</a> on a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting devices. She <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/03/06/greenpoint-and-williamsburg-beg-dot-for-20mph-slow-zone>backed the push</a> for a 20 mph slow zone in Greenpoint and Williamsburg, writing to DOT with other officials after a deadly year. She <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/08/dot-stands-by-astoria-safety-project-despite-foes-anti-bike-lawsuit>stood with local leaders</a> to demand protected bike lanes in Astoria, even as businesses sued to stop them.</p><p>But the blood keeps coming. The city and state move slow. Each delay is another family broken.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-donow>What You Can Do—Now</h3><p><strong>Call Senator Gonzalez. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed limiters for repeat offenders. Demand protected bike lanes and daylight at every corner.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.

Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On February 10, 2023, eighteen Brooklyn lawmakers issued a joint letter demanding New York State Department of Transportation (DOT) participate in comprehensive planning for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens. Jabari Brisport, Julia Salazar, Kristen Gonzalez, Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Members Bobby Carroll, Maritza Davila, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Emily Gallagher, Jo Anne Simon, Marcela Mitaynes, and Council Members Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Lincoln Restler. Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint. Without state action, only city-owned segments see attention. The city’s efforts are limited.

Politicians and residents demand safer streets, better enforcement, and an end to car dominance.
