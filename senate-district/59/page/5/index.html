Since 2022, 19 people have died and 3,850 have been injured in crashes here. Forty-one were left with wounds so deep they are called serious injuries. The dead do not get second chances. The living carry scars.</p><p>Last spring, a cyclist was killed on India Street in Greenpoint. A bike ran a stop, a man died. The city called it a statistic. His family called it a life. The record shows: &ldquo;Severe bleeding&rdquo; and &ldquo;Apparent Death&rdquo; for a man crossing the street, struck by a rider who did not stop, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>A few months before, a woman in Greenpoint was hit by a driver with 26 prior speed camera violations. She died. The driver kept his license until the day he killed. Officials said, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/02/22/serious-crash-in-greenpoint>&ldquo;Lowering the speed limit and enforcing real accountability for dangerous drivers are urgent steps we must take to protect New Yorkers.&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=who-pays-who-acts>Who Pays, Who Acts</h3><p>The pain is not spread even. Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt. Cars and trucks did the most harm: 628 pedestrian injuries, 5 deaths. Bikes killed 2, injured 53. Motorcycles and mopeds, 42 injuries, no deaths. The numbers do not lie. The city’s most vulnerable are left to fend for themselves.</p><h3 id=senator-gonzalez-votes-words-and-the-waiting>Senator Gonzalez: Votes, Words, and the Waiting</h3><p>Senator Kristen Gonzalez has not been silent. She co-sponsored the bill to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters. She voted yes. She called for lower speed limits and for the city to act. After the Greenpoint death, she said, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/02/25/greenpoint-woman-dies-from-injuries-sustained-in-crash>&ldquo;We’re calling on the New York State legislature to pass two critical bills that would lead to fewer incidents of traffic violence.&rdquo;</a></p><p>She backed the 20 mph slow zone for Greenpoint and Williamsburg. She signed the letter to open the Queensboro Bridge path for walkers and cyclists. She has voted for school speed zones. The bills are good. The deaths keep coming.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now</h3><p>The street is still hungry. The law moves slow. The city waits. The dead do not wait. Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed limiters for repeat offenders. Demand streets that do not kill.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
