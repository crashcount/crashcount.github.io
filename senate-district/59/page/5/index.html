Forty-four suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. The numbers do not slow. In the last year alone, deaths more than doubled. Five dead, 734 injured, 15 left with wounds called &ldquo;serious&rdquo; by the city.</p><p>Just last week, a firefighter died on the FDR Drive. He fell from his motorcycle. A car hit him and kept going. Police said, &ldquo;he was struck by an unknown vehicle that did not remain on the scene&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/31-year-old-firefighter-matthew-goicochea-killed-overnight-motorcycle-crash-fdr-drive-fdny-says/17279439/>ABC7</a>). No arrest. No answers. The road is fast, the city is silent.</p><p>A cyclist was struck on McGuinness Boulevard. The driver turned and hit him. There was no protected lane. &ldquo;The fact is that this wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem if Mayor Adams had just done what he had promised to do, which was, make all of McGuinness safe,&rdquo; said a local advocate (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/20/cyclist-badly-hurt-on-segment-of-mcguinness-blvd-that-mayor-adams-refused-to-make-safe>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> Cars and trucks caused 655 injuries or deaths to people on foot. Motorcycles and mopeds, 42. Bikes, 55. The city blames distraction. The city blames the victim. The dead cannot answer.</p><h3 id=what-has-senator-gonzalez-done>What Has Senator Gonzalez Done?</h3><p>Senator Kristen Gonzalez has not stood still. She co-sponsored and voted for the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat speeders to install devices that keep their cars from breaking the law (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). She backed the extension of school speed zones. She signed on to bills for automated bike lane enforcement and called for lower speed limits after deadly crashes. She joined other officials to demand the city open safe paths for walkers and cyclists and to back protected bike lanes in Astoria (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/20/dot-stands-by-astoria-bike-lane-plan-despite-foes-childish-outbursts>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>But the blood on the street says it is not enough. <strong>Every day of delay is another family broken.</strong></p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Call Senator Gonzalez. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for every street.</strong> Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.

The measure targets drivers who block bike lanes, aiming to keep space clear for cyclists. No safety analyst note is available.

She died alone on the cold street.' The crash data lists no specific driver errors or contributing factors beyond the truck’s right turn.

The driver turned right from 24th Avenue onto 29th Street, hitting Kao and killing her instantly. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani called the crash 'absolutely heartbreaking,' noting Kao was the fourth cyclist killed in Astoria in 2.5 years. State Senator Kristen Gonzalez blamed 'poorly designed streets,' saying, 'traffic violence is the outcome of poorly designed streets and is a solvable problem.' The area has almost no protected bike lanes. In 2022, Community Board 1 saw 1,979 crashes, injuring 120 cyclists and 163 pedestrians. Politicians and residents demand safer streets, better enforcement, and an end to car dominance. The deadly toll continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
