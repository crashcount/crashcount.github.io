She co-sponsored the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force the worst repeat offenders to install speed-limiting devices. She voted yes to create more safety zones and expand ignition interlock monitoring. These are steps forward. But the deaths keep coming. <strong>Policy must move faster than the next crash.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call Senator Cleare. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit.
