Since 2022, 20 people have died in crashes. Sixty-seven more suffered serious injuries. Nearly 4,000 have been hurt. The dead include children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old, walking or riding. They only rise.</p><p>SUVs and cars did most of the killing—eight deaths, eleven serious injuries. Trucks and buses took two more lives. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left dozens battered, but the greatest harm came from heavy, fast machines. The names fade, but the pain stays. A cyclist ejected, head bleeding on East 135th. A pedestrian crushed on Harlem River Drive. A child struck crossing Manhattan Avenue. The city moves on. The families do not.</p><h2 id=recent-crashes-no-end-in-sight>Recent Crashes: No End in Sight</h2><p>The violence does not slow. On June 2, a pedestrian was killed at the RFK Bridge exit. In late May, an <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/nypd-car-hits-two-pedestrians-while-trying-to-avoid-crash-into-manhattan-taxi/>NYPD squad car hit two people</a> eating outdoors on Broadway. The police said, “<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/nypd-car-hits-two-pedestrians-while-trying-to-avoid-crash-into-manhattan-taxi/>The NYPD squad car struck two pedestrians Monday afternoon while trying to avoid a collision with a Manhattan taxi.</a>” Both diners and officers went to the hospital. The taxi driver got a summons for failure to yield. The investigation is ongoing. The street remains the same.</p><p>In February, a fire from an uncertified e-bike battery killed journalist Fazil Khan in Harlem. Councilmember Keith Powers called it “<a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/new-york-city-expands-efforts-to-combat-deadly-lithium-ion-battery-fires-with-certified-e-bike-program-EE4710402>a critical measure to keep New Yorkers safe. Fires from unregulated e-bike batteries have already caused too much harm, including tragic loss of life.</a>”</p><h2 id=leadership-progress-and-pressure>Leadership: Progress and Pressure</h2><p>State Senator Cordell Cleare has <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>voted yes</a> on bills to require safer street design and co-sponsored legislation to put vulnerable users first. These votes matter. But the crisis is not over. The laws are not enough until the dying stops.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next-demand-more>What Comes Next: Demand More</h2><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Every death is a choice made by someone in power. Call Senator Cleare. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people walking and biking. The street will not change itself. Only pressure works. Only action saves lives.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
