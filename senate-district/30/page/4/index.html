Police found him &ldquo;unconscious and unresponsive on the tracks&rdquo;—no arrests, no answers, only another life lost in the system’s blind spot, as reported by the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/06/man-fatally-struck-on-subway-tracks-in-harlem/>NY Daily News</a>.</p><p>On the streets, the carnage is relentless. In the last 12 months alone, <strong>10 people died</strong> and <strong>1,285 were injured</strong> in crashes across SD 30. Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians—none are spared. A 73-year-old man was killed crossing W 135th Street by an SUV. A 43-year-old cyclist died on the 97th Street Transverse. The numbers do not flinch: <strong>25 people suffered serious injuries</strong>. Each one is a story cut short.</p><h3 id=the-vehicles-that-kill>The Vehicles That Kill</h3><p>SUVs and cars do most of the damage. In this district, they caused <strong>10 deaths</strong> and over <strong>650 injuries</strong> to pedestrians and cyclists. Trucks and buses killed 2 more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll. The street is a gauntlet, and the most vulnerable pay the price, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-pressure>Leadership: Progress and Pressure</h3><p>State Senator Cordell Cleare has taken steps. She co-sponsored and voted yes on the <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act</strong>, a bill to force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. She also voted to extend school speed zones. These are real moves, but the crisis is bigger than any one bill. The work is not done.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>Every crash leaves a mark. &ldquo;Kirk was taken from me just as we were starting our new life together.

The grief is raw, the loss permanent.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>The deaths will not stop until the city and state make every street safe for the most vulnerable.</strong> Call Senator Cleare. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph citywide speed limit. Demand action against repeat offenders. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
