Since 2022, 20 people have died and 67 have been seriously injured in crashes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a>). In the last year alone, deaths tripled compared to the year before. Three people are dead since January.</p><p>The bodies are not numbers. A cyclist, ejected and bleeding, on E 135th Street. A pedestrian crushed on the Harlem River Drive. A man on a scooter, killed by a fleeing driver near St. Nicholas Avenue (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/06/harlem-hit-and-run-nypd-car-stop-stolen-van-bicyclist-devon-hughley-arrest-enesin-delarosa/>Scooter rider killed fleeing traffic stop</a>). The names fade. The pain does not.</p><h3 id=no-shelter-for-the-vulnerable>No Shelter for the Vulnerable</h3><p>Children, elders, and people on foot or bike pay the highest price. In the past twelve months, two children died. One elder, crossing at night, did not make it home. SUVs and trucks do the most damage. Cars and SUVs killed 8 people and injured over 600. Trucks and buses killed 2. Bikes, mopeds, and motorcycles left dozens more hurt.</p><p>The street does not forgive. &ldquo;Fires from unregulated e-bike batteries have already caused too much harm, including tragic loss of life,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/new-york-city-expands-efforts-to-combat-deadly-lithium-ion-battery-fires-with-certified-e-bike-program-EE4710402>said Councilmember Keith Powers</a>. But the real fire is on the asphalt, where speed and steel meet flesh.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-pressure>Leadership: Progress and Pressure</h3><p>State Senator Cordell Cleare has voted for safer streets. She backed a bill to require <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S131>complete street design</a>—roads built for people, not just cars. She co-sponsored another to force every project with public money to put safety first (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>co-sponsored safety bill</a>). These are steps. But the blood on the crosswalk says it is not enough.</p><p>The city and state have the power to lower speed limits, redesign deadly corners, and rein in repeat offenders. The tools are there. The clock is running.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more>Call to Action: Demand More</h3><p>Every crash is preventable. Every death is a failure. Call Senator Cleare. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit, real street redesigns, and an end to the carnage. The street belongs to the living. Make them prove it.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
