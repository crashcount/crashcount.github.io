Over 1,200 injured.</strong> In the last year alone, the streets of Senate District 30 have not been safe. A 73-year-old man died crossing 135th Street. A cyclist was crushed by a bus on Lenox Avenue. A pedestrian was left dead on Harlem River Drive. The numbers do not flinch: <strong>24 deaths, 4,168 injuries, 72 serious injuries</strong> since 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a>).</p><p>Just this May, an NYPD squad car swerved to avoid a taxi and plowed into two people sitting outside on Broadway. The police and the diners went to the hospital. The cab driver got a summons for failing to yield. &ldquo;The chaos erupted as the police cruiser, with lights flashing and sirens blaring, was traveling north on Broadway&mldr; when a cab heading south attempted a leisurely left turn onto West 112th Street,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/27/us-news/nypd-squad-car-strikes-2-people-in-outdoor-dining-area-while-trying-to-avoid-crash-with-taxi-police/>said an NYPD spokesperson</a>.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> They killed 10 people and injured 655 more. Trucks and buses killed 2, motorcycles and mopeds injured 31, and bikes were involved in 43 injury cases. The victims are often the most vulnerable: children, the elderly, people just trying to cross the street or ride a bike. The city keeps counting bodies. The pain is not abstract. &ldquo;Kirk was taken from me just as we were starting our new life together. He was the love of my life,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/27/us-news/drunk-teen-jimmy-connors-killed-groom-to-be-kirk-walker-in-wrong-way-crash-after-night-out-at-nyc-club-new-suit-alleges/>said Shauntea Weaver</a>, after a drunk teen killed her fiancé in a wrong-way crash.</p><h3 id=what-has-senator-cleare-done>What Has Senator Cleare Done?</h3><p><strong>Senator Cordell Cleare has voted for safety.</strong> She co-sponsored and voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed-limiting devices (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>). She also voted to extend school speed zones, a move to protect children on their way to class. These are steps, but the blood on the street says more is needed. The deaths keep coming.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Call Senator Cleare. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit.

The crash left the 22-year-old minicycle rider with crush injuries across his entire body, though he remained conscious at the scene. The report cites 'Traffic Control Disregarded' and 'Unsafe Speed' as contributing factors, underscoring the systemic dangers present when signals are ignored and speed exceeds safe limits. The minicycle, traveling straight, collided with the ambulance as it made a left turn. The police report notes that the rider was wearing a helmet at the time of impact. The scooter’s front end was described as folding 'like paper,' a stark testament to the force involved when traffic controls fail to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
