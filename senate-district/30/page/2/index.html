Since 2022, <strong>19 people are dead</strong>. <strong>65 suffered serious injuries</strong>. Over 3,700 were hurt. These are not just numbers. They are children, elders, neighbors. A 13-year-old girl killed at Cathedral Parkway and Manhattan Avenue. A 66-year-old man dead on West 135th. A cyclist, ejected and bleeding, on East 135th. The city moves on. The families do not.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-cost-of-inaction>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Cost of Inaction</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs killed 7. Trucks and buses killed 2.</strong> Bikes and mopeds left others broken. The violence is not random. It is relentless. It happens at the curb, in the crosswalk, at the dinner table. Even police cars are not immune. In May, an <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/nypd-car-hits-two-pedestrians-while-trying-to-avoid-crash-into-manhattan-taxi/>NYPD squad car struck two people</a> eating outdoors on Broadway. The police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/nypd-car-hits-two-pedestrians-while-trying-to-avoid-crash-into-manhattan-taxi/>said</a>, “The NYPD squad car struck two pedestrians Monday afternoon while trying to avoid a collision with a Manhattan taxi.” The taxi driver got a summons. The diners went to the hospital. The street stayed the same.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-bills-and-the-need-for-more>Leadership: Votes, Bills, and the Need for More</h3><p>Senator Cordell Cleare has taken steps. She voted yes on <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>S 9718</a>, a bill to force safer street design for all. She co-sponsored <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S131>S 131</a>, demanding that every new project put people first. These are the right moves. But the crisis does not wait for committee meetings. <strong>Every day without action is another day of risk.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> The dead do not get a second chance. The living must fight for the first. Call Senator Cleare. Call your council member. Demand lower speed limits. Demand protected crossings. Demand that every street is built for the most fragile body, not the fastest car. The city will not change until you force it to.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Night swallowed the scene in Manhattan.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a Station Wagon/SUV traveling south on 8th Avenue near 262nd Street made a left turn and struck a man riding a bike northbound, who was proceeding straight ahead. The report details that the cyclist was ejected, suffering a severe head injury and bleeding, with shock evident in his expression. The narrative states, 'He flew, hit pavement. Head split. Blood pooled. Eyes wide with shock. The bumper bent where his body broke.' The point of impact was the SUV’s left front bumper. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified' for both parties, but the SUV driver’s action—making a left turn into the path of a cyclist going straight—remains central to the crash. The cyclist was not wearing a helmet, as noted in the report, but this is mentioned only after the driver’s maneuver. The crash occurred late at night in Manhattan, underscoring the persistent danger for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
