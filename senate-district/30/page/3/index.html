Sixty-seven were hurt so badly they may never walk the same again. Children, elders, cyclists, pedestrians—no one is spared.</p><p><strong>Just last month, a man was killed crossing the RFK Bridge exit at 2nd Avenue.</strong> In January, a 59-year-old cyclist died under the wheels of a bus on Lenox Avenue.
