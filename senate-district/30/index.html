A child pedals home. In Senate District 30, the street does not forgive. <strong>Seven people killed in the last year. Nineteen more left with injuries so grave they may never walk the same.</strong> Nearly a thousand hurt. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about age. Two children dead. Three elders. Cyclists, pedestrians, names lost to the road.</p><p><strong>Just weeks ago, a man was crushed crossing the RFK Bridge exit.</strong> In January, a cyclist was killed by a bus on Lenox Avenue. In November, a stolen van fleeing police struck down Devon Hughley, a local rider. His sister said the arrest of the driver <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/06/harlem-hit-and-run-nypd-car-stop-stolen-van-bicyclist-devon-hughley-arrest-enesin-delarosa/>&ldquo;brought some peace&rdquo;</a>—but not enough to fill the empty space he left behind.</p><p><strong>No one is spared.</strong> The street claims the young and the old, the careful and the hurried. The only constant is the violence.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-cost>Who Bears the Cost?</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> Out of all pedestrian injuries and deaths, cars and SUVs are responsible for 626 cases. Trucks and buses add 64 more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes are not blameless, but their toll is smaller. The street is a battlefield, and the heaviest machines win.</p><p><strong>The pain is not abstract.</strong> A neighbor remembered Hughley as a <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/06/harlem-hit-and-run-nypd-car-stop-stolen-van-bicyclist-devon-hughley-arrest-enesin-delarosa/>&ldquo;community superhero&rdquo;</a>—a man who loved bikes and dogs, known to everyone on his block. Now there is only a poster in the lobby, and a silence where his voice should be.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>State Senator Cordell Cleare has taken steps. She <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>voted yes on a bill</a> to redesign streets for all users, not just drivers. She <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S131>co-sponsors a measure</a> to require safer street design on every state-funded project. These are good votes. But the deaths keep coming. <strong>Policy on paper is not safety on the street.</strong></p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Senator Cleare. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real street redesign, not just promises. <strong>Every day of delay is another name lost.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Contact your leaders and demand action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The crash left the 22-year-old minicycle rider with crush injuries across his entire body, though he remained conscious at the scene. The report cites 'Traffic Control Disregarded' and 'Unsafe Speed' as contributing factors, underscoring the systemic dangers present when signals are ignored and speed exceeds safe limits. The minicycle, traveling straight, collided with the ambulance as it made a left turn. The police report notes that the rider was wearing a helmet at the time of impact. The scooter’s front end was described as folding 'like paper,' a stark testament to the force involved when traffic controls fail to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
