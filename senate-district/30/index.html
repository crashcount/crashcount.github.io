Since 2022, <strong>19 people are dead</strong>. <strong>65 suffered serious injuries</strong>. Over 3,700 were hurt. These are not just numbers. They are children, elders, neighbors. A 13-year-old girl killed at Cathedral Parkway and Manhattan Avenue. A 66-year-old man dead on West 135th. A cyclist, ejected and bleeding, on East 135th. The city moves on. The families do not.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-cost-of-inaction>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Cost of Inaction</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs killed 7. Trucks and buses killed 2.</strong> Bikes and mopeds left others broken. The violence is not random. It is relentless. It happens at the curb, in the crosswalk, at the dinner table. Even police cars are not immune. In May, an <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/nypd-car-hits-two-pedestrians-while-trying-to-avoid-crash-into-manhattan-taxi/>NYPD squad car struck two people</a> eating outdoors on Broadway. The police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/nypd-car-hits-two-pedestrians-while-trying-to-avoid-crash-into-manhattan-taxi/>said</a>, “The NYPD squad car struck two pedestrians Monday afternoon while trying to avoid a collision with a Manhattan taxi.” The taxi driver got a summons. The diners went to the hospital. The street stayed the same.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-bills-and-the-need-for-more>Leadership: Votes, Bills, and the Need for More</h3><p>Senator Cordell Cleare has taken steps. She voted yes on <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>S 9718</a>, a bill to force safer street design for all. She co-sponsored <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S131>S 131</a>, demanding that every new project put people first. These are the right moves. But the crisis does not wait for committee meetings. <strong>Every day without action is another day of risk.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> The dead do not get a second chance. The living must fight for the first. Call Senator Cleare. Call your council member. Demand lower speed limits. Demand protected crossings. Demand that every street is built for the most fragile body, not the fastest car. The city will not change until you force it to.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

In February 2024, journalist Fazil Khan died in a Harlem apartment fire started by a charging battery; 22 others were injured. The article notes, 'Fires from unregulated e-bike batteries have already caused too much harm, including tragic loss of life.' The city’s $2 million pilot lets delivery workers exchange uncertified e-bikes and batteries for certified, UL-standard models. The program also requires a safety course. While battery-related fires rose slightly from 268 in 2023 to 277 in 2024, fatalities fell from 18 to 6.
