Seventy-one more are seriously hurt.</strong> These are not just numbers—they are neighbors, children, elders. A 73-year-old man, crossing at W 135th Street, struck down by an SUV. A 43-year-old cyclist, killed on the 97th Street Transverse. A baby, crushed on the RFK Bridge exit. The road does not care who you are.

The street is unchanged.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-miles-to-go>Leadership: Steps Forward, Miles to Go</h3><p><strong>Senator Cordell Cleare has voted for safer streets.</strong> In June 2024, she <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>voted yes on a bill to require complete street design</a>, putting people before cars. The bill calls for roads that protect everyone, not just drivers.

This is policy.</strong> The dead and injured are the cost of delay. The city can lower speed limits. The state can stop repeat offenders. The council can redesign streets.

The pedestrian was not in a crosswalk or at a signal. The report states the driver was unlicensed, operating a 2019 Nissan SUV registered in Connecticut. The impact caused fatal crush injuries, and the man died at the scene. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified.' The narrative details the pedestrian's location as 'not at intersection' and 'crossing, no signal or crosswalk,' but does not cite these as contributing factors.

Williams was struck, thrown, and died from his injuries. The article states, “An officer pursuing dirt bikers suddenly crossed the double yellow line into Williams' path, causing a collision.” Another NYPD vehicle attempted a similar maneuver. The family’s attorney called it a “deadly maneuver” for a minor violation. The city later billed Williams’ family for police vehicle damages. The NYPD has not commented, citing litigation. The case raises questions about police pursuit tactics and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
