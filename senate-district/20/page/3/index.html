An SUV turned left. She never made it to the curb. Police charged the driver with aggravated unlicensed operation and failure to exercise due care. Her son called it a &ldquo;tragedy&rdquo; and remembered her long walks to feed hospital patients. &ldquo;She walked every morning from Crown Heights to Brookdale Hospital. She used to feed patients there for many years&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/23/elderly-brooklyn-woman-hit-suv-driver-dies-injuries/>said Yisroel Brod</a>.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>2 people died and 17 suffered serious injuries</strong> on these streets. There were <strong>1,336 injuries</strong> and over <strong>2,200 crashes</strong>. The dead are mostly the old, the young, the ones on foot or bike. The numbers do not bleed, but the families do.</p><h2 id=who-bears-the-weight-cars-trucks-and-the-unlicensed>Who Bears the Weight: Cars, Trucks, and the Unlicensed</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars caused the most pain</strong>—4 deaths, 18 serious injuries.

The bodies are not.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-done-myries-record>What Has Been Done: Myrie’s Record</h2><p>Senator Zellnor Myrie has not been silent. He voted yes on a bill to force safer street designs for all users, not just drivers <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>see S 9718</a>. He backs protected bike lanes, busways, and daylighting. He promises to meet or beat the Streets Master Plan’s bike lane goals and to end project delays. &ldquo;Physically separated bus lanes&rdquo; and more automated enforcement are his pledge <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/07/decision-2025-mayoral-hopefuls-discuss-saving-us-from-reckless-drivers>discussed here</a>. But the deaths keep coming. The work is not done.</p><h2 id=the-call-no-more-waiting>The Call: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay means another family broken.</strong> The law is passed, but the streets are not yet safe. Call Senator Myrie. Call your council member. Demand the city use its new power to lower speed limits, redesign intersections, and protect the most vulnerable. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

They called for 'universal daylighting with hardened materials such as boulders, planters, and bike corrals' at intersections. The officials cited recent fatal crashes and urged the city to opt into a state law banning parking within 20 feet of corners. They want federal funds used for these changes. The group opposes DOT’s slow pace and reliance on paint, demanding physical barriers. Community board leaders and advocates support the move. DOT says it will review the letter and remains committed to evidence-based daylighting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
