According to the police report, a westbound motorcycle 'slammed into the front of a turning Audi.' The 38-year-old motorcycle rider, who wore no helmet, suffered a crushed arm. The report describes the moment: 'Metal groaned. Morning broke with the sound of bone and the echo of pain.' The Audi, a 2020 SUV, was making a left turn when the crash occurred. Police data lists the pre-crash actions as 'Going Straight Ahead' for the motorcycle and 'Making Left Turn' for the Audi. Contributing factors are marked as 'Unspecified,' and the report does not cite any specific driver errors. The only victim behavior noted is the absence of a helmet, mentioned after the sequence of driver actions. The crash highlights the persistent dangers at intersections where turning vehicles and through traffic collide.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

This marks the lowest bus lane mileage since 2018. The matter, titled 'Adams Has Proposed Just 7 Miles of Bus Lanes This Year — Less Than 1/4 of Requirement,' has drawn sharp criticism. State Sen. Zellnor Myrie called it 'unacceptable that Mayor Adams has not prioritized improving bus speeds, service, and reliability.' Scott Stringer accused the administration of using 'community engagement as an excuse to not get things done.' Brad Lander pledged to push for more dedicated bus lanes. Riders like Alex Gean described daily gridlock. The DOT claims more lanes are coming, but offers no details. Vulnerable road users—bus riders, pedestrians—remain at risk as the city fails to meet its own safety and mobility targets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They called for 'universal daylighting with hardened materials such as boulders, planters, and bike corrals' at intersections. The officials cited recent fatal crashes and urged the city to opt into a state law banning parking within 20 feet of corners. They want federal funds used for these changes.
