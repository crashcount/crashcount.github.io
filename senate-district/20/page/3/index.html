A black Honda Pilot hit him as he crossed with his sister. He was eight. The 69‑year‑old driver stayed. No arrest. Neighbors called the street dangerous. “<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-year-old-boy-killed-suv-crossing-intersection-crown-heights-brooklyn/16875804/>Police are looking at whether speed was a factor</a>.” A witness said, “<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/boy-fatally-struck-honda-suv-driver-crown-heights-brooklyn/>I saw the kid being dragged from underneath the car</a>.”</p><p>At Montgomery and Brooklyn Avenue, a driver turned left and struck a woman in the crosswalk. She was 101. The SUV driver was unlicensed, police records say. She had the walk. The report lists “<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Failure to Yield Right‑of‑Way</a>” as a factor.</p><p>On Church and East 55th, a Ford SUV hit a 36‑year‑old man at the intersection. He died at the scene, the city dataset shows. The car went straight. He didn’t get up.</p><p>On Flatbush at Caton, an Audi sedan struck a 64‑year‑old man away from the crosswalk. The entry says “Crush Injuries.” No more words.</p><h3 id=where-the-bodies-are>Where the bodies are</h3><p>These deaths sit inside Senate District 20.

Many do their part.</p><h3 id=a-child-a-century-and-a-light-that-stayed-green>A child, a century, and a light that stayed green</h3><p>Witnesses at Eastern Parkway spoke in fragments. “<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>They were walking, he was crossing the street with his sister</a>,” a neighbor said. “<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/boy-fatally-struck-honda-suv-driver-crown-heights-brooklyn/>I just saw a lot of blood</a>,” another said. The driver stood by the car. The NYPD towed the SUV. No charges announced in the press reports.</p><p>On Montgomery Street, the form fields are stark. “Crossing With Signal.” “Failure to Yield.” “Unlicensed.” Center front end. Left turn. That is all the city gives you. It is enough.</p><h3 id=power-sits-on-the-switch>Power sits on the switch</h3><p>Albany gave the city the power to drop speeds. The city can act. A 20 mph default on local streets is on the table. Speed cameras now run around the clock through 2030. The tools to slow cars exist. The city has not used all of them. The state can press repeat offenders.</p><p>The Senate is moving a bill to stop the worst drivers. The <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045)</strong> would force drivers with heavy records to install speed limiters. The measure advanced in June; SD 20’s senator is listed as a co‑sponsor. Two committee votes passed while he was marked excused (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>bill file</a>).</p><p>Slow the streets. Box in the worst speeders. That is the work.</p><p>Take one step now. Tell City Hall and Albany to use the tools we already have.

Intro 606 faces opposition from DOT, which says, 'there is no evidence that registration improves safety.' The matter’s summary warns that Hochul’s plan would let NYPD enforce bike lane speed limits and reclassify heavy e-bikes as mopeds, requiring licenses and registration. Council members are split: Brad Lander supports regulation targeting app companies, not workers; Jessica Ramos and Zohran Mamdani call for better street design; Michael Blake urges targeted safety solutions and more infrastructure. Advocates like Ligia Guallpa say these measures would criminalize delivery workers and create a 'ticketing-to-deportation pipeline.' The Council press office did not comment.

We need leadership that's not afraid to stand up for us, or stand up against Donald Trump."" -- Zellnor Myrie</p><p class=mb3>On February 19, 2025, the Trump administration withdrew federal approval for New York City's congestion pricing program. U.S. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy cited burdens on working-class drivers and questioned the legality of using toll revenue for transit. The MTA immediately filed a lawsuit to challenge the move, arguing the program is settled law and already reduces congestion. State Senators Andrew Gounardes and Zellnor Myrie condemned the action, warning, 'Trump will be directly responsible for more traffic, more crashes, more polluted air, slower buses and less funding for our transit system.' The withdrawal aligns with New Jersey's opposition and threatens transit upgrades like elevators for elderly and disabled riders.

This marks the lowest bus lane mileage since 2018. The matter, titled 'Adams Has Proposed Just 7 Miles of Bus Lanes This Year — Less Than 1/4 of Requirement,' has drawn sharp criticism. State Sen. Zellnor Myrie called it 'unacceptable that Mayor Adams has not prioritized improving bus speeds, service, and reliability.' Scott Stringer accused the administration of using 'community engagement as an excuse to not get things done.' Brad Lander pledged to push for more dedicated bus lanes. Riders like Alex Gean described daily gridlock. The DOT claims more lanes are coming, but offers no details. Vulnerable road users—bus riders, pedestrians—remain at risk as the city fails to meet its own safety and mobility targets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
