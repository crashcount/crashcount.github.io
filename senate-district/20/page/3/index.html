A black Honda Pilot hit him. His sister watched. Neighbors ran for towels. They tried to stop the blood. &ldquo;I saw the kid being dragged from underneath the car by a woman,&rdquo; a witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/boy-fatally-struck-honda-suv-driver-crown-heights-brooklyn/>said</a>. The boy died. The driver stayed. No arrest. The street stayed the same.</p><p>Just weeks before, a 101-year-old woman was killed crossing Montgomery Street at Brooklyn Avenue. A GMC SUV, left turn, unlicensed driver. She had the signal. She did not make it across. In the last year, four people have died on these streets. One was a child. One was a centenarian. One was a cyclist. One was a man crushed by a truck. <strong>No one is safe.</strong></p><h3 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h3><p>In the last twelve months, SD 20 saw <strong>4 deaths and 15 serious injuries</strong>. <strong>1,495 people were hurt</strong>. Children, elders, cyclists, walkers. Cars and SUVs did most of the killing—<strong>5 deaths and 18 serious injuries</strong> citywide in the period, just from these vehicles <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>according to NYC Open Data</a>.

But when the bill came up for a vote in June, he was marked &ldquo;excused&rdquo;—<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>absent</a>. The bill passed committee. The streets did not change.</p><h3 id=the-call-no-more-waiting>The Call: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> Call Senator Myrie. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand action on repeat speeders. Demand streets where children and elders can cross and live. <strong>Do not wait for another towel, another body, another name.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

We need leadership that's not afraid to stand up for us, or stand up against Donald Trump."" -- Zellnor Myrie</p><p class=mb3>On February 19, 2025, the Trump administration withdrew federal approval for New York City's congestion pricing program. U.S. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy cited burdens on working-class drivers and questioned the legality of using toll revenue for transit. The MTA immediately filed a lawsuit to challenge the move, arguing the program is settled law and already reduces congestion. State Senators Andrew Gounardes and Zellnor Myrie condemned the action, warning, 'Trump will be directly responsible for more traffic, more crashes, more polluted air, slower buses and less funding for our transit system.' The withdrawal aligns with New Jersey's opposition and threatens transit upgrades like elevators for elderly and disabled riders.

The police narrative describes the scene: 'The truck’s right front crushed his head. He lay semiconscious on the pavement, bleeding into the dusk.' The driver was licensed and traveling straight ahead at the time of the crash. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified,' offering no further details on driver behavior. The only mention of the pedestrian’s actions is that he was 'crossing, no signal, or crosswalk,' which is included after the account of the vehicle’s impact. The focus remains on the devastating outcome of the collision and the lethal force of the truck.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The SUV was making a left turn while the motorcycle was traveling straight south. The motorcycle rider, a 35-year-old male, was struck on the center front end and thrown face-first, sustaining severe facial lacerations and bleeding. The report states, 'An SUV turned left. A motorcycle came straight. No helmet. The rider flew, face-first. Flesh tore. Blood pooled on the asphalt. He stayed awake. Eyes open.' The SUV sustained damage to its right front quarter panel. The police report lists the contributing factor as 'Unspecified,' but the sequence clearly shows the SUV turning left into the motorcycle's path. The rider was not wearing a helmet, noted after the driver actions. The driver of the SUV was a 32-year-old male, wearing a lap belt and harness, and suffered minor abrasions. This collision highlights the dangers posed by turning vehicles crossing the path of oncoming motorcycles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

According to the police report, a westbound motorcycle 'slammed into the front of a turning Audi.' The 38-year-old motorcycle rider, who wore no helmet, suffered a crushed arm. The report describes the moment: 'Metal groaned. Morning broke with the sound of bone and the echo of pain.' The Audi, a 2020 SUV, was making a left turn when the crash occurred. Police data lists the pre-crash actions as 'Going Straight Ahead' for the motorcycle and 'Making Left Turn' for the Audi. Contributing factors are marked as 'Unspecified,' and the report does not cite any specific driver errors. The only victim behavior noted is the absence of a helmet, mentioned after the sequence of driver actions.

This marks the lowest bus lane mileage since 2018. The matter, titled 'Adams Has Proposed Just 7 Miles of Bus Lanes This Year — Less Than 1/4 of Requirement,' has drawn sharp criticism. State Sen. Zellnor Myrie called it 'unacceptable that Mayor Adams has not prioritized improving bus speeds, service, and reliability.' Scott Stringer accused the administration of using 'community engagement as an excuse to not get things done.' Brad Lander pledged to push for more dedicated bus lanes. Riders like Alex Gean described daily gridlock. The DOT claims more lanes are coming, but offers no details. Vulnerable road users—bus riders, pedestrians—remain at risk as the city fails to meet its own safety and mobility targets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
