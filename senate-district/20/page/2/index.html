A black Honda Pilot hit him as he crossed with his sister. He was eight. The 69‑year‑old driver stayed. No arrest. Neighbors called the street dangerous. “<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-year-old-boy-killed-suv-crossing-intersection-crown-heights-brooklyn/16875804/>Police are looking at whether speed was a factor</a>.” A witness said, “<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/boy-fatally-struck-honda-suv-driver-crown-heights-brooklyn/>I saw the kid being dragged from underneath the car</a>.”</p><p>At Montgomery and Brooklyn Avenue, a driver turned left and struck a woman in the crosswalk. She was 101. The SUV driver was unlicensed, police records say. She had the walk. The report lists “<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Failure to Yield Right‑of‑Way</a>” as a factor.</p><p>On Church and East 55th, a Ford SUV hit a 36‑year‑old man at the intersection. He died at the scene, the city dataset shows. The car went straight. He didn’t get up.</p><p>On Flatbush at Caton, an Audi sedan struck a 64‑year‑old man away from the crosswalk. The entry says “Crush Injuries.” No more words.</p><h3 id=where-the-bodies-are>Where the bodies are</h3><p>These deaths sit inside Senate District 20.

SUVs and cars account for most injuries to people on foot (<a href=#>PeriodStats</a>).</p><h3 id=the-numbers-dont-blink>The numbers don’t blink</h3><p>Year to date, crashes are up. Compared to last year’s span, SD 20 has <strong>21.7% more crashes</strong> and more people hurt. Deaths rose from 3 to 4 in the same period (<a href=#>PeriodStats</a>). Children are not spared: one killed this year; 98 injured so far. Seniors too: deaths in the 65–74 and 75+ bands, injuries in every decade (<a href=#>PeriodStats</a>).</p><p>Pedestrians are hit most by sedans and SUVs. The dataset lists 398 pedestrian casualties tied to sedans and 302 tied to SUVs, including deaths (<a href=#>PeriodStats</a>). Trucks and buses add to the toll. No corridor carries it all. Many do their part.</p><h3 id=a-child-a-century-and-a-light-that-stayed-green>A child, a century, and a light that stayed green</h3><p>Witnesses at Eastern Parkway spoke in fragments. “<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>They were walking, he was crossing the street with his sister</a>,” a neighbor said. “<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/boy-fatally-struck-honda-suv-driver-crown-heights-brooklyn/>I just saw a lot of blood</a>,” another said. The driver stood by the car. The NYPD towed the SUV. No charges announced in the press reports.</p><p>On Montgomery Street, the form fields are stark. “Crossing With Signal.” “Failure to Yield.” “Unlicensed.” Center front end. Left turn. That is all the city gives you. It is enough.</p><h3 id=power-sits-on-the-switch>Power sits on the switch</h3><p>Albany gave the city the power to drop speeds. The city can act. A 20 mph default on local streets is on the table. Speed cameras now run around the clock through 2030. The tools to slow cars exist. The city has not used all of them. The state can press repeat offenders.</p><p>The Senate is moving a bill to stop the worst drivers. The <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045)</strong> would force drivers with heavy records to install speed limiters. The measure advanced in June; SD 20’s senator is listed as a co‑sponsor. Two committee votes passed while he was marked excused (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>bill file</a>).</p><p>Slow the streets. Box in the worst speeders. That is the work.</p><p>Take one step now. Tell City Hall and Albany to use the tools we already have. Start here: <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Concrete islands promise safer crossings. Details remain thin. Cars may still block buses. The street could change. Pedestrians and riders wait. The city holds its breath.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC (2025-06-09) reports the Department of Transportation plans a center-running bus lane on Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn. The project aims to connect neighborhoods and calm traffic. DOT Assistant Director Dustin Khuu said the goal is a 'high performing transit priority street.' The plan includes concrete bus boarding islands and may reduce car lanes, giving more space to pedestrians and buses. However, the article notes gaps: 'DOT didn't share a block-by-block breakdown,' and curbside parking may remain, risking bus lane obstruction by double-parked vehicles. The city may physically protect the lane, but details are pending. The B41 bus, serving 28,000 daily trips, crawls at 4 mph during rush hour. The proposal highlights the need for clear enforcement and design to keep cars out of bus lanes and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Critics say safety for walkers and riders is left behind.</p><p class=mb3>On May 22, 2025, Streetsblog NYC covered the city's announcement of a $550 million redesign for Fifth Avenue. The plan, described as a 'much-compromised redesign,' keeps two car lanes, scraps a bus lane, and offers no space for cyclists. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called it a 'pedestrian-first corridor,' but critics, including Riders Alliance spokesman Danny Pearlstein, slammed the move as a 'huge corporate giveaway at New Yorkers' expense.' The redesign widens sidewalks and adds planters and seating, but cars still dominate. Council members and advocates oppose the car-first approach. According to safety analysts, the event only mentions the redesign and its cost, without specifying design features or their effects on vulnerable road users; therefore, the safety impact cannot be determined from the information provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He proposes revising the city’s minimum pay law and making app companies liable for damages caused by delivery riders. His campaign website claims these changes will 'eliminate inappropriate incentives to dangerous use of e-bikes.' DoorDash donated $1 million to a Cuomo-aligned super PAC. Comptroller Brad Lander accused Cuomo of siding with app companies, saying, 'DoorDash is trying to buy Cuomo’s election...so he’ll roll back the law I passed that requires them to pay their workers a living wage.' Other officials, including Scott Stringer and Zellnor Myrie, voiced doubts about Cuomo’s commitment to delivery worker protections. The bill is not in committee; it is a campaign proposal. The safety impact for vulnerable road users remains unclear, but the fight over pay and regulation leaves delivery workers exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lander pushed for stricter rules on heavy e-bikes and a crackdown on illegal sales, saying, 'I support stricter regulations for the heaviest e-bikes, which can travel at higher speeds and are more likely to injure both riders and pedestrians.' Mamdani supported e-bike subsidies with safety checks. Tilson urged a 20 mph cap and mandatory registration for delivery e-bikes.

Zellnor Myrie promised 'physically separated bus lanes' and expanded automated enforcement. Jessica Ramos called for 'a citywide strategy that prioritizes safety through design.' Zohran Mamdani wants to move traffic enforcement from NYPD to DOT, ending biased stops. Whitney Tilson supports more police and cameras.

Scott Stringer, Zellnor Myrie, Jessica Ramos, Brad Lander, and Whitney Tilson responded, each supporting congestion pricing and further transit investment.

Mayoral candidates responded. Ben Furnas (Transportation Alternatives) called for universal daylighting and laws against super speeders, urging street redesign and enforcement. Zellnor Myrie backed robust street designs to separate bikers, pedestrians, and drivers. Jessica Ramos supported protected bike lanes for both analog and e-bikes, calling e-bikes 'a vital tool for reducing car dependency.' Whitney Tilson demanded speed caps and insurance for e-bike riders. Despite some focus on e-bikes, advocates and data point to car and truck drivers as the main source of injury and death.

The bill, sponsored in Albany by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, would require drivers with repeated violations to install intelligent speed assistance (ISA) devices. These devices cap speed at 5 mph over the limit for those with 11 or more license points in 24 months or six camera tickets in a year. The rally followed a fatal Gravesend crash that killed a mother and her two daughters. Hanif and other lawmakers called current enforcement—ticketing, suspensions, fines, jail—ineffective. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon said, 'The speed limiter technology is available to us. Let’s use it. It will save lives.' The bill is modeled on EU and Virginia laws.
