Children, elders, cyclists, pedestrians—no one is spared. On June 28, an eight-year-old boy was crossing Eastern Parkway with his sister. A black SUV hit him.

Scott Stringer, Zellnor Myrie, Jessica Ramos, Brad Lander, and Whitney Tilson all support congestion pricing, bus rapid transit, protected bike lanes, and pedestrianization. Stringer promises a full bus network overhaul and more protected lanes. Myrie vows to defend congestion pricing from federal attacks. Ramos pushes for Bus Rapid Transit in all boroughs.

Mayoral candidates responded. Ben Furnas (Transportation Alternatives) called for universal daylighting and laws against super speeders, urging street redesign and enforcement. Zellnor Myrie backed robust street designs to separate bikers, pedestrians, and drivers. Jessica Ramos supported protected bike lanes for both analog and e-bikes, calling e-bikes 'a vital tool for reducing car dependency.' Whitney Tilson demanded speed caps and insurance for e-bike riders. Despite some focus on e-bikes, advocates and data point to car and truck drivers as the main source of injury and death.

The bill, sponsored in Albany by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, would require drivers with repeated violations to install intelligent speed assistance (ISA) devices. These devices cap speed at 5 mph over the limit for those with 11 or more license points in 24 months or six camera tickets in a year. The rally followed a fatal Gravesend crash that killed a mother and her two daughters. Hanif and other lawmakers called current enforcement—ticketing, suspensions, fines, jail—ineffective. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon said, 'The speed limiter technology is available to us. Let’s use it. It will save lives.' The bill is modeled on EU and Virginia laws.

Council members are split: Brad Lander supports regulation targeting app companies, not workers; Jessica Ramos and Zohran Mamdani call for better street design; Michael Blake urges targeted safety solutions and more infrastructure.

Lander vowed to end subway and street homelessness for the severely mentally ill by connecting them to stable housing. Mamdani promised a world-class bus network. Myrie pushed for citywide bus lanes. Ramos called for automatic Fair Fares registration. Stringer backed more bus routes. Walden opposed fare evasion crackdowns, urging resources go to service instead. All criticized Mayor Adams’ record on bus lanes and congestion pricing. The forum highlighted a united front for safer, more accessible transit, but offered no immediate relief for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, organized by Riders Alliance, saw candidates attack Mayor Eric Adams for not meeting the Streets Master Plan law, which mandates 30 new miles of bus lanes each year. Adams’ administration installed only 15.7 miles last fiscal year. State Sen. Jessica Ramos said, 'The current mayor promised 150 miles of bus lanes and hasn't delivered.' Comptroller Brad Lander promised a 'professional, world-class DOT commissioner.' Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani vowed to resist business interests blocking bus projects. Sen. Zellnor Myrie, mentioned at the forum, made pro-transit promises. The forum exposed how political inaction and broken promises keep streets unsafe for bus riders and pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary reads: 'NYC mayoral candidates participated in a transit-focused forum... discussing congestion pricing, subway safety, and transit upgrades.' Zellnor Myrie, representing District 20, criticized Mayor Adams for not defending congestion pricing and promised to support it regardless of federal politics. Ramos pushed for congestion pricing revenue to fund the MTA. Stringer called for bus expansion and DOT reform. Walden wanted more police and exemptions for seniors and disabled riders. Lander and Mamdani argued for housing and outreach teams over policing.
