A black Honda Pilot hit him. His sister watched. Neighbors ran for towels. They tried to stop the blood. &ldquo;I saw the kid being dragged from underneath the car by a woman,&rdquo; a witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/boy-fatally-struck-honda-suv-driver-crown-heights-brooklyn/>said</a>. The boy died. The driver stayed. No arrest. The street stayed the same.</p><p>Just weeks before, a 101-year-old woman was killed crossing Montgomery Street at Brooklyn Avenue. A GMC SUV, left turn, unlicensed driver. She had the signal. She did not make it across. In the last year, four people have died on these streets. One was a child. One was a centenarian. One was a cyclist. One was a man crushed by a truck. <strong>No one is safe.</strong></p><h3 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h3><p>In the last twelve months, SD 20 saw <strong>4 deaths and 15 serious injuries</strong>. <strong>1,495 people were hurt</strong>. Children, elders, cyclists, walkers. Cars and SUVs did most of the killing—<strong>5 deaths and 18 serious injuries</strong> citywide in the period, just from these vehicles <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>according to NYC Open Data</a>.

But when the bill came up for a vote in June, he was marked &ldquo;excused&rdquo;—<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>absent</a>. The bill passed committee. The streets did not change.</p><h3 id=the-call-no-more-waiting>The Call: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> Call Senator Myrie. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand action on repeat speeders. Demand streets where children and elders can cross and live. <strong>Do not wait for another towel, another body, another name.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Stringer demanded 'massive expansion of protected bike lanes.' Myrie backed S1047, a bill for 50-percent e-bike rebates. Ramos called for safe bike lanes and clear signage for all riders. Lander pushed for stricter rules on heavy e-bikes and a crackdown on illegal sales, saying, 'I support stricter regulations for the heaviest e-bikes, which can travel at higher speeds and are more likely to injure both riders and pedestrians.' Mamdani supported e-bike subsidies with safety checks. Tilson urged a 20 mph cap and mandatory registration for delivery e-bikes.

Police say the driver, Menachem Shagalow, was unlicensed and charged with aggravated unlicensed operation, failure to exercise due care, and unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle. Brod died from her injuries at Maimonides Medical Center on April 20. The article notes, 'Menachem was arrested at 8:37 p.m. on April 8 shortly after the incident.' This crash follows another fatal collision involving a suspended driver in Brooklyn the previous week. The incidents highlight ongoing dangers from unlicensed drivers and raise questions about enforcement and systemic safety failures.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The poll, highlighted in Streetsblog NYC, found deep worry among women, seniors, and Bronx residents. The matter summary reads: '77% of NYC voters consider pedestrian safety a serious issue.' Mayoral candidates responded. Ben Furnas (Transportation Alternatives) called for universal daylighting and laws against super speeders, urging street redesign and enforcement. Zellnor Myrie backed robust street designs to separate bikers, pedestrians, and drivers. Jessica Ramos supported protected bike lanes for both analog and e-bikes, calling e-bikes 'a vital tool for reducing car dependency.' Whitney Tilson demanded speed caps and insurance for e-bike riders. Despite some focus on e-bikes, advocates and data point to car and truck drivers as the main source of injury and death. The poll signals a mandate: fix the streets, protect the vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lawmakers promise change.</p><p class=mb3>On April 1, 2025, Council Member Shahana Hanif joined a rally at Brooklyn Borough Hall demanding passage of the Stop Super Speeders bill. The bill, sponsored in Albany by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, would require drivers with repeated violations to install intelligent speed assistance (ISA) devices. These devices cap speed at 5 mph over the limit for those with 11 or more license points in 24 months or six camera tickets in a year. The rally followed a fatal Gravesend crash that killed a mother and her two daughters. Hanif and other lawmakers called current enforcement—ticketing, suspensions, fines, jail—ineffective. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon said, 'The speed limiter technology is available to us. Let’s use it. It will save lives.' The bill is modeled on EU and Virginia laws. Some opposition remains, but supporters say the measure is urgent and practical.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Intro 606 faces opposition from DOT, which says, 'there is no evidence that registration improves safety.' The matter’s summary warns that Hochul’s plan would let NYPD enforce bike lane speed limits and reclassify heavy e-bikes as mopeds, requiring licenses and registration. Council members are split: Brad Lander supports regulation targeting app companies, not workers; Jessica Ramos and Zohran Mamdani call for better street design; Michael Blake urges targeted safety solutions and more infrastructure. Advocates like Ligia Guallpa say these measures would criminalize delivery workers and create a 'ticketing-to-deportation pipeline.' The Council press office did not comment.
