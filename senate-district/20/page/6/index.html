A black Honda Pilot hit him. He died in the street. A witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/boy-fatally-struck-honda-suv-driver-crown-heights-brooklyn/>described</a> the scene: &ldquo;I saw the kid being dragged from underneath the car by a woman.&rdquo; Another neighbor <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-year-old-boy-killed-suv-crossing-intersection-crown-heights-brooklyn/16875804/>put it plainly</a>: &ldquo;Yeah, this street is dangerous.&rdquo;</p><p>This is not rare. In the last twelve months, SD 20 saw <strong>1,289 injuries and 2 deaths</strong> from crashes. Fifteen people were seriously hurt. Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians are broken on these roads. The numbers do not stop. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=the-toll-of-cars-and-trucks>The Toll of Cars and Trucks</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> In this district, they caused <strong>4 deaths and 18 serious injuries</strong> to people on foot or bike. Trucks and buses killed 3 more. Bikes, mopeds, and motorcycles add to the toll, but the big machines do the killing. Every week, another family is left to grieve.</p><h3 id=what-has-senator-myrie-done>What Has Senator Myrie Done?</h3><p>Senator Zellnor Myrie has voted for safer streets. In June 2024, he <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>voted yes on a bill</a> to redesign roads for all users, not just drivers. He has called for more protected bike lanes, busways, and enforcement. He <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/16/the-dave-colon-challenge-zellnor-myrie-wants-his-own-bike-now>said</a>, &ldquo;We should be making this as easy as possible and as safe as possible for as many people as possible.&rdquo;</p><p>But the deaths keep coming.

Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes and daylighted corners. Demand action, not words. The blood on the street is real. The time to act is now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
