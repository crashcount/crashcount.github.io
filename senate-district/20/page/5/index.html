Sixteen suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The dead include a 101-year-old woman, a boy of eight, and a 68-year-old grandmother. Their lives ended at the curb, in the crosswalk, or crossing with the light.</p><p><strong>Just days ago, an eight-year-old boy was killed crossing Eastern Parkway with his sister.</strong> The driver stayed at the scene. The street stayed dangerous. &ldquo;Yeah, this street is dangerous,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-year-old-boy-killed-suv-crossing-intersection-crown-heights-brooklyn/16875804/>said a neighbor</a>. The boy’s name was Mordica Keller. He was walking home. He never made it.</p><p>In May, Maurette Lafleur, 68, was hit in a crosswalk in East Flatbush. She had the signal. The driver turned left and struck her. &ldquo;The lady spin around and sped through,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/16/fridays-headlines-east-flatbush-tragedy-edition>said Lorna Johnson, who watched her die</a>. The driver faced no charges.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the damage.</strong> In three years, they killed four pedestrians and left hundreds more with broken bodies. Trucks and vans killed three more. Bikes and mopeds hurt dozens, but the carnage comes on four wheels. The numbers are plain: 18 killed, 5,027 injured, 66 left with wounds that will not heal.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-votes-and-whats-missing>Leadership: Words, Votes, and What’s Missing</h3><p>State Senator Zellnor Myrie has voted for safer street design, backing a bill to require &ldquo;complete streets&rdquo; that protect everyone, not just drivers. He has called for more protected bike lanes, busways, and an end to delays. &ldquo;We should be making this as easy as possible and as safe as possible for as many people as possible,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/16/the-dave-colon-challenge-zellnor-myrie-wants-his-own-bike-now>he said after riding the streets himself</a>. He has supported congestion pricing and speed limiters for repeat offenders. But the blood on the street says it is not enough. Promises do not stop cars. Votes do not slow SUVs. <strong>Every week without action is another funeral.</strong></p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call Senator Myrie. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand that the killing stop.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Find out how to take action.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The hearing followed a Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) investigation, which found Kovalik abused his authority by threatening Myrie and others with pepper spray during a protest on May 29, 2020. The matter centered on 'excessive use of force with department-issued bikes' and the officer's actions at a protest outside Barclays Center after George Floyd's murder. Myrie, detained with zip ties, said, 'I felt what felt like bike tires on my back and on my arms.' He described lasting trauma from the incident. The CCRB prosecutor, Andre Applewhite, argued video evidence confirmed the threats. Myrie and another lawmaker have filed a federal lawsuit against the NYPD. The case highlights the dangers faced by peaceful protesters and the use of police bicycles as tools of force.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
