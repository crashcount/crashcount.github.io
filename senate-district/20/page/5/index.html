The project, not tied to a specific council bill, begins March 12 and is billed as an 18-month pilot. The main loop’s eastern stretch will be repaved and repainted, giving cyclists a 16-to-18-foot shared lane with authorized vehicles, flanked by two pedestrian lanes up to 14 feet wide. The city rejected a two-bike-lane alternative, citing pedestrian access needs. State Sen. Zellnor Myrie praised the upgrade, calling Prospect Park a treasure. Chief Public Realm Officer Ya-Ting Liu said, 'Re-examining how we design the roads in our park system is a perfect example of how we’re advancing the Mayor’s vision for quality public spaces throughout the city.'
