One was a child. Fifteen more suffered serious injuries. These are not just numbers—they are bodies on the ground, families torn open, lives ended at the curb.</p><p>On June 28, an eight-year-old boy was crossing Eastern Parkway with his sister when a black SUV hit him. He died there, in the intersection. A witness said, &ldquo;I just saw a lot of blood gushing out of his ears, his mouth&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/boy-fatally-struck-honda-suv-driver-crown-heights-brooklyn/>NY Daily News</a>). The driver stayed. No arrest. The street stayed dangerous. Another neighbor said, &ldquo;Yeah, this street is dangerous&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-year-old-boy-killed-suv-crossing-intersection-crown-heights-brooklyn/16875804/>ABC7</a>).</p><p><strong>In the past year, 1,493 people were hurt in crashes here.</strong> Most were walking, biking, or just trying to live. Cars and SUVs did the most harm—killing, maiming, leaving scars that never heal.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-votes-and-the-long-road>Leadership: Promises, Votes, and the Long Road</h3><p>State Senator Zellnor Myrie has not been silent. He <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>voted yes on a bill</a> to force safer street designs for all users. He has backed more protected bike lanes, busways, and daylighting. He rode a bike through Brooklyn and said, &ldquo;We should be making this as easy as possible and as safe as possible for as many people as possible&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/16/the-dave-colon-challenge-zellnor-myrie-wants-his-own-bike-now>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>But the bodies keep coming.

Every month, another family in mourning.</strong></p><h3 id=what-now-the-next-step-is-yours>What Now: The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> The deaths are preventable. The pain is a choice made by those in power, or by those who do nothing. Call Senator Myrie. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for every crosswalk and bike lane. <strong>Do not wait for another child to die.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
