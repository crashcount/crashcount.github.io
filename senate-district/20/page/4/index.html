An SUV turned left. She never made it to the curb. Police charged the driver with aggravated unlicensed operation and failure to exercise due care. Her son called it a &ldquo;tragedy&rdquo; and remembered her long walks to feed hospital patients. &ldquo;She walked every morning from Crown Heights to Brookdale Hospital. She used to feed patients there for many years&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/23/elderly-brooklyn-woman-hit-suv-driver-dies-injuries/>said Yisroel Brod</a>.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>2 people died and 17 suffered serious injuries</strong> on these streets.

He backs protected bike lanes, busways, and daylighting. He promises to meet or beat the Streets Master Plan’s bike lane goals and to end project delays. &ldquo;Physically separated bus lanes&rdquo; and more automated enforcement are his pledge <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/07/decision-2025-mayoral-hopefuls-discuss-saving-us-from-reckless-drivers>discussed here</a>.

The project, not tied to a specific council bill, begins March 12 and is billed as an 18-month pilot. The main loop’s eastern stretch will be repaved and repainted, giving cyclists a 16-to-18-foot shared lane with authorized vehicles, flanked by two pedestrian lanes up to 14 feet wide. The city rejected a two-bike-lane alternative, citing pedestrian access needs. State Sen. Zellnor Myrie praised the upgrade, calling Prospect Park a treasure. Chief Public Realm Officer Ya-Ting Liu said, 'Re-examining how we design the roads in our park system is a perfect example of how we’re advancing the Mayor’s vision for quality public spaces throughout the city.'
