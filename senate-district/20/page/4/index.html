Who Will Stop the Bloodshed?</h1><p class="byline f6 silver">Written June 29, 2025 <em>(Revised June 29, 2025 – Minor stats refresh)</em></p></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>SD 20: Jan 1, 2022 - Jun 29, 2025</h2><h3 id=children-elders-and-the-unprotected>Children, Elders, and the Unprotected</h3><p><strong>In Senate District 20, the street is a gauntlet.</strong> In the past year, two people died and 1,298 were hurt in crashes. Sixteen suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The dead include a 101-year-old woman, a boy of eight, and a 68-year-old grandmother. Their lives ended at the curb, in the crosswalk, or crossing with the light.</p><p><strong>Just days ago, an eight-year-old boy was killed crossing Eastern Parkway with his sister.</strong> The driver stayed at the scene. The street stayed dangerous. &ldquo;Yeah, this street is dangerous,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-year-old-boy-killed-suv-crossing-intersection-crown-heights-brooklyn/16875804/>said a neighbor</a>. The boy’s name was Mordica Keller. He was walking home. He never made it.</p><p>In May, Maurette Lafleur, 68, was hit in a crosswalk in East Flatbush. She had the signal. The driver turned left and struck her. &ldquo;The lady spin around and sped through,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/16/fridays-headlines-east-flatbush-tragedy-edition>said Lorna Johnson, who watched her die</a>. The driver faced no charges.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the damage.</strong> In three years, they killed four pedestrians and left hundreds more with broken bodies. Trucks and vans killed three more. Bikes and mopeds hurt dozens, but the carnage comes on four wheels. The numbers are plain: 18 killed, 5,027 injured, 66 left with wounds that will not heal.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-votes-and-whats-missing>Leadership: Words, Votes, and What’s Missing</h3><p>State Senator Zellnor Myrie has voted for safer street design, backing a bill to require &ldquo;complete streets&rdquo; that protect everyone, not just drivers. He has called for more protected bike lanes, busways, and an end to delays. &ldquo;We should be making this as easy as possible and as safe as possible for as many people as possible,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/16/the-dave-colon-challenge-zellnor-myrie-wants-his-own-bike-now>he said after riding the streets himself</a>. He has supported congestion pricing and speed limiters for repeat offenders. But the blood on the street says it is not enough. Promises do not stop cars. Votes do not slow SUVs. <strong>Every week without action is another funeral.</strong></p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call Senator Myrie. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand that the killing stop.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Find out how to take action.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The city rejected a two-bike-lane alternative, citing pedestrian access needs. State Sen. Zellnor Myrie praised the upgrade, calling Prospect Park a treasure.
