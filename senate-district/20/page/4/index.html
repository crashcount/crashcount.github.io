One was a child. Fifteen more suffered serious injuries. These are not just numbers—they are bodies on the ground, families torn open, lives ended at the curb.</p><p>On June 28, an eight-year-old boy was crossing Eastern Parkway with his sister when a black SUV hit him. He died there, in the intersection. A witness said, &ldquo;I just saw a lot of blood gushing out of his ears, his mouth&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/boy-fatally-struck-honda-suv-driver-crown-heights-brooklyn/>NY Daily News</a>). The driver stayed. No arrest. The street stayed dangerous. Another neighbor said, &ldquo;Yeah, this street is dangerous&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-year-old-boy-killed-suv-crossing-intersection-crown-heights-brooklyn/16875804/>ABC7</a>).</p><p><strong>In the past year, 1,493 people were hurt in crashes here.</strong> Most were walking, biking, or just trying to live. Cars and SUVs did the most harm—killing, maiming, leaving scars that never heal.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-votes-and-the-long-road>Leadership: Promises, Votes, and the Long Road</h3><p>State Senator Zellnor Myrie has not been silent. He <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>voted yes on a bill</a> to force safer street designs for all users. He has backed more protected bike lanes, busways, and daylighting. He rode a bike through Brooklyn and said, &ldquo;We should be making this as easy as possible and as safe as possible for as many people as possible&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/16/the-dave-colon-challenge-zellnor-myrie-wants-his-own-bike-now>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>But the bodies keep coming.

Every month, another family in mourning.</strong></p><h3 id=what-now-the-next-step-is-yours>What Now: The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> The deaths are preventable. The pain is a choice made by those in power, or by those who do nothing. Call Senator Myrie. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for every crosswalk and bike lane. <strong>Do not wait for another child to die.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

They called for 'universal daylighting with hardened materials such as boulders, planters, and bike corrals' at intersections. The officials cited recent fatal crashes and urged the city to opt into a state law banning parking within 20 feet of corners. They want federal funds used for these changes.

Fresh pavement replaces potholes. Cyclists and pedestrians gain wider, dedicated lanes. Cars lose ground. Officials call it a pilot for city parks. If it works, Central Park could be next.</p><p class=mb3>On March 8, 2023, city officials announced a major redesign of Prospect Park’s East Drive. The project, not tied to a specific council bill, begins March 12 and is billed as an 18-month pilot. The main loop’s eastern stretch will be repaved and repainted, giving cyclists a 16-to-18-foot shared lane with authorized vehicles, flanked by two pedestrian lanes up to 14 feet wide. The city rejected a two-bike-lane alternative, citing pedestrian access needs. State Sen. Zellnor Myrie praised the upgrade, calling Prospect Park a treasure. Chief Public Realm Officer Ya-Ting Liu said, 'Re-examining how we design the roads in our park system is a perfect example of how we’re advancing the Mayor’s vision for quality public spaces throughout the city.' Officials stress the park is closed to private vehicles.
