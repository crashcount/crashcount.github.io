He was walking with his sister when a black Honda SUV struck him. The driver stayed. The boy did not. A witness said, &ldquo;I just saw a lot of blood gushing out of his ears, his mouth&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/boy-fatally-struck-honda-suv-driver-crown-heights-brooklyn/>NY Daily News</a>). Neighbors called the street dangerous. The city called it an accident. The family called the undertaker.</p><p>In the last twelve months, three people have died in crashes in SD 20. One was a child. One was over 75. Over 1,200 people have been injured (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Thirteen were seriously hurt. The dead and wounded are not numbers. They are children, elders, neighbors. They are the cost of delay.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-young>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Young</h3><p>Cars and SUVs do most of the killing. In the last three years, SUVs and sedans caused five pedestrian deaths and hundreds of injuries. Trucks and buses killed three more. Bikes and mopeds did not kill a single pedestrian. The pattern is clear. The danger is heavy and fast (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=what-has-senator-myrie-done>What Has Senator Myrie Done?</h3><p>Senator Zellnor Myrie has voted for safer streets. He backed the 2024 bill to redesign roads for all users, not just drivers (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>supported the 2024 bill</a>). He has called for more protected bike lanes, busways, and daylighting. He rode a bike with a reporter and said, &ldquo;We should be making this as easy as possible and as safe as possible for as many people as possible&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/16/the-dave-colon-challenge-zellnor-myrie-wants-his-own-bike-now>said Myrie</a>). He supports congestion pricing and enforcement against reckless drivers. But the deaths keep coming. The pace of change is slow. The streets are not safe yet.</p><h3 id=the-call-no-more-waiting>The Call: No More Waiting</h3><p>Every day of delay is another family broken. Call Senator Myrie. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people on foot and bike. Do not wait for the next child to die.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
