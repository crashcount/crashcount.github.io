A black Honda Pilot hit him. His sister watched. Neighbors ran for towels. They tried to stop the blood. &ldquo;I saw the kid being dragged from underneath the car by a woman,&rdquo; a witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/boy-fatally-struck-honda-suv-driver-crown-heights-brooklyn/>said</a>. The boy died. The driver stayed. No arrest. The street stayed the same.</p><p>Just weeks before, a 101-year-old woman was killed crossing Montgomery Street at Brooklyn Avenue. A GMC SUV, left turn, unlicensed driver. She had the signal. She did not make it across. In the last year, four people have died on these streets. One was a child. One was a centenarian. One was a cyclist. One was a man crushed by a truck. <strong>No one is safe.</strong></p><h3 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h3><p>In the last twelve months, SD 20 saw <strong>4 deaths and 15 serious injuries</strong>. <strong>1,495 people were hurt</strong>. Children, elders, cyclists, walkers. Cars and SUVs did most of the killing—<strong>5 deaths and 18 serious injuries</strong> citywide in the period, just from these vehicles <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>according to NYC Open Data</a>.

But when the bill came up for a vote in June, he was marked &ldquo;excused&rdquo;—<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>absent</a>. The bill passed committee. The streets did not change.</p><h3 id=the-call-no-more-waiting>The Call: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> Call Senator Myrie. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand action on repeat speeders. Demand streets where children and elders can cross and live. <strong>Do not wait for another towel, another body, another name.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report states, 'The box truck hit him first. The SUV followed. Head shattered. Bones crushed. He died there, beneath the streetlights, far from the crosswalk, alone on the asphalt.' Both vehicles—a box truck and a sport utility vehicle—were traveling straight ahead at the time of the collision. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified' for both drivers, offering no further detail on specific driver errors. The pedestrian was crossing the street at a location not marked by a signal or crosswalk, but the report does not cite this as a contributing factor. The focus remains on the lethal impact of large vehicles moving unchecked through city streets, leaving a man dead and unanswered questions in their wake.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Advocates back the push.</p><p class=mb3>On January 17, 2024, seven Brooklyn elected officials—including Council Member Shahana Hanif, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, Assembly Members Marcela Mitaynes, Jo Anne Simon, Robert Carroll, and State Senators Zellnor Myrie and Andrew Gounardes—issued a joint letter to the NYC Department of Transportation. They called for 'universal daylighting with hardened materials such as boulders, planters, and bike corrals' at intersections. The officials cited recent fatal crashes and urged the city to opt into a state law banning parking within 20 feet of corners. They want federal funds used for these changes. The group opposes DOT’s slow pace and reliance on paint, demanding physical barriers. Community board leaders and advocates support the move. DOT says it will review the letter and remains committed to evidence-based daylighting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
