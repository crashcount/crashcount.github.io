A black Honda Pilot hit him as he crossed with his sister. He was eight. The 69‑year‑old driver stayed. No arrest. Neighbors called the street dangerous. “<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-year-old-boy-killed-suv-crossing-intersection-crown-heights-brooklyn/16875804/>Police are looking at whether speed was a factor</a>.” A witness said, “<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/boy-fatally-struck-honda-suv-driver-crown-heights-brooklyn/>I saw the kid being dragged from underneath the car</a>.”</p><p>At Montgomery and Brooklyn Avenue, a driver turned left and struck a woman in the crosswalk. She was 101. The SUV driver was unlicensed, police records say. She had the walk. The report lists “<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Failure to Yield Right‑of‑Way</a>” as a factor.</p><p>On Church and East 55th, a Ford SUV hit a 36‑year‑old man at the intersection. He died at the scene, the city dataset shows. The car went straight. He didn’t get up.</p><p>On Flatbush at Caton, an Audi sedan struck a 64‑year‑old man away from the crosswalk. The entry says “Crush Injuries.” No more words.</p><h3 id=where-the-bodies-are>Where the bodies are</h3><p>These deaths sit inside Senate District 20. The roll call is short and brutal:</p><ul><li>Eastern Parkway at Albany Ave: boy, 8, killed by SUV, driver remained, investigation ongoing (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYPD crash database</a>; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-year-old-boy-killed-suv-crossing-intersection-crown-heights-brooklyn/16875804/>ABC7</a>; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/boy-fatally-struck-honda-suv-driver-crown-heights-brooklyn/>NY Daily News</a>).</li><li>Montgomery St at Brooklyn Ave: woman, 101, crossing with the signal, struck and killed by unlicensed left‑turning SUV driver (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data, CrashID 4804451</a>).</li><li>Church Ave at E 55 St: man, 36, pedestrian at the intersection, struck by Ford SUV, killed (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4828979</a>).</li><li>Flatbush Ave at Caton Ave: man, 64, pedestrian outside an intersection, killed by sedan (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4783016</a>).</li><li>Prospect Park West Drive at Center Drive: cyclist, 71, died after losing consciousness while riding, no motor vehicle involved (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4824644</a>).</li></ul><p>This district logged 9,752 crashes since 2022. <strong>22 people are dead. 5,768 are hurt</strong>. SUVs and cars account for most injuries to people on foot (<a href=#>PeriodStats</a>).</p><h3 id=the-numbers-dont-blink>The numbers don’t blink</h3><p>Year to date, crashes are up. Compared to last year’s span, SD 20 has <strong>21.7% more crashes</strong> and more people hurt. Deaths rose from 3 to 4 in the same period (<a href=#>PeriodStats</a>). Children are not spared: one killed this year; 98 injured so far. Seniors too: deaths in the 65–74 and 75+ bands, injuries in every decade (<a href=#>PeriodStats</a>).</p><p>Pedestrians are hit most by sedans and SUVs. The dataset lists 398 pedestrian casualties tied to sedans and 302 tied to SUVs, including deaths (<a href=#>PeriodStats</a>). Trucks and buses add to the toll. No corridor carries it all. Many do their part.</p><h3 id=a-child-a-century-and-a-light-that-stayed-green>A child, a century, and a light that stayed green</h3><p>Witnesses at Eastern Parkway spoke in fragments. “<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>They were walking, he was crossing the street with his sister</a>,” a neighbor said. “<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/boy-fatally-struck-honda-suv-driver-crown-heights-brooklyn/>I just saw a lot of blood</a>,” another said. The driver stood by the car. The NYPD towed the SUV. No charges announced in the press reports.</p><p>On Montgomery Street, the form fields are stark. “Crossing With Signal.” “Failure to Yield.” “Unlicensed.” Center front end. Left turn. That is all the city gives you. It is enough.</p><h3 id=power-sits-on-the-switch>Power sits on the switch</h3><p>Albany gave the city the power to drop speeds. The city can act. A 20 mph default on local streets is on the table. Speed cameras now run around the clock through 2030. The tools to slow cars exist. The city has not used all of them. The state can press repeat offenders.</p><p>The Senate is moving a bill to stop the worst drivers. The <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045)</strong> would force drivers with heavy records to install speed limiters. The measure advanced in June; SD 20’s senator is listed as a co‑sponsor. Two committee votes passed while he was marked excused (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>bill file</a>).</p><p>Slow the streets. Box in the worst speeders. That is the work.</p><p>Take one step now. Tell City Hall and Albany to use the tools we already have. Start here: <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

He described tires on his back, threats of pepper spray, and trauma that lingers. The Civilian Complaint Review Board found the officer abused his authority.</p><p class=mb3>On June 30, 2022, State Senator Zellnor Myrie testified at an NYPD disciplinary hearing for Officer Michael Kovalik, a member of the Strategic Response Group. The hearing followed a Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) investigation, which found Kovalik abused his authority by threatening Myrie and others with pepper spray during a protest on May 29, 2020. The matter centered on 'excessive use of force with department-issued bikes' and the officer's actions at a protest outside Barclays Center after George Floyd's murder. Myrie, detained with zip ties, said, 'I felt what felt like bike tires on my back and on my arms.' He described lasting trauma from the incident. The CCRB prosecutor, Andre Applewhite, argued video evidence confirmed the threats. Myrie and another lawmaker have filed a federal lawsuit against the NYPD. The case highlights the dangers faced by peaceful protesters and the use of police bicycles as tools of force.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
