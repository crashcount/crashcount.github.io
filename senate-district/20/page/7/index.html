It keeps growing.</p><h3 id=eastern-parkway-took-a-boy>Eastern Parkway took a boy</h3><p>At Eastern Parkway and Albany, a southbound Honda Pilot hit an eight‑year‑old crossing with his sister at 5:33 p.m. The driver stayed. No arrest that day. Police said they were looking at speed. Witnesses saw the child dragged from under the SUV. “I just saw a lot of blood,” one said. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a> confirms the fatal strike on June 28, 2025. The scene and voices are in the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/boy-fatally-struck-honda-suv-driver-crown-heights-brooklyn/>Daily News</a> and <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-year-old-boy-killed-suv-crossing-intersection-crown-heights-brooklyn/16875804/>ABC7</a>: “Police are looking at whether speed was a factor.”</p><h3 id=a-century-of-life-ended-in-a-turn>A century of life ended in a turn</h3><p>On April 8, 2025, at Montgomery and Brooklyn, a GMC SUV making a left failed to yield and hit a woman, 101, who was crossing with the signal. The driver was unlicensed, the record says. She died of head injuries. This is all in the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city dataset</a> for CrashID 4804451.</p><h3 id=caton-and-flatbush-broke-a-man>Caton and Flatbush broke a man</h3><p>New Year’s Eve, 2024. Flatbush at Caton. An Audi sedan struck a 64‑year‑old man outside an intersection. He suffered crush injuries and died. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city crash file</a> shows the death at 5:40 p.m., CrashID 4783016.</p><h3 id=prospect-parks-quiet-morning-then-a-body>Prospect Park’s quiet morning, then a body</h3><p>June 5, 2025. West Drive at Center Drive. A 71‑year‑old bicyclist going straight ahead lost consciousness and died. No second vehicle listed. The bike shows “no damage” in the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>official record</a>, CrashID 4824644.</p><h3 id=church-and-e-55-midday-one-more-death>Church and E 55: mid‑day, one more death</h3><p>July 17, 2025. Church Avenue at East 55th Street. A Ford SUV hit a 36‑year‑old man at the intersection. The file lists “alcohol involvement” and “crossing against signal.” He died at the scene. The SUV was going straight. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYPD dataset</a> is blunt, CrashID 4828979. Only one person is dead, and it isn’t the driver.</p><h3 id=the-count-wont-stop>The count won’t stop</h3><p>From 2022 to now, SD 20 logged 9,752 crashes, 5,768 injuries, and 22 deaths. In the last 12 months alone, there were 2,936 crashes, 1,861 injuries, and 5 deaths. Year‑to‑date crashes and injuries are up sharply over last year. These figures come from our area roll‑up of <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. SUVs and cars are the main source of harm to people on foot: 868 pedestrian injuries, including 7 deaths in the period covered, tied to those vehicles. Trucks and buses add more. See the full breakdown in our <a href=#>statistics</a> sourced from the same dataset.</p><h3 id=the-senator-rides-then-misses-votes>The senator rides, then misses votes</h3><p>State Sen. Zellnor Myrie says streets must be safe for riders and walkers. “We should be making this as easy as possible and as safe as possible for as many people as possible,” he told <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/16/the-dave-colon-challenge-zellnor-myrie-wants-his-own-bike-now>Streetsblog</a> on a June 16, 2025 ride. He co‑sponsored the speed‑limiter bill, <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>, which targets repeat violators. But on June 11 and 12, committee votes moved that bill forward while he was marked “excused.” The records are on the Senate site via <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>.</p><h3 id=what-stops-the-next-one>What stops the next one</h3><p>The tools sit on the table. Albany passed Sammy’s Law to let the city set lower speed limits. City Hall can drop residential streets to 20 mph. The state bill S 4045 would force speed limiters on repeat offenders. Both are covered in our <a href=/take_action/>Take Action page</a> and the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Senate file</a>. Use them.</p><p><strong>One task today:</strong> tell City Hall to set a default 20 mph and back speed limiters for chronic offenders.
