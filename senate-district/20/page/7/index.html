He did not make it. A black Honda Pilot struck him at the intersection with Albany Avenue. Witnesses saw a woman drag the boy from under the SUV. &ldquo;I just saw a lot of blood gushing out of his ears, his mouth,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/boy-fatally-struck-honda-suv-driver-crown-heights-brooklyn/>said one witness</a>.

Fifteen people suffered serious injuries. Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians all paid. SUVs and cars did most of the harm—<strong>5 deaths and 784 injuries</strong> to pedestrians in recent years. Trucks and buses killed three more. Bikes and mopeds took lives too, but the carnage comes on four wheels, not two. The disaster is slow, but it does not stop.</p><h2 id=leadership-words-votes-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Words, Votes, and Missed Chances</h2><p>State Senator Zellnor Myrie has stood with advocates for safer streets. He co-sponsored the <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act</strong>, a bill to force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed limiters. But when the bill came to a vote in June, he was marked &ldquo;excused&rdquo;—absent, not voting <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>on both June 11 and June 12</a>. Myrie has spoken for protected bike lanes and busways, saying, &ldquo;We should be making this as easy as possible and as safe as possible for as many people as possible&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/16/the-dave-colon-challenge-zellnor-myrie-wants-his-own-bike-now>on a recent ride</a>. But words do not stop cars. Votes do. Laws do.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a policy failure.</strong> Call Senator Myrie. Tell him to show up and vote for the bills that save lives. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand action, not sympathy. Do not wait for another child to die. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
