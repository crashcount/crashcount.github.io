A black SUV hit him. Neighbors saw the boy dragged from under the car. &ldquo;I just saw a lot of blood gushing out of his ears, his mouth,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/boy-fatally-struck-honda-suv-driver-crown-heights-brooklyn/>a witness said</a>. The driver stayed. The boy did not.</p><p>This is not rare. In the last twelve months, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>four people died and 1,489 were injured</a> in SD 20. Fifteen suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians—no one is spared. The numbers are not just numbers. They are families left with empty beds and blood on the street.</p><h3 id=the-slow-grind-of-policy>The Slow Grind of Policy</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> In this district, they killed five, seriously injured eighteen, and hurt hundreds more. Trucks and buses killed three. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll, but the deadliest threat is always heavy and fast.</p><p>Senator Zellnor Myrie has spoken for safer streets. He rode a bike through Brooklyn, saying, &ldquo;We should be making this as easy as possible and as safe as possible for as many people as possible&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/16/the-dave-colon-challenge-zellnor-myrie-wants-his-own-bike-now>he told Streetsblog</a>. He co-sponsored the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed limiters. But when the bill came up for a key vote in June, <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>he missed it</a>. The bill passed committee, but the work is not done.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p>Every crash is preventable. Streets can be rebuilt. Speed can be tamed. Laws can be enforced. But none of this happens without pressure. &ldquo;Yeah, this street is dangerous,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-year-old-boy-killed-suv-crossing-intersection-crown-heights-brooklyn/16875804/>a neighbor said</a>. The city knows. Albany knows. Your leaders know. Now they need to hear it from you.</p><p>Call Senator Myrie. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action on repeat reckless drivers. Demand streets where children can cross and come home.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, titled 'Relates to requiring the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices for repeated violation of maximum speed limits,' mandates these devices for drivers who rack up eleven or more points in 24 months, or six speed or red light camera tickets in a year. The measure aims to curb repeat dangerous driving. Senators including Jamaal Bailey, Jabari Brisport, and others voted yes.

Cars keep two lanes. Buses lose out. Cyclists get nothing. Sidewalks widen, but most space stays with traffic. Critics say safety for walkers and riders is left behind.</p><p class=mb3>On May 22, 2025, Streetsblog NYC covered the city's announcement of a $550 million redesign for Fifth Avenue. The plan, described as a 'much-compromised redesign,' keeps two car lanes, scraps a bus lane, and offers no space for cyclists. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called it a 'pedestrian-first corridor,' but critics, including Riders Alliance spokesman Danny Pearlstein, slammed the move as a 'huge corporate giveaway at New Yorkers' expense.' The redesign widens sidewalks and adds planters and seating, but cars still dominate. Council members and advocates oppose the car-first approach. According to safety analysts, the event only mentions the redesign and its cost, without specifying design features or their effects on vulnerable road users; therefore, the safety impact cannot be determined from the information provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On May 13, 2025, Andrew Cuomo, running for NYC mayor, made a campaign statement targeting 'delivery chaos.' He proposes revising the city’s minimum pay law and making app companies liable for damages caused by delivery riders. His campaign website claims these changes will 'eliminate inappropriate incentives to dangerous use of e-bikes.' DoorDash donated $1 million to a Cuomo-aligned super PAC. Comptroller Brad Lander accused Cuomo of siding with app companies, saying, 'DoorDash is trying to buy Cuomo’s election...so he’ll roll back the law I passed that requires them to pay their workers a living wage.' Other officials, including Scott Stringer and Zellnor Myrie, voiced doubts about Cuomo’s commitment to delivery worker protections. The bill is not in committee; it is a campaign proposal. The safety impact for vulnerable road users remains unclear, but the fight over pay and regulation leaves delivery workers exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lander pushed for stricter rules on heavy e-bikes and a crackdown on illegal sales, saying, 'I support stricter regulations for the heaviest e-bikes, which can travel at higher speeds and are more likely to injure both riders and pedestrians.' Mamdani supported e-bike subsidies with safety checks. Tilson urged a 20 mph cap and mandatory registration for delivery e-bikes.
