The street was busy. The driver stayed at the scene. There was no arrest. A witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/boy-fatally-struck-honda-suv-driver-crown-heights-brooklyn/>described</a> the horror: &ldquo;I saw the kid being dragged from underneath the car by a woman.&rdquo; Another neighbor <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-year-old-boy-killed-suv-crossing-intersection-crown-heights-brooklyn/16875804/>said</a>, &ldquo;Yeah, this street is dangerous.&rdquo;</p><p>This is not rare. In the past year, SD 20 saw 3 deaths and 13 serious injuries. Children, elders, and working people. SUVs and cars did most of the killing.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-that-dont-lie>The Numbers That Don’t Lie</h3><p>In the last 12 months:</p><ul><li>1 child killed, 70 children injured</li><li>1 elder killed, 39 elders injured</li><li>1 person over 55 killed, 152 injured</li><li>Total: 3 dead, 1,293 injured, 13 seriously hurt</li></ul><p>SUVs and cars caused the most harm: 5 deaths, 18 serious injuries since 2022. Trucks and buses killed 3. Motorcycles and mopeds, none. Bikes, none. The bodies pile up. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=what-has-senator-myrie-done>What Has Senator Myrie Done?</h3><p>Senator Zellnor Myrie has voted for safer streets. In June 2024, he <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>voted yes</a> on a bill to require &ldquo;complete street design&rdquo;—redesigning roads to protect everyone, not just drivers. He has <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/16/the-dave-colon-challenge-zellnor-myrie-wants-his-own-bike-now>called</a> for more protected bike lanes, busways, and congestion pricing. He <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/16/the-dave-colon-challenge-zellnor-myrie-wants-his-own-bike-now>said</a>, &ldquo;We should be making this as easy as possible and as safe as possible for as many people as possible.&rdquo;</p><p>But the deaths keep coming. Promises and plans do not stop a speeding SUV. Every day without change is another day someone dies.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy.</p><p>Call Senator Myrie. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real street redesigns—protected bike lanes, daylighted corners, busways. Do not wait for another child’s blood on the street.</p><p>Act now. The next victim is only a day away.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The plan includes concrete bus boarding islands and may reduce car lanes, giving more space to pedestrians and buses.

The city may physically protect the lane, but details are pending. The B41 bus, serving 28,000 daily trips, crawls at 4 mph during rush hour.

His campaign website claims these changes will 'eliminate inappropriate incentives to dangerous use of e-bikes.' DoorDash donated $1 million to a Cuomo-aligned super PAC. Comptroller Brad Lander accused Cuomo of siding with app companies, saying, 'DoorDash is trying to buy Cuomo’s election...so he’ll roll back the law I passed that requires them to pay their workers a living wage.'

The forum, hosted by Streetsblog NYC, asked candidates how they would address reckless driving. Scott Stringer said, 'The best way to curtail reckless driving is to make less room for reckless drivers on the road.' Zellnor Myrie promised 'physically separated bus lanes' and expanded automated enforcement. Jessica Ramos called for 'a citywide strategy that prioritizes safety through design.' Zohran Mamdani wants to move traffic enforcement from NYPD to DOT, ending biased stops. Whitney Tilson supports more police and cameras. The candidates back protected bike lanes, busways, daylighting, and automated enforcement. Their plans center on street redesign and accountability, not blaming victims. Each pledges to protect pedestrians, cyclists, and transit riders from systemic danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Scott Stringer calls for 'dedicated bus lanes, more enforcement, more shelters, better curbs, more transit signal priority, all-door boarding, and more frequent off-peak services.'

The event was not a council bill, but a public challenge.

Scott Stringer, Zellnor Myrie, Jessica Ramos, Brad Lander, and Whitney Tilson responded, each supporting congestion pricing and further transit investment. Streetsblog’s demand was clear—protect vulnerable road users. The safety analyst notes that congestion pricing reduces car traffic, lowers crash risk for pedestrians and cyclists, encourages mode shift, and opens the door for street redesigns that put vulnerable users first. The debate underscores urgency: congestion pricing helps, but more must be done to make streets safe for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
