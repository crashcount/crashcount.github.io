A black Honda Pilot hit him as he crossed with his sister. He was eight. The 69‑year‑old driver stayed. No arrest. Neighbors called the street dangerous. “<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-year-old-boy-killed-suv-crossing-intersection-crown-heights-brooklyn/16875804/>Police are looking at whether speed was a factor</a>.” A witness said, “<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/boy-fatally-struck-honda-suv-driver-crown-heights-brooklyn/>I saw the kid being dragged from underneath the car</a>.”</p><p>At Montgomery and Brooklyn Avenue, a driver turned left and struck a woman in the crosswalk. She was 101. The SUV driver was unlicensed, police records say. She had the walk. The report lists “<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Failure to Yield Right‑of‑Way</a>” as a factor.</p><p>On Church and East 55th, a Ford SUV hit a 36‑year‑old man at the intersection. He died at the scene, the city dataset shows. The car went straight. He didn’t get up.</p><p>On Flatbush at Caton, an Audi sedan struck a 64‑year‑old man away from the crosswalk. The entry says “Crush Injuries.” No more words.</p><h3 id=where-the-bodies-are>Where the bodies are</h3><p>These deaths sit inside Senate District 20.

SUVs and cars account for most injuries to people on foot (<a href=#>PeriodStats</a>).</p><h3 id=the-numbers-dont-blink>The numbers don’t blink</h3><p>Year to date, crashes are up. Compared to last year’s span, SD 20 has <strong>21.7% more crashes</strong> and more people hurt. Deaths rose from 3 to 4 in the same period (<a href=#>PeriodStats</a>). Children are not spared: one killed this year; 98 injured so far. Seniors too: deaths in the 65–74 and 75+ bands, injuries in every decade (<a href=#>PeriodStats</a>).</p><p>Pedestrians are hit most by sedans and SUVs. The dataset lists 398 pedestrian casualties tied to sedans and 302 tied to SUVs, including deaths (<a href=#>PeriodStats</a>). Trucks and buses add to the toll. No corridor carries it all. Many do their part.</p><h3 id=a-child-a-century-and-a-light-that-stayed-green>A child, a century, and a light that stayed green</h3><p>Witnesses at Eastern Parkway spoke in fragments. “<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>They were walking, he was crossing the street with his sister</a>,” a neighbor said. “<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/boy-fatally-struck-honda-suv-driver-crown-heights-brooklyn/>I just saw a lot of blood</a>,” another said. The driver stood by the car. The NYPD towed the SUV. No charges announced in the press reports.</p><p>On Montgomery Street, the form fields are stark. “Crossing With Signal.” “Failure to Yield.” “Unlicensed.” Center front end. Left turn. That is all the city gives you. It is enough.</p><h3 id=power-sits-on-the-switch>Power sits on the switch</h3><p>Albany gave the city the power to drop speeds. The city can act. A 20 mph default on local streets is on the table. Speed cameras now run around the clock through 2030. The tools to slow cars exist. The city has not used all of them. The state can press repeat offenders.</p><p>The Senate is moving a bill to stop the worst drivers. The <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045)</strong> would force drivers with heavy records to install speed limiters. The measure advanced in June; SD 20’s senator is listed as a co‑sponsor. Two committee votes passed while he was marked excused (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>bill file</a>).</p><p>Slow the streets. Box in the worst speeders. That is the work.</p><p>Take one step now. Tell City Hall and Albany to use the tools we already have. Start here: <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The article states: "The car is driven by multiple people, all of whom have been reminded to obey the speed limit, and there are no outstanding tickets." Cuomo’s spokesperson, Esther Jensen, noted his past support for speed cameras. Mayoral rival Brad Lander and Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani criticized Cuomo’s record, calling his driving 'reckless and unlawful.' Zellnor Myrie’s spokesperson, Julia Rose, said Cuomo acts above the law.

He highlighted blocked bike lanes, rising injuries, and the lack of protected infrastructure. Myrie voiced support for congestion pricing, safer streets, and reducing car dependency.

Concrete islands promise safer crossings. Details remain thin. Cars may still block buses. The street could change. Pedestrians and riders wait. The city holds its breath.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC (2025-06-09) reports the Department of Transportation plans a center-running bus lane on Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn. The project aims to connect neighborhoods and calm traffic. DOT Assistant Director Dustin Khuu said the goal is a 'high performing transit priority street.' The plan includes concrete bus boarding islands and may reduce car lanes, giving more space to pedestrians and buses. However, the article notes gaps: 'DOT didn't share a block-by-block breakdown,' and curbside parking may remain, risking bus lane obstruction by double-parked vehicles. The city may physically protect the lane, but details are pending. The B41 bus, serving 28,000 daily trips, crawls at 4 mph during rush hour. The proposal highlights the need for clear enforcement and design to keep cars out of bus lanes and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
