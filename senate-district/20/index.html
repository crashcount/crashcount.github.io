A black Honda Pilot hit him as he crossed with his sister. He was eight. The 69‑year‑old driver stayed. No arrest. Neighbors called the street dangerous. “<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-year-old-boy-killed-suv-crossing-intersection-crown-heights-brooklyn/16875804/>Police are looking at whether speed was a factor</a>.” A witness said, “<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/boy-fatally-struck-honda-suv-driver-crown-heights-brooklyn/>I saw the kid being dragged from underneath the car</a>.”</p><p>At Montgomery and Brooklyn Avenue, a driver turned left and struck a woman in the crosswalk. She was 101. The SUV driver was unlicensed, police records say. She had the walk. The report lists “<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Failure to Yield Right‑of‑Way</a>” as a factor.</p><p>On Church and East 55th, a Ford SUV hit a 36‑year‑old man at the intersection. He died at the scene, the city dataset shows. The car went straight. He didn’t get up.</p><p>On Flatbush at Caton, an Audi sedan struck a 64‑year‑old man away from the crosswalk. The entry says “Crush Injuries.” No more words.</p><h3 id=where-the-bodies-are>Where the bodies are</h3><p>These deaths sit inside Senate District 20.

SUVs and cars account for most injuries to people on foot (<a href=#>PeriodStats</a>).</p><h3 id=the-numbers-dont-blink>The numbers don’t blink</h3><p>Year to date, crashes are up. Compared to last year’s span, SD 20 has <strong>21.7% more crashes</strong> and more people hurt. Deaths rose from 3 to 4 in the same period (<a href=#>PeriodStats</a>). Children are not spared: one killed this year; 98 injured so far. Seniors too: deaths in the 65–74 and 75+ bands, injuries in every decade (<a href=#>PeriodStats</a>).</p><p>Pedestrians are hit most by sedans and SUVs. The dataset lists 398 pedestrian casualties tied to sedans and 302 tied to SUVs, including deaths (<a href=#>PeriodStats</a>). Trucks and buses add to the toll. No corridor carries it all. Many do their part.</p><h3 id=a-child-a-century-and-a-light-that-stayed-green>A child, a century, and a light that stayed green</h3><p>Witnesses at Eastern Parkway spoke in fragments. “<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/us-news/eight-year-old-boy-killed-in-tragic-brooklyn-car-accident/>They were walking, he was crossing the street with his sister</a>,” a neighbor said. “<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/boy-fatally-struck-honda-suv-driver-crown-heights-brooklyn/>I just saw a lot of blood</a>,” another said. The driver stood by the car. The NYPD towed the SUV. No charges announced in the press reports.</p><p>On Montgomery Street, the form fields are stark. “Crossing With Signal.” “Failure to Yield.” “Unlicensed.” Center front end. Left turn. That is all the city gives you. It is enough.</p><h3 id=power-sits-on-the-switch>Power sits on the switch</h3><p>Albany gave the city the power to drop speeds. The city can act. A 20 mph default on local streets is on the table. Speed cameras now run around the clock through 2030. The tools to slow cars exist. The city has not used all of them. The state can press repeat offenders.</p><p>The Senate is moving a bill to stop the worst drivers. The <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045)</strong> would force drivers with heavy records to install speed limiters. The measure advanced in June; SD 20’s senator is listed as a co‑sponsor. Two committee votes passed while he was marked excused (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>bill file</a>).</p><p>Slow the streets. Box in the worst speeders. That is the work.</p><p>Take one step now. Tell City Hall and Albany to use the tools we already have.

That makes four in three months. Each violation happened near Brooklyn schools. Cuomo’s team paid the fines. Leaders who speed endanger walkers and riders. Streets stay deadly when the powerful ignore the law.</p><p class=mb3>On June 16, 2025, Streetsblog NYC reported that former Governor Andrew Cuomo’s car received two new speed-camera tickets, bringing the total to four in three months. The article states: "The car is driven by multiple people, all of whom have been reminded to obey the speed limit, and there are no outstanding tickets." Cuomo’s spokesperson, Esther Jensen, noted his past support for speed cameras. Mayoral rival Brad Lander and Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani criticized Cuomo’s record, calling his driving 'reckless and unlawful.' Zellnor Myrie’s spokesperson, Julia Rose, said Cuomo acts above the law. The safety analyst notes: this event describes an individual's driving and parking behavior but does not constitute a policy change or legislation affecting population-level safety for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He saw blocked lanes, heavy traffic, and real risk. Myrie called out the dangers for new cyclists. He backed safer bike lanes and fewer cars. The ride changed nothing systemic.</p><p class=mb3>On June 16, 2025, State Senator Zellnor Myrie joined reporter Dave Colon for a bike ride through Brooklyn, as covered by Streetsblog NYC. The event was not a formal bill or committee action, but a public statement on street safety. Myrie said, "We should be making this as easy as possible and as safe as possible for as many people as possible." He highlighted blocked bike lanes, rising injuries, and the lack of protected infrastructure. Myrie voiced support for congestion pricing, safer streets, and reducing car dependency. The safety impact is neutral: a senator riding a bike is symbolic and does not directly change safety outcomes for pedestrians or cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
