Cuomo’s spokesperson, Esther Jensen, noted his past support for speed cameras.

Cars keep two lanes. Buses lose out. Cyclists get nothing. Sidewalks widen, but most space stays with traffic. Critics say safety for walkers and riders is left behind.</p><p class=mb3>On May 22, 2025, Streetsblog NYC covered the city's announcement of a $550 million redesign for Fifth Avenue. The plan, described as a 'much-compromised redesign,' keeps two car lanes, scraps a bus lane, and offers no space for cyclists. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called it a 'pedestrian-first corridor,' but critics, including Riders Alliance spokesman Danny Pearlstein, slammed the move as a 'huge corporate giveaway at New Yorkers' expense.' The redesign widens sidewalks and adds planters and seating, but cars still dominate. Council members and advocates oppose the car-first approach. According to safety analysts, the event only mentions the redesign and its cost, without specifying design features or their effects on vulnerable road users; therefore, the safety impact cannot be determined from the information provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On May 13, 2025, Andrew Cuomo, running for NYC mayor, made a campaign statement targeting 'delivery chaos.' He proposes revising the city’s minimum pay law and making app companies liable for damages caused by delivery riders. His campaign website claims these changes will 'eliminate inappropriate incentives to dangerous use of e-bikes.' DoorDash donated $1 million to a Cuomo-aligned super PAC. Comptroller Brad Lander accused Cuomo of siding with app companies, saying, 'DoorDash is trying to buy Cuomo’s election...so he’ll roll back the law I passed that requires them to pay their workers a living wage.' Other officials, including Scott Stringer and Zellnor Myrie, voiced doubts about Cuomo’s commitment to delivery worker protections. The bill is not in committee; it is a campaign proposal. The safety impact for vulnerable road users remains unclear, but the fight over pay and regulation leaves delivery workers exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
