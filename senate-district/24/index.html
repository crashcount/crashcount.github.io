Each number is a name, a family, a life cut short or broken. Just weeks ago, a 16-year-old on an e-scooter died on College Avenue. He crossed into the path of a Hyundai. The police said, <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>&ldquo;Ellis suffered head trauma as a result of the crash.&rdquo;</a> No arrests. No comfort. Only the sound of sirens and the hush that follows.</p><p>On Hylan Boulevard, an 80-year-old man tried to cross the street. He did not make it. The driver stayed. The man did not. Police said they were <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/driver-fatally-strikes-80-year-old-staten-island-man-a-block-from-his-home-police-say>&ldquo;still investigating how fast the woman was driving and what the traffic signals at the intersection were displaying at the time.&rdquo;</a> The questions linger. The loss remains.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists bear the brunt.</strong> Cars and trucks killed six, left hundreds more with injuries (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash data</a>). Trucks, SUVs, sedans—they do not discriminate. They crush, they maim, they kill. The old, the young, the ones just trying to get home. The roll call of the dead is steady. The pain is not shared equally.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-and-inaction>Leadership: Action and Inaction</h2><p>State Senator Andrew Lanza has voted for some safety bills. He supported new safety zones. But when it mattered most, he voted <strong>against reauthorizing speed cameras in school zones</strong>—a proven tool to slow drivers and save lives (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>voted against speed cameras</a>). He also voted <strong>against lowering speed limits near schools</strong> (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted against lower speed limits</a>). The record is clear. When the choice was children or convenience, he chose the latter. When the Senate debated speed cameras, Lanza called the program a <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/06/01/state-senate-overwhelmingly-supports-24-7-speed-cameras-for-the-city>&ldquo;cash register&rdquo;</a>.</p><h2 id=what-now>What Now?</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay, every vote against safety, is a choice. Call Senator Lanza. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras where children walk. Demand action before another family gets the call.</p><p><strong>The blood on the street is not an accident.

Their votes keep streets exposed. Pedestrians and cyclists lose a shield. Reckless drivers win. The city’s most basic defense—rejected. The toll will be measured in blood, not words.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13 and June 17, 2025, the New York State Senate and Assembly voted on reauthorizing New York City's school zone speed camera program. The Senate passed the measure 38-21; three city senators—Stephen Chan, Andrew Lanza, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton—voted no. The Assembly passed it 110-31, with nine city lawmakers—Alec Brook-Krasny, Lester Chang, Simcha Eichenstein, Michael Novakhov, Stacey Pheffer Amato, Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Reilly, David Weprin, Kalman Yeger—opposing. The Streetsblog NYC article, 'Ye Shall Know Their Names! Meet the Dirty Dozen City Pols Who Voted Against Speed Camera Program,' quotes lawmakers dismissing speed cameras as revenue grabs or burdens. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action, so no direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists can be assessed.' Still, the votes signal disregard for proven tools that protect those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
