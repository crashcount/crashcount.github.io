Thirty-six suffered serious injuries.</strong> Four thousand more carry wounds that do not heal. In the last twelve months alone, five families buried loved ones. <strong>Children, elders, workers—no one is spared.</strong></p><p>A man crossing Hylan Boulevard never made it home. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/10/staten-island-pedestrian-struck-suv-driver-block-from-home-chaosheng-wu/>Chaosheng Wu was crossing Hylan Blvd. at Benton Ave. when the driver of a 2008 Ford Edge struck him about 9:25 a.m. on Friday, cops said.</a> He died at the hospital. The driver stayed. No charges. The street stayed the same.</p><p>At an Amazon warehouse, a box truck reversed. <a href=https://www.amny.com/police-fire/staten-island-amazon-warehouse-collision-04092025/>A 40-year-old man, while operating a box truck, backed the vehicle up at the location but wound up striking a pedestrian, later identified as 34-year-old Leony Salcedo-Chevalier of Perth Amboy, NJ.</a> The worker died. The driver stayed. The case is under review. The loading dock is still busy.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-and-trucks-kill-policy-stalls>The Pattern: Cars and Trucks Kill, Policy Stalls</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do the killing.</strong> In this district, cars and SUVs took six lives, trucks and buses four. Bikes killed none. The pattern is clear. The danger is not hidden.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-bills-and-the-silence-between>Leadership: Votes, Bills, and the Silence Between</h3><p>Senator Andrew Lanza has not led the charge for safer streets. He voted <strong>no</strong> on a bill to require safer street design for all users—<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>Enables safe access to public roads for all users by utilizing complete street design principles (S 9718)</a>. He sponsored a bill to let drivers escape speed camera tickets on technicalities—<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S7085>Permits a violation captured by a speed camera to be dismissed&mldr;if any information&mldr;is omitted from such notice of liability (S 7085)</a>. He wants to repeal congestion pricing, a measure proven to cut traffic and save lives.</p><p>When the city moved to slow Hylan Boulevard, Lanza did not stand with the families who walk it. When speed cameras came up for renewal, he called them a &ldquo;cash register&rdquo; and not a life-saving tool.</p><h3 id=what-next-the-cost-of-waiting>What Next: The Cost of Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay means another risk, another family changed forever.</strong></p><p>Call Senator Lanza. Call your council member. Demand real action: safer street design, lower speed limits, and enforcement that protects people, not just drivers. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The injured man was not wearing a seatbelt, but the report does not cite this as a contributing factor to the crash itself. The focus remains on the excessive speed of the sedan, which led to the violent collision and serious injury.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The crash happened at Huguenot Ave. and Drumgoole Ave. West, Staten Island, after a precinct holiday party. Todaro admitted, "I had three or four drinks. My life is over." The impact triggered airbags and left her with a forehead gash. All three passengers, also officers, were placed on desk duty and may face charges for allowing Todaro to drive or being unfit for duty. The article notes this was one of three NYPD DWI arrests in four days, highlighting a pattern during holiday party season. The incident raises questions about internal discipline and the risks posed by impaired driving, even among law enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move slashes funding for the 2020-24 MTA capital plan, which was to be partly paid by congestion pricing. The report highlights that many companies losing contracts are in districts represented by lawmakers who either support the pause or have stayed silent. Senator Patricia Canzoneri-Fitzpatrick called congestion pricing 'simply another tax' and demanded repeal. Assemblyman Gary Pretlow praised the pause, saying it allows time to address 'communities' concerns.' Frank Russo, president of Ozone Park Lumber, warned, 'You can't just say, 'We're not going to buy supplies and equipment.'' Rachael Fauss of Reinvent Albany said, 'Congestion pricing is an economic booster.' The pause means less money for transit, fewer jobs, and more risk for vulnerable road users who rely on safe, reliable public transportation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
