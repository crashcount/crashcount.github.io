Seventeen left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 1,300 hurt in the last year alone (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>injury and fatality data</a>). Each number is a name, a family, a life cut short or broken. Just weeks ago, a 16-year-old on an e-scooter died on College Avenue. He crossed into the path of a Hyundai. The police said, <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>&ldquo;Ellis suffered head trauma as a result of the crash.&rdquo;</a> No arrests. No comfort. Only the sound of sirens and the hush that follows.</p><p>On Hylan Boulevard, an 80-year-old man tried to cross the street. He did not make it. The driver stayed. The man did not. Police said they were <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/driver-fatally-strikes-80-year-old-staten-island-man-a-block-from-his-home-police-say>&ldquo;still investigating how fast the woman was driving and what the traffic signals at the intersection were displaying at the time.&rdquo;</a> The questions linger. The loss remains.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists bear the brunt.</strong> Cars and trucks killed six, left hundreds more with injuries (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash data</a>). Trucks, SUVs, sedans—they do not discriminate. They crush, they maim, they kill. The old, the young, the ones just trying to get home. The roll call of the dead is steady. The pain is not shared equally.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-and-inaction>Leadership: Action and Inaction</h2><p>State Senator Andrew Lanza has voted for some safety bills. He supported new safety zones. But when it mattered most, he voted <strong>against reauthorizing speed cameras in school zones</strong>—a proven tool to slow drivers and save lives (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>voted against speed cameras</a>). He also voted <strong>against lowering speed limits near schools</strong> (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted against lower speed limits</a>). The record is clear. When the choice was children or convenience, he chose the latter. When the Senate debated speed cameras, Lanza called the program a <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/06/01/state-senate-overwhelmingly-supports-24-7-speed-cameras-for-the-city>&ldquo;cash register&rdquo;</a>.</p><h2 id=what-now>What Now?</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay, every vote against safety, is a choice. Call Senator Lanza. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras where children walk. Demand action before another family gets the call.</p><p><strong>The blood on the street is not an accident.

The DOT cites high injury and fatality rates, especially among cyclists, as the reason for action, referencing success from similar projects. Council Member Joe Borelli opposes the plan, saying, 'Thousands who use this road each day will be inconvenienced...all for the benefit of 251 aspiring Greg LeMonds who cycle this stretch on the weekends.' Borelli calls the plan unoriginal and unnecessary. DOT spokesman Vin Barone defends the proposal, pointing to injury data and safety gains.

The vote was 51 to 12. Cameras now catch speeders at night and on weekends. Most deaths happen off-hours. Expansion aims to cut deadly crashes citywide.</p><p class=mb3>On May 31, 2022, the State Senate approved a bill to extend and expand New York City's speed camera program. The measure passed 51-12 and now moves to the Assembly. The bill allows cameras to operate 24/7 in nearly 2,000 locations across 750 school zones until July 1, 2025. The matter summary states, 'The proposal to extend New York City's speed camera program for another three years and expand it to run every day and around the clock easily passed.' Senator Andrew Gounardes sponsored the bill, saying, 'We are going to see a marked reduction in traffic violence on our streets at a time when traffic deaths are at their highest in a decade.' Simcha Felder, Democrat from District 44, voted against. The expansion targets off-hours, which account for 59% of traffic deaths. Speeding dropped 72% and deaths fell 55% where cameras operated. The city pushed for this as fatalities rose under Mayor Adams. Some penalties for repeat speeders were removed during negotiations.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Andrew Gounardes, reauthorizes and expands New York City’s school-zone speed camera program to operate 24/7. The measure was debated in the Senate, with Sen. Robert Jackson and Gounardes defending it: 'Cars speeding in New York kill New Yorkers, injure New Yorkers.' Gounardes called the cameras 'life-saving.' Opponents, including Sen. Andrew Lanza, dismissed the program as a 'cash register.' Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives said, 'When New York City’s speed safety cameras turn off, speeding increases and crashes rise.' The bill awaits Assembly action before the legislative session ends.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
