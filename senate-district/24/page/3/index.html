Thirty-six suffered serious injuries.</strong> Four thousand more carry wounds that do not heal. In the last twelve months alone, five families buried loved ones. <strong>Children, elders, workers—no one is spared.</strong></p><p>A man crossing Hylan Boulevard never made it home. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/10/staten-island-pedestrian-struck-suv-driver-block-from-home-chaosheng-wu/>Chaosheng Wu was crossing Hylan Blvd. at Benton Ave. when the driver of a 2008 Ford Edge struck him about 9:25 a.m. on Friday, cops said.</a> He died at the hospital. The driver stayed. No charges. The street stayed the same.</p><p>At an Amazon warehouse, a box truck reversed. <a href=https://www.amny.com/police-fire/staten-island-amazon-warehouse-collision-04092025/>A 40-year-old man, while operating a box truck, backed the vehicle up at the location but wound up striking a pedestrian, later identified as 34-year-old Leony Salcedo-Chevalier of Perth Amboy, NJ.</a> The worker died. The driver stayed. The case is under review. The loading dock is still busy.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-and-trucks-kill-policy-stalls>The Pattern: Cars and Trucks Kill, Policy Stalls</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do the killing.</strong> In this district, cars and SUVs took six lives, trucks and buses four. Bikes killed none. The pattern is clear. The danger is not hidden.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-bills-and-the-silence-between>Leadership: Votes, Bills, and the Silence Between</h3><p>Senator Andrew Lanza has not led the charge for safer streets. He voted <strong>no</strong> on a bill to require safer street design for all users—<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>Enables safe access to public roads for all users by utilizing complete street design principles (S 9718)</a>. He sponsored a bill to let drivers escape speed camera tickets on technicalities—<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S7085>Permits a violation captured by a speed camera to be dismissed&mldr;if any information&mldr;is omitted from such notice of liability (S 7085)</a>. He wants to repeal congestion pricing, a measure proven to cut traffic and save lives.</p><p>When the city moved to slow Hylan Boulevard, Lanza did not stand with the families who walk it. When speed cameras came up for renewal, he called them a &ldquo;cash register&rdquo; and not a life-saving tool.</p><h3 id=what-next-the-cost-of-waiting>What Next: The Cost of Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay means another risk, another family changed forever.</strong></p><p>Call Senator Lanza. Call your council member. Demand real action: safer street design, lower speed limits, and enforcement that protects people, not just drivers. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The measure passed 51-12 and now moves to the Assembly. The bill allows cameras to operate 24/7 in nearly 2,000 locations across 750 school zones until July 1, 2025. The matter summary states, 'The proposal to extend New York City's speed camera program for another three years and expand it to run every day and around the clock easily passed.' Senator Andrew Gounardes sponsored the bill, saying, 'We are going to see a marked reduction in traffic violence on our streets at a time when traffic deaths are at their highest in a decade.' Simcha Felder, Democrat from District 44, voted against. The expansion targets off-hours, which account for 59% of traffic deaths. Speeding dropped 72% and deaths fell 55% where cameras operated. The city pushed for this as fatalities rose under Mayor Adams. Some penalties for repeat speeders were removed during negotiations.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
