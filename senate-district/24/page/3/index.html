Seventeen left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 1,300 hurt in the last year alone (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>injury and fatality data</a>). Each number is a name, a family, a life cut short or broken. Just weeks ago, a 16-year-old on an e-scooter died on College Avenue. He crossed into the path of a Hyundai. The police said, <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>&ldquo;Ellis suffered head trauma as a result of the crash.&rdquo;</a> No arrests. No comfort. Only the sound of sirens and the hush that follows.</p><p>On Hylan Boulevard, an 80-year-old man tried to cross the street. He did not make it. The driver stayed. The man did not. Police said they were <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/driver-fatally-strikes-80-year-old-staten-island-man-a-block-from-his-home-police-say>&ldquo;still investigating how fast the woman was driving and what the traffic signals at the intersection were displaying at the time.&rdquo;</a> The questions linger. The loss remains.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists bear the brunt.</strong> Cars and trucks killed six, left hundreds more with injuries (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash data</a>). Trucks, SUVs, sedans—they do not discriminate. They crush, they maim, they kill. The old, the young, the ones just trying to get home. The roll call of the dead is steady. The pain is not shared equally.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-and-inaction>Leadership: Action and Inaction</h2><p>State Senator Andrew Lanza has voted for some safety bills. He supported new safety zones. But when it mattered most, he voted <strong>against reauthorizing speed cameras in school zones</strong>—a proven tool to slow drivers and save lives (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>voted against speed cameras</a>). He also voted <strong>against lowering speed limits near schools</strong> (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted against lower speed limits</a>). The record is clear. When the choice was children or convenience, he chose the latter. When the Senate debated speed cameras, Lanza called the program a <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/06/01/state-senate-overwhelmingly-supports-24-7-speed-cameras-for-the-city>&ldquo;cash register&rdquo;</a>.</p><h2 id=what-now>What Now?</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay, every vote against safety, is a choice. Call Senator Lanza. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras where children walk. Demand action before another family gets the call.</p><p><strong>The blood on the street is not an accident.

The study, led by HDR, will look at expanding the bridge’s narrow lanes to meet federal standards and possibly adding more lanes. The matter summary states the goal is to 'relieve congestion and improve traffic flow.' State Senator Andrew Lanza pushed for the study, calling the bridge 'very narrow therefore very dangerous.' Port Authority Executive Director Rick Cotton acknowledged induced demand and said the study will consider all options, including a shared-use path for cyclists and pedestrians. Former Traffic Commissioner Sam Schwartz opposed widening, urging investment in public transit instead. The study’s outcome could shape the future safety of vulnerable road users crossing between Staten Island and New Jersey.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
