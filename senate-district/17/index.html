Nearly 3,000 injured.</strong> In just the last twelve months, three more deaths, almost a thousand hurt. The dead are not numbers. They are elders, children, workers, neighbors. A 95-year-old woman, Mayya Gil, was crossing Cropsey Avenue with her home health aide. A van turned left. Gil never made it home. Her daughter said, <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/woman-who-survived-nazis-chernobyl-covid-killed-while-crossing-brooklyn-street-police-say>&ldquo;She was a very active lady.&rdquo;</a> The police did not charge the driver.</p><p>On June 22, a man named Pascual Tziquin was crossing New Utrecht Avenue. A red Dodge Charger hit him and kept going. His son watched. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/06/hit-and-run-driver-kills-brooklyn-restaurant-worker-in-front-of-son/>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t stop. He just kept going.&rdquo;</a> Eight days later, Tziquin died in the hospital. The street stayed the same.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> SUVs and cars did most of the killing—six deaths, 659 injuries. Trucks and buses killed two, bikes killed one. The old and the young are not spared. In the last year, one person over 65 died, another over 75. Children under 18 were hurt 103 times.</p><p>A van carrying adults with special needs crashed into a tree in Bath Beach. Fourteen people hurt. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/transport-van-crashes-tree-bath-beach-brooklyn-injuring-14-people/16903098/>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sad because they definitely need a lot of attention more than anyone else. I hope that they&rsquo;re all OK at the end of the day,&rdquo;</a> said a neighbor. The cause is still under investigation.</p><p>State Senator Steve Chan voted yes on bills to curb repeat speeders and expand speed cameras. He voted no on complete streets and safer school zones. He backed <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/13/senate-requires-delivery-apps-to-provide-insurance-for-workers>insurance for delivery workers</a>, but not the laws that would slow cars or <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/10/18/vision-zero-cities-how-to-fix-our-most-dangerous-roads/>redesign streets</a>. He has not led the fight for a 20 mph citywide speed limit or for redesigning the roads that kill.</p><p><strong>The crisis is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every delay, every watered-down law, every silent leader means another family waits for a loved one who will never come home.</p><p><strong>Demand more.</strong> Call Senator Chan. Tell him to fight for lower speed limits, for real street redesign, for laws that protect people, not just drivers. Join <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice. Make them choose life.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Lawmakers tout support for the injured. But insurance comes after the hit. Speeders keep driving. Danger stays on the street. Prevention takes a back seat.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13, 2025, the New York State Senate passed a bill requiring food delivery apps to provide insurance for delivery workers, pedestrians, and cyclists. The bill, sponsored by Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger, mandates up to $50,000 per person for basic economic loss, regardless of citizenship or employment status. Assembly Member Robert Carroll authored the original Assembly version, stating, 'It is time we require delivery apps to take responsibility for keeping delivery workers and pedestrians safe.' Sen. Andrew Gounardes defended a related speed-limiting bill, but it was weakened. Safety analysts warn: 'Focusing on insurance rather than speed limits shifts responsibility away from prevention and system design, failing to reduce crash risk and potentially discouraging mode shift by not addressing the root causes of danger for pedestrians and cyclists.' Lawmakers back insurance, but leave the streets risky.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
