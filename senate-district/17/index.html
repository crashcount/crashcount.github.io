Same ending.</p><ul><li>On 7th Avenue at 44th Street, a sedan turned left and hit a 70‑year‑old woman who had the signal. She died. Police cited failure to yield. That was January 13, 2025 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>On Cropsey and 24th, a 95‑year‑old woman and her aide were struck by a turning cargo van. She died. Police later charged a man with failure to yield and failure to exercise due care, after her death made headlines (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/brooklyn-man-arrested-in-fatal-crash-with-pedestrian-95-who-survived-nazis-chernobyl>Gothamist</a>).</li><li>On 60th at 4th Avenue, a box truck going straight hit a 30‑year‑old man. He died in the street (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>On 86th Street at 18th Avenue, a 76‑year‑old woman was killed at the intersection. The record lists a traffic control disregarded (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li></ul><p>Four deaths in this Senate district in the last 12 months. Most of the injured are not young. The toll keeps climbing: <strong>1,857 crashes, 1,190 injuries, 4 deaths</strong> in the last year alone across SD 17 (<a href=#>PeriodStats</a>).</p><p>The names fade. The corners don’t.</p><p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t stop. He just kept going,&rdquo; said a son after a hit‑and‑run killed his father on New Utrecht Avenue this June (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/06/hit-and-run-driver-kills-brooklyn-restaurant-worker-in-front-of-son/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>Left turns.

This district’s pedestrian injuries stack up behind them: SUVs lead, then sedans, then trucks. Bikes injure too, but the body count comes from larger vehicles (<a href=#>PeriodStats</a>).</p><p>Seniors carry the grief. Two deaths for residents 75+, another for 65–74, in the past year here. Older bodies do not survive impacts. The figures do not lie (<a href=#>PeriodStats</a>).</p><p>—</p><p>We already know what works — do we use it?</p><p>Albany moved one bill. The Senate voted on the Stop Super Speeders Act, which forces habitual violators to install speed limiters. It passed committee votes in June (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). The idea is simple: cap the speed, cut the risk.</p><p>City Hall has another tool. The city can lower speeds. A default <strong>20 mph</strong> makes crashes more survivable. Advocates say do it now. The path is laid out in our own call to action (<a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>).</p><p>Insurance for delivery workers advanced. Helpful after the crash. It does not slow the car before it hits you (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/13/senate-requires-delivery-apps-to-provide-insurance-for-workers>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>—</p><p>Three corners. One fix.</p><ul><li>44th Street at 7th Avenue: left‑turn protection and slow turns. A woman with the signal died there (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>Cropsey at 24th Avenue: turn‑calming and tighter corners. A 95‑year‑old died after a turning van hit her (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/brooklyn-man-arrested-in-fatal-crash-with-pedestrian-95-who-survived-nazis-chernobyl>Gothamist</a>).</li><li>60th at 4th Avenue: truck traffic and speed. A man died there under a box truck’s path (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li></ul><p>Slow them. Save them. The rest is noise.</p><p>—</p><p>What must change, right now</p><ul><li>Lower the city’s default speed limit to <strong>20 mph</strong>. Fewer sirens. Fewer funerals (<a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>).</li><li>Pass state law to put <strong>intelligent speed assistance</strong> on cars of the worst repeat offenders. The Senate has the bill on the table (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>).</li></ul><p>One call can help move both.

Lawmakers tout support for the injured. But insurance comes after the hit. Speeders keep driving. Danger stays on the street. Prevention takes a back seat.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13, 2025, the New York State Senate passed a bill requiring food delivery apps to provide insurance for delivery workers, pedestrians, and cyclists. The bill, sponsored by Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger, mandates up to $50,000 per person for basic economic loss, regardless of citizenship or employment status. Assembly Member Robert Carroll authored the original Assembly version, stating, 'It is time we require delivery apps to take responsibility for keeping delivery workers and pedestrians safe.' Sen. Andrew Gounardes defended a related speed-limiting bill, but it was weakened. Safety analysts warn: 'Focusing on insurance rather than speed limits shifts responsibility away from prevention and system design, failing to reduce crash risk and potentially discouraging mode shift by not addressing the root causes of danger for pedestrians and cyclists.' Lawmakers back insurance, but leave the streets risky.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
