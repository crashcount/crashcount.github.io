Since 2022, <strong>20 people have died</strong> and <strong>over 3,100 have been injured</strong> in traffic crashes. The numbers do not flinch. <strong>SUVs and cars alone have killed 6, injuring nearly 700</strong>. Trucks, motorcycles, bikes—they all leave their mark. The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross the street. No one is spared.</p><p>Just this January, a <strong>95-year-old woman was struck and killed</strong> while crossing Cropsey Avenue with her home health aide. The van hit them turning left. She died at the hospital. Her aide survived. &ldquo;Everybody knows her,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/woman-who-survived-nazis-chernobyl-covid-killed-while-crossing-brooklyn-street-police-say>said her daughter</a>. &ldquo;She was a very active lady.&rdquo; No arrest. No charges. The street swallows another life. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/woman-who-survived-nazis-chernobyl-covid-killed-while-crossing-brooklyn-street-police-say>Gothamist reported</a>.</p><p>Last month, a hit-and-run driver killed a man in front of his son. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t stop. He just kept going,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/06/hit-and-run-driver-kills-brooklyn-restaurant-worker-in-front-of-son/>said Henry Tziquin</a>. The horror is routine. The grief is not.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-and-silence>Leadership: Votes and Silence</h3><p><strong>State Senator Steve Chan</strong> has voted for and against safety. He backed the <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act</strong>, which would force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed-limiting devices. He voted to expand school speed cameras. But he also voted <strong>against the complete streets bill</strong>—a measure that would have made roads safer for everyone. He voted <strong>no on safer school speed zones</strong>. He voted <strong>yes to weaken bus lane rules</strong>, making streets riskier for those on foot and bike. The record is mixed. The danger is not.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-that-dont-lie>The Numbers That Don’t Lie</h3><p>In the last year, crashes in SD 17 rose by <strong>19%</strong>. Injuries jumped <strong>43%</strong>. Serious injuries doubled. Children, elders, workers—all at risk. The street does not care who you are. It only cares how fast you move and how hard you fall.</p><h3 id=what-now-demand-more>What Now? Demand More</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Senator Chan. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real street redesigns. Demand action that puts people before cars. <strong>Every day of delay is another family broken.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Prevention takes a back seat.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13, 2025, the New York State Senate passed a bill requiring food delivery apps to provide insurance for delivery workers, pedestrians, and cyclists. The bill, sponsored by Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger, mandates up to $50,000 per person for basic economic loss, regardless of citizenship or employment status. Assembly Member Robert Carroll authored the original Assembly version, stating, 'It is time we require delivery apps to take responsibility for keeping delivery workers and pedestrians safe.' Sen. Andrew Gounardes defended a related speed-limiting bill, but it was weakened. Safety analysts warn: 'Focusing on insurance rather than speed limits shifts responsibility away from prevention and system design, failing to reduce crash risk and potentially discouraging mode shift by not addressing the root causes of danger for pedestrians and cyclists.' Lawmakers back insurance, but leave the streets risky.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A man driving a cargo van made a left turn and struck Gil and her home health aide. The aide survived; Gil did not. Police made no arrests or charges. The article notes, 'She was a very active lady.' Gil was the second elderly pedestrian killed in Brooklyn that month. Transportation Alternatives highlighted that 46 senior pedestrians died in city crashes last year. The crash underscores the ongoing risk to older New Yorkers at crosswalks and the lack of driver accountability in such incidents.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
