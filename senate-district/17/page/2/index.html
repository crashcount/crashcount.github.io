The report states the motorcyclist suffered severe bleeding from his hip and leg but remained conscious at the scene. The narrative describes, 'Blood poured from his hip and leg. He stayed awake. The engine cooled. The street held its breath.' The point of impact and vehicle damage were both recorded as the car’s left side doors. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified' and does not cite any specific driver errors. The motorcyclist was not wearing a helmet, as noted in the report, but no victim behavior is listed as a contributing factor.
