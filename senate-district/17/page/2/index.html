They are elders, children, workers. In January, a 95-year-old woman, Mayya Gil, was crossing Cropsey Avenue with her home health aide. A van turned left. Gil died. The aide survived. Her daughter <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/woman-who-survived-nazis-chernobyl-covid-killed-while-crossing-brooklyn-street-police-say>described her as &ldquo;a very active lady.&rdquo;</a></p><p>Just days later, another crash. A transport van in Bath Beach swerved and slammed into a tree. Fourteen people hurt, most with special needs. A bystander <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/transport-van-crashes-tree-bath-beach-brooklyn-injuring-14-people/16903098/>said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sad because they definitely need a lot of attention more than anyone else.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>In the last twelve months, SD 17 has seen 1,450 crashes, 3 deaths, and 7 serious injuries.</strong></p><h3 id=the-vehicles-that-kill>The Vehicles That Kill</h3><p>SUVs and cars do most of the damage. In three years, they killed six and injured hundreds more. Trucks and buses killed two. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes killed two more. The pattern is clear. The streets are not safe for the old, the young, or anyone on foot.</p><h3 id=what-has-senator-steve-chan-done>What Has Senator Steve Chan Done?</h3><p>Senator Chan has spoken up for some reforms. He supported calls to fix deadly arterial roads and back urban street design standards. But when the Senate <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/13/senate-requires-delivery-apps-to-provide-insurance-for-workers>passed a bill to require delivery apps to provide insurance for workers and pedestrians</a>, Chan supported it. Insurance pays after the crash. It does not stop the crash. Safety analysts warn: <strong>&ldquo;Focusing on insurance rather than speed limits shifts responsibility away from prevention and system design, failing to reduce crash risk and potentially discouraging mode shift by not addressing the root causes of danger for pedestrians and cyclists.&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/13/senate-requires-delivery-apps-to-provide-insurance-for-workers>Streetsblog NYC</a>)</p><p><strong>The silence is louder than the action.</strong> No bill to slow cars. No push for street redesign. No demand for real accountability for repeat offenders.</p><h3 id=the-call-demand-action-not-excuses>The Call: Demand Action, Not Excuses</h3><p><strong>Contact Senator Chan. Demand he fight for lower speed limits, street redesign, and enforcement against repeat offenders.</strong> Insurance is not enough. The next crash is coming.

They are wide, fast, and deadly for walkers and cyclists. Most are state-owned. Cities and advocates demand lower speeds, urban design, and local control. Changing these streets is urgent. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>This policy advocacy statement, published October 18, 2022, by Streetsblog NYC, highlights the urgent need to fix deadly arterial roads. The statement, titled 'Vision Zero Cities: How to Fix Our Most Dangerous Roads,' calls for context-sensitive speed limits, urban street design standards, and transferring state-owned roads to city control. Streetsblog and Transportation Alternatives urge, 'Cities and advocates should push their states to transform arterial streets into safe spaces for all modes.' The statement notes that arterials make up 15 percent of roads but see 67 percent of pedestrian deaths. It stresses that speed is the main factor in fatal crashes and that state DOTs often prioritize fast driving over safety. The call is clear: redesign streets for people, not cars, and give cities the power to act.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, 'A taxi and a sedan met head-on in the dark. A woman in the back, belted and crushed. Her neck throbbed. The taxi driver had no license. Alcohol hung in the air.' The crash left a 57-year-old female rear passenger injured with neck and crush injuries. The taxi driver was unlicensed. The police report lists 'Alcohol Involvement' as a contributing factor. These driver errors—alcohol use and operating without a license—created the conditions for harm. The woman wore a seatbelt, but the system and the drivers failed to protect her.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
