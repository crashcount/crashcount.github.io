Same ending.</p><ul><li>On 7th Avenue at 44th Street, a sedan turned left and hit a 70‑year‑old woman who had the signal. She died. Police cited failure to yield. That was January 13, 2025 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>On Cropsey and 24th, a 95‑year‑old woman and her aide were struck by a turning cargo van. She died. Police later charged a man with failure to yield and failure to exercise due care, after her death made headlines (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/brooklyn-man-arrested-in-fatal-crash-with-pedestrian-95-who-survived-nazis-chernobyl>Gothamist</a>).</li><li>On 60th at 4th Avenue, a box truck going straight hit a 30‑year‑old man. He died in the street (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>On 86th Street at 18th Avenue, a 76‑year‑old woman was killed at the intersection. The record lists a traffic control disregarded (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li></ul><p>Four deaths in this Senate district in the last 12 months. Most of the injured are not young. The toll keeps climbing: <strong>1,857 crashes, 1,190 injuries, 4 deaths</strong> in the last year alone across SD 17 (<a href=#>PeriodStats</a>).</p><p>The names fade. The corners don’t.</p><p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t stop. He just kept going,&rdquo; said a son after a hit‑and‑run killed his father on New Utrecht Avenue this June (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/06/hit-and-run-driver-kills-brooklyn-restaurant-worker-in-front-of-son/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>Left turns.

She never got up (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>Mayya Gil, 95, crossed near her home on Cropsey.

This district’s pedestrian injuries stack up behind them: SUVs lead, then sedans, then trucks. Bikes injure too, but the body count comes from larger vehicles (<a href=#>PeriodStats</a>).</p><p>Seniors carry the grief. Two deaths for residents 75+, another for 65–74, in the past year here. Older bodies do not survive impacts. The figures do not lie (<a href=#>PeriodStats</a>).</p><p>—</p><p>We already know what works — do we use it?</p><p>Albany moved one bill. The Senate voted on the Stop Super Speeders Act, which forces habitual violators to install speed limiters. It passed committee votes in June (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). The idea is simple: cap the speed, cut the risk.</p><p>City Hall has another tool. The city can lower speeds. A default <strong>20 mph</strong> makes crashes more survivable. Advocates say do it now. The path is laid out in our own call to action (<a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>).</p><p>Insurance for delivery workers advanced. Helpful after the crash. It does not slow the car before it hits you (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/13/senate-requires-delivery-apps-to-provide-insurance-for-workers>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>—</p><p>Three corners. One fix.</p><ul><li>44th Street at 7th Avenue: left‑turn protection and slow turns. A woman with the signal died there (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>Cropsey at 24th Avenue: turn‑calming and tighter corners.

The rest is noise.</p><p>—</p><p>What must change, right now</p><ul><li>Lower the city’s default speed limit to <strong>20 mph</strong>. Fewer sirens. Fewer funerals (<a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>).</li><li>Pass state law to put <strong>intelligent speed assistance</strong> on cars of the worst repeat offenders. The Senate has the bill on the table (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>).</li></ul><p>One call can help move both.
