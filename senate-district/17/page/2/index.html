Since 2022, <strong>20 people have died</strong> and <strong>over 3,100 have been injured</strong> in traffic crashes. The numbers do not flinch. <strong>SUVs and cars alone have killed 6, injuring nearly 700</strong>. Trucks, motorcycles, bikes—they all leave their mark. The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross the street. No one is spared.</p><p>Just this January, a <strong>95-year-old woman was struck and killed</strong> while crossing Cropsey Avenue with her home health aide. The van hit them turning left. She died at the hospital. Her aide survived. &ldquo;Everybody knows her,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/woman-who-survived-nazis-chernobyl-covid-killed-while-crossing-brooklyn-street-police-say>said her daughter</a>. &ldquo;She was a very active lady.&rdquo; No arrest. No charges. The street swallows another life. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/woman-who-survived-nazis-chernobyl-covid-killed-while-crossing-brooklyn-street-police-say>Gothamist reported</a>.</p><p>Last month, a hit-and-run driver killed a man in front of his son. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t stop. He just kept going,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/06/hit-and-run-driver-kills-brooklyn-restaurant-worker-in-front-of-son/>said Henry Tziquin</a>. The horror is routine. The grief is not.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-and-silence>Leadership: Votes and Silence</h3><p><strong>State Senator Steve Chan</strong> has voted for and against safety. He backed the <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act</strong>, which would force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed-limiting devices. He voted to expand school speed cameras. But he also voted <strong>against the complete streets bill</strong>—a measure that would have made roads safer for everyone. He voted <strong>no on safer school speed zones</strong>. He voted <strong>yes to weaken bus lane rules</strong>, making streets riskier for those on foot and bike. The record is mixed. The danger is not.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-that-dont-lie>The Numbers That Don’t Lie</h3><p>In the last year, crashes in SD 17 rose by <strong>19%</strong>. Injuries jumped <strong>43%</strong>. Serious injuries doubled. Children, elders, workers—all at risk. The street does not care who you are. It only cares how fast you move and how hard you fall.</p><h3 id=what-now-demand-more>What Now? Demand More</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Senator Chan. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real street redesigns. Demand action that puts people before cars. <strong>Every day of delay is another family broken.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
