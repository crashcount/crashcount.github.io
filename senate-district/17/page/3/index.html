That was January 13, 2025 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>On Cropsey and 24th, a 95‑year‑old woman and her aide were struck by a turning cargo van. She died. Police later charged a man with failure to yield and failure to exercise due care, after her death made headlines (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/brooklyn-man-arrested-in-fatal-crash-with-pedestrian-95-who-survived-nazis-chernobyl>Gothamist</a>).</li><li>On 60th at 4th Avenue, a box truck going straight hit a 30‑year‑old man. He died in the street (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>On 86th Street at 18th Avenue, a 76‑year‑old woman was killed at the intersection. The record lists a traffic control disregarded (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li></ul><p>Four deaths in this Senate district in the last 12 months. Most of the injured are not young. The toll keeps climbing: <strong>1,857 crashes, 1,190 injuries, 4 deaths</strong> in the last year alone across SD 17 (<a href=#>PeriodStats</a>).</p><p>The names fade. The corners don’t.</p><p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t stop. He just kept going,&rdquo; said a son after a hit‑and‑run killed his father on New Utrecht Avenue this June (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/06/hit-and-run-driver-kills-brooklyn-restaurant-worker-in-front-of-son/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>Left turns.

This district’s pedestrian injuries stack up behind them: SUVs lead, then sedans, then trucks. Bikes injure too, but the body count comes from larger vehicles (<a href=#>PeriodStats</a>).</p><p>Seniors carry the grief. Two deaths for residents 75+, another for 65–74, in the past year here. Older bodies do not survive impacts. The figures do not lie (<a href=#>PeriodStats</a>).</p><p>—</p><p>We already know what works — do we use it?</p><p>Albany moved one bill.

It passed committee votes in June (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). The idea is simple: cap the speed, cut the risk.</p><p>City Hall has another tool. The city can lower speeds. A default <strong>20 mph</strong> makes crashes more survivable. Advocates say do it now. The path is laid out in our own call to action (<a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>).</p><p>Insurance for delivery workers advanced. Helpful after the crash. It does not slow the car before it hits you (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/13/senate-requires-delivery-apps-to-provide-insurance-for-workers>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>—</p><p>Three corners. One fix.</p><ul><li>44th Street at 7th Avenue: left‑turn protection and slow turns. A woman with the signal died there (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>Cropsey at 24th Avenue: turn‑calming and tighter corners.

They are wide, fast, and deadly for walkers and cyclists. Most are state-owned. Cities and advocates demand lower speeds, urban design, and local control. Changing these streets is urgent. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>This policy advocacy statement, published October 18, 2022, by Streetsblog NYC, highlights the urgent need to fix deadly arterial roads. The statement, titled 'Vision Zero Cities: How to Fix Our Most Dangerous Roads,' calls for context-sensitive speed limits, urban street design standards, and transferring state-owned roads to city control. Streetsblog and Transportation Alternatives urge, 'Cities and advocates should push their states to transform arterial streets into safe spaces for all modes.' The statement notes that arterials make up 15 percent of roads but see 67 percent of pedestrian deaths. It stresses that speed is the main factor in fatal crashes and that state DOTs often prioritize fast driving over safety. The call is clear: redesign streets for people, not cars, and give cities the power to act.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
