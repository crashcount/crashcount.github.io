They are elders, children, workers. In January, a 95-year-old woman, Mayya Gil, was crossing Cropsey Avenue with her home health aide. A van turned left. Gil died. The aide survived. Her daughter <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/woman-who-survived-nazis-chernobyl-covid-killed-while-crossing-brooklyn-street-police-say>described her as &ldquo;a very active lady.&rdquo;</a></p><p>Just days later, another crash.

A bystander <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/transport-van-crashes-tree-bath-beach-brooklyn-injuring-14-people/16903098/>said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sad because they definitely need a lot of attention more than anyone else.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>In the last twelve months, SD 17 has seen 1,450 crashes, 3 deaths, and 7 serious injuries.</strong></p><h3 id=the-vehicles-that-kill>The Vehicles That Kill</h3><p>SUVs and cars do most of the damage. In three years, they killed six and injured hundreds more. Trucks and buses killed two. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes killed two more. The pattern is clear. The streets are not safe for the old, the young, or anyone on foot.</p><h3 id=what-has-senator-steve-chan-done>What Has Senator Steve Chan Done?</h3><p>Senator Chan has spoken up for some reforms. He supported calls to fix deadly arterial roads and back urban street design standards. But when the Senate <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/13/senate-requires-delivery-apps-to-provide-insurance-for-workers>passed a bill to require delivery apps to provide insurance for workers and pedestrians</a>, Chan supported it. Insurance pays after the crash. It does not stop the crash. Safety analysts warn: <strong>&ldquo;Focusing on insurance rather than speed limits shifts responsibility away from prevention and system design, failing to reduce crash risk and potentially discouraging mode shift by not addressing the root causes of danger for pedestrians and cyclists.&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/13/senate-requires-delivery-apps-to-provide-insurance-for-workers>Streetsblog NYC</a>)</p><p><strong>The silence is louder than the action.</strong> No bill to slow cars. No push for street redesign. No demand for real accountability for repeat offenders.</p><h3 id=the-call-demand-action-not-excuses>The Call: Demand Action, Not Excuses</h3><p><strong>Contact Senator Chan. Demand he fight for lower speed limits, street redesign, and enforcement against repeat offenders.</strong> Insurance is not enough. The next crash is coming.
