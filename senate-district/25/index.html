A gray Ford hit him and kept going. He died at Brookdale Hospital. The driver vanished into the night. Police said it was the second hit-and-run in the city in 24 hours. Fifty-five pedestrians have been killed crossing city streets this year. That is eight fewer than last year, but the number is still a wound that will not close. As the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/04/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-man-36-in-brooklyn-crash/>Daily News reported</a>, &ldquo;A hit-and-run driver struck and killed a 36-year-old man crossing a Brooklyn street, officials said Friday.&rdquo;</p><p>On the same day, a 55-year-old motorcyclist died on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. He lost control and was thrown from his bike. The road was closed for hours. According to <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/03/motorcyclist-dies-after-losing-control-in-crash-on-brooklyn-queens-expressway/>police</a>, &ldquo;The victim was zipping west on the expressway on a Kawasaki KLR650 when he lost control near Emerson Place in Clinton Hill just before 2 a.m.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=the-numbers-behind-the-names>The Numbers Behind the Names</h3><p>In the last twelve months, 12 people have died and 24 have been seriously injured in SD 25. There have been 2,677 crashes and 1,587 injuries. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, parents. Cars and SUVs did most of the killing—10 deaths and 14 serious injuries. Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds, three serious injuries. Bikes, one serious injury. The violence is steady. It does not care about the weather or the hour.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>State Senator Jabari Brisport has voted for and co-sponsored bills to curb repeat speeders, expand speed cameras, and require driver education on pedestrian and cyclist safety. He voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force the worst repeat offenders to install speed-limiting devices. He co-sponsored bills for bike lane camera enforcement and more complete street designs. But the blood keeps running. The laws are not enough. The city still waits for a 20 mph speed limit. Bike lanes are still ripped out for politics. The most vulnerable are still left to fend for themselves.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-now>Call to Action: Demand More, Now</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Call Senator Brisport. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for every person on foot or bike. Do not wait for another body in the street. The time to act is now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The city acted after complaints from local leaders. The lane sits on a 'Vision Zero Priority Corridor,' one of Brooklyn’s most dangerous streets.

The redesign replaces two car lanes with 24/7 bus-only lanes and adds pedestrian islands. DOT officials said, 'almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles.' Since 2019, 55 people have been killed or severely injured in crashes along this stretch. The plan removes curbside parking and bans cars from bus lanes, aiming to speed up twelve bus routes and protect people on foot. Most residents in the area do not own cars and depend on slow buses. The proposal reflects a shift toward prioritizing vulnerable road users and addressing systemic danger on one of Brooklyn's busiest corridors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
