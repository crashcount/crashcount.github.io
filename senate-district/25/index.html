Fifty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 5,200 hurt since 2022. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors. A 32-year-old woman crushed by an SUV on Van Buren Street in May. A 55-year-old woman struck by another SUV on Washington Avenue days later. The street does not care if you are young or old. It takes what it wants.</p><p><strong>SUVs and cars are the main killers.</strong> They caused seven deaths and over 250 serious or moderate injuries to pedestrians and cyclists in this district alone. Trucks and buses killed at least one. Bikes and mopeds hurt, but they do not kill like steel and speed do. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=the-politics-of-safety>The Politics of Safety</h3><p>The city talks about safety. Sometimes it acts. Sometimes it does not. On Bedford Avenue, the city ripped out a protected bike lane after complaints and a crash involving a child and a cyclist. The mayor called it a response to &ldquo;community concerns.&rdquo; Council Member Lincoln Restler called it what it was: <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/bedford-avenue-protected-bike-lane-removal/>&ldquo;This is just pure politics. That is not how safety decisions on our streets should be made.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>The cost of delay is paid in blood.</strong> The city’s own data showed this stretch had the second largest number of pedestrian deaths before the lane went in. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/13/breaking-mayor-adams-to-remove-bedford-avenue-protected-bike-lane-citing-bizarrely-safety>&ldquo;Before this bike lane from 2018 to 2022 this is the area that had the second largest numbers of pedestrian fatalities and crashes in the city,&rdquo; said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez.</a></p><h3 id=what-has-brisport-done>What Has Brisport Done?</h3><p>Senator Jabari Brisport has not been silent. He voted yes on a bill to force safer street design for all users, not just drivers. He co-sponsored a bill to use cameras to keep bike lanes clear of cars. He stood with advocates <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/bk-protest-congestion-pricing-hochul/>demanding congestion pricing to fund transit and cut traffic</a>. These are steps. But the bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=what-next-demand-more>What Next? Demand More</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day the city delays, another family is broken. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call Senator Brisport. Tell them: <strong>protect the vulnerable, not the parking. Build streets for people, not for cars.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Officials responded to concerns by painting pedestrian islands and loading zones but did not install physical barriers or bus boarding islands. Cyclists described the decision as political, with one saying, "There’s a very important voting bloc that’s using their leverage over the mayor to remove the bike lane."

The move follows complaints from local residents, especially after a viral video showed a child running into the lane from a double-parked car and colliding with an e-bike. Adams stated, 'we listened to community concerns and decided to adjust the current design to better reflect community feedback.' The Department of Transportation will revert the protected lane to its previous unprotected state between Willoughby and Flushing avenues. The article highlights ongoing political battles over street design and notes that double-parking and chaotic traffic remain unaddressed.

The redesign replaces two car lanes with 24/7 bus-only lanes and adds pedestrian islands. DOT officials said, 'almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles.' Since 2019, 55 people have been killed or severely injured in crashes along this stretch. The plan removes curbside parking and bans cars from bus lanes, aiming to speed up twelve bus routes and protect people on foot. Most residents in the area do not own cars and depend on slow buses. The proposal reflects a shift toward prioritizing vulnerable road users and addressing systemic danger on one of Brooklyn's busiest corridors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
