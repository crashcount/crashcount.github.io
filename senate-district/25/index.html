A car hit him. The driver did not stop. The man died at Brookdale Hospital. He was 36. His name is not in the record. The driver is still gone. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brownsville-crash-police-searching-driver-deadly-hit-run-collision-brooklyn-nyc/16949967/>Police are still looking</a>.</p><p>A few hours earlier, a 55-year-old man rode his motorcycle west on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. He lost control near Emerson Place, hit the median, and died on the road. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/03/motorcyclist-dies-after-losing-control-in-crash-on-brooklyn-queens-expressway/>Police said he was &ldquo;zipping west&rdquo;</a>.</p><p>On May 24, a woman was killed by an SUV on Van Buren Street. On May 17, another woman was killed by an SUV on Washington Avenue. In the last twelve months, SD 25 has seen <strong>12 deaths</strong> and <strong>24 serious injuries</strong>. There have been <strong>1,587 injuries</strong> in <strong>2,677 crashes</strong>. The numbers do not stop. They only rise.</p><h2 id=the-system-fails-the-vulnerable>The System Fails the Vulnerable</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> In this district, they caused <strong>10 deaths</strong> and over <strong>850 injuries</strong> to pedestrians. Trucks and buses killed at least one. Motorcycles and mopeds injured dozens more. No helmet, no crosswalk, no light can stop a speeding car. The street does not forgive.</p><p>Drivers flee. Families wait for answers. &ldquo;The driver of the Ford sped off, never stopping, cops said. He remained at large on Saturday.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/04/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-man-36-in-brooklyn-crash/>NY Daily News</a>.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn&rsquo;t</h2><p>State Senator Jabari Brisport has voted for and co-sponsored bills to curb repeat speeders and expand school speed zones. He backed the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, which would force the worst drivers to install speed limiters. He voted yes to extend speed cameras near schools. He co-sponsored a bill for automated bike lane enforcement. These are steps. But the deaths keep coming.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;This is about the economic engine for the entire region,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-transit-advocates-mta-funding-capital-02022025/>said a colleague at a rally for transit funding</a>.

Hundreds maimed.</strong> This is not fate. This is policy. Call Senator Brisport. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand speed limiters for repeat offenders.

The city will shift the lane to the street's center, ending the barrier of parked cars. The move follows protests from local Orthodox Jewish communities and a recent e-bike crash. Advocates sued, arguing Adams bypassed environmental review. The judge ruled the change was not a major project.

Prosecutors say Pigford rear-ended Cifuni, then stopped two blocks away. When Cifuni approached, Pigford 'refused to roll down her window or speak,' then accelerated, striking and dragging Cifuni. The article quotes Assistant District Attorney Tara Kelly: 'The defendant floored the gas, instantly striking Tiffany, causing her body to become lodged beneath the vehicle.' Pigford then made an illegal turn and fled. The case highlights the lethal risk of hit-and-run driving and the dangers posed by unlicensed, reckless drivers operating stolen vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The court found the city may have acted "arbitrarily, capriciously, and illegally" by ordering the removal without proper legal notice. City law requires the Department of Transportation to notify local officials and allow time for public discussion, but, as the court papers state, "DOT did not provide the required notice." Plaintiffs argued that removing the lane would "irreparably" harm cyclists, especially children. The city claimed it would only shift the lane, not remove it, but advocates countered that any removal increases danger.

The bill, titled 'Relates to requiring the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices for repeated violation of maximum speed limits,' mandates these devices for drivers who rack up eleven or more points in 24 months, or six speed or red light camera tickets in a year. The measure aims to curb repeat dangerous driving. Senators including Jamaal Bailey, Jabari Brisport, and others voted yes. The bill targets drivers with a pattern of violations, seeking to cut risk for pedestrians and cyclists by limiting repeat speeding.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan includes boarding islands for safer passenger access and removes two car lanes. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, “Almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic, and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles.” The redesign aims to separate buses from car traffic, reduce conflicts, and improve safety for vulnerable road users. Parking will decrease, but the exact impact is unclear. The plan responds to chronic congestion and slow bus speeds, which often fall below five miles per hour during rush hour.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The redesign replaces two car lanes with 24/7 bus-only lanes and adds pedestrian islands. DOT officials said, 'almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles.' Since 2019, 55 people have been killed or severely injured in crashes along this stretch. The plan removes curbside parking and bans cars from bus lanes, aiming to speed up twelve bus routes and protect people on foot. Most residents in the area do not own cars and depend on slow buses. The proposal reflects a shift toward prioritizing vulnerable road users and addressing systemic danger on one of Brooklyn's busiest corridors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
