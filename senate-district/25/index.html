Twenty-two left with serious injuries. Over 1,400 hurt.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, there were 2,500 crashes. The dead include a pregnant woman, a 55-year-old pedestrian, a 26-year-old passenger, and a 27-year-old motorcyclist. They are not numbers. They are lives ended on the street.</p><p>On May 24, Tiffany Cifuni stepped out of her car in Bedford-Stuyvesant after a minor crash. She never made it home.

Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes added more injuries. The city talks about Vision Zero. The state passes laws. But the carnage does not stop.</p><p><strong>Jabari Brisport has taken steps.</strong> He voted yes on a bill to force safer street design for all users, not just drivers. He co-sponsored a bill to use cameras to keep bike lanes clear, so cyclists do not have to swerve into traffic. He backed another bill to require complete street design for any project using public money. These are not empty gestures. They are votes and signatures on the record. But the streets are still not safe.</p><h2 id=the-fight-over-infrastructure>The Fight Over Infrastructure</h2><p>The city removed a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue after crashes involving children. The mayor called it a response to community concerns. Council Member Lincoln Restler called it &ldquo;a purely political decision to rip out a bike lane with no alternative&rdquo; <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/adams-dot-remove-bedford-avenue-bike-lane/>in an interview</a>. The lawsuits came fast. The danger remains.</p><h2 id=what-now-demand-more>What Now? Demand More</h2><p><strong>The bodies keep coming. The promises keep coming.</strong> The only thing that stops a car is concrete, not talk. Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand protected bike lanes, lower speed limits, and enforcement that does not blame the dead. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong> <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The court found the city may have acted "arbitrarily, capriciously, and illegally" by ordering the removal without proper legal notice. City law requires the Department of Transportation to notify local officials and allow time for public discussion, but, as the court papers state, "DOT did not provide the required notice." Plaintiffs argued that removing the lane would "irreparably" harm cyclists, especially children. The city claimed it would only shift the lane, not remove it, but advocates countered that any removal increases danger. The case highlights the need for transparent processes and the risks when safety infrastructure is hastily altered.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city intends to revert to an older, unprotected design after complaints from local residents. Advocates argue the protected lane was installed due to 'years of danger and death,' and that removing it is 'unwarranted, unlawful, reckless.' The lawsuit claims the city failed to conduct required traffic or impact studies before making the change. City Hall says intersections will keep some safety features, but the main stretch will lose its protection. The article highlights persistent double-parking and high injury rates as key dangers. The legal battle underscores the tension between community concerns and proven safety measures for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move follows complaints from local residents, especially after a viral video showed a child running into the lane from a double-parked car and colliding with an e-bike. Adams stated, 'we listened to community concerns and decided to adjust the current design to better reflect community feedback.' The Department of Transportation will revert the protected lane to its previous unprotected state between Willoughby and Flushing avenues. The article highlights ongoing political battles over street design and notes that double-parking and chaotic traffic remain unaddressed. Deputy Mayor Randy Mastro cited 'lack of action' on e-bike safety as a barrier to safer infrastructure.

The redesign replaces two car lanes with 24/7 bus-only lanes and adds pedestrian islands. DOT officials said, 'almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles.' Since 2019, 55 people have been killed or severely injured in crashes along this stretch. The plan removes curbside parking and bans cars from bus lanes, aiming to speed up twelve bus routes and protect people on foot. Most residents in the area do not own cars and depend on slow buses. The proposal reflects a shift toward prioritizing vulnerable road users and addressing systemic danger on one of Brooklyn's busiest corridors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
