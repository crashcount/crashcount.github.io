The lane, installed in October, had reduced crashes, according to DOT data. Plaintiffs argued removal would increase danger and violated city rules on public notice. The city’s lawyers dismissed its own safety data, claiming it was unreliable. Alexa Sledge of Transportation Alternatives warned, “Mayor Adams is exposing the City of New York...to significant financial and legal liability.” Attorney Peter Beadle urged Adams to let DOT implement safer alternatives. The decision highlights how political pressure can override proven safety measures.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
