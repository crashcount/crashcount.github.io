Twenty-two left with serious injuries. Over 1,400 hurt.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, there were 2,500 crashes. The dead include a pregnant woman, a 55-year-old pedestrian, a 26-year-old passenger, and a 27-year-old motorcyclist. They are not numbers. They are lives ended on the street.</p><p>On May 24, Tiffany Cifuni stepped out of her car in Bedford-Stuyvesant after a minor crash. She never made it home.

Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes added more injuries. The city talks about Vision Zero. The state passes laws. But the carnage does not stop.</p><p><strong>Jabari Brisport has taken steps.</strong> He voted yes on a bill to force safer street design for all users, not just drivers. He co-sponsored a bill to use cameras to keep bike lanes clear, so cyclists do not have to swerve into traffic. He backed another bill to require complete street design for any project using public money. These are not empty gestures. They are votes and signatures on the record. But the streets are still not safe.</p><h2 id=the-fight-over-infrastructure>The Fight Over Infrastructure</h2><p>The city removed a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue after crashes involving children. The mayor called it a response to community concerns. Council Member Lincoln Restler called it &ldquo;a purely political decision to rip out a bike lane with no alternative&rdquo; <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/adams-dot-remove-bedford-avenue-bike-lane/>in an interview</a>. The lawsuits came fast. The danger remains.</p><h2 id=what-now-demand-more>What Now? Demand More</h2><p><strong>The bodies keep coming. The promises keep coming.</strong> The only thing that stops a car is concrete, not talk. Call your council member. Call your senator.

The rally targeted Governor Hochul’s $252 billion budget, which omits $33 billion needed for transit upgrades. The event, covered by amny.com, highlighted the matter: 'NYC transit advocates urge Hochul to fully fund MTA Capital Plan with guaranteed state budget revenue.' Hoylman-Sigal said, 'This is about the economic engine for the entire region.' Assembly Member Tony Simone and others demanded investment in transportation deserts and accessible stations. Advocates cited the MTA’s ADA settlement, noting only a quarter of stations are wheelchair-accessible, with the fewest in low-income areas. The rally underscored that without full funding, vulnerable riders—especially those with disabilities—face continued barriers and danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They protested Governor Kathy Hochul’s June 5 decision to suspend congestion pricing, a move that froze $16.5 billion in MTA upgrades, including elevators for Bed-Stuy’s busy station. The event, covered by brooklynpaper.com, highlighted the urgent need for accessibility: 'We want our elevators, we want our service, and we want it now,' said State Sen. Jabari Brisport. Assembly Member Phara Souffrant Forrest called the delay a denial of basic rights. Ossé called Hochul’s move 'an attack on our most vulnerable constituents.' Only a quarter of city stations are wheelchair-accessible. The hold traps thousands—seniors, parents, disabled riders—forcing them to risk dangerous streets or skip transit altogether.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The debate, reported by Gothamist, centers on whether a lower toll could unfreeze the program while still funding the MTA. Hoylman-Sigal said, "Nobody's wedded to $15. We are wedded to the improvements that congestion pricing will provide for mass transit or safety on our streets for cleaner air." Sen. Liz Krueger is open to a new fee if it raises $1 billion yearly. Sen. Jabari Brisport criticized the lack of study and feedback in the process, calling it "irresponsible." Any change needs legislative, MTA, and federal approval. Trump has promised to end congestion pricing if elected.

The 2019 law mandates the state and MTA 'shall' implement congestion pricing, not 'may.' U.S. Rep. Ritchie Torres said, 'When the will of the Executive competes with an Act of the Legislature, the law wins. Or should.' MTA board members, caught off guard, warned that without toll revenue, modernization projects—like electric buses and ADA stations—will be deprioritized. State Sen. Jabari Brisport and Riders Alliance noted a surge in public support for the program after Hochul’s decision. Hochul cited safety and community concerns, but advocates say her move robs New Yorkers of a vital tool to fund transit and cut traffic and pollution. The program’s future remains uncertain, with vulnerable road users facing continued risk from unchecked car traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
