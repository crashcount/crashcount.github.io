Over 5,100 injured.</strong> In the last year alone, the streets of Senate District 25 have not been quiet. The dead do not speak. The living carry scars. A 32-year-old pregnant woman was dragged and left dying on Van Buren Street. Her husband said, “I lost my whole family tonight and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever be the same” (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/husband-mourns-pregnant-wife-run-over-by-hit-run-driver-in-brooklyn-fender-bender-clash/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>SUVs, sedans, trucks—steel and speed. <strong>Most victims were on foot.</strong> In the past twelve months, SUVs alone killed five pedestrians and injured 85 more (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The numbers do not flinch. The pain is not abstract.</p><p>The toll grows. Now, 9,558 crashes. 5,180 injuries. Children, elders, workers. No one spared. Among the hurt: 447 children, 79 elders over 75. Fifteen young adults, ages 18 to 24, suffered serious wounds. The street does not choose.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Senator Jabari Brisport has not been silent. He voted yes on a bill to force safer street design for all users, not just drivers (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>Open States</a>). He co-sponsored bills to require complete street design and to bring automated enforcement to bike lanes (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S131>Open States</a>). He stood with advocates demanding elevators for Bed-Stuy’s subway, saying, “We want our elevators, we want our service, and we want it now” (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/hochul-congestion-pricing-accessibility-upgrades-bed-stuy/>brooklynpaper.com</a>).</p><p>But the blood on the street does not care about bills in committee. <strong>Every day without action is another day of risk.</strong> The laws are slow. The cars are fast.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is preventable. Every death is a failure to act. The city now has the power to lower speed limits. The state can reauthorize speed cameras and fund safer infrastructure. The tools are there. The will must follow.</p><p><strong>Call your leaders. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand that every bill becomes a barrier between flesh and steel.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another family to be broken. The street remembers every name.</p><p><a href=/take_action/>Take Action Now</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Assembly Member Phara Souffrant Forrest called the delay a denial of basic rights. Ossé called Hochul’s move 'an attack on our most vulnerable constituents.' Only a quarter of city stations are wheelchair-accessible. The hold traps thousands—seniors, parents, disabled riders—forcing them to risk dangerous streets or skip transit altogether.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The debate, reported by Gothamist, centers on whether a lower toll could unfreeze the program while still funding the MTA. Hoylman-Sigal said, "Nobody's wedded to $15. We are wedded to the improvements that congestion pricing will provide for mass transit or safety on our streets for cleaner air." Sen. Liz Krueger is open to a new fee if it raises $1 billion yearly. Sen. Jabari Brisport criticized the lack of study and feedback in the process, calling it "irresponsible." Any change needs legislative, MTA, and federal approval. Trump has promised to end congestion pricing if elected. No formal safety analysis was provided for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states the vehicle's center front end hit the pedestrian's head, causing severe lacerations and leaving him bleeding but conscious on the pavement. The driver of the SUV held only a learner’s permit at the time of the crash, as documented in the police report. The report does not specify any additional driver errors or contributing factors beyond the driver’s license status. The pedestrian was not at an intersection and was crossing without a signal or crosswalk, but the police report does not list these as contributing factors—only as the location and action. The collision underscores the dangers faced by pedestrians on city streets, especially when drivers lack full licensure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The 2019 law mandates the state and MTA 'shall' implement congestion pricing, not 'may.' U.S. Rep. Ritchie Torres said, 'When the will of the Executive competes with an Act of the Legislature, the law wins. Or should.' MTA board members, caught off guard, warned that without toll revenue, modernization projects—like electric buses and ADA stations—will be deprioritized. State Sen. Jabari Brisport and Riders Alliance noted a surge in public support for the program after Hochul’s decision. Hochul cited safety and community concerns, but advocates say her move robs New Yorkers of a vital tool to fund transit and cut traffic and pollution. The program’s future remains uncertain, with vulnerable road users facing continued risk from unchecked car traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The 2019 law’s language—'shall implement tolls'—makes her action legally questionable. The Federal Highway Administration has not finalized the agreement, giving Hochul a bureaucratic opening. State Sen. Jabari Brisport, district 25, spoke at a pro-congestion pricing rally, saying, 'A lot of senators felt the pressure from the phone calls, myself included.' The MTA warned that without toll revenue, modernization and accessibility projects will be delayed. Advocacy groups and transit riders called the pause a betrayal, emphasizing congestion pricing’s role in funding transit and reducing traffic and pollution.

The event, organized by Riders Alliance, followed Governor Kathy Hochul’s last-minute decision to halt the Manhattan toll plan. The protest drew bus and subway riders, who chanted for immediate action and held signs demanding clean air and reliable transit. Restler declared, 'Kathy Hochul has betrayed us,' and called for more frequent bus service, better trains, and less dependence on cars and trucks. The demonstrators warned that without congestion pricing, the MTA faces a funding crisis. This threatens repairs and improvements, especially in Black, Brown, and low-income neighborhoods, and risks worsening traffic and delays for emergency services. The protest highlights the systemic danger: when transit funding is gutted, vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
