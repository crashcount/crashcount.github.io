Another 1,592 were hurt. Twenty-four were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors. A 36-year-old man, struck crossing Broadway and East New York Avenue, died as the driver sped away. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/04/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-man-36-in-brooklyn-crash/>&ldquo;The driver of the Ford sped off, never stopping, cops said. He remained at large on Saturday.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price.</strong> SUVs and sedans do most of the damage. In three years, cars and trucks killed 10, injured 840, and left 14 with life-altering wounds. Bikes and mopeds are not blameless, but their toll is a fraction. The street is a gauntlet. No one is safe.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-and-silence>Leadership: Action and Silence</h2><p>State Senator Jabari Brisport has taken steps. He <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>voted yes on a bill</a> to force safer street design for all users. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>&ldquo;The bill’s focus is clear: safer streets for people on foot, on bikes, and in vehicles.&rdquo;</a> He co-sponsored a bill to use cameras to keep bike lanes clear. He signed on to require every new project with public money to put people first, not cars. These are steps, not leaps. The blood still runs.</p><h2 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h2><p><strong>Every day without change is another day of loss.</strong> The numbers do not lie. In the last year, deaths in the district jumped from 1 to 12. Injuries rose by nearly 22%. The city talks of Vision Zero. The street tells another story.</p><h2 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Senator Brisport. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for every person on foot or bike. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The rally targeted Governor Hochul’s $252 billion budget, which omits $33 billion needed for transit upgrades. The event, covered by amny.com, highlighted the matter: 'NYC transit advocates urge Hochul to fully fund MTA Capital Plan with guaranteed state budget revenue.' Hoylman-Sigal said, 'This is about the economic engine for the entire region.' Assembly Member Tony Simone and others demanded investment in transportation deserts and accessible stations. Advocates cited the MTA’s ADA settlement, noting only a quarter of stations are wheelchair-accessible, with the fewest in low-income areas. The rally underscored that without full funding, vulnerable riders—especially those with disabilities—face continued barriers and danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They protested Governor Kathy Hochul’s June 5 decision to suspend congestion pricing, a move that froze $16.5 billion in MTA upgrades, including elevators for Bed-Stuy’s busy station. The event, covered by brooklynpaper.com, highlighted the urgent need for accessibility: 'We want our elevators, we want our service, and we want it now,' said State Sen. Jabari Brisport. Assembly Member Phara Souffrant Forrest called the delay a denial of basic rights. Ossé called Hochul’s move 'an attack on our most vulnerable constituents.' Only a quarter of city stations are wheelchair-accessible. The hold traps thousands—seniors, parents, disabled riders—forcing them to risk dangerous streets or skip transit altogether.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The debate, reported by Gothamist, centers on whether a lower toll could unfreeze the program while still funding the MTA. Hoylman-Sigal said, "Nobody's wedded to $15. We are wedded to the improvements that congestion pricing will provide for mass transit or safety on our streets for cleaner air." Sen. Liz Krueger is open to a new fee if it raises $1 billion yearly. Sen. Jabari Brisport criticized the lack of study and feedback in the process, calling it "irresponsible." Any change needs legislative, MTA, and federal approval. Trump has promised to end congestion pricing if elected.
