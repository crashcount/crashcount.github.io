A gray Ford hit him and kept going. He died at Brookdale Hospital. The driver vanished into the night. Police are still searching. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/04/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-man-36-in-brooklyn-crash/>&ldquo;A hit-and-run driver struck and killed a 36-year-old man crossing a Brooklyn street, officials said Friday.&rdquo;</a></p><p>He was not alone. In the last twelve months, <strong>12 people have died</strong> and <strong>1,582 have been injured</strong> on the streets of SD 25. Twenty-four of those injuries were serious—lives changed in a moment. Most victims were walking. Most drivers kept driving.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most harm.</strong> In this district, they killed 10 people and injured hundreds more. Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds, none. Bikes, none. The street is not safe for the old, the young, or anyone in between.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-silence>Leadership: Action and Silence</h3><p>State Senator Jabari Brisport has not stood still. He co-sponsored the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, a bill to force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed limiters. He voted yes—twice. He also backed bills to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>extend school speed zones</a> and <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4804>create new safety zones</a>. These are steps in the right direction. But the blood keeps flowing.</p><p>The city rips out bike lanes. The drivers keep fleeing. The dead do not come back. As one advocate <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/15/appeals-court-halts-adamss-impending-bedford-ave-protected-bike-lane-demolition>said</a>, &ldquo;The fight to save the Bedford Avenue safety improvements continues, and we won&rsquo;t back down until everyone can get home safely.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day, another family waits for a call that never should come. Call Senator Brisport. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for every person on foot or bike. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p><p><strong>Act now. The street will not forgive delay.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Advocates cited the MTA’s ADA settlement, noting only a quarter of stations are wheelchair-accessible, with the fewest in low-income areas.

According to police, Simpson "swiped an oncoming car" near Gates Avenue and Marcus Garvey Boulevard, then "drove away, dragging the person several feet and hitting another car with a pregnant woman inside." She struck a third, empty car before being arrested by city sheriffs. No one was seriously injured, though the pregnant woman was taken to a hospital for evaluation. Simpson faces charges of reckless endangerment, assault, and leaving the scene.
