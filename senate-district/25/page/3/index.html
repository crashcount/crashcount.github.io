Twenty-two left with serious injuries. Over 1,400 hurt.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, there were 2,500 crashes. The dead include a pregnant woman, a 55-year-old pedestrian, a 26-year-old passenger, and a 27-year-old motorcyclist. They are not numbers. They are lives ended on the street.</p><p>On May 24, Tiffany Cifuni stepped out of her car in Bedford-Stuyvesant after a minor crash. She never made it home. The driver hit the gas, dragged her under the car, and left her to die. &ldquo;The defendant floored the gas, instantly striking Tiffany, causing her body to become lodged beneath the vehicle,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/06/18/us-news/driver-who-mowed-down-mom-to-be-on-way-home-from-beyonce-show-nabbed-in-nyc-officials/>said Assistant District Attorney Tara Kelly</a>.

Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes added more injuries. The city talks about Vision Zero. The state passes laws. But the carnage does not stop.</p><p><strong>Jabari Brisport has taken steps.</strong> He voted yes on a bill to force safer street design for all users, not just drivers. He co-sponsored a bill to use cameras to keep bike lanes clear, so cyclists do not have to swerve into traffic. He backed another bill to require complete street design for any project using public money. These are not empty gestures. They are votes and signatures on the record. But the streets are still not safe.</p><h2 id=the-fight-over-infrastructure>The Fight Over Infrastructure</h2><p>The city removed a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue after crashes involving children. The mayor called it a response to community concerns. Council Member Lincoln Restler called it &ldquo;a purely political decision to rip out a bike lane with no alternative&rdquo; <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/adams-dot-remove-bedford-avenue-bike-lane/>in an interview</a>. The lawsuits came fast. The danger remains.</p><h2 id=what-now-demand-more>What Now? Demand More</h2><p><strong>The bodies keep coming. The promises keep coming.</strong> The only thing that stops a car is concrete, not talk. Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand protected bike lanes, lower speed limits, and enforcement that does not blame the dead. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong> <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report states the vehicle's center front end hit the pedestrian's head, causing severe lacerations and leaving him bleeding but conscious on the pavement. The driver of the SUV held only a learner’s permit at the time of the crash, as documented in the police report. The report does not specify any additional driver errors or contributing factors beyond the driver’s license status. The pedestrian was not at an intersection and was crossing without a signal or crosswalk, but the police report does not list these as contributing factors—only as the location and action.

Lawmakers and advocates called her move illegal. The MTA faces lost funds, stalled upgrades, and mounting frustration. Transit riders and vulnerable road users are left exposed as car traffic surges unchecked.</p><p class=mb3>On June 10, 2024, Governor Kathy Hochul abruptly paused New York City’s congestion pricing program, which was set to begin June 30. The 2019 law mandates the state and MTA 'shall' implement congestion pricing, not 'may.' U.S. Rep. Ritchie Torres said, 'When the will of the Executive competes with an Act of the Legislature, the law wins. Or should.' MTA board members, caught off guard, warned that without toll revenue, modernization projects—like electric buses and ADA stations—will be deprioritized. State Sen. Jabari Brisport and Riders Alliance noted a surge in public support for the program after Hochul’s decision. Hochul cited safety and community concerns, but advocates say her move robs New Yorkers of a vital tool to fund transit and cut traffic and pollution. The program’s future remains uncertain, with vulnerable road users facing continued risk from unchecked car traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The 2019 law’s language—'shall implement tolls'—makes her action legally questionable. The Federal Highway Administration has not finalized the agreement, giving Hochul a bureaucratic opening. State Sen. Jabari Brisport, district 25, spoke at a pro-congestion pricing rally, saying, 'A lot of senators felt the pressure from the phone calls, myself included.' The MTA warned that without toll revenue, modernization and accessibility projects will be delayed. Advocacy groups and transit riders called the pause a betrayal, emphasizing congestion pricing’s role in funding transit and reducing traffic and pollution. The matter’s title: 'Hochul's Bid to Stop Congestion Pricing Might Be Illegal.'

Restler declared, 'Kathy Hochul has betrayed us,' and called for more frequent bus service, better trains, and less dependence on cars and trucks.
