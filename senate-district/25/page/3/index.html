The vehicle's front end struck the man's back, causing crush injuries. The report states the pedestrian remained conscious at the scene. The SUV driver continued the turn after impact. Contributing factors cited in the report include 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Turning Improperly.' The pedestrian's action—'Crossing With Signal'—is noted in the report, but the primary focus remains on the driver's failure to yield and improper turning.

The impact came from the vehicle’s right front bumper, crushing the man’s arm and causing fatal injuries. The report states the driver did not stop after the collision. Police cite 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor. The pedestrian was crossing against the signal, as noted in the report, but the primary error listed is the driver’s failure to pay attention. The man died at the scene, his blood left on the pavement.

They protested Governor Kathy Hochul’s June 5 decision to suspend congestion pricing, a move that froze $16.5 billion in MTA upgrades, including elevators for Bed-Stuy’s busy station. The event, covered by brooklynpaper.com, highlighted the urgent need for accessibility: 'We want our elevators, we want our service, and we want it now,' said State Sen. Jabari Brisport. Assembly Member Phara Souffrant Forrest called the delay a denial of basic rights. Ossé called Hochul’s move 'an attack on our most vulnerable constituents.' Only a quarter of city stations are wheelchair-accessible. The hold traps thousands—seniors, parents, disabled riders—forcing them to risk dangerous streets or skip transit altogether.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The debate, reported by Gothamist, centers on whether a lower toll could unfreeze the program while still funding the MTA. Hoylman-Sigal said, "Nobody's wedded to $15. We are wedded to the improvements that congestion pricing will provide for mass transit or safety on our streets for cleaner air." Sen. Liz Krueger is open to a new fee if it raises $1 billion yearly. Sen. Jabari Brisport criticized the lack of study and feedback in the process, calling it "irresponsible." Any change needs legislative, MTA, and federal approval. Trump has promised to end congestion pricing if elected.

The report states the vehicle's center front end hit the pedestrian's head, causing severe lacerations and leaving him bleeding but conscious on the pavement. The driver of the SUV held only a learner’s permit at the time of the crash, as documented in the police report.

The pedestrian was not at an intersection and was crossing without a signal or crosswalk, but the police report does not list these as contributing factors—only as the location and action.

The 2019 law mandates the state and MTA 'shall' implement congestion pricing, not 'may.' U.S. Rep. Ritchie Torres said, 'When the will of the Executive competes with an Act of the Legislature, the law wins. Or should.' MTA board members, caught off guard, warned that without toll revenue, modernization projects—like electric buses and ADA stations—will be deprioritized. State Sen. Jabari Brisport and Riders Alliance noted a surge in public support for the program after Hochul’s decision. Hochul cited safety and community concerns, but advocates say her move robs New Yorkers of a vital tool to fund transit and cut traffic and pollution. The program’s future remains uncertain, with vulnerable road users facing continued risk from unchecked car traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

State Sen. Jabari Brisport, district 25, spoke at a pro-congestion pricing rally, saying, 'A lot of senators felt the pressure from the phone calls, myself included.' The MTA warned that without toll revenue, modernization and accessibility projects will be delayed. Advocacy groups and transit riders called the pause a betrayal, emphasizing congestion pricing’s role in funding transit and reducing traffic and pollution.
