The debate, reported by Gothamist, centers on whether a lower toll could unfreeze the program while still funding the MTA. Hoylman-Sigal said, "Nobody's wedded to $15. We are wedded to the improvements that congestion pricing will provide for mass transit or safety on our streets for cleaner air." Sen. Liz Krueger is open to a new fee if it raises $1 billion yearly. Sen. Jabari Brisport criticized the lack of study and feedback in the process, calling it "irresponsible." Any change needs legislative, MTA, and federal approval. Trump has promised to end congestion pricing if elected.

The report states the vehicle's center front end hit the pedestrian's head, causing severe lacerations and leaving him bleeding but conscious on the pavement. The driver of the SUV held only a learner’s permit at the time of the crash, as documented in the police report. The report does not specify any additional driver errors or contributing factors beyond the driver’s license status. The pedestrian was not at an intersection and was crossing without a signal or crosswalk, but the police report does not list these as contributing factors—only as the location and action. The collision underscores the dangers faced by pedestrians on city streets, especially when drivers lack full licensure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The 2019 law mandates the state and MTA 'shall' implement congestion pricing, not 'may.' U.S. Rep. Ritchie Torres said, 'When the will of the Executive competes with an Act of the Legislature, the law wins. Or should.' MTA board members, caught off guard, warned that without toll revenue, modernization projects—like electric buses and ADA stations—will be deprioritized. State Sen. Jabari Brisport and Riders Alliance noted a surge in public support for the program after Hochul’s decision. Hochul cited safety and community concerns, but advocates say her move robs New Yorkers of a vital tool to fund transit and cut traffic and pollution. The program’s future remains uncertain, with vulnerable road users facing continued risk from unchecked car traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The MTA warned that without toll revenue, modernization and accessibility projects will be delayed. Advocacy groups and transit riders called the pause a betrayal, emphasizing congestion pricing’s role in funding transit and reducing traffic and pollution.

Restler declared, 'Kathy Hochul has betrayed us,' and called for more frequent bus service, better trains, and less dependence on cars and trucks. The demonstrators warned that without congestion pricing, the MTA faces a funding crisis.

The vehicle struck a 28-year-old woman who was crossing the intersection with the signal. The report states her shoulder and upper arm were crushed beneath the moped’s center front end, causing significant injury. The pedestrian remained conscious at the scene. The police report cites 'Traffic Control Disregarded' and 'Driver Inexperience' as contributing factors to the crash. The woman’s actions—crossing with the signal—are noted in the report, but only after the driver’s failures. The collision underscores the lethal consequences when drivers ignore traffic controls in Brooklyn’s crosswalks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The impact ejected the 32-year-old male cyclist from his bike, leaving him semiconscious and bleeding severely from the head. The report notes that the SUV’s front end caved in, while the bicycle was left twisted at the scene. Police cite 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as contributing factors, highlighting driver error as central to the crash. The narrative describes blood pooling from the cyclist’s head and confirms he was not wearing a helmet, but this detail is mentioned only after the driver’s actions. Systemic danger persists on Atlantic Avenue, where vulnerable road users face lethal force from vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
