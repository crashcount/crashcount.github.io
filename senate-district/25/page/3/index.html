A gray Ford hit him and kept going. He died at Brookdale Hospital. The driver vanished into the night. Police are still searching. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/04/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-man-36-in-brooklyn-crash/>&ldquo;A hit-and-run driver struck and killed a 36-year-old man crossing a Brooklyn street, officials said Friday.&rdquo;</a></p><p>He was not alone. In the last twelve months, <strong>12 people have died</strong> and <strong>1,582 have been injured</strong> on the streets of SD 25. Twenty-four of those injuries were serious—lives changed in a moment. Most victims were walking. Most drivers kept driving.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most harm.</strong> In this district, they killed 10 people and injured hundreds more. Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds, none. Bikes, none. The street is not safe for the old, the young, or anyone in between.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-silence>Leadership: Action and Silence</h3><p>State Senator Jabari Brisport has not stood still. He co-sponsored the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, a bill to force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed limiters. He voted yes—twice. He also backed bills to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>extend school speed zones</a> and <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4804>create new safety zones</a>. These are steps in the right direction. But the blood keeps flowing.</p><p>The city rips out bike lanes. The drivers keep fleeing. The dead do not come back. As one advocate <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/15/appeals-court-halts-adamss-impending-bedford-ave-protected-bike-lane-demolition>said</a>, &ldquo;The fight to save the Bedford Avenue safety improvements continues, and we won&rsquo;t back down until everyone can get home safely.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day, another family waits for a call that never should come. Call Senator Brisport. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for every person on foot or bike. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p><p><strong>Act now. The street will not forgive delay.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Assembly Member Phara Souffrant Forrest called the delay a denial of basic rights. Ossé called Hochul’s move 'an attack on our most vulnerable constituents.'

We are wedded to the improvements that congestion pricing will provide for mass transit or safety on our streets for cleaner air." Sen. Liz Krueger is open to a new fee if it raises $1 billion yearly. Sen. Jabari Brisport criticized the lack of study and feedback in the process, calling it "irresponsible."

The report states the vehicle's center front end hit the pedestrian's head, causing severe lacerations and leaving him bleeding but conscious on the pavement. The driver of the SUV held only a learner’s permit at the time of the crash, as documented in the police report. The report does not specify any additional driver errors or contributing factors beyond the driver’s license status. The pedestrian was not at an intersection and was crossing without a signal or crosswalk, but the police report does not list these as contributing factors—only as the location and action. The collision underscores the dangers faced by pedestrians on city streets, especially when drivers lack full licensure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The 2019 law mandates the state and MTA 'shall' implement congestion pricing, not 'may.' U.S. Rep. Ritchie Torres said, 'When the will of the Executive competes with an Act of the Legislature, the law wins. Or should.' MTA board members, caught off guard, warned that without toll revenue, modernization projects—like electric buses and ADA stations—will be deprioritized. State Sen. Jabari Brisport and Riders Alliance noted a surge in public support for the program after Hochul’s decision. Hochul cited safety and community concerns, but advocates say her move robs New Yorkers of a vital tool to fund transit and cut traffic and pollution. The program’s future remains uncertain, with vulnerable road users facing continued risk from unchecked car traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The 2019 law’s language—'shall implement tolls'—makes her action legally questionable. The Federal Highway Administration has not finalized the agreement, giving Hochul a bureaucratic opening. State Sen. Jabari Brisport, district 25, spoke at a pro-congestion pricing rally, saying, 'A lot of senators felt the pressure from the phone calls, myself included.' The MTA warned that without toll revenue, modernization and accessibility projects will be delayed. Advocacy groups and transit riders called the pause a betrayal, emphasizing congestion pricing’s role in funding transit and reducing traffic and pollution. The matter’s title: 'Hochul's Bid to Stop Congestion Pricing Might Be Illegal.'

The event, organized by Riders Alliance, followed Governor Kathy Hochul’s last-minute decision to halt the Manhattan toll plan. The protest drew bus and subway riders, who chanted for immediate action and held signs demanding clean air and reliable transit. Restler declared, 'Kathy Hochul has betrayed us,' and called for more frequent bus service, better trains, and less dependence on cars and trucks. The demonstrators warned that without congestion pricing, the MTA faces a funding crisis.
