A gray Ford hit him and kept going. He died at Brookdale Hospital. The driver vanished into the night. Police are still searching. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/04/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-man-36-in-brooklyn-crash/>&ldquo;A hit-and-run driver struck and killed a 36-year-old man crossing a Brooklyn street, officials said Friday.&rdquo;</a></p><p>He was not alone. In the last twelve months, <strong>12 people have died</strong> and <strong>1,582 have been injured</strong> on the streets of SD 25. Twenty-four of those injuries were serious—lives changed in a moment. Most victims were walking. Most drivers kept driving.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most harm.</strong> In this district, they killed 10 people and injured hundreds more. Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds, none. Bikes, none. The street is not safe for the old, the young, or anyone in between.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-silence>Leadership: Action and Silence</h3><p>State Senator Jabari Brisport has not stood still. He co-sponsored the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, a bill to force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed limiters. He voted yes—twice. He also backed bills to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>extend school speed zones</a> and <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4804>create new safety zones</a>. These are steps in the right direction. But the blood keeps flowing.</p><p>The city rips out bike lanes. The drivers keep fleeing. The dead do not come back. As one advocate <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/15/appeals-court-halts-adamss-impending-bedford-ave-protected-bike-lane-demolition>said</a>, &ldquo;The fight to save the Bedford Avenue safety improvements continues, and we won&rsquo;t back down until everyone can get home safely.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day, another family waits for a call that never should come. Call Senator Brisport. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for every person on foot or bike. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p><p><strong>Act now. The street will not forgive delay.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

They protested Governor Kathy Hochul’s June 5 decision to suspend congestion pricing, a move that froze $16.5 billion in MTA upgrades, including elevators for Bed-Stuy’s busy station. The event, covered by brooklynpaper.com, highlighted the urgent need for accessibility: 'We want our elevators, we want our service, and we want it now,' said State Sen. Jabari Brisport. Assembly Member Phara Souffrant Forrest called the delay a denial of basic rights. Ossé called Hochul’s move 'an attack on our most vulnerable constituents.' Only a quarter of city stations are wheelchair-accessible. The hold traps thousands—seniors, parents, disabled riders—forcing them to risk dangerous streets or skip transit altogether.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The debate, reported by Gothamist, centers on whether a lower toll could unfreeze the program while still funding the MTA. Hoylman-Sigal said, "Nobody's wedded to $15. We are wedded to the improvements that congestion pricing will provide for mass transit or safety on our streets for cleaner air." Sen. Liz Krueger is open to a new fee if it raises $1 billion yearly. Sen. Jabari Brisport criticized the lack of study and feedback in the process, calling it "irresponsible."

The 2019 law mandates the state and MTA 'shall' implement congestion pricing, not 'may.' U.S. Rep. Ritchie Torres said, 'When the will of the Executive competes with an Act of the Legislature, the law wins. Or should.' MTA board members, caught off guard, warned that without toll revenue, modernization projects—like electric buses and ADA stations—will be deprioritized. State Sen. Jabari Brisport and Riders Alliance noted a surge in public support for the program after Hochul’s decision. Hochul cited safety and community concerns, but advocates say her move robs New Yorkers of a vital tool to fund transit and cut traffic and pollution. The program’s future remains uncertain, with vulnerable road users facing continued risk from unchecked car traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The police report identifies 'Pavement Defective' as the sole contributing factor in the crash. The narrative notes her helmet cracked on impact, but no victim behavior is cited as a contributing factor.

The police report lists 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Driver Inexperience' as contributing factors. The collision occurred when the sedan’s right front bumper hit the pedestrian, who was in the crosswalk. No evidence in the report suggests any pedestrian error contributed to the crash.

The vehicle struck a 28-year-old woman who was crossing the intersection with the signal. The report states her shoulder and upper arm were crushed beneath the moped’s center front end, causing significant injury. The pedestrian remained conscious at the scene. The police report cites 'Traffic Control Disregarded' and 'Driver Inexperience' as contributing factors to the crash.
