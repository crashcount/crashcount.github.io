Fifty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 5,200 hurt since 2022. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors. A 32-year-old woman crushed by an SUV on Van Buren Street in May. A 55-year-old woman struck by another SUV on Washington Avenue days later. The street does not care if you are young or old. It takes what it wants.</p><p><strong>SUVs and cars are the main killers.</strong> They caused seven deaths and over 250 serious or moderate injuries to pedestrians and cyclists in this district alone. Trucks and buses killed at least one. Bikes and mopeds hurt, but they do not kill like steel and speed do. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=the-politics-of-safety>The Politics of Safety</h3><p>The city talks about safety. Sometimes it acts. Sometimes it does not. On Bedford Avenue, the city ripped out a protected bike lane after complaints and a crash involving a child and a cyclist. The mayor called it a response to &ldquo;community concerns.&rdquo; Council Member Lincoln Restler called it what it was: <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/bedford-avenue-protected-bike-lane-removal/>&ldquo;This is just pure politics. That is not how safety decisions on our streets should be made.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>The cost of delay is paid in blood.</strong> The city’s own data showed this stretch had the second largest number of pedestrian deaths before the lane went in. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/13/breaking-mayor-adams-to-remove-bedford-avenue-protected-bike-lane-citing-bizarrely-safety>&ldquo;Before this bike lane from 2018 to 2022 this is the area that had the second largest numbers of pedestrian fatalities and crashes in the city,&rdquo; said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez.</a></p><h3 id=what-has-brisport-done>What Has Brisport Done?</h3><p>Senator Jabari Brisport has not been silent. He voted yes on a bill to force safer street design for all users, not just drivers. He co-sponsored a bill to use cameras to keep bike lanes clear of cars. He stood with advocates <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/bk-protest-congestion-pricing-hochul/>demanding congestion pricing to fund transit and cut traffic</a>. These are steps. But the bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=what-next-demand-more>What Next? Demand More</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day the city delays, another family is broken. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call Senator Brisport. Tell them: <strong>protect the vulnerable, not the parking. Build streets for people, not for cars.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On February 10, 2023, eighteen Brooklyn lawmakers issued a joint letter demanding New York State Department of Transportation (DOT) participate in comprehensive planning for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens. Jabari Brisport, Julia Salazar, Kristen Gonzalez, Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Members Bobby Carroll, Maritza Davila, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Emily Gallagher, Jo Anne Simon, Marcela Mitaynes, and Council Members Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Lincoln Restler. Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint. Without state action, only city-owned segments see attention. The city’s efforts are limited.
