They protested Governor Kathy Hochul’s June 5 decision to suspend congestion pricing, a move that froze $16.5 billion in MTA upgrades, including elevators for Bed-Stuy’s busy station. The event, covered by brooklynpaper.com, highlighted the urgent need for accessibility: 'We want our elevators, we want our service, and we want it now,' said State Sen. Jabari Brisport. Assembly Member Phara Souffrant Forrest called the delay a denial of basic rights. Ossé called Hochul’s move 'an attack on our most vulnerable constituents.' Only a quarter of city stations are wheelchair-accessible. The hold traps thousands—seniors, parents, disabled riders—forcing them to risk dangerous streets or skip transit altogether.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The debate, reported by Gothamist, centers on whether a lower toll could unfreeze the program while still funding the MTA. Hoylman-Sigal said, "Nobody's wedded to $15. We are wedded to the improvements that congestion pricing will provide for mass transit or safety on our streets for cleaner air." Sen. Liz Krueger is open to a new fee if it raises $1 billion yearly. Sen. Jabari Brisport criticized the lack of study and feedback in the process, calling it "irresponsible." Any change needs legislative, MTA, and federal approval. Trump has promised to end congestion pricing if elected.

The 2019 law mandates the state and MTA 'shall' implement congestion pricing, not 'may.' U.S. Rep. Ritchie Torres said, 'When the will of the Executive competes with an Act of the Legislature, the law wins. Or should.' MTA board members, caught off guard, warned that without toll revenue, modernization projects—like electric buses and ADA stations—will be deprioritized. State Sen. Jabari Brisport and Riders Alliance noted a surge in public support for the program after Hochul’s decision. Hochul cited safety and community concerns, but advocates say her move robs New Yorkers of a vital tool to fund transit and cut traffic and pollution.
