Twenty-two left with serious injuries. Over 1,400 hurt.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, there were 2,500 crashes. The dead include a pregnant woman, a 55-year-old pedestrian, a 26-year-old passenger, and a 27-year-old motorcyclist. They are not numbers.

Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes added more injuries. The city talks about Vision Zero. The state passes laws. But the carnage does not stop.</p><p><strong>Jabari Brisport has taken steps.</strong> He voted yes on a bill to force safer street design for all users, not just drivers. He co-sponsored a bill to use cameras to keep bike lanes clear, so cyclists do not have to swerve into traffic. He backed another bill to require complete street design for any project using public money. These are not empty gestures. They are votes and signatures on the record. But the streets are still not safe.</p><h2 id=the-fight-over-infrastructure>The Fight Over Infrastructure</h2><p>The city removed a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue after crashes involving children. The mayor called it a response to community concerns. Council Member Lincoln Restler called it &ldquo;a purely political decision to rip out a bike lane with no alternative&rdquo; <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/adams-dot-remove-bedford-avenue-bike-lane/>in an interview</a>. The lawsuits came fast. The danger remains.</p><h2 id=what-now-demand-more>What Now? Demand More</h2><p><strong>The bodies keep coming.

Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On February 10, 2023, eighteen Brooklyn lawmakers issued a joint letter demanding New York State Department of Transportation (DOT) participate in comprehensive planning for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens. Jabari Brisport, Julia Salazar, Kristen Gonzalez, Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Members Bobby Carroll, Maritza Davila, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Emily Gallagher, Jo Anne Simon, Marcela Mitaynes, and Council Members Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Lincoln Restler. Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint. Without state action, only city-owned segments see attention. The city’s efforts are limited.
