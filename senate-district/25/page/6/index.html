They only count the bodies and the broken.</p><p>Just this July, a man tried to cross Broadway at East New York Avenue. A gray Ford hit him and kept going. He died at Brookdale Hospital.

John Liu backs maintaining cameras but won’t commit to S5602. Some City Council members demand that camera revenue fund local road improvements. Assembly Member Dick Gottfried doubts the Council will send the required home rule message in time, while Assembly Member William Magnarelli promises to advance the bill if they do. Mayor Adams’ team claims safety was discussed in Albany, but the mayor himself stayed silent. The bill faces opposition over increased penalties and insurance notifications.
