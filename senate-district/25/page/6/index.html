A car hit him. The driver did not stop. The man died at Brookdale Hospital. He was 36. His name is not in the record. The driver is still gone. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brownsville-crash-police-searching-driver-deadly-hit-run-collision-brooklyn-nyc/16949967/>Police are still looking</a>.</p><p>A few hours earlier, a 55-year-old man rode his motorcycle west on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. He lost control near Emerson Place, hit the median, and died on the road. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/03/motorcyclist-dies-after-losing-control-in-crash-on-brooklyn-queens-expressway/>Police said he was &ldquo;zipping west&rdquo;</a>.</p><p>On May 24, a woman was killed by an SUV on Van Buren Street. On May 17, another woman was killed by an SUV on Washington Avenue. In the last twelve months, SD 25 has seen <strong>12 deaths</strong> and <strong>24 serious injuries</strong>.

They only rise.</p><h2 id=the-system-fails-the-vulnerable>The System Fails the Vulnerable</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> In this district, they caused <strong>10 deaths</strong> and over <strong>850 injuries</strong> to pedestrians. Trucks and buses killed at least one. Motorcycles and mopeds injured dozens more. No helmet, no crosswalk, no light can stop a speeding car. The street does not forgive.</p><p>Drivers flee.

He backed the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, which would force the worst drivers to install speed limiters. He voted yes to extend speed cameras near schools. He co-sponsored a bill for automated bike lane enforcement. These are steps. But the deaths keep coming.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;This is about the economic engine for the entire region,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-transit-advocates-mta-funding-capital-02022025/>said a colleague at a rally for transit funding</a>.

Hundreds maimed.</strong> This is not fate. This is policy. Call Senator Brisport. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand speed limiters for repeat offenders.

The legislative session nears its end with no clear action. State Sen. Jabari Brisport supports the bill, calling for round-the-clock enforcement. Sen. John Liu backs maintaining cameras but won’t commit to S5602. Some City Council members demand that camera revenue fund local road improvements. Assembly Member Dick Gottfried doubts the Council will send the required home rule message in time, while Assembly Member William Magnarelli promises to advance the bill if they do. Mayor Adams’ team claims safety was discussed in Albany, but the mayor himself stayed silent. The bill faces opposition over increased penalties and insurance notifications. Without action, the city’s speed cameras—and the safety of its streets—are at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
