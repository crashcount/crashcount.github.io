A gray Ford hit him and kept going. He died at Brookdale Hospital. The driver vanished into the night. This was July 3rd. It was not the first time. It will not be the last. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/04/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-man-36-in-brooklyn-crash/>A hit-and-run driver struck and killed a 36-year-old man crossing a Brooklyn street, officials said Friday.</a></p><p>Just hours before, a motorcyclist lost control on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. He hit the median and died on the road. Police said he was &ldquo;zipping west&rdquo; when it happened. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/03/motorcyclist-dies-after-losing-control-in-crash-on-brooklyn-queens-expressway/>A 55-year-old motorcyclist died after crashing on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway early Thursday, police said.</a></p><p><strong>In the last 12 months, 12 people have died and 1,582 have been injured in SD 25.</strong> Twenty-four were seriously hurt. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><h2 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h2><p>Since 2022, there have been <strong>26 deaths and 61 serious injuries</strong> on these streets. Most of the dead were walking. Most of the vehicles were cars, SUVs, or trucks. The numbers are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors. They are the empty seat at the table.</p><h2 id=leadership-what-has-been-done>Leadership: What Has Been Done</h2><p>State Senator Jabari Brisport has not been silent. He co-sponsored the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, which would force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. He voted yes to extend <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>school speed zones</a>, making it safer for children to cross the street. He backed <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S3304>automated bike lane enforcement</a> to keep drivers out of the space meant for cyclists. These are steps. They are not enough. The bodies keep coming.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call Senator Brisport. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat offenders. Demand streets where a walk to the store is not a gamble with death.</p><p>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. Act now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
