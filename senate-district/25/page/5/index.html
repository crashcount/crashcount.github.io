A car hit him. The driver did not stop. The man died at Brookdale Hospital. He was 36. His name is not in the record. The driver is still gone. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brownsville-crash-police-searching-driver-deadly-hit-run-collision-brooklyn-nyc/16949967/>Police are still looking</a>.</p><p>A few hours earlier, a 55-year-old man rode his motorcycle west on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. He lost control near Emerson Place, hit the median, and died on the road. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/03/motorcyclist-dies-after-losing-control-in-crash-on-brooklyn-queens-expressway/>Police said he was &ldquo;zipping west&rdquo;</a>.</p><p>On May 24, a woman was killed by an SUV on Van Buren Street. On May 17, another woman was killed by an SUV on Washington Avenue. In the last twelve months, SD 25 has seen <strong>12 deaths</strong> and <strong>24 serious injuries</strong>. There have been <strong>1,587 injuries</strong> in <strong>2,677 crashes</strong>. The numbers do not stop. They only rise.</p><h2 id=the-system-fails-the-vulnerable>The System Fails the Vulnerable</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> In this district, they caused <strong>10 deaths</strong> and over <strong>850 injuries</strong> to pedestrians. Trucks and buses killed at least one. Motorcycles and mopeds injured dozens more. No helmet, no crosswalk, no light can stop a speeding car. The street does not forgive.</p><p>Drivers flee. Families wait for answers. &ldquo;The driver of the Ford sped off, never stopping, cops said. He remained at large on Saturday.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/04/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-man-36-in-brooklyn-crash/>NY Daily News</a>.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn&rsquo;t</h2><p>State Senator Jabari Brisport has voted for and co-sponsored bills to curb repeat speeders and expand school speed zones. He backed the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, which would force the worst drivers to install speed limiters. He voted yes to extend speed cameras near schools. He co-sponsored a bill for automated bike lane enforcement. These are steps. But the deaths keep coming.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;This is about the economic engine for the entire region,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-transit-advocates-mta-funding-capital-02022025/>said a colleague at a rally for transit funding</a>.

Hundreds maimed.</strong> This is not fate. This is policy. Call Senator Brisport. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph limit. Demand speed limiters for repeat offenders.

They reject piecemeal fixes. They call out decades of harm. The state’s refusal leaves neighborhoods exposed. The city’s hands are tied. The highway’s danger remains. Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On February 10, 2023, eighteen Brooklyn lawmakers issued a joint letter demanding New York State Department of Transportation (DOT) participate in comprehensive planning for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens. Jabari Brisport, Julia Salazar, Kristen Gonzalez, Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Members Bobby Carroll, Maritza Davila, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Emily Gallagher, Jo Anne Simon, Marcela Mitaynes, and Council Members Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Lincoln Restler. Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint. Without state action, only city-owned segments see attention. The city’s efforts are limited. The state’s inaction leaves systemic danger unaddressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
