The Blood Is on Our Streets—And Their Hands.</h1><p class="byline f6 silver">Written July 10, 2025 <em>(Revised July 10, 2025 – Minor stats refresh)</em></p></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>SD 25: Jan 1, 2022 - Jul 10, 2025</h2><h2 id=blood-on-the-asphalt>Blood on the Asphalt</h2><p><strong>Ten dead. Fourteen hundred injured.</strong> That is the toll in Senate District 25 over the last year. The bodies do not lie. In the last twelve months, cars and trucks have killed ten people and left twenty-two with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The numbers are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors.</p><p><strong>Just last week, a 36-year-old man was crossing near Broadway and East New York Avenue.</strong> A driver hit him and kept going. He died at Brookdale Hospital. The driver never stopped. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/04/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-man-36-in-brooklyn-crash/>A hit-and-run driver struck and killed a 36-year-old man crossing a Brooklyn street, officials said</a>. The killer is still out there. The street is the same.</p><p>A day earlier, a 55-year-old man on a motorcycle lost control on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. He hit the median. He died before sunrise. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/03/motorcyclist-dies-after-losing-control-in-crash-on-brooklyn-queens-expressway/>The victim was zipping west on the expressway on a Kawasaki KLR650 when he lost control, cops said</a>.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-who-pays-the-price>The Pattern: Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the highest price.</strong> In three years, 24 people have died on these streets. Over 5,000 have been hurt. Most were walking. Most were doing nothing wrong. Cars and SUVs are the main killers—eight deaths, 577 minor injuries, 240 moderate injuries, 14 serious injuries. Trucks and buses add more. Motorcycles and mopeds, too. Bikes rarely kill, but they are not immune.</p><h2 id=leadership-what-has-been-done>Leadership: What Has Been Done</h2><p>Senator Jabari Brisport has not been silent. He voted for <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>complete street design</a>, pushing for roads that protect people, not just cars. He co-sponsored bills for <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S5008>automated bike lane enforcement</a> and <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S131>safer street requirements</a>. He stood with advocates to <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/hochul-congestion-pricing-accessibility-upgrades-bed-stuy/>demand subway accessibility</a>. He called out <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/bk-protest-congestion-pricing-hochul/>delays in congestion pricing</a>, knowing that more cars mean more blood.</p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The laws are not enough. The city moves slow. The streets stay deadly.</p><h2 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another family broken.</strong> Call Senator Brisport. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for every crosswalk and bike lane. Demand that repeat speeders are stopped before they kill again.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name on the list. Act now.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
