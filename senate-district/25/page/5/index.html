A gray Ford hit him and kept going. He died at Brookdale Hospital. The driver vanished into the night. Police are still searching. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/04/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-man-36-in-brooklyn-crash/>&ldquo;A hit-and-run driver struck and killed a 36-year-old man crossing a Brooklyn street, officials said Friday.&rdquo;</a></p><p>He was not alone. In the last twelve months, <strong>12 people have died</strong> and <strong>1,582 have been injured</strong> on the streets of SD 25. Twenty-four of those injuries were serious—lives changed in a moment. Most victims were walking. Most drivers kept driving.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most harm.</strong> In this district, they killed 10 people and injured hundreds more. Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds, none. Bikes, none. The street is not safe for the old, the young, or anyone in between.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-silence>Leadership: Action and Silence</h3><p>State Senator Jabari Brisport has not stood still. He co-sponsored the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, a bill to force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed limiters. He voted yes—twice. He also backed bills to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>extend school speed zones</a> and <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4804>create new safety zones</a>. These are steps in the right direction. But the blood keeps flowing.</p><p>The city rips out bike lanes. The drivers keep fleeing. The dead do not come back. As one advocate <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/15/appeals-court-halts-adamss-impending-bedford-ave-protected-bike-lane-demolition>said</a>, &ldquo;The fight to save the Bedford Avenue safety improvements continues, and we won&rsquo;t back down until everyone can get home safely.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day, another family waits for a call that never should come. Call Senator Brisport. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for every person on foot or bike. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p><p><strong>Act now. The street will not forgive delay.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On February 10, 2023, eighteen Brooklyn lawmakers issued a joint letter demanding New York State Department of Transportation (DOT) participate in comprehensive planning for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens. Jabari Brisport, Julia Salazar, Kristen Gonzalez, Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Members Bobby Carroll, Maritza Davila, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Emily Gallagher, Jo Anne Simon, Marcela Mitaynes, and Council Members Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Lincoln Restler. Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint. Without state action, only city-owned segments see attention. The city’s efforts are limited. The state’s inaction leaves systemic danger unaddressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
