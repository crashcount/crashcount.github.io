Since 2022, 25 people have died in crashes. Seventy-one suffered serious injuries. These are not just numbers—they are mothers, sons, neighbors. In the last twelve months alone, eight more lives ended on these streets. Two were seniors. One was a child. The violence does not stop.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a 68-year-old woman was killed crossing Rutland Road at E. 95th Street. She had the walk signal. The driver did not wait. &ldquo;I heard the van run over her and her bones crunching,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/16/fridays-headlines-east-flatbush-tragedy-edition>said Lorna Johnson</a>. The city moved on. The family did not.</p><p>On Lincoln Avenue, a grocery delivery worker was beaten with a pipe after a minor crash. He was left on the sidewalk, blood on his shirt, groceries scattered. &ldquo;The suspect opened his hatchback, pulled out a pipe, and lunged at the victim, striking him repeatedly,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/12/man-delivering-groceries-beaten-with-pipe-in-brooklyn-road-rage-attack/>reported the Daily News</a>. The attacker fled. The worker went to the hospital.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the killing. Fourteen deaths and hundreds of injuries came from cars and trucks. Motorcycles, mopeds, bikes, and buses add to the toll. Pedestrians die crossing with the light. Children are struck in crosswalks. The violence is not random. It follows the same lines, the same roads, the same mistakes.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>State Senator Roxanne Persaud has voted for bills to curb repeat speeders, expand speed cameras, and protect highway workers. She voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act, which targets drivers who rack up tickets and points <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>in committee</a>. She backed more speed cameras near schools. These are steps. But the blood keeps flowing. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not. The most dangerous drivers still roam free.</p><h2 id=act-nowor-count-more-dead>Act Now—Or Count More Dead</h2><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call Senator Persaud. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat offenders. Do not wait for another name on the list. The road will not wait.</p><p>Every day of delay is another day of loss.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
