Twenty-five people have died since 2022. Seventy-one suffered serious injuries. The numbers do not bleed, but the families do. A mother crossing with the light. A child in a crosswalk. A man behind the wheel, never coming home. The streets do not care who you are.</p><p>Just days ago, July 13, a young woman was killed in a parking lot in East New York. Her boyfriend lost control while doing donuts. She was sitting on the curb. He struck her. She died at the hospital. Police charged him with negligent homicide. &ldquo;He lost control when he was doing donuts with the vehicle,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>he told police</a>. The tire marks are still there.</p><p>A month before, a grocery delivery worker was beaten with a pipe after a minor crash in Cypress Hills. He was just doing his job. The attacker fled. The worker went to the hospital. &ldquo;A 36-year-old man delivering groceries was hospitalized after he was viciously beaten with a pipe during a road rage-fueled attack,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/12/man-delivering-groceries-beaten-with-pipe-in-brooklyn-road-rage-attack/>police said</a>.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-suvs-and-the-cost>The Pattern: Cars, SUVs, and the Cost</h3><p>Cars and SUVs do most of the killing. Fourteen deaths from cars and SUVs. One from a truck or bus. Bikes and mopeds, almost none. The pattern is clear. The pain is not shared equally. Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price.</p><h3 id=what-has-senator-persaud-done>What Has Senator Persaud Done?</h3><p>Senator Roxanne Persaud has voted yes on bills to curb repeat speeders and extend school speed zones. She backed the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, which would force drivers with a record of violations to install speed-limiting devices. She voted to create more safety zones and raise penalties for endangering highway workers. These are steps. But the blood on the street says it is not enough.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p>Every day of delay is another risk. Call Senator Persaud. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real consequences for repeat offenders. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
