Nineteen seriously hurt. Over 2,300 injured.</strong> That’s just the last twelve months in Senate District 19. The dead include the old, the young, and the nameless. A 68-year-old woman, Maurette Lafleur, was crossing with the light in East Flatbush. She never made it to the other side. &ldquo;The lady spin around and sped through,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/16/fridays-headlines-east-flatbush-tragedy-edition>said a witness</a>.

Demand More</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another family broken.</strong> Call Senator Persaud. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand more speed cameras.

Primary sponsor Andrew Gounardes led the push, joined by co-sponsors Samra Brouk, Cordell Cleare, and others.
