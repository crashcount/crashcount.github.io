Seventeen seriously hurt. Over 2,200 injured.</strong> In the last year alone, these are the numbers from the streets of Senate District 19. The dead include elders, children, and people just trying to cross with the light. The wounds are not just numbers. They are broken bones, crushed chests, and families left waiting for someone who will never come home.</p><p>A 68-year-old woman was killed in East Flatbush, crossing with the signal, struck by a Mercedes. A witness <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/16/fridays-headlines-east-flatbush-tragedy-edition>heard the van run over her and her bones crunching</a>. The driver kept going. The city kept moving.</p><p>On Fulton Street, a 55-year-old man was killed crossing the street. The driver fled. The car, a Ford Explorer with out-of-state plates, vanished into the night. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-fatal-hit-run-police-searching-driver-55-year-old-man-fatally-struck-car-cypress-hills/16447158/>The vehicle did not remain on the scene</a>.

Another name, another number.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>Most of the killing is done by cars and SUVs.</strong> In three years, cars and SUVs took 14 lives and left 16 with serious injuries. Trucks and buses killed one, seriously hurt four. Motorcycles and mopeds, one serious injury. Bikes, one. The street is not safe for anyone on foot. The old, the young, the careful, the distracted. It does not matter.</p><h3 id=what-has-roxanne-persaud-done>What Has Roxanne Persaud Done?</h3><p>Senator Persaud has voted for bills to make streets safer. She backed <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>speed limiters for repeat offenders</a>. She voted for <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>complete street design</a>, and for <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S7678>school speed cameras</a>. These are steps. They are not enough. The blood on the street says so.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Call Senator Persaud. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people walking and biking.</strong> Every day of delay is another day for the sirens. Another day for the undertaker. The city will not save itself. You must make them act.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
