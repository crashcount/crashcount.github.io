Since 2022, <strong>25 people have died</strong> in crashes. <strong>71 more suffered serious injuries</strong>. The wounded are not numbers. They are children, elders, workers, neighbors. In the last twelve months alone, <strong>8 lives were lost</strong> and <strong>26 people were left with injuries that will not heal</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a>).</p><p>Last month, a 21-year-old woman sat by the curb outside Gateway Plaza. Her boyfriend spun his car in circles. He lost control. She died there. Her family mourns. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating. It&rsquo;s affecting everyone in our family, especially (Ruiz&rsquo;s) mom. Maddy was her only daughter,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>said her sister-in-law</a>. Days later, the tire marks still scarred the lot.</p><p>A month before, a man delivering groceries on Lincoln Avenue was beaten with a pipe after a minor collision. He was left bleeding in the street. &ldquo;The suspect opened his hatchback, pulled out a pipe, and lunged at the victim, striking him repeatedly in the head and body,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/12/man-delivering-groceries-beaten-with-pipe-in-brooklyn-road-rage-attack/>reported police</a>.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-cars-and-suvs-kill-most>The Pattern: Cars and SUVs Kill Most</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> In this district, they killed <strong>14 people</strong> and injured over a thousand. Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes together killed none, but left some injured. The street is not safe for the unprotected. The numbers do not lie (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a>).</p><h2 id=what-has-senator-persaud-done>What Has Senator Persaud Done?</h2><p><strong>State Senator Roxanne Persaud has voted for safety.</strong> She backed the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>). She voted to extend school speed zones and create more safety zones (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/14/woman-fatally-struck-by-genesis-g80-driver-doing-donuts-in-brooklyn-plaza-parking-lot/>school speed zones</a>). These are steps forward. But the deaths keep coming. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so. The most dangerous drivers still roam free.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-demand-more>The Next Step: Demand More</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice made by leaders who act or delay. Call Senator Persaud. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat speeders. Do not wait for another family to grieve. The road will not wait.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
