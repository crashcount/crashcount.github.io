The dead include children, elders, and people just trying to cross the street. The living carry scars you cannot see.</p><p><strong>Just last month, a 21-year-old woman was killed in the Gateway Center parking lot.</strong> She was sitting on a curb. Her boyfriend lost control of his car while doing donuts. Police charged him with negligent homicide. Days later, the tire marks were still there. <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/driver-fleeing-cops-brooklyn-subway-station/>&ldquo;Next thing I know, he was into the fence. Absolutely crazy,&rdquo; said a witness at another crash scene.</a></p><p><strong>In May, a 68-year-old woman was crossing with the signal at Rutland Road and E 95th Street.</strong> A left-turning sedan struck and killed her. She had the light. She did not make it home. The car kept going. The city kept moving.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Most victims are not in cars.</strong> They are on foot, on bikes, or waiting for the light to change. Cars and SUVs are the main killers—<strong>15 deaths and over 1,000 injuries</strong>. Trucks and buses killed one, injuring dozens more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left their own trail of broken bodies. No helmet, no crosswalk, no prayer can stop a two-ton machine moving too fast.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>State Senator Roxanne Persaud has voted yes on bills to curb repeat speeders and extend school speed zones. She backed the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force the worst offenders to install speed-limiting devices. She voted to create more safety zones and raise penalties for endangering highway workers. These are steps. But the blood on the street says it is not enough.</p><p><strong>The carnage continues.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so. The most dangerous drivers are still behind the wheel. The next crash is already on its way.</p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p><strong>Call Senator Persaud. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat speeders.</strong> Do not wait for another name on the list. Do not wait for another family to grieve. The road will not forgive delay.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
