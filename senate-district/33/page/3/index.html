This year, he <strong>co-sponsored and voted yes</strong> on the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill that would force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting devices <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>according to Open States</a>. He also backed bills to create safety zones and a pedestrian safety rating for vehicles. These are steps forward. But the blood on the street says it is not enough. The carnage continues.

The matter, titled 'Bronx Business Leaders and Local Institutions Want to Halt Bus Fixes on Fordham Rd,' highlights their demand for Mayor Adams to halt improvements meant for 85,000 daily bus riders. The Belmont and Fordham Business Improvement Districts, along with the Bronx Zoo, New York Botanical Garden, Fordham University, Monroe College, and St. Barnabas Hospital, argue the changes would 'significantly impact crucial traffic flow' and burden side streets. State Sen. Gustavo Rivera voiced support for transit equity but awaits a traffic study. DOT claims to work with the community. Despite business concerns, advocates and city data show most shoppers use transit, walking, or biking, not cars. Similar fears about bus improvements hurting business have not come true elsewhere.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
