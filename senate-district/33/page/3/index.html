Sixty-six left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 4,500 hurt since 2022. The dead do not get a second chance. The wounded carry scars that do not heal. Most victims are not in cars. They are walking, riding, or crossing. They are children, elders, neighbors.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a driver struck and killed two men on scooters on the Bronx River Parkway. Police made an arrest, but the loss is permanent. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/driver-arrested-in-bronx-river-parkway-fatal-crash/>Police said a Mercedes sedan driver struck two men on scooters, who then suffered fatal injuries.</a> The story is always the same. The car keeps moving. The bodies do not.</p><p><strong>Hit-and-runs are routine.</strong> In May, a pedestrian was killed and the driver fled. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/driver-sought-after-deadly-bronx-hit-and-run/>Police are searching for a driver who allegedly fled after striking and killing a pedestrian in the Bronx early Saturday morning.</a> The city shrugs. The street is washed clean. But the blood remains.</p><h2 id=the-policy-response-riveras-record>The Policy Response: Rivera’s Record</h2><p>Senator Gustavo Rivera has not been silent. He voted yes on bills to curb repeat speeders and extend school speed zones. He co-sponsored a bill to rate cars for pedestrian safety. In June, he backed the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force the worst repeat offenders to install speed limiters. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>He voted yes in committee, boosting street safety by curbing repeat speeders.</a></p><p>But the crisis does not wait for Albany. The streets demand more. Cameras catch speeders, but the city’s default speed limit is still too high. The most dangerous drivers keep driving. The most vulnerable keep dying.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-demand-action-now>The Next Step: Demand Action Now</h2><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a policy choice. The numbers are not fate. They are the result of laws, votes, and silence.</p><p>Call Senator Rivera. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real consequences for repeat offenders. Join the fight. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter, titled 'Bronx Business Leaders and Local Institutions Want to Halt Bus Fixes on Fordham Rd,' highlights their demand for Mayor Adams to halt improvements meant for 85,000 daily bus riders. The Belmont and Fordham Business Improvement Districts, along with the Bronx Zoo, New York Botanical Garden, Fordham University, Monroe College, and St. Barnabas Hospital, argue the changes would 'significantly impact crucial traffic flow' and burden side streets. State Sen. Gustavo Rivera voiced support for transit equity but awaits a traffic study. DOT claims to work with the community. Despite business concerns, advocates and city data show most shoppers use transit, walking, or biking, not cars. Similar fears about bus improvements hurting business have not come true elsewhere.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
