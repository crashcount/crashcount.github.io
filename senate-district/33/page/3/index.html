One sedan flipped. Metal twisted. A 56-year-old woman in the front seat was crushed from the knees down. She stayed conscious as chaos reigned. Unsafe speed drove the violence. The system failed her.</p><p class=mb3>A violent multi-car collision unfolded on Bronx River Parkway late at night, involving a taxi and three sedans. According to the police report, the crash occurred at high speed, with one vehicle overturning and several others sustaining heavy damage. The report states, 'Bronx River Parkway, northbound, late at night — a taxi and three sedans collided at speed. One flipped. A 56-year-old woman in the front seat was crushed from the knees down. She did not lose consciousness.' The only contributing factor listed by police is 'Unsafe Speed,' underscoring the role of excessive velocity in the crash. No victim behavior is cited as a factor.

The city weighs next steps.</p><p class=mb3>On May 30, 2023, Bronx business leaders and institutions sent a letter opposing the Department of Transportation’s plan to expand bus lanes on Fordham Road. The matter, titled 'Bronx Business Leaders and Local Institutions Want to Halt Bus Fixes on Fordham Rd,' highlights their demand for Mayor Adams to halt improvements meant for 85,000 daily bus riders. The Belmont and Fordham Business Improvement Districts, along with the Bronx Zoo, New York Botanical Garden, Fordham University, Monroe College, and St. Barnabas Hospital, argue the changes would 'significantly impact crucial traffic flow' and burden side streets. State Sen. Gustavo Rivera voiced support for transit equity but awaits a traffic study. DOT claims to work with the community. Despite business concerns, advocates and city data show most shoppers use transit, walking, or biking, not cars. Similar fears about bus improvements hurting business have not come true elsewhere.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
