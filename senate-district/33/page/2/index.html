Sixty-one suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old. In the last year alone, <strong>one person died and 1,258 were injured</strong>. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared.</p><p>The dead do not speak. But the headlines do. A man was killed on the Major Deegan Expressway. The driver who hit him ran away. Police said, <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/police-looking-for-suspect-in-fatal-hit-and-run-on-major-deegan-expressway-nypd-says>they were looking for a man who ran away after crashing his car into a disabled vehicle on the Major Deegan Expressway and killing its driver over the weekend.</a> No arrests. No answers. Only another family left with silence.</p><p>A pedestrian was struck and killed in a Bronx hit-and-run. The driver fled. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/driver-sought-after-deadly-bronx-hit-and-run/>Police are searching for a driver who allegedly fled after striking and killing a pedestrian in the Bronx early Saturday morning.</a> The street was empty except for the body and the memory of footsteps.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage.</strong> They killed five. Trucks and buses killed two. Motorcycles and mopeds, none. Bikes, none. But the pain is not measured in metal. It is measured in the lives cut short, the families left behind, the wheelchairs and crutches and empty chairs at dinner.</p><h2 id=rivera-votes-bills-and-the-long-road>Rivera: Votes, Bills, and the Long Road</h2><p>Senator Gustavo Rivera has taken some steps. He voted yes on a bill to require safer street design for all users, not just drivers. The bill calls for streets that protect people on foot and on bikes, not just those behind the wheel. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>He voted yes.</a></p><p>He also co-sponsored a bill to create a public safety rating for cars, so people know which vehicles are most dangerous to pedestrians. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S1675>He signed on.</a> But the bill sits. No vote. No law. The street does not wait.</p><p>When business leaders tried to block bus improvements on Fordham Road, Rivera said he supports transit equity but wanted to wait for a traffic study. The buses still crawl. The danger remains. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/05/30/bronx-business-leaders-and-local-institutions-want-to-halt-bus-fixes-on-fordham-rd>He spoke, but the street stayed the same.</a></p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>The disaster is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every delay, every excuse, every watered-down law means another name on the list. Call Senator Rivera. Call your council member. Demand streets that put people first. Demand action before another family gets the call no one wants.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
