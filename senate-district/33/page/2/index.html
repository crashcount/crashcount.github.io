This year, he <strong>co-sponsored and voted yes</strong> on the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill that would force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting devices <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>according to Open States</a>.

Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz stated, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." The crash damaged the overpass wall and scattered debris onto the street below. No injuries were reported, though conflicting accounts left passenger presence unclear. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz highlighted the broader issue: "We’re seeing all over the city parking regulations not being enforced." The incident underscores the risks posed by illegal parking and the need for stricter enforcement and infrastructure checks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Despite the force, neither vehicle sustained damage. The police report cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor for both drivers. The moped rider wore a helmet, as noted in the report, but the focus remains on the driver errors that led to the crash. The man remained conscious, lying still in the street as traffic continued around him.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
