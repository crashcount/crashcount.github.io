His name was Darryl Mathis. He was hit by a Mercedes while stranded in his car. The driver ran. Police said, <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/police-looking-for-suspect-in-fatal-hit-and-run-on-major-deegan-expressway-nypd-says>they were looking for a man who ran away after crashing his car</a>. No one has been charged. Five more people, including pedestrians, landed in the hospital after a multivehicle crash in June. The driver fled. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/bronx-man-arrested-after-allegedly-fleeing-multivehicle-crash-that-injured-pedestrians/>The suspect allegedly fled the scene after the crash, which injured several pedestrians</a>.</p><p><strong>In the last 12 months, SD 33 saw 1,365 injuries, 19 serious injuries, and 1 death.</strong> The dead do not come back. The injured carry scars. The numbers do not stop. In three and a half years, 19 people have died and 4,295 have been hurt in 7,328 crashes. Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers are all in the count.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most harm.</strong> They killed 5, seriously hurt 17, and injured 718 more. Trucks and buses killed 2. Motorcycles and mopeds left 1 seriously injured and 47 more hurt. Bikes, too, are in the tally, but the weight of steel and speed does most of the killing.</p><p>The faces change. The story does not. A pedestrian is struck. A moped rider is thrown. A driver flees. The street is washed clean, but the loss stays.</p><h3 id=senator-rivera-action-and-accountability>Senator Rivera: Action and Accountability</h3><p>State Senator Gustavo Rivera has voted yes on bills to create safety zones and curb repeat speeders. He co-sponsored the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, which would force the worst offenders to install speed limiters. He also backed a bill to create a <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S1675>pedestrian safety rating system for vehicles</a>. These are steps. But the carnage continues. The laws are not yet enough.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-demand-more>The Next Step: Demand More</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every delay is a choice. Call Senator Rivera. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat offenders. Stand with the families who have lost. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
