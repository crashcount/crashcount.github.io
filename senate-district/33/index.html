This year, he <strong>co-sponsored and voted yes</strong> on the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill that would force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting devices <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>according to Open States</a>. He also backed bills to create safety zones and a pedestrian safety rating for vehicles. These are steps forward. But the blood on the street says it is not enough. The carnage continues.

The article states, “An arrest was made after Keino Campbell, 27, was shot and killed over the weekend in New York City.” The incident highlights the lethal mix of driver aggression and firearms on city streets. Road rage escalated to deadly violence, turning a routine drive into tragedy. The arrest points to a clear driver action—use of a gun following a traffic dispute.

According to the police report, the sedan's driver, a 34-year-old woman, suffered crush injuries to her shoulder, while her 33-year-old male passenger was pinned and injured in the back. Both were conscious but sustained serious injuries. The report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor for both the driver and the passenger. The sedan's left front bumper struck the right side doors of the box truck, which sustained no damage. The box truck was starting from parking, while the sedan was going straight ahead. The focus remains on driver distraction as the systemic danger leading to this violent crash.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bus crashed into the wall, breaking through and leaving debris below. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz said, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." No injuries were reported, but the crash caused structural damage. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz noted, "That’s a very big bus, so even going very slowly, it can do a lot of damage," highlighting the risk of lax parking enforcement. The incident underscores systemic issues: double-parking and weak infrastructure can combine to threaten lives, even when no one is hurt.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
