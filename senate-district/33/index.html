The city’s danger pulsed in the silence.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, an 18-year-old unlicensed male was driving a moped southbound on E 204 St near E Mosholu Pkwy S when he struck the rear of a station wagon/SUV. The report states the moped was traveling at 'Unsafe Speed.' The teen’s head hit the vehicle, causing bleeding and crush injuries, but he remained conscious. The SUV’s right rear bumper cracked from the impact. The police report explicitly cites 'Unsafe Speed' as a contributing factor, and notes the moped driver was unlicensed at the time of the crash. No contributing factors are attributed to the SUV driver. The focus remains on the systemic danger of unlicensed, speeding drivers on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bus crashed into the wall, leaving it hanging over the edge. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz said, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." No injuries were reported, but the crash caused structural damage and scattered debris below. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz noted, "It speaks to the importance of enforcing our parking rules because it was going around a double-parked car."
