Streetsblog NYC reports: 'renewing calls from advocates for the city to redesign the dangerous street.' Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez, State Sen. Julia Salazar, and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher back the push. Advocates want a protected bike lane, mid-block crossings, and safer loading zones. Despite meetings and official letters, the city has not acted. The safety analyst notes: advocacy alone brings no immediate safety change, but it could spark future improvements.

The article states, "The redesign was initially intended to improve safety for cyclists, but recent incidents have prompted city officials to revert to the previous layout." The protected lane, meant to shield riders, instead saw collisions increase. The city’s decision highlights the risks of poorly executed street changes and the urgent need for designs that truly protect vulnerable road users. No driver actions are detailed, but the policy shift underscores ongoing systemic failures in street safety planning.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
