A truck turns. He does not make it home. In the last twelve months, <strong>nine people have died</strong> on the streets of Senate District 18. <strong>Thirty-one more suffered serious injuries</strong>—bones broken, lives changed, futures stolen. The dead include a child, elders, and working men and women. The numbers are not just numbers. They are families left waiting for a door that will never open.</p><p>Last month, a garbage truck turned and struck a moped rider in Brooklyn. The rider died at Elmhurst Hospital. The truck was not even city property yet—just another machine too big, too fast, too close. &ldquo;Both vehicles were traveling westbound&mldr; when the garbage truck driver plowed into the moped rider while trying to turn,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/13/garbage-truck-mta-bus-oil-truck-accidents-claim-lives-nyc/>reported the NY Daily News</a>. No arrest. No change. Just another name on the list.</p><h3 id=broken-promises-broken-bodies>Broken Promises, Broken Bodies</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do the most harm.</strong> In three years, they killed or injured over 600 people walking or biking here. SUVs, sedans, vans, and trucks account for the bulk of the blood. Motorcycles and mopeds add to the toll. Even bikes, when the street is chaos, can hurt. But the pattern is clear: the bigger the vehicle, the greater the danger.</p><p>On Bedford Avenue, the city tried to fix a bike lane. The redesign failed. Crashes rose. Now, officials are reverting to the old layout. &ldquo;The redesign was initially intended to improve safety for cyclists, but recent incidents have prompted city officials to revert to the previous layout,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/brooklyns-bedford-avenue-bike-lane-returning-to-original-design-after-crashes/>reported CBS New York</a>. The lesson: half-measures and quick fixes do not save lives. Only real protection does.</p><h3 id=senator-salazar-action-and-the-road-ahead>Senator Salazar: Action and the Road Ahead</h3><p>State Senator Julia Salazar has backed bills for safer streets. She voted yes on a law to require <strong>complete street design</strong>—roads built for people, not just cars. She co-sponsored a bill for <strong>automated bike lane enforcement</strong>, targeting drivers who block and endanger cyclists. She also supports a <strong>fare-free bus pilot</strong> to give people safer, cheaper ways to move. But the deaths keep coming. The work is not done.</p><p><strong>Every day without change is another day of loss.</strong></p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-relentless-safety>Call to Action: Demand Relentless Safety</h3><p>Call Senator Salazar. Call your council member. Tell them: <strong>No more delays. No more broken promises. Build streets that protect the living.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another siren in the night. Demand action now.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Department of Transportation will ban cars on Scott Avenue between Flushing and Johnson and remove parking at several corners to improve visibility, a process called daylighting.

The intersection saw 39 crashes from 2020 to 2024. The redesign includes a pedestrian plaza, narrowed roadways, and a ban on right turns onto Scott Avenue. These changes follow advocacy from Haussmann’s family and local lawmakers, highlighting systemic danger and the need for proactive street design.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The 29-year-old male driver, the sole occupant, suffered severe facial bleeding and was found conscious inside the crumpled Hyundai. The police report cites 'Alcohol Involvement' as the primary contributing factor to the crash. The narrative describes the Hyundai as having 'plowed into three parked cars,' with the scene marked by 'the night smelled of alcohol and steel.' The impact crushed the Hyundai's roof and damaged the rear ends of the parked vehicles. No pedestrians, cyclists, or other vehicle occupants were reported injured. The report places the responsibility for the crash on the driver's alcohol use, with no mention of any contributing behavior by others.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

According to the police report, 'Both drivers ran the light.' The moped's rear was torn in the crash, and the rider was thrown from his seat, remaining conscious but badly injured. The report lists 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as the primary contributing factor for both vehicles involved. The moped operator was unlicensed, but the data centers driver actions: both failed to obey traffic signals, creating lethal conditions for all road users. The police report describes the aftermath in stark terms: 'Blood ran from deep cuts across his face.' No mention is made of victim behavior as a contributing factor. The crash underscores the systemic danger when drivers ignore traffic controls at busy Brooklyn intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Seabrook had been out on bail for a previous crash involving police. On January 8, 2024, he crashed into a Toyota, killing Hayden Wallace and injuring three others. Seabrook fled the scene, abandoning his vehicle. The article notes, "All accidents are useless but this one was even more useless because [Seabrook] had so many other offenses." Seabrook faces 23 charges, including manslaughter, leaving the scene, unlicensed driving, and speeding. The case highlights repeated driver offenses and questions about bail and enforcement. Police needed over a year to arrest Seabrook, who had a history of fleeing crashes and driving without a license.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A man in his 20s, crouched in the street to pick up food, was struck and killed by a turning dump truck just before 4 a.m. at Withers Street and Woodpoint Road. The NYPD stated, “The driver, a 49-year-old man, left the scene.” No arrests have been made. The NYPD’s Collision Investigation Squad is investigating. The article notes this was one of several deadly crashes in Brooklyn that week, highlighting ongoing risks for pedestrians and the persistent issue of hit-and-runs. At least 10 people have died in Brooklyn traffic crashes so far this year, matching last year’s pace.
