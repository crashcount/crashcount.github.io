Thirty-two seriously injured.</strong> In the past year, Senate District 18 has seen 2,775 crashes. These are not just numbers—they are neighbors, children, elders. A 26-year-old cyclist killed on Evergreen Avenue. A pedestrian crushed by a dump truck on Withers Street. A toddler struck by an e-bike on Bedford Avenue, rushed to Bellevue with internal injuries. The cyclist died. The child survived. The street stayed the same.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p><strong>&ldquo;Broken ankle, broken humorous, bunch of fractures in my skull.&rdquo;</strong> That’s how Ruari Fay-Handebeaux described his injuries after a hit-and-run in Bushwick. He was thrown ten feet by a car and left in the intersection. His friend said he &ldquo;gets absolutely launched, maybe 10 to 15 feet right into the middle of the intersection, and just left there,&rdquo; as reported by <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-hit-run-32-year-old-man-struck-car-bushwick-shares-survival-story/16486736/>ABC7</a>. The driver fled.

She co-sponsored <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S5008>S 5008</a>, calling for automated bike lane enforcement. She joined calls for concrete barriers on Grand Street and supported rebates for e-bike access. But the deaths keep coming. The bills are not enough until the streets change. <strong>Every delay is another body on the pavement.</strong></p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>The crisis is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Senator Salazar. Call your council member. Demand hardened bike lanes, lower speed limits, and real enforcement. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The city rejected Lyft’s plan to add speedometers, demanding immediate compliance. Deputy Mayor Mastro wrote, 'We have requested that you immediately implement this new 15 mph speed limit for Citi Bike e-bikes, and you declined to do so.' Citi Bike agreed to the mandate, though previously voiced concerns. In 2021, e-bike injuries (1,170) and deaths (9) far outpaced those on pedal bikes (236 injuries, 2 deaths). The order follows a crash where a 3-year-old was struck by an e-bike in South Williamsburg. The city will collect public comments before finalizing the rule. The move highlights rising e-bike use and the city’s struggle to manage micromobility safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
