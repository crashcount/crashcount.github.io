Thirty-five left with life-changing wounds.</strong> In the last year alone, the streets of Senate District 18 have not let up. A child crushed by a turning truck at Withers and Woodpoint. A man struck down crossing Wyckoff and DeKalb. A motorcyclist killed on Jackie Robinson Parkway. The numbers are not just numbers. They are families torn open, futures erased.</p><p><strong>Crashes keep coming.</strong> In just twelve months: 1,576 people hurt, 35 seriously. The dead span every age. The young, the old, the ones just trying to cross the street. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data tracks the toll</a>. The city keeps moving.</p><h3 id=the-policy-fight-who-gets-protected>The Policy Fight: Who Gets Protected?</h3><p><strong>The battle for safe streets is not over.</strong> On Bedford Avenue, the city tried to rip out a protected bike lane. Cyclists and advocates fought back. The city claimed it was about safety for children. But the numbers showed the lane made the street safer for everyone. &ldquo;This whole situation is extremely frustrating, because it&rsquo;s very clear that this is more about the mayor placating the South Williamsburg voting block than it is about trying to advance smart policy and keep people safe,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/15/new-yorkers-threaten-legal-action-if-eric-adams-makes-bedford-av-less-safe-for-cyclists>said Alex Morano of Transportation Alternatives</a>.</p><p>A judge stepped in. The bulldozers waited. &ldquo;The Adams administration is going to have to spend their night preparing their legal case, not ripping out a critical safety project and central Brooklyn&rsquo;s only protected bike lane,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/judge-derails-nyc-plan-to-move-bedford-ave-bike-lane-in-brooklyn-at-eleventh-hour/>said Ben Furnas</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-what-has-senator-salazar-done>Leadership: What Has Senator Salazar Done?</h3><p><strong>Senator Julia Salazar has voted for change.</strong> She co-sponsored and voted yes on the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, which would force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed limiters. She backed bills for <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S3304>bike lane enforcement</a>, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/08/23/we-never-gave-hochul-the-power-to-pause-congestion-pricing-legislators-say>congestion pricing</a>, and <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/dot-barriers-grand-street-bike-lane/>real barriers on Grand Street</a>. She has not been silent. But the blood on the street says more is needed.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-no-more-waiting>The Next Step: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day we wait, another name is lost.</strong> Call Senator Salazar. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real barriers, not plastic. Demand action, not words. The city will not save you unless you force its hand.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The city planned to move cyclists next to car traffic, but the court granted an emergency restraining order after advocates appealed. Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives called the lane a 'critical safety project.' City Hall insists the reconfiguration is legal and claims the appeal delays 'easing the safety concerns plaguing Williamsburg parents.' The protected lane, installed in October 2024, separates cyclists from moving vehicles. The ruling highlights ongoing policy battles over street design and cyclist safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The victims, a man and a woman, "couldn't even see [the string] until it was too late." The man required hospitalization; the woman was also hurt. The article highlights the hidden danger posed by objects left or strung across public walkways. No mention is made of driver involvement, but the incident underscores the need for better oversight of bridge safety and the removal of hazardous obstacles. The report does not specify how the string came to be there, focusing instead on the sudden, severe impact on those passing through.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation will ban cars on Scott Avenue between Flushing and Johnson and remove parking at several corners to improve visibility, a process called daylighting. The article notes, 'Drivers struggle to see oncoming traffic on Scott Avenue at Jefferson Street and at Flushing Avenue, due to parking blocking sight lines and the angle of the street.' The intersection saw 39 crashes from 2020 to 2024. The redesign includes a pedestrian plaza, narrowed roadways, and a ban on right turns onto Scott Avenue. These changes follow advocacy from Haussmann’s family and local lawmakers, highlighting systemic danger and the need for proactive street design.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
