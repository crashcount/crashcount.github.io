Thirty-five seriously injured. In the last year alone, the streets of Senate District 18—Williamsburg, Bushwick, Cypress Hills—have not let up. The dead include a child crushed by a dump truck while crossing with the signal. A 59-year-old man, crossing Wyckoff and DeKalb, killed by a van turning right, the driver failing to yield. These are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors.</p><p>Just last month, a driver on Lincoln Avenue in Cypress Hills crashed, then pulled a metal object and beat a man in the street. The victim was rushed to the hospital. The assailant fled. The city released a video, asking for help. The violence did not end with the crash. <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/brooklyn-assault-car-crash-07122025/>&ldquo;Things quickly turned violent,&rdquo; police said.</a></p><h3 id=broken-promises-unfinished-protection>Broken Promises, Unfinished Protection</h3><p>The Meeker Avenue bike lane remains unfinished. Eleven people killed or severely injured on that stretch from 2014 to 2020. The lane is still not on the city bike map. DOT says it is not safe enough to use. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/18/eyes-on-the-street-meeker-avenue-bike-lane-is-a-failure>&ldquo;They don’t consider it complete enough or safe enough to tell people to use it,&rdquo;</a> said a local. Trash piles up. Trucks block the way. Cyclists dodge cars and debris. The city knows this. It does nothing.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-words-and-the-work-left>Leadership: Votes, Words, and the Work Left</h3><p>State Senator Julia Salazar has <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>co-sponsored and voted for bills to curb repeat speeders</a> and expand safety zones. She backed the <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/dot-barriers-grand-street-bike-lane/>push for concrete barriers on Grand Street</a> and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/08/30/ny-lawmakers-want-to-bring-e-bikes-to-the-people>supported e-bike access for working New Yorkers</a>. She <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/08/23/we-never-gave-hochul-the-power-to-pause-congestion-pricing-legislators-say>joined a legal fight to keep congestion pricing on track</a>. These are steps. But the blood on the street says it is not enough. The <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/judge-derails-nyc-plan-to-move-bedford-ave-bike-lane-in-brooklyn-at-eleventh-hour/>protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue was nearly ripped out</a>—only a court order stopped it. The city still talks about &ldquo;balancing concerns.&rdquo; The dead do not balance.</p><h3 id=the-call-demand-more-demand-it-now>The Call: Demand More, Demand It Now</h3><p>Every day of delay is another family broken. Call Senator Salazar. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for every bike lane. Demand that repeat speeders are stopped before they kill. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

A child was hit weeks before. Injuries on e-bikes outnumber pedal bikes. Officials call it an emergency. The rule moves fast. Riders and workers face new limits.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist reported on June 5, 2025, that Mayor Adams ordered Citi Bike to limit e-bike speeds to 15 mph, citing an 'emergency threat to life and property.' The city rejected Lyft’s plan to add speedometers, demanding immediate compliance. Deputy Mayor Mastro wrote, 'We have requested that you immediately implement this new 15 mph speed limit for Citi Bike e-bikes, and you declined to do so.' Citi Bike agreed to the mandate, though previously voiced concerns. In 2021, e-bike injuries (1,170) and deaths (9) far outpaced those on pedal bikes (236 injuries, 2 deaths). The order follows a crash where a 3-year-old was struck by an e-bike in South Williamsburg. The city will collect public comments before finalizing the rule. The move highlights rising e-bike use and the city’s struggle to manage micromobility safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The impact downed the pole, which triggered another crash on the opposite side of the expressway. As the article notes, 'A truck had downed a pole, triggering another crash on the opposite side of the expressway.' One person was injured and taken to Woodhull Hospital. The sequence of collisions highlights the dangers of high-speed, multi-lane expressways and the risks posed by large vehicles losing control.
