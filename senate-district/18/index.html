Streetsblog NYC reports: 'renewing calls from advocates for the city to redesign the dangerous street.' Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez, State Sen. Julia Salazar, and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher back the push. Advocates want a protected bike lane, mid-block crossings, and safer loading zones. Despite meetings and official letters, the city has not acted. The safety analyst notes: advocacy alone brings no immediate safety change, but it could spark future improvements.

Sponsored by Senator Andrew Gounardes, the bill passed Senate votes on June 12 and June 13, and cleared the Assembly on June 17. The measure extends and corrects school speed zone laws in New York City, repealing outdated provisions. Gounardes led the push, with strong support from most Senate Democrats and a split Assembly. The bill's technical fixes aim to keep protections in place for children and other vulnerable road users near schools.
