The impact was severe: a 32-year-old man riding unbelted in the sedan’s right rear seat was ejected from the vehicle and landed in the street, where he died. The police report explicitly lists 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as a contributing factor, indicating the bus driver failed to obey a traffic signal or sign. The report does not cite any contributing actions by the victim. The crash occurred at 21:46, with the bus’s left front bumper colliding with the sedan’s right side doors. The focus remains on the bus driver's disregard for traffic control, a systemic danger that led to the loss of life.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
