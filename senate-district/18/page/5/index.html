Thirty-five left with life-changing wounds.</strong> In the last year alone, the streets of Senate District 18 have not let up. A child crushed by a turning truck at Withers and Woodpoint. A man struck down crossing Wyckoff and DeKalb. A motorcyclist killed on Jackie Robinson Parkway. The numbers are not just numbers. They are families torn open, futures erased.</p><p><strong>Crashes keep coming.</strong> In just twelve months: 1,576 people hurt, 35 seriously. The dead span every age. The young, the old, the ones just trying to cross the street. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data tracks the toll</a>. The city keeps moving.</p><h3 id=the-policy-fight-who-gets-protected>The Policy Fight: Who Gets Protected?</h3><p><strong>The battle for safe streets is not over.</strong> On Bedford Avenue, the city tried to rip out a protected bike lane. Cyclists and advocates fought back. The city claimed it was about safety for children. But the numbers showed the lane made the street safer for everyone. &ldquo;This whole situation is extremely frustrating, because it&rsquo;s very clear that this is more about the mayor placating the South Williamsburg voting block than it is about trying to advance smart policy and keep people safe,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/15/new-yorkers-threaten-legal-action-if-eric-adams-makes-bedford-av-less-safe-for-cyclists>said Alex Morano of Transportation Alternatives</a>.</p><p>A judge stepped in. The bulldozers waited. &ldquo;The Adams administration is going to have to spend their night preparing their legal case, not ripping out a critical safety project and central Brooklyn&rsquo;s only protected bike lane,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/judge-derails-nyc-plan-to-move-bedford-ave-bike-lane-in-brooklyn-at-eleventh-hour/>said Ben Furnas</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-what-has-senator-salazar-done>Leadership: What Has Senator Salazar Done?</h3><p><strong>Senator Julia Salazar has voted for change.</strong> She co-sponsored and voted yes on the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, which would force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed limiters. She backed bills for <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S3304>bike lane enforcement</a>, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/08/23/we-never-gave-hochul-the-power-to-pause-congestion-pricing-legislators-say>congestion pricing</a>, and <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/dot-barriers-grand-street-bike-lane/>real barriers on Grand Street</a>. She has not been silent. But the blood on the street says more is needed.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-no-more-waiting>The Next Step: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day we wait, another name is lost.</strong> Call Senator Salazar. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real barriers, not plastic. Demand action, not words. The city will not save you unless you force its hand.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On February 10, 2023, eighteen Brooklyn lawmakers issued a joint letter demanding New York State Department of Transportation (DOT) participate in comprehensive planning for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens.

Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint.

The measure targets drivers who block bike lanes, aiming to keep space clear for cyclists. No safety analyst note is available.

Salazar says, 'With the Ride Clean rebate, [e-bikes] really would be much more accessible to working New Yorkers.' Carroll pushes back on critics who call e-bikes a luxury, stating, 'They don’t realize that this is not a luxury item.' The program would use NYSERDA funds from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, mirroring the Drive Clean program for electric cars. Advocates cite European and U.S. models.
