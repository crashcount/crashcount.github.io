Police say a driver hit him and kept going. Detectives say the victim was dragged more than 50 feet. He died there.</p><p>Gothamist wrote, “Police were looking on Monday for the driver of a car that struck and dragged a 47-year-old man… killing him,” and noted it was “not immediately clear whether the man was walking in a crosswalk” (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/police-searching-for-information-on-bushwick-hit-and-run-that-killed-a-pedestrian>Gothamist</a>). The Daily News added: “A driver struck and killed a 47-year-old pedestrian… then left the scene,” and early reports suggested “the vehicle might have been a garbage truck” (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/cops-looking-for-driver-who-fatally-struck-man-on-brooklyn-street/>Daily News</a>).</p><p>Six days later, a pedestrian dies under a truck at Morgan Avenue and Maspeth. The city crash log marks a 46‑year‑old, crush injuries, apparent death. A box truck heading south. Going straight. Not at an intersection (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash 4833207</a>).</p><h3 id=morgan-avenue-keeps-taking>Morgan Avenue keeps taking</h3><p>Advocates have been here before. Three years. Three deaths. They asked for a protected lane, crossings, loading rules. The city met with them. The street stayed the same. “Renewing calls… to redesign the dangerous street,” wrote <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/07/three-years-three-deaths-advocates-want-dot-to-make-morgan-avenue-safe>Streetsblog NYC</a>. Electeds backed them. Nothing moved.</p><p>Trucks roll past warehouses. People walk anyway. The open‑data record shows the last kill was a pedestrian, mid‑block, crushed by a southbound box truck (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash 4833207</a>).</p><h3 id=broadway-at-suydam-hit-dragged-gone>Broadway at Suydam: hit, dragged, gone</h3><p>The Highway District’s investigators say the car was northbound. The body was found near the corner. The driver did not stop. “Police were still looking for the driver Sunday,” the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/cops-looking-for-driver-who-fatally-struck-man-on-brooklyn-street/>Daily News</a> reported.

Pedestrians take the hits. Since 2022 in this Senate district, trucks and buses have killed six pedestrians; SUVs and cars, five; vans, two; others, the rest. <strong>Twenty‑seven dead</strong> and thousands injured across all crashes in the period covered (<a href=#sources-stats>district stats</a>).</p><h3 id=a-district-drowning-in-crashes>A district drowning in crashes</h3><p>Year to date, crashes are up 21% over last year in this district. Injuries up 34%. Serious injuries up 155%. Deaths doubled (<a href=#sources-stats>district stats</a>). The city’s own numbers say pedestrians here are most often struck by SUVs and sedans, but trucks kill hard. Trucks and buses account for 6 pedestrian deaths and 91 total pedestrian injuries/events in the period tallied (<a href=#sources-stats>district stats</a>).</p><p>Names rarely make the spreadsheets. Causes read “unspecified.” Bodies read “apparent death.” The map fills anyway.</p><h3 id=the-policy-levers-sitting-on-the-desk>The policy levers sitting on the desk</h3><p>Albany moved one lever. The Senate advanced a bill to put speed limiters on repeat offenders. S4045 would require “intelligent speed assistance devices” after a pattern of violations. Senator Julia Salazar backed it in committee votes (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>).</p><p>Another lever exists now. The city can lower speeds on local streets under Sammy’s Law. That means a lower default can happen. Our site lays out the steps and contacts to push it through (<a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>).</p><p>Lower speeds. Fewer funerals.

Hanif, along with Lincoln Restler, Alexa Avilés, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Crystal Hudson, joined borough, state, and federal colleagues in this push. They propose a credit system to balance costs between DOT bridges and MTA tunnels, aiming to protect neighborhoods like the Brooklyn waterfront and the BQE corridor from traffic surges. The MTA declined comment. The Board will soon set final toll rates and rules. The federal government has approved the congestion pricing plan, with tolls for cars expected between $9 and $23.
