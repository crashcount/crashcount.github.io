A truck turns. He does not make it home. In the last twelve months, <strong>nine people have died</strong> on the streets of Senate District 18. <strong>Thirty-one more suffered serious injuries</strong>—bones broken, lives changed, futures stolen. The dead include a child, elders, and working men and women. The numbers are not just numbers. They are families left waiting for a door that will never open.</p><p>Last month, a garbage truck turned and struck a moped rider in Brooklyn. The rider died at Elmhurst Hospital. The truck was not even city property yet—just another machine too big, too fast, too close. &ldquo;Both vehicles were traveling westbound&mldr; when the garbage truck driver plowed into the moped rider while trying to turn,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/13/garbage-truck-mta-bus-oil-truck-accidents-claim-lives-nyc/>reported the NY Daily News</a>. No arrest. No change. Just another name on the list.</p><h3 id=broken-promises-broken-bodies>Broken Promises, Broken Bodies</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do the most harm.</strong> In three years, they killed or injured over 600 people walking or biking here. SUVs, sedans, vans, and trucks account for the bulk of the blood. Motorcycles and mopeds add to the toll. Even bikes, when the street is chaos, can hurt. But the pattern is clear: the bigger the vehicle, the greater the danger.</p><p>On Bedford Avenue, the city tried to fix a bike lane. The redesign failed. Crashes rose. Now, officials are reverting to the old layout. &ldquo;The redesign was initially intended to improve safety for cyclists, but recent incidents have prompted city officials to revert to the previous layout,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/brooklyns-bedford-avenue-bike-lane-returning-to-original-design-after-crashes/>reported CBS New York</a>. The lesson: half-measures and quick fixes do not save lives. Only real protection does.</p><h3 id=senator-salazar-action-and-the-road-ahead>Senator Salazar: Action and the Road Ahead</h3><p>State Senator Julia Salazar has backed bills for safer streets. She voted yes on a law to require <strong>complete street design</strong>—roads built for people, not just cars. She co-sponsored a bill for <strong>automated bike lane enforcement</strong>, targeting drivers who block and endanger cyclists. She also supports a <strong>fare-free bus pilot</strong> to give people safer, cheaper ways to move. But the deaths keep coming. The work is not done.</p><p><strong>Every day without change is another day of loss.</strong></p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-relentless-safety>Call to Action: Demand Relentless Safety</h3><p>Call Senator Salazar. Call your council member. Tell them: <strong>No more delays. No more broken promises. Build streets that protect the living.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another siren in the night. Demand action now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

They reject piecemeal fixes. They call out decades of harm. The state’s refusal leaves neighborhoods exposed. The city’s hands are tied. The highway’s danger remains. Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On February 10, 2023, eighteen Brooklyn lawmakers issued a joint letter demanding New York State Department of Transportation (DOT) participate in comprehensive planning for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens. Jabari Brisport, Julia Salazar, Kristen Gonzalez, Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Members Bobby Carroll, Maritza Davila, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Emily Gallagher, Jo Anne Simon, Marcela Mitaynes, and Council Members Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Lincoln Restler. Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint. Without state action, only city-owned segments see attention. The city’s efforts are limited. The state’s inaction leaves systemic danger unaddressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The letter, backed by Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, State Senator Julia Salazar, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, and Council Members Lincoln Restler and Jennifer Gutierrez, called for 'protective jersey barricades and measures taken at each intersection to stop cars from entering the protected bike lane.' The group condemned the current plastic delineators, noting, 'From day one, the Grand Street bike lane has failed to keep people safe.' Since 2019, 67 cyclists have been injured and 196 crashes reported. The letter urges the city to replace weak barriers, fix dangerous entrances, and finally deliver safety for vulnerable road users.

Lives at risk until real protection arrives.</p><p class=mb3>On March 3, 2022, Councilmember Lincoln Restler (District 33) joined activists to demand the Department of Transportation install concrete barriers on the Grand Street bike lane. The push follows years of crashes—67 cyclist injuries and 196 total crashes since 2019—despite so-called 'protected' lanes. The matter, titled 'Activists and electeds ask DOT to add better barriers to Grand Street bike lane,' highlights how plastic bollards fail to stop drivers from blocking lanes, forcing cyclists into traffic. Restler, along with Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, State Senator Julia Salazar, and Borough President Antonio Reynoso, signed a letter urging Mayor Adams and Commissioner Rodriguez to act. The DOT has started hardening some lanes citywide, but Grand Street remains unprotected. Activists say, 'We knew the omission of protective jersey barriers would lead to dangerous conditions back in 2019 and we have witnessed that prediction come tragically true throughout 2021.' The call is clear: real barriers, not broken promises.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
