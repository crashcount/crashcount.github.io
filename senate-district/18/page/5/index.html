Sixty-eight seriously injured.</strong> In the past three years, Senate District 18 has seen 10,597 crashes. The toll climbs: children, elders, workers. A 26-year-old cyclist was killed on Evergreen Avenue. A pedestrian was crushed by a dump truck on Withers Street. A toddler was struck by an e-bike on Bedford Avenue and rushed to Bellevue with injuries to her stomach. The cyclist died. The child survived. The street stayed the same.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p><strong>&ldquo;Broken ankle, broken humorous, bunch of fractures in my skull.&rdquo;</strong> Ruari Fay-Handebeaux described his injuries after a hit-and-run in Bushwick. He was thrown ten feet by a car and left in the intersection. His friend said, &ldquo;He gets absolutely launched, maybe 10 to 15 feet right into the middle of the intersection, and just left there,&rdquo; as reported by <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-hit-run-32-year-old-man-struck-car-bushwick-shares-survival-story/16486736/>ABC7</a>. The driver fled. The intersection remains unchanged.</p><p>A three-year-old girl stepped from a double-parked car into a bike lane. An e-bike struck her. She was knocked down and taken to the hospital. The cyclist stayed. The cars stayed. The danger stayed, as shown by <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/26/us-news/shocking-video-shows-moment-e-bike-slams-into-girl-3-in-nyc-bike-lane/>New York Post</a>.</p><h3 id=the-relentless-tally>The Relentless Tally</h3><p>The numbers crawl higher. 5,339 injuries. 1,705 of them are people aged 25 to 34. 787 are 18 to 24. 386 are children. Four elders, aged 65 to 74, are dead. The oldest, over 75, are not spared. The city counts the bodies. The city does not change the street.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-silence>Leadership: Action and Silence</h3><p><strong>Senator Julia Salazar has backed bills for safer streets.</strong> She voted yes on <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>S 9718</a>, pushing for complete street design. She co-sponsored <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S5008>S 5008</a>, calling for automated bike lane enforcement. She joined calls for concrete barriers on Grand Street and supported rebates for e-bike access. But the deaths keep coming. The bills are not enough until the streets change. <strong>Every delay is another body on the pavement.</strong></p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>The crisis is not fate.

The matter, titled 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass...S.315/A.1416, which would authorize New York City to set a five mile per hour speed limit on streets participating in the Open Streets program,' was sponsored by Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary), Farah N. Louis, Lincoln Restler, Amanda Farías, Julie Won, Carlina Rivera, and Crystal Hudson. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. The measure aimed to protect pedestrians and cyclists by slowing traffic where people gather.

The city must act before more lives are lost.</p><p class=mb3>On March 4, 2022, North Brooklyn officials and activists sent a letter to the Department of Transportation demanding a true protected bike lane on Grand Street. The letter, backed by Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, State Senator Julia Salazar, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, and Council Members Lincoln Restler and Jennifer Gutierrez, called for 'protective jersey barricades and measures taken at each intersection to stop cars from entering the protected bike lane.' The group condemned the current plastic delineators, noting, 'From day one, the Grand Street bike lane has failed to keep people safe.' Since 2019, 67 cyclists have been injured and 196 crashes reported. The letter urges the city to replace weak barriers, fix dangerous entrances, and finally deliver safety for vulnerable road users. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and Mayor Adams are now under pressure to act.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Plastic bollards fail. Drivers block lanes. Restler and activists push for concrete barriers. Seventy injuries since 2019. DOT delays. Riders wait. Danger remains. Lives at risk until real protection arrives.</p><p class=mb3>On March 3, 2022, Councilmember Lincoln Restler (District 33) joined activists to demand the Department of Transportation install concrete barriers on the Grand Street bike lane. The push follows years of crashes—67 cyclist injuries and 196 total crashes since 2019—despite so-called 'protected' lanes. The matter, titled 'Activists and electeds ask DOT to add better barriers to Grand Street bike lane,' highlights how plastic bollards fail to stop drivers from blocking lanes, forcing cyclists into traffic. Restler, along with Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, State Senator Julia Salazar, and Borough President Antonio Reynoso, signed a letter urging Mayor Adams and Commissioner Rodriguez to act. The DOT has started hardening some lanes citywide, but Grand Street remains unprotected. Activists say, 'We knew the omission of protective jersey barriers would lead to dangerous conditions back in 2019 and we have witnessed that prediction come tragically true throughout 2021.' The call is clear: real barriers, not broken promises.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The effort is described as 'an unprecedented effort to collect detailed data on bicycle transportation across the state.' The survey asks about riding frequency, infrastructure, barriers, and connections to transit. Assembly Member Robert Carroll and State Senator Julia Salazar have backed related legislation for an e-bike rebate program. The survey’s results will be shared with governments and advocacy groups. Officials say the data will help planners and policymakers 'invest in safer, more equitable multimodal streets.'
