A truck turns. He does not make it home. In Senate District 18, <strong>20 people have died</strong> on the streets since 2022. <strong>Seventy more suffered serious injuries</strong>—bodies broken, lives changed forever. In the last year alone, three deaths, thirteen left with wounds that will not heal. The youngest lost was a child. The oldest, someone’s grandmother. <strong>Cars and trucks did most of the killing</strong>—SUVs, vans, dump trucks, box trucks. Each crash leaves behind a pair of shoes, a pool of blood, a family waiting for a call that never comes.</p><h3 id=broken-promises-slow-progress>Broken Promises, Slow Progress</h3><p>The city paints bike lanes. Drivers park in them. Cyclists swerve into traffic and die. On Grand Street, the so-called protected lane is a joke. Plastic sticks do not stop a two-ton car. Advocates and electeds, including Julia Salazar, <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/dot-barriers-grand-street-bike-lane/>demanded real barriers</a>. <em>&ldquo;We knew the omission of protective jersey barriers would lead to dangerous conditions back in 2019 and we have witnessed that prediction come tragically true throughout 2021&rdquo;</em> <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/dot-barriers-grand-street-bike-lane/>said local activists and officials</a>. Still, the city drags its feet. The carnage continues.</p><h3 id=what-has-julia-salazar-done>What Has Julia Salazar Done?</h3><p><strong>Salazar has backed bills for safer streets.</strong> She voted yes on a law to force &ldquo;complete street design&rdquo;—redesigning roads for people, not just cars (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>see bill S 9718</a>). She co-sponsored a bill for automated bike lane enforcement, to keep drivers out of the lanes meant for cyclists (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S5008>see S 5008</a>). She signed on for fare-free buses, a move that could shift more people out of cars (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4421>see S 4421</a>). But the deaths keep coming. The bills are not yet law. The barriers are not yet built. The blood is still on the street.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-demand-more-demand-now>The Next Step: Demand More, Demand Now</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay is another body. Call Julia Salazar. Call the Mayor. Call DOT. Demand real barriers, lower speed limits, and enforcement that protects people, not just paint on pavement. <strong>Do not wait for another child’s shoes to be left in the road.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Hanif led as primary sponsor, joined by Amanda Farías, Crystal Hudson, Julie Won, and Carlina Rivera. The committee approved the resolution with strong support. The bill targets streets where pedestrians and cyclists mix with traffic. Lower speeds mean fewer crashes and less severe injuries.
