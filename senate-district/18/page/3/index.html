A driver struck him and kept going. Police found him dead in the street. The car did not stop. Early reports point to a garbage truck. The driver is still out there. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/cops-looking-for-driver-who-fatally-struck-man-on-brooklyn-street/>&ldquo;A driver struck and killed a 47-year-old pedestrian&mldr; then left the scene,&rdquo; police said.</a></p><p>This is not rare. In the last twelve months, SD 18 saw 12 deaths and 39 serious injuries on its streets. Over 1,800 people hurt. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. They are gone.</p><h2 id=streets-built-for-speed-not-safety>Streets Built for Speed, Not Safety</h2><p>Large vehicles kill. Trucks and SUVs are overrepresented in the blood tally. In this district since 2022, trucks and buses killed 5, cars and SUVs killed 4, motorcycles and mopeds killed 0, and bikes killed 0. The bodies pile up at intersections, crosswalks, and corners where the city promises protection but delivers paint.</p><p>The Bedford Avenue bike lane was meant to shield cyclists. It failed. After a string of crashes, the city is reverting to the old design. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/brooklyns-bedford-avenue-bike-lane-returning-to-original-design-after-crashes/>&ldquo;The redesign was initially intended to improve safety for cyclists, but recent incidents have prompted city officials to revert to the previous layout.&rdquo;</a></p><h2 id=senator-salazar-action-and-gaps>Senator Salazar: Action and Gaps</h2><p>State Senator Julia Salazar has backed bills to curb repeat speeders and expand school speed zones. She voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force the worst offenders to install speed limiters. She co-sponsored bills for safer bus service, congestion pricing, and protected bike lanes. She signed letters demanding real barriers on Grand Street, not plastic posts. But the carnage continues. The laws crawl. The deaths do not wait.</p><h2 id=the-call-demand-more-demand-now>The Call: Demand More, Demand Now</h2><p>Every day of delay is another family broken. Call Senator Salazar. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real barriers, not promises. Join <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Join <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a>. Do not wait for another body in the crosswalk.

The vehicle's bumper struck the head of a 26-year-old woman who was standing off the roadway. The report notes she suffered severe bleeding and shock, with the point of impact listed as the center back end of the sedan. Police cite 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Backing Unsafely' as contributing factors. The woman was not in the roadway and was not crossing at an intersection at the time of the crash. The report makes no mention of any pedestrian error or behavior contributing to the collision. The driver’s actions—specifically inattention and unsafe backing—are the only factors cited in the police account.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Both vehicles were fleeing police at the time of the crash. The report lists 'Unsafe Speed' as a contributing factor. The e-bike rider, a 31-year-old man, suffered severe neck lacerations and was conscious at the scene. The police narrative describes a violent impact: 'The e-bike rider, 31, strikes hard. No helmet. Neck torn. Blood pools. Doors crumple. Sirens wail.' The sedan sustained damage to its right side doors, while the e-bike impacted the left front bumper. The focus remains on the excessive speed and the peril of high-velocity chases, as detailed in the official account.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On August 23, 2024, a group of New York State legislators—Assembly Members Phil Steck and Andrew Hevesi, State Senator Julia Salazar, and former Assembly Member Dick Gottfried—filed a legal brief against Governor Hochul’s decision to pause congestion pricing. The matter, as described: “the legislature never gave her or any governor the power to do away with the traffic toll.” The brief cites the 2019 Traffic Mobility Act, arguing only the Traffic Mobility Review Board and the MTA can make such decisions. The lawmakers warn that letting the governor override the MTA would “make impossibly opaque the actual responsibility for MTA decisions.” Their action supports the MTA Board’s independence and opposes executive interference. No safety analyst has assessed the direct impact on vulnerable road users, but the legislators’ stance highlights the risk of political meddling in life-and-death street policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The 29-year-old motorcycle rider, who was wearing a helmet, was crushed and partially ejected from his bike. He died at the scene from severe injuries to his entire body. The police report cites 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as a contributing factor, drawing attention to the failure of at least one driver to obey traffic signals or signs. Both vehicles were reported as going straight ahead at the time of impact. The truck's left front quarter panel was struck, and the motorcycle overturned. The report makes no mention of any victim error or behavior contributing to the crash. The violence of the impact and the disregard for traffic control proved fatal.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The impact was severe: 'A Jeep slammed into a northbound moped. The 65-year-old rider flew from the seat, struck the pavement headfirst. Blood pooled in the street. The SUV’s front end folded.

The police report notes the SUV driver was unlicensed, with a license from Georgia that was not valid in New York. No driver errors beyond 'unspecified' are listed, but the unlicensed status is a critical systemic failure. Helmet use is mentioned only to note its absence, after the primary driver error. The crash underscores the lethal consequences when unlicensed drivers operate vehicles on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
