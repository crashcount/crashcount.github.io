The Daily News added: “A driver struck and killed a 47-year-old pedestrian… then left the scene,” and early reports suggested “the vehicle might have been a garbage truck” (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/cops-looking-for-driver-who-fatally-struck-man-on-brooklyn-street/>Daily News</a>).</p><p>Six days later, a pedestrian dies under a truck at Morgan Avenue and Maspeth.
