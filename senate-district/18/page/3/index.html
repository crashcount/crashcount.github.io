A truck turns. He does not make it home. In the last twelve months, <strong>nine people have died</strong> on the streets of Senate District 18. <strong>Thirty-one more suffered serious injuries</strong>—bones broken, lives changed, futures stolen. The dead include a child, elders, and working men and women. The numbers are not just numbers. They are families left waiting for a door that will never open.</p><p>Last month, a garbage truck turned and struck a moped rider in Brooklyn. The rider died at Elmhurst Hospital. The truck was not even city property yet—just another machine too big, too fast, too close. &ldquo;Both vehicles were traveling westbound&mldr; when the garbage truck driver plowed into the moped rider while trying to turn,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/13/garbage-truck-mta-bus-oil-truck-accidents-claim-lives-nyc/>reported the NY Daily News</a>. No arrest. No change. Just another name on the list.</p><h3 id=broken-promises-broken-bodies>Broken Promises, Broken Bodies</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do the most harm.</strong> In three years, they killed or injured over 600 people walking or biking here. SUVs, sedans, vans, and trucks account for the bulk of the blood. Motorcycles and mopeds add to the toll. Even bikes, when the street is chaos, can hurt. But the pattern is clear: the bigger the vehicle, the greater the danger.</p><p>On Bedford Avenue, the city tried to fix a bike lane. The redesign failed. Crashes rose. Now, officials are reverting to the old layout. &ldquo;The redesign was initially intended to improve safety for cyclists, but recent incidents have prompted city officials to revert to the previous layout,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/brooklyns-bedford-avenue-bike-lane-returning-to-original-design-after-crashes/>reported CBS New York</a>. The lesson: half-measures and quick fixes do not save lives. Only real protection does.</p><h3 id=senator-salazar-action-and-the-road-ahead>Senator Salazar: Action and the Road Ahead</h3><p>State Senator Julia Salazar has backed bills for safer streets. She voted yes on a law to require <strong>complete street design</strong>—roads built for people, not just cars. She co-sponsored a bill for <strong>automated bike lane enforcement</strong>, targeting drivers who block and endanger cyclists. She also supports a <strong>fare-free bus pilot</strong> to give people safer, cheaper ways to move. But the deaths keep coming. The work is not done.</p><p><strong>Every day without change is another day of loss.</strong></p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-relentless-safety>Call to Action: Demand Relentless Safety</h3><p>Call Senator Salazar. Call your council member. Tell them: <strong>No more delays. No more broken promises. Build streets that protect the living.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another siren in the night. Demand action now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The impact occurred at the center back end of the taxi and the center front end of the sedan, crumpling metal severely. A 25-year-old woman, seated in the left rear passenger seat of the taxi and wearing a lap belt, sustained crushing injuries to her entire body and remained still, held by shock.
