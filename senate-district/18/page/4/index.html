A truck turns. He does not make it home. In the last twelve months, <strong>nine people have died</strong> on the streets of Senate District 18. <strong>Thirty-one more suffered serious injuries</strong>—bones broken, lives changed, futures stolen. The dead include a child, elders, and working men and women. The numbers are not just numbers. They are families left waiting for a door that will never open.</p><p>Last month, a garbage truck turned and struck a moped rider in Brooklyn. The rider died at Elmhurst Hospital. The truck was not even city property yet—just another machine too big, too fast, too close. &ldquo;Both vehicles were traveling westbound&mldr; when the garbage truck driver plowed into the moped rider while trying to turn,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/13/garbage-truck-mta-bus-oil-truck-accidents-claim-lives-nyc/>reported the NY Daily News</a>. No arrest. No change. Just another name on the list.</p><h3 id=broken-promises-broken-bodies>Broken Promises, Broken Bodies</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do the most harm.</strong> In three years, they killed or injured over 600 people walking or biking here. SUVs, sedans, vans, and trucks account for the bulk of the blood. Motorcycles and mopeds add to the toll. Even bikes, when the street is chaos, can hurt. But the pattern is clear: the bigger the vehicle, the greater the danger.</p><p>On Bedford Avenue, the city tried to fix a bike lane. The redesign failed. Crashes rose. Now, officials are reverting to the old layout. &ldquo;The redesign was initially intended to improve safety for cyclists, but recent incidents have prompted city officials to revert to the previous layout,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/brooklyns-bedford-avenue-bike-lane-returning-to-original-design-after-crashes/>reported CBS New York</a>. The lesson: half-measures and quick fixes do not save lives. Only real protection does.</p><h3 id=senator-salazar-action-and-the-road-ahead>Senator Salazar: Action and the Road Ahead</h3><p>State Senator Julia Salazar has backed bills for safer streets. She voted yes on a law to require <strong>complete street design</strong>—roads built for people, not just cars. She co-sponsored a bill for <strong>automated bike lane enforcement</strong>, targeting drivers who block and endanger cyclists. She also supports a <strong>fare-free bus pilot</strong> to give people safer, cheaper ways to move. But the deaths keep coming. The work is not done.</p><p><strong>Every day without change is another day of loss.</strong></p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-relentless-safety>Call to Action: Demand Relentless Safety</h3><p>Call Senator Salazar. Call your council member. Tell them: <strong>No more delays. No more broken promises. Build streets that protect the living.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another siren in the night. Demand action now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Hanif, along with Lincoln Restler, Alexa Avilés, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Crystal Hudson, joined borough, state, and federal colleagues in this push.

The MTA declined comment. The Board will soon set final toll rates and rules. The federal government has approved the congestion pricing plan, with tolls for cars expected between $9 and $23.

Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi claimed some locals want three lanes each way, but 17 elected officials, including State Sen. Julia Salazar, Sen. Andrew Gounardes, Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, and Council Member Lincoln Restler, publicly rejected the idea. Salazar said, 'no to three lanes. Two lanes at most.' Gounardes confirmed, 'all support a two-lane highway.' Gallagher wrote, '2 lanes if any.' Restler called City Hall’s statements 'plainly inaccurate.' The Department of Transportation delayed environmental review to study both options. Advocates and officials urge investment in mass transit, not highway expansion. Vulnerable road users remain at risk as the city weighs more lanes for cars and trucks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
