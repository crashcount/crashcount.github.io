Thirty-five seriously injured. In the last year alone, the streets of Senate District 18—Williamsburg, Bushwick, Cypress Hills—have not let up. The dead include a child crushed by a dump truck while crossing with the signal. A 59-year-old man, crossing Wyckoff and DeKalb, killed by a van turning right, the driver failing to yield. These are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors.</p><p>Just last month, a driver on Lincoln Avenue in Cypress Hills crashed, then pulled a metal object and beat a man in the street. The victim was rushed to the hospital. The assailant fled. The city released a video, asking for help. The violence did not end with the crash. <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/brooklyn-assault-car-crash-07122025/>&ldquo;Things quickly turned violent,&rdquo; police said.</a></p><h3 id=broken-promises-unfinished-protection>Broken Promises, Unfinished Protection</h3><p>The Meeker Avenue bike lane remains unfinished. Eleven people killed or severely injured on that stretch from 2014 to 2020. The lane is still not on the city bike map. DOT says it is not safe enough to use. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/18/eyes-on-the-street-meeker-avenue-bike-lane-is-a-failure>&ldquo;They don’t consider it complete enough or safe enough to tell people to use it,&rdquo;</a> said a local. Trash piles up. Trucks block the way. Cyclists dodge cars and debris. The city knows this. It does nothing.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-words-and-the-work-left>Leadership: Votes, Words, and the Work Left</h3><p>State Senator Julia Salazar has <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>co-sponsored and voted for bills to curb repeat speeders</a> and expand safety zones. She backed the <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/dot-barriers-grand-street-bike-lane/>push for concrete barriers on Grand Street</a> and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/08/30/ny-lawmakers-want-to-bring-e-bikes-to-the-people>supported e-bike access for working New Yorkers</a>. She <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/08/23/we-never-gave-hochul-the-power-to-pause-congestion-pricing-legislators-say>joined a legal fight to keep congestion pricing on track</a>. These are steps. But the blood on the street says it is not enough. The <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/judge-derails-nyc-plan-to-move-bedford-ave-bike-lane-in-brooklyn-at-eleventh-hour/>protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue was nearly ripped out</a>—only a court order stopped it. The city still talks about &ldquo;balancing concerns.&rdquo; The dead do not balance.</p><h3 id=the-call-demand-more-demand-it-now>The Call: Demand More, Demand It Now</h3><p>Every day of delay is another family broken. Call Senator Salazar. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for every bike lane. Demand that repeat speeders are stopped before they kill. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Gutiérrez, joined by U.S. Rep. Nydia Velázquez, Assembly Members Maritz Davila and Emily Gallagher, and State Senator Julia Salazar, urged a full investigation and demanded urgent infrastructure upgrades. Gutiérrez said, 'We remain committed to enhancing public safety and ensuring that the nightlife community operates and maintains responsible practices.'

Hanif, along with Lincoln Restler, Alexa Avilés, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Crystal Hudson, joined borough, state, and federal colleagues in this push. They propose a credit system to balance costs between DOT bridges and MTA tunnels, aiming to protect neighborhoods like the Brooklyn waterfront and the BQE corridor from traffic surges. The MTA declined comment. The Board will soon set final toll rates and rules. The federal government has approved the congestion pricing plan, with tolls for cars expected between $9 and $23. Over 100 exemption requests, including from taxi and for-hire vehicle drivers, are under review.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
