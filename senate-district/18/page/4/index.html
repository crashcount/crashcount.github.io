Thirty-five left with life-changing wounds.</strong> In the last year alone, the streets of Senate District 18 have not let up. A child crushed by a turning truck at Withers and Woodpoint. A man struck down crossing Wyckoff and DeKalb. A motorcyclist killed on Jackie Robinson Parkway. The numbers are not just numbers. They are families torn open, futures erased.</p><p><strong>Crashes keep coming.</strong> In just twelve months: 1,576 people hurt, 35 seriously. The dead span every age. The young, the old, the ones just trying to cross the street. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data tracks the toll</a>. The city keeps moving.</p><h3 id=the-policy-fight-who-gets-protected>The Policy Fight: Who Gets Protected?</h3><p><strong>The battle for safe streets is not over.</strong> On Bedford Avenue, the city tried to rip out a protected bike lane. Cyclists and advocates fought back. The city claimed it was about safety for children. But the numbers showed the lane made the street safer for everyone. &ldquo;This whole situation is extremely frustrating, because it&rsquo;s very clear that this is more about the mayor placating the South Williamsburg voting block than it is about trying to advance smart policy and keep people safe,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/15/new-yorkers-threaten-legal-action-if-eric-adams-makes-bedford-av-less-safe-for-cyclists>said Alex Morano of Transportation Alternatives</a>.</p><p>A judge stepped in. The bulldozers waited. &ldquo;The Adams administration is going to have to spend their night preparing their legal case, not ripping out a critical safety project and central Brooklyn&rsquo;s only protected bike lane,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/judge-derails-nyc-plan-to-move-bedford-ave-bike-lane-in-brooklyn-at-eleventh-hour/>said Ben Furnas</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-what-has-senator-salazar-done>Leadership: What Has Senator Salazar Done?</h3><p><strong>Senator Julia Salazar has voted for change.</strong> She co-sponsored and voted yes on the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, which would force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed limiters. She backed bills for <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S3304>bike lane enforcement</a>, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/08/23/we-never-gave-hochul-the-power-to-pause-congestion-pricing-legislators-say>congestion pricing</a>, and <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/dot-barriers-grand-street-bike-lane/>real barriers on Grand Street</a>. She has not been silent. But the blood on the street says more is needed.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-no-more-waiting>The Next Step: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day we wait, another name is lost.</strong> Call Senator Salazar. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real barriers, not plastic. Demand action, not words. The city will not save you unless you force its hand.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Gutiérrez, joined by U.S. Rep. Nydia Velázquez, Assembly Members Maritz Davila and Emily Gallagher, and State Senator Julia Salazar, urged a full investigation and demanded urgent infrastructure upgrades.

Hanif, along with Lincoln Restler, Alexa Avilés, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Crystal Hudson, joined borough, state, and federal colleagues in this push. They propose a credit system to balance costs between DOT bridges and MTA tunnels, aiming to protect neighborhoods like the Brooklyn waterfront and the BQE corridor from traffic surges. The MTA declined comment. The Board will soon set final toll rates and rules. The federal government has approved the congestion pricing plan, with tolls for cars expected between $9 and $23. Over 100 exemption requests, including from taxi and for-hire vehicle drivers, are under review.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
