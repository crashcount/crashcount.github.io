A truck turns. He does not make it home. In Senate District 18, <strong>20 people have died</strong> on the streets since 2022. <strong>Seventy more suffered serious injuries</strong>—bodies broken, lives changed forever. In the last year alone, three deaths, thirteen left with wounds that will not heal. The youngest lost was a child. The oldest, someone’s grandmother. <strong>Cars and trucks did most of the killing</strong>—SUVs, vans, dump trucks, box trucks. Each crash leaves behind a pair of shoes, a pool of blood, a family waiting for a call that never comes.</p><h3 id=broken-promises-slow-progress>Broken Promises, Slow Progress</h3><p>The city paints bike lanes. Drivers park in them. Cyclists swerve into traffic and die. On Grand Street, the so-called protected lane is a joke. Plastic sticks do not stop a two-ton car. Advocates and electeds, including Julia Salazar, <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/dot-barriers-grand-street-bike-lane/>demanded real barriers</a>. <em>&ldquo;We knew the omission of protective jersey barriers would lead to dangerous conditions back in 2019 and we have witnessed that prediction come tragically true throughout 2021&rdquo;</em> <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/dot-barriers-grand-street-bike-lane/>said local activists and officials</a>. Still, the city drags its feet. The carnage continues.</p><h3 id=what-has-julia-salazar-done>What Has Julia Salazar Done?</h3><p><strong>Salazar has backed bills for safer streets.</strong> She voted yes on a law to force &ldquo;complete street design&rdquo;—redesigning roads for people, not just cars (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>see bill S 9718</a>). She co-sponsored a bill for automated bike lane enforcement, to keep drivers out of the lanes meant for cyclists (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S5008>see S 5008</a>). She signed on for fare-free buses, a move that could shift more people out of cars (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4421>see S 4421</a>). But the deaths keep coming. The bills are not yet law. The barriers are not yet built. The blood is still on the street.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-demand-more-demand-now>The Next Step: Demand More, Demand Now</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay is another body. Call Julia Salazar. Call the Mayor. Call DOT. Demand real barriers, lower speed limits, and enforcement that protects people, not just paint on pavement. <strong>Do not wait for another child’s shoes to be left in the road.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Their letter to the Traffic Mobility Review Board states: 'No one community should disproportionately bear the burden of the cars and trucks passing through their neighborhood.' Hanif, along with Lincoln Restler, Alexa Avilés, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Crystal Hudson, joined borough, state, and federal colleagues in this push. They propose a credit system to balance costs between DOT bridges and MTA tunnels, aiming to protect neighborhoods like the Brooklyn waterfront and the BQE corridor from traffic surges. The MTA declined comment. The Board will soon set final toll rates and rules. The federal government has approved the congestion pricing plan, with tolls for cars expected between $9 and $23. Over 100 exemption requests, including from taxi and for-hire vehicle drivers, are under review.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The 27-year-old e-bike rider was ejected and suffered severe facial bleeding, but remained conscious on the pavement. According to the police report, 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' were listed as contributing factors. The sedan’s left rear quarter panel was damaged. The report notes the e-bike rider was not wearing a helmet, but this was not listed as a cause. No injuries were reported for the sedan’s occupants.

Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi claimed some locals want three lanes each way, but 17 elected officials, including State Sen. Julia Salazar, Sen. Andrew Gounardes, Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, and Council Member Lincoln Restler, publicly rejected the idea. Salazar said, 'no to three lanes. Two lanes at most.' Gounardes confirmed, 'all support a two-lane highway.' Gallagher wrote, '2 lanes if any.' Restler called City Hall’s statements 'plainly inaccurate.' The Department of Transportation delayed environmental review to study both options. Advocates and officials urge investment in mass transit, not highway expansion.

Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On February 10, 2023, eighteen Brooklyn lawmakers issued a joint letter demanding New York State Department of Transportation (DOT) participate in comprehensive planning for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens. Jabari Brisport, Julia Salazar, Kristen Gonzalez, Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Members Bobby Carroll, Maritza Davila, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Emily Gallagher, Jo Anne Simon, Marcela Mitaynes, and Council Members Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Lincoln Restler. Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint. Without state action, only city-owned segments see attention. The city’s efforts are limited. The state’s inaction leaves systemic danger unaddressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
