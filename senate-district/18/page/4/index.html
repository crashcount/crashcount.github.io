A driver struck him and kept going. Police found him dead in the street. The car did not stop. Early reports point to a garbage truck. The driver is still out there. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/cops-looking-for-driver-who-fatally-struck-man-on-brooklyn-street/>&ldquo;A driver struck and killed a 47-year-old pedestrian&mldr; then left the scene,&rdquo; police said.</a></p><p>This is not rare. In the last twelve months, SD 18 saw 12 deaths and 39 serious injuries on its streets. Over 1,800 people hurt. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. They are gone.</p><h2 id=streets-built-for-speed-not-safety>Streets Built for Speed, Not Safety</h2><p>Large vehicles kill. Trucks and SUVs are overrepresented in the blood tally. In this district since 2022, trucks and buses killed 5, cars and SUVs killed 4, motorcycles and mopeds killed 0, and bikes killed 0. The bodies pile up at intersections, crosswalks, and corners where the city promises protection but delivers paint.</p><p>The Bedford Avenue bike lane was meant to shield cyclists. It failed. After a string of crashes, the city is reverting to the old design. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/brooklyns-bedford-avenue-bike-lane-returning-to-original-design-after-crashes/>&ldquo;The redesign was initially intended to improve safety for cyclists, but recent incidents have prompted city officials to revert to the previous layout.&rdquo;</a></p><h2 id=senator-salazar-action-and-gaps>Senator Salazar: Action and Gaps</h2><p>State Senator Julia Salazar has backed bills to curb repeat speeders and expand school speed zones. She voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force the worst offenders to install speed limiters. She co-sponsored bills for safer bus service, congestion pricing, and protected bike lanes. She signed letters demanding real barriers on Grand Street, not plastic posts. But the carnage continues. The laws crawl. The deaths do not wait.</p><h2 id=the-call-demand-more-demand-now>The Call: Demand More, Demand Now</h2><p>Every day of delay is another family broken. Call Senator Salazar. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real barriers, not promises. Join <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Join <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a>. Do not wait for another body in the crosswalk.
