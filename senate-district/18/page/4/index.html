Both vehicles were fleeing police at the time of the crash. The report lists 'Unsafe Speed' as a contributing factor.

They filed a brief. They argue the governor has no right to halt congestion pricing. The MTA Board, not Albany, holds the power. The pause sows confusion. Streets stay clogged. Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On August 23, 2024, a group of New York State legislators—Assembly Members Phil Steck and Andrew Hevesi, State Senator Julia Salazar, and former Assembly Member Dick Gottfried—filed a legal brief against Governor Hochul’s decision to pause congestion pricing. The matter, as described: “the legislature never gave her or any governor the power to do away with the traffic toll.” The brief cites the 2019 Traffic Mobility Act, arguing only the Traffic Mobility Review Board and the MTA can make such decisions. The lawmakers warn that letting the governor override the MTA would “make impossibly opaque the actual responsibility for MTA decisions.” Their action supports the MTA Board’s independence and opposes executive interference. No safety analyst has assessed the direct impact on vulnerable road users, but the legislators’ stance highlights the risk of political meddling in life-and-death street policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The 29-year-old motorcycle rider, who was wearing a helmet, was crushed and partially ejected from his bike. He died at the scene from severe injuries to his entire body. The police report cites 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as a contributing factor, drawing attention to the failure of at least one driver to obey traffic signals or signs. Both vehicles were reported as going straight ahead at the time of impact. The truck's left front quarter panel was struck, and the motorcycle overturned. The report makes no mention of any victim error or behavior contributing to the crash. The violence of the impact and the disregard for traffic control proved fatal.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The impact was severe: 'A Jeep slammed into a northbound moped. The 65-year-old rider flew from the seat, struck the pavement headfirst. Blood pooled in the street. The SUV’s front end folded. He died there.' The moped rider, a 65-year-old man, was killed instantly, suffering fatal head injuries after being ejected from his vehicle. The police report notes the SUV driver was unlicensed, with a license from Georgia that was not valid in New York. No driver errors beyond 'unspecified' are listed, but the unlicensed status is a critical systemic failure. Helmet use is mentioned only to note its absence, after the primary driver error. The crash underscores the lethal consequences when unlicensed drivers operate vehicles on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
