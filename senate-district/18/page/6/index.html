A car hit him, dragged him fifty feet, and left him to die. The driver did not stop. Police are still looking for the car. The man’s name is not yet known. The street is the same as it was the day before. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/cops-looking-for-driver-who-fatally-struck-man-on-brooklyn-street/>&ldquo;A driver struck and killed a 47-year-old pedestrian&mldr; then left the scene,&rdquo; police said.</a></p><p>This is not rare. In the last twelve months, SD 18 saw <strong>12 deaths</strong> and <strong>39 serious injuries</strong> from crashes. <strong>1886 people were hurt.</strong> The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. The street does not care who you are.</p><h3 id=the-toll-grows-the-promises-pile-up>The Toll Grows, the Promises Pile Up</h3><p>The violence is steady. Trucks, cars, and SUVs do most of the killing. In three years, <strong>cars and SUVs caused 4 deaths and 7 serious injuries</strong> to pedestrians. <strong>Trucks and buses killed 5</strong>. Motorcycles and mopeds, 2 serious injuries, no deaths. Bikes, none. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the city’s own data.</a></p><p>On Bedford Avenue, the city tried to fix a bike lane.

Officials gave up and put it back the old way. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/brooklyns-bedford-avenue-bike-lane-returning-to-original-design-after-crashes/>&ldquo;The redesign was initially intended to improve safety for cyclists, but recent incidents have prompted city officials to revert to the previous layout.&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=what-has-senator-salazar-done>What Has Senator Salazar Done?</h3><p>State Senator Julia Salazar has backed bills to slow the worst drivers. She <strong>co-sponsored and voted yes</strong> on the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from going too fast. She also supported extending school speed zones. She signed on to bills for real bike lane protection and e-bike access. She stood with other lawmakers to defend congestion pricing, a policy proven to cut traffic and save lives. But the killing has not stopped.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Twelve dead. Thirty-nine with life-changing wounds.</strong> The street is not safe. The laws are not enough. The time for waiting is over. Call Senator Salazar. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real barriers, not paint. Demand action, not words.</p><p><strong>If you do nothing, nothing will change.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The measure, led by State Senator Julia Salazar and Assembly Member Robert Carroll, aims to make e-bikes accessible to working-class New Yorkers. Salazar says, 'With the Ride Clean rebate, [e-bikes] really would be much more accessible to working New Yorkers.' Carroll pushes back on critics who call e-bikes a luxury, stating, 'They don’t realize that this is not a luxury item.' The program would use NYSERDA funds from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, mirroring the Drive Clean program for electric cars. Advocates cite European and U.S. models.

The letter, backed by Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, State Senator Julia Salazar, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, and Council Members Lincoln Restler and Jennifer Gutierrez, called for 'protective jersey barricades and measures taken at each intersection to stop cars from entering the protected bike lane.' The group condemned the current plastic delineators, noting, 'From day one, the Grand Street bike lane has failed to keep people safe.' Since 2019, 67 cyclists have been injured and 196 crashes reported. The letter urges the city to replace weak barriers, fix dangerous entrances, and finally deliver safety for vulnerable road users.

The push follows years of crashes—67 cyclist injuries and 196 total crashes since 2019—despite so-called 'protected' lanes. The matter, titled 'Activists and electeds ask DOT to add better barriers to Grand Street bike lane,' highlights how plastic bollards fail to stop drivers from blocking lanes, forcing cyclists into traffic. Restler, along with Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, State Senator Julia Salazar, and Borough President Antonio Reynoso, signed a letter urging Mayor Adams and Commissioner Rodriguez to act. The DOT has started hardening some lanes citywide, but Grand Street remains unprotected. Activists say, 'We knew the omission of protective jersey barriers would lead to dangerous conditions back in 2019 and we have witnessed that prediction come tragically true throughout 2021.' The call is clear: real barriers, not broken promises.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
