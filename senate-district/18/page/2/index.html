A truck turns. He does not make it home. In Senate District 18, <strong>20 people have died</strong> on the streets since 2022. <strong>Seventy more suffered serious injuries</strong>—bodies broken, lives changed forever. In the last year alone, three deaths, thirteen left with wounds that will not heal. The youngest lost was a child. The oldest, someone’s grandmother. <strong>Cars and trucks did most of the killing</strong>—SUVs, vans, dump trucks, box trucks. Each crash leaves behind a pair of shoes, a pool of blood, a family waiting for a call that never comes.</p><h3 id=broken-promises-slow-progress>Broken Promises, Slow Progress</h3><p>The city paints bike lanes. Drivers park in them. Cyclists swerve into traffic and die. On Grand Street, the so-called protected lane is a joke. Plastic sticks do not stop a two-ton car. Advocates and electeds, including Julia Salazar, <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/dot-barriers-grand-street-bike-lane/>demanded real barriers</a>. <em>&ldquo;We knew the omission of protective jersey barriers would lead to dangerous conditions back in 2019 and we have witnessed that prediction come tragically true throughout 2021&rdquo;</em> <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/dot-barriers-grand-street-bike-lane/>said local activists and officials</a>. Still, the city drags its feet. The carnage continues.</p><h3 id=what-has-julia-salazar-done>What Has Julia Salazar Done?</h3><p><strong>Salazar has backed bills for safer streets.</strong> She voted yes on a law to force &ldquo;complete street design&rdquo;—redesigning roads for people, not just cars (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>see bill S 9718</a>). She co-sponsored a bill for automated bike lane enforcement, to keep drivers out of the lanes meant for cyclists (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S5008>see S 5008</a>). She signed on for fare-free buses, a move that could shift more people out of cars (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4421>see S 4421</a>). But the deaths keep coming. The bills are not yet law. The barriers are not yet built. The blood is still on the street.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-demand-more-demand-now>The Next Step: Demand More, Demand Now</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay is another body. Call Julia Salazar. Call the Mayor. Call DOT. Demand real barriers, lower speed limits, and enforcement that protects people, not just paint on pavement. <strong>Do not wait for another child’s shoes to be left in the road.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The vehicle's bumper struck the head of a 26-year-old woman who was standing off the roadway. The report notes she suffered severe bleeding and shock, with the point of impact listed as the center back end of the sedan. Police cite 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Backing Unsafely' as contributing factors. The woman was not in the roadway and was not crossing at an intersection at the time of the crash. The report makes no mention of any pedestrian error or behavior contributing to the collision.

The matter, as described: “the legislature never gave her or any governor the power to do away with the traffic toll.” The brief cites the 2019 Traffic Mobility Act, arguing only the Traffic Mobility Review Board and the MTA can make such decisions. The lawmakers warn that letting the governor override the MTA would “make impossibly opaque the actual responsibility for MTA decisions.” Their action supports the MTA Board’s independence and opposes executive interference. No safety analyst has assessed the direct impact on vulnerable road users, but the legislators’ stance highlights the risk of political meddling in life-and-death street policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The 29-year-old motorcycle rider, who was wearing a helmet, was crushed and partially ejected from his bike. He died at the scene from severe injuries to his entire body. The police report cites 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as a contributing factor, drawing attention to the failure of at least one driver to obey traffic signals or signs. Both vehicles were reported as going straight ahead at the time of impact. The truck's left front quarter panel was struck, and the motorcycle overturned. The report makes no mention of any victim error or behavior contributing to the crash.
