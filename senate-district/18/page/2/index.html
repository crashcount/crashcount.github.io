A car hit him, dragged him fifty feet, and left him to die. The driver did not stop. Police are still looking for the car. The man’s name is not yet known. The street is the same as it was the day before. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/cops-looking-for-driver-who-fatally-struck-man-on-brooklyn-street/>&ldquo;A driver struck and killed a 47-year-old pedestrian&mldr; then left the scene,&rdquo; police said.</a></p><p>This is not rare. In the last twelve months, SD 18 saw <strong>12 deaths</strong> and <strong>39 serious injuries</strong> from crashes. <strong>1886 people were hurt.</strong> The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. The street does not care who you are.</p><h3 id=the-toll-grows-the-promises-pile-up>The Toll Grows, the Promises Pile Up</h3><p>The violence is steady. Trucks, cars, and SUVs do most of the killing. In three years, <strong>cars and SUVs caused 4 deaths and 7 serious injuries</strong> to pedestrians. <strong>Trucks and buses killed 5</strong>. Motorcycles and mopeds, 2 serious injuries, no deaths. Bikes, none. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the city’s own data.</a></p><p>On Bedford Avenue, the city tried to fix a bike lane.

Officials gave up and put it back the old way. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/brooklyns-bedford-avenue-bike-lane-returning-to-original-design-after-crashes/>&ldquo;The redesign was initially intended to improve safety for cyclists, but recent incidents have prompted city officials to revert to the previous layout.&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=what-has-senator-salazar-done>What Has Senator Salazar Done?</h3><p>State Senator Julia Salazar has backed bills to slow the worst drivers. She <strong>co-sponsored and voted yes</strong> on the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from going too fast. She also supported extending school speed zones. She signed on to bills for real bike lane protection and e-bike access. She stood with other lawmakers to defend congestion pricing, a policy proven to cut traffic and save lives. But the killing has not stopped.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Twelve dead. Thirty-nine with life-changing wounds.</strong> The street is not safe. The laws are not enough. The time for waiting is over. Call Senator Salazar. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real barriers, not paint. Demand action, not words.</p><p><strong>If you do nothing, nothing will change.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

As the truck pulled out, a motorcycle traveling straight ahead collided with its side. The motorcyclist, age 47, was thrown from his vehicle and suffered severe lacerations to his leg, described as 'knee-lower leg foot' injuries, and was partially ejected but remained conscious. The report notes the truck sustained no damage, while the motorcycle's left front bumper took the impact. Both vehicles list 'Other Vehicular' as contributing factors, which, in this context, points to the truck's movement from parking as a critical action preceding the crash. The police narrative underscores the violence of the impact and the aftermath, with blood spreading on the blacktop. No driver errors beyond 'Other Vehicular' are specified, and no victim behavior is cited as a contributing factor.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
