Thirty-five left with life-changing wounds.</strong> In the last year alone, the streets of Senate District 18 have not let up. A child crushed by a turning truck at Withers and Woodpoint. A man struck down crossing Wyckoff and DeKalb. A motorcyclist killed on Jackie Robinson Parkway. The numbers are not just numbers. They are families torn open, futures erased.</p><p><strong>Crashes keep coming.</strong> In just twelve months: 1,576 people hurt, 35 seriously. The dead span every age. The young, the old, the ones just trying to cross the street. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data tracks the toll</a>. The city keeps moving.</p><h3 id=the-policy-fight-who-gets-protected>The Policy Fight: Who Gets Protected?</h3><p><strong>The battle for safe streets is not over.</strong> On Bedford Avenue, the city tried to rip out a protected bike lane. Cyclists and advocates fought back. The city claimed it was about safety for children. But the numbers showed the lane made the street safer for everyone. &ldquo;This whole situation is extremely frustrating, because it&rsquo;s very clear that this is more about the mayor placating the South Williamsburg voting block than it is about trying to advance smart policy and keep people safe,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/15/new-yorkers-threaten-legal-action-if-eric-adams-makes-bedford-av-less-safe-for-cyclists>said Alex Morano of Transportation Alternatives</a>.</p><p>A judge stepped in. The bulldozers waited. &ldquo;The Adams administration is going to have to spend their night preparing their legal case, not ripping out a critical safety project and central Brooklyn&rsquo;s only protected bike lane,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/judge-derails-nyc-plan-to-move-bedford-ave-bike-lane-in-brooklyn-at-eleventh-hour/>said Ben Furnas</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-what-has-senator-salazar-done>Leadership: What Has Senator Salazar Done?</h3><p><strong>Senator Julia Salazar has voted for change.</strong> She co-sponsored and voted yes on the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, which would force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed limiters. She backed bills for <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S3304>bike lane enforcement</a>, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/08/23/we-never-gave-hochul-the-power-to-pause-congestion-pricing-legislators-say>congestion pricing</a>, and <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/dot-barriers-grand-street-bike-lane/>real barriers on Grand Street</a>. She has not been silent. But the blood on the street says more is needed.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-no-more-waiting>The Next Step: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day we wait, another name is lost.</strong> Call Senator Salazar. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real barriers, not plastic. Demand action, not words. The city will not save you unless you force its hand.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The 29-year-old male driver, the sole occupant, suffered severe facial bleeding and was found conscious inside the crumpled Hyundai.

The narrative describes the Hyundai as having 'plowed into three parked cars,' with the scene marked by 'the night smelled of alcohol and steel.' The impact crushed the Hyundai's roof and damaged the rear ends of the parked vehicles. No pedestrians, cyclists, or other vehicle occupants were reported injured.
