Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon said the bill lacks support to reach the floor. The bill passed the City Council’s home rule message but faces Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie’s resistance.

Brad Hoylman-Sigal and other NYC officials lobbied the state legislature to pass key transportation and housing bills before the session ends June 9. The centerpiece is 'Sammy’s Law,' which would let New York City set its own speed limits, potentially lowering them to 20 mph. Hoylman-Sigal, the bill’s sponsor, said, 'Senators in Massapequa shouldn’t set the speed limit for Manhattan—or the reverse.' The law is named for Sammy Cohen Eckstein, a 12-year-old killed by a car in Brooklyn. The bill had stalled before, but this year the required home rule resolution was submitted. Mayor Adams’ administration also pushed for affordable housing reforms. The push for Sammy’s Law is a fight to give NYC control over its streets and protect vulnerable road users from deadly speeding.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal, has stalled in the legislature before. Hochul’s State of the State address declared, 'she will introduce her own version of the existing "Sammy's Law" bill.' Hoylman-Sigal called City Council members his 'partners' and urged their support. Amy Cohen, whose son was killed by a speeding driver, pressed the Council to act, saying, 'We need the Council to make it a priority to support Sammy's Law and redesign streets ... at a safe speed limit.' DOT spokesman Vin Barone added, 'DOT strongly supports Sammy’s Law.' The Adams administration and street safety advocates back the measure. If passed, the law would let the city drop speed limits below 25 mph citywide and below 15 mph near schools, giving local officials real power to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
