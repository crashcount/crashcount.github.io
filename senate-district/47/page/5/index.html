A truck crushes him on 9th Avenue. He is 39. He dies in the street. A 74-year-old cyclist collides with a bus on West End Avenue. He does not get up. A 69-year-old woman, walking with the light at Amsterdam and 96th, is struck by an SUV turning left. She dies at the intersection. These are not rare stories. They are the drumbeat of life and death in Senate District 47.</p><p><strong>In the last 12 months, five people have died in crashes here. Seventeen more suffered serious injuries.</strong> In total, 793 people were hurt. The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross the street. The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><h3 id=the-system-fails-the-vulnerable>The System Fails the Vulnerable</h3><p>Most deaths come from cars and trucks. <strong>SUVs killed four. Trucks killed two.</strong> Bikes and mopeds hurt, but they do not kill like steel and speed. The city’s streets are not built for the softest bodies. They are built for the biggest vehicles. The cost is measured in funerals and empty chairs.</p><p>Last week, a car fire in the Lincoln Tunnel trapped commuters for over an hour. One was hospitalized. Five more were treated at the scene. The fire was put out, but the fear lingers. &ldquo;One commuter was taken to Mount Sinai West to be treated for injuries. The extent of the victim&rsquo;s injuries was unclear,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/08/us-news/lincoln-tunnel-closed-for-an-hour-in-rush-hour-nightmare-as-car-fire-snarls-traffic/>said the FDNY</a>. The tunnel reopened, but the city did not change.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-pressure>Leadership: Progress and Pressure</h3><p>Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal has voted for safer street design. He backed the bill to require &ldquo;complete street design principles&rdquo;—a step toward roads that protect everyone, not just drivers. He has supported speed cameras, lower speed limits, and better enforcement. But the deaths keep coming. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so. The law is on the books. The blood is on the asphalt.</p><p>&ldquo;One bus made contact with the rear of the other bus,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/2-buses-collide-port-authority-shutting-down-14-injured/16916303/>said Deputy Chief Jason Saffon</a>, after a crash at Port Authority left 14 injured. The system is brittle. The bodies are real.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand enforcement against the worst repeat offenders. Join <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>.

The moped vanished south, leaving injury behind.</p><p class=mb3>A 33-year-old man was crossing Columbus Avenue near West 70th Street in Manhattan when a southbound moped struck him head-on. According to the police report, 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' was a contributing factor. The pedestrian suffered a severe leg injury and remained conscious at the scene. The moped did not stop and continued south. The report notes the pedestrian was not in a crosswalk or at a signal, but lists driver inattention as a primary cause. The crash left the man bleeding on the asphalt while the moped rider fled, unmarked and unaccounted for.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The plan, described as giving 'absolute priority for pedestrians,' will remove 70,000 parking spaces by 2026, daylight all intersections, widen sidewalks, and expand bike lanes. Hidalgo rejects harsh measures against e-bikes, focusing instead on reducing car dominance and discouraging SUVs through progressive parking fees. Council Member Gale A. Brewer, District 6, is mentioned in the context of New York’s contrasting approach, where enforcement often targets e-bikes rather than cars. Advocates highlight that cars and trucks cause most pedestrian injuries and deaths. They urge New York to emulate Paris—reclaiming street space from cars, not blaming micromobility. The data is clear: fewer cars mean safer streets for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, 'A woman crossed without a signal. The e-scooter struck her face. The taxi stood still. Her body crumpled. Crush wounds. No helmet. No warning.' The woman suffered facial injuries and was in shock. The e-scooter driver, a 40-year-old man, was cited for 'Driver Inattention/Distraction.' The taxi was parked and not involved in the impact. The report notes the pedestrian was not wearing a helmet, but this is mentioned only after the driver’s inattention. The crash shows how distraction behind the handlebars endangers those on foot.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The city waits.</p><p class=mb3>On January 10, 2023, Governor Kathy Hochul announced her support for a state bill—known as Sammy’s Law—that would let New York City lower its own speed limits. The bill, sponsored by Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal, has stalled in the legislature before. Hochul’s State of the State address declared, 'she will introduce her own version of the existing "Sammy's Law" bill.' Hoylman-Sigal called City Council members his 'partners' and urged their support. Amy Cohen, whose son was killed by a speeding driver, pressed the Council to act, saying, 'We need the Council to make it a priority to support Sammy's Law and redesign streets ... at a safe speed limit.' DOT spokesman Vin Barone added, 'DOT strongly supports Sammy’s Law.' The Adams administration and street safety advocates back the measure. If passed, the law would let the city drop speed limits below 25 mph citywide and below 15 mph near schools, giving local officials real power to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
