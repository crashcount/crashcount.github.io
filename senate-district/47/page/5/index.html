Twenty seriously hurt. In the last year alone, 881 people in Senate District 47 were injured in crashes. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about the weather or the hour. They do not care if you are young or old. A 69-year-old woman, crossing with the light at Amsterdam and 96th, was killed by a turning SUV. She had the right of way. She is gone.

They are walking, riding, crossing, living. The streets are not safe. Trucks, SUVs, taxis, bikes—all can kill. But the biggest toll comes from cars and trucks: six deaths, sixteen serious injuries, 580 crashes in the last three years. Bikes and mopeds hurt too, but the numbers are smaller. The pain is not.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h2><p>Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal has voted for safer street design and supported bills for lower speed limits and better enforcement. He backed the law that lets New York City set its own speed limits. He voted yes on the complete streets bill. He supported more speed cameras and called for camera enforcement of blocked bike lanes. But the pace is slow. The danger does not wait.</p><p>The city and state talk about Vision Zero.

The enforcement action follows years of crackdowns dating back to Mayor Bloomberg, ramped up under Mayor de Blasio. Police say the seizures make streets safer, but city crash data show cars and trucks—not e-bikes or mopeds—cause most pedestrian injuries. Delivery worker Roziev Akmal warned, 'Livelihoods will be ruined because of the seizure.' Ligia Guallpa of the Worker’s Justice Project called it 'another example where you see deliveristas being economically impacted.' State Sen. Brad Hoylman and Council Member Gale Brewer cited constituent complaints, but advocates and legal experts argue enforcement targets workers, not the root causes. The crackdown leaves low-paid, mostly immigrant workers exposed to fines, lost income, and road danger, while app companies escape responsibility.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, described as giving 'absolute priority for pedestrians,' will remove 70,000 parking spaces by 2026, daylight all intersections, widen sidewalks, and expand bike lanes. Hidalgo rejects harsh measures against e-bikes, focusing instead on reducing car dominance and discouraging SUVs through progressive parking fees. Council Member Gale A. Brewer, District 6, is mentioned in the context of New York’s contrasting approach, where enforcement often targets e-bikes rather than cars. Advocates highlight that cars and trucks cause most pedestrian injuries and deaths. They urge New York to emulate Paris—reclaiming street space from cars, not blaming micromobility. The data is clear: fewer cars mean safer streets for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, 'A woman crossed without a signal. The e-scooter struck her face. The taxi stood still. Her body crumpled. Crush wounds. No helmet. No warning.' The woman suffered facial injuries and was in shock. The e-scooter driver, a 40-year-old man, was cited for 'Driver Inattention/Distraction.' The taxi was parked and not involved in the impact. The report notes the pedestrian was not wearing a helmet, but this is mentioned only after the driver’s inattention. The crash shows how distraction behind the handlebars endangers those on foot.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Streets could get safer. The city waits.</p><p class=mb3>On January 10, 2023, Governor Kathy Hochul announced her support for a state bill—known as Sammy’s Law—that would let New York City lower its own speed limits. The bill, sponsored by Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal, has stalled in the legislature before. Hochul’s State of the State address declared, 'she will introduce her own version of the existing "Sammy's Law" bill.' Hoylman-Sigal called City Council members his 'partners' and urged their support. Amy Cohen, whose son was killed by a speeding driver, pressed the Council to act, saying, 'We need the Council to make it a priority to support Sammy's Law and redesign streets ... at a safe speed limit.' DOT spokesman Vin Barone added, 'DOT strongly supports Sammy’s Law.' The Adams administration and street safety advocates back the measure. If passed, the law would let the city drop speed limits below 25 mph citywide and below 15 mph near schools, giving local officials real power to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
