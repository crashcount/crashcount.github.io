It doubles fines for unauthorized moped dealers from $1,000 to $2,000 and requires registration at the point of sale.

Kruger said, 'My bill makes sure we know who is selling mopeds.' González-Rojas added, 'The bill will help alleviate some of the challenges we see around mopeds.' Advocates like Ligia Guallpa of the Workers Justice Project support enforcement at the point of sale, noting many dealers are unlicensed.

The sedan’s point of impact was its center front end, colliding with the pickup’s center back end. The report lists 'Following Too Closely' and 'Unsafe Speed' as contributing factors linked to the sedan driver. The pickup driver, a 49-year-old man, was belted in with a lap belt and harness and sustained neck injuries and whiplash but remained conscious. The police report explicitly attributes the crash to the sedan driver’s failure to maintain a safe following distance. No contributing factors were assigned to the pickup driver.

Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On April 18, 2024, state lawmakers advanced legislation enabling New York City to reduce its default speed limit to 20 mph. The measure, known as Sammy’s Law, is part of the state budget deal and awaits final publication. Sponsored by Assemblymember Linda Rosenthal and Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal, the bill allows the City Council to set lower limits on most streets, but excludes roads with three or more lanes in one direction. The bill’s title honors Sammy Cohen Eckstein, a 12-year-old killed by a speeding driver in 2013. Rosenthal said, “This is about trying to eliminate all unnecessary deaths, and one of the ways you do that is by making the speed limit lower.” Hoylman-Sigal credited persistent advocacy by Sammy’s mother and Families for Safe Streets. The City Council and Mayor must still approve the change. Advocates and city officials say the law gives New York City a vital tool to prevent traffic violence and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assembly Member Tony Simone, aims to remind cyclists to stop at red lights and avoid sidewalks. Bottcher’s district saw 2,215 crashes last year, injuring 267 pedestrians and 218 cyclists; three of five fatalities were pedestrians killed by drivers. Bottcher said, 'the vast majority of deaths and injuries are caused by cars.' Simone highlighted delivery app pressure on workers to break laws. Ligia Guallpa of the Workers Justice Project noted delivery workers face daily risks and exploitation. The campaign, first in English and Spanish, will expand citywide. The focus remains: cars are the real threat, but all street users must be considered.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The impact set off a chain reaction, tangling twelve vehicles. The report lists 'Alcohol Involvement' as a contributing factor, stating one driver had been drinking. The woman was not in the roadway at the time. The police report highlights the driver's error—backing up while impaired—as the direct cause of the injury and the pileup. No victim action contributed to the crash.

The resolution urges city and state to punish illegal dealers, enforce laws, and back Albany’s registration bill. Lawmakers say loopholes fuel chaos. Immigrants often misled. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On December 14, 2023, Community Board 7’s transportation committee passed a resolution, 8-1, demanding action against unregistered mopeds. The board called on the Department of Motor Vehicles to impose civil penalties on unregistered dealers and urged city and state officials to enforce laws against selling non-street-legal mopeds. The resolution also asks the city to consider a buy-back program for gas-powered mopeds. The matter, titled 'Upper West Side Panel Backs Resolution to Rein in Dangerous Mopeds,' supports Albany legislation requiring sellers to register mopeds with the DMV before sale. State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assembly Member Alex Bores sponsor the bill. Bores said, 'We need to cut off the flow of these vehicles before they get onto these streets.' The board’s move aims to close loopholes, protect vulnerable road users, and address the chaos caused by unregistered mopeds.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
