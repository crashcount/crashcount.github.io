In the last twelve months, seven people died and 1,009 were injured in 2,034 crashes. Twenty-three suffered serious injuries. The old and the young are not spared. Four people over 65 died. Children under 18 were hurt forty-six times. Each number is a body, a family, a life changed or ended.</p><p>Just last month, two buses collided at the Port Authority ramp. Thirty people were sent to the hospital. The FDNY called it &ldquo;a lot of them with musculoskeletal injuries, neck pain, back pain,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/multiple-injuries-2-buses-crash-ramp-port-authority-nyc/17274379/>said Deputy Assistant Chief Joseph Pataky</a>. The ramp is a known bottleneck. The city says it will be fixed by 2032. That is seven years and hundreds of crashes away.</p><h2 id=the-system-fails-the-vulnerable>The System Fails the Vulnerable</h2><p>SUVs and cars do the most harm. In this district, they killed six and injured hundreds more. Trucks and buses killed two. Bikes caused over 100 injuries. The streets are not safe for anyone who walks, rides, or waits for a bus. The old rules do not protect the old bones.</p><p>In Central Park, a 72-year-old woman was hit by cyclists twice. She suffered kidney damage. The NYPD never followed up. &ldquo;Ninety percent of their crashes have no police report and in 90 percent of these crashes over 90 percent the rider flees the scene,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/she-was-hit-twice-by-bikes-in-central-park-and-says-nypd-never-followed-up-IH4810802>said Janet Schroeder</a>. The city counts the dead, but not the broken.</p><h2 id=leadership-progress-and-pressure>Leadership: Progress and Pressure</h2><p>Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal has taken steps. He co-sponsored and voted for the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed-limiting devices <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>see bill S 4045</a>. He backed the law letting NYC lower speed limits to 20 mph <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/lawmakers-to-allow-nyc-to-lower-speed-limit-to-20-mph>see Sammy’s Law</a>. He sponsored bills for automated bike lane enforcement and safer bus lanes. But the streets are still killing. The laws are not yet enough.</p><p>Every day without action is another day of blood on the asphalt.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-demand-more-demand-now>Call to Action: Demand More, Demand Now</h2><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call Senator Hoylman-Sigal. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat speeders. Demand streets that put people before cars. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter, discussed in Streetsblog, quotes Adams: “Each Council member is going to have to weigh in on how they feel it should be enacted or should not be enacted in their district.” Adams hesitated to commit to a citywide 20 mph limit, instead suggesting community-by-community decisions. Eric McClure of StreetsPAC called this approach “chaotic and dangerous,” pushing for a uniform 20 mph limit to save lives. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives urged a comprehensive, data-driven plan. State Senator Andrew Gounardes and Brad Hoylman-Sigal pressed the Council to use its new powers. The Department of Transportation clarified its limited authority. The Council’s delay leaves vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lawmakers say this closes loopholes, shifts blame from workers, and aims to cut rising crashes. Streets see more mopeds, more injuries, more tension.</p><p class=mb3>On July 12, 2024, Governor Hochul signed a package of eight bills into law, including new moped and e-bike safety regulations. The legislation, sponsored by State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assemblymember Alex Bores, requires retailers to register mopeds at the point of sale, provide safety information, and prohibit the sale of substandard lithium-ion batteries. The law also mandates crash reporting and new safety training for first responders. Hoylman-Sigal said, 'I've received more complaints about the hazards these mopeds cause than just about any other issue.' Bores added, 'By requiring the registration of mopeds at point of sale and the collection of e-bike collision data, we are making our streets safer and increasing accountability.' The law shifts accountability to retailers, aiming to improve street safety without penalizing delivery workers. Council Member Shekar Krishnan and State Senator Liz Kruger also voiced support, highlighting the dangers of unregistered mopeds and the need for better buyer education. The law responds to a sharp rise in moped-related injuries and community complaints across New York City.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The debate, reported by Gothamist, centers on whether a lower toll could unfreeze the program while still funding the MTA. Hoylman-Sigal said, "Nobody's wedded to $15. We are wedded to the improvements that congestion pricing will provide for mass transit or safety on our streets for cleaner air." Sen. Liz Krueger is open to a new fee if it raises $1 billion yearly. Sen. Jabari Brisport criticized the lack of study and feedback in the process, calling it "irresponsible." Any change needs legislative, MTA, and federal approval. Trump has promised to end congestion pricing if elected.
