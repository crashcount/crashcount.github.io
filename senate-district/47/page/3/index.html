Twenty seriously hurt. Nearly 900 injured in the last year alone. In Senate District 47, the numbers do not lie. They do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old. A 69-year-old woman, crossing with the light, struck dead by an SUV at Amsterdam and 96th. A 74-year-old man, riding his bike, killed by a bus at West End and 70th. A 39-year-old man, crushed by a truck on 9th Avenue. The dead do not get a second chance. The living carry scars.</p><p>Just last week, a food cart broke loose from a van and slammed into a parked car with a woman and a child inside. Police found 76 propane tanks and 75 gallons of gasoline in the van. The driver was charged with reckless endangerment. Firefighters <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/cops-bust-minivan-driver-in-manhattan-for-carrying-propane-tanks/>forced entry into the van, removing 76 20-pound propane cylinders and 15 five-gallon fuel containers</a>, the report read. The woman and child survived. This time.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-the-price-of-delay>Leadership: Progress and the Price of Delay</h3><p>State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal has moved. He backed the law that lets New York City lower its speed limit to 20 mph. He co-sponsored the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force the worst repeat offenders to install speed-limiting devices. He voted yes to extend school speed zones. He pushed for moped registration and better crash reporting. But the work is not done. The streets are not safe. The bills are not law until they are enforced. The dead do not wait for process.</p><p>When the city cracks down on e-bike riders but leaves dangerous drivers untouched, the message is clear. As one safety analyst <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/08/amsterdam-leads-the-way-on-e-bike-regulation-should-new-york-follow-suit>put it</a>, &ldquo;enforcement can&rsquo;t fix the problems of car-first design.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p>Every day of delay is another day of risk. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to drop the speed limit to 20 mph. Demand the city use its new power. Tell Senator Hoylman-Sigal to keep pushing until the most dangerous drivers are off the road. Join the fight. The next life lost could be someone you love.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The project, a $300 million overhaul, is part of ongoing MTA accessibility efforts. State Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal, who represents District 47, praised the work: "There is a fundamental right to access mass transit. And today we are taking an important step forward in making that right real to all New Yorkers." The upgrades will make the complex fully accessible under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Still, 23 other stations remain on hold after congestion pricing was paused, freezing $15 billion in planned improvements. Only 30% of stations are accessible.

Eric McClure of StreetsPAC called this approach “chaotic and dangerous,” pushing for a uniform 20 mph limit to save lives. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives urged a comprehensive, data-driven plan. State Senator Andrew Gounardes and Brad Hoylman-Sigal pressed the Council to use its new powers.

The legislation, sponsored by State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assemblymember Alex Bores, requires retailers to register mopeds at the point of sale, provide safety information, and prohibit the sale of substandard lithium-ion batteries. The law also mandates crash reporting and new safety training for first responders. Hoylman-Sigal said, 'I've received more complaints about the hazards these mopeds cause than just about any other issue.' Bores added, 'By requiring the registration of mopeds at point of sale and the collection of e-bike collision data, we are making our streets safer and increasing accountability.' The law shifts accountability to retailers, aiming to improve street safety without penalizing delivery workers. Council Member Shekar Krishnan and State Senator Liz Kruger also voiced support, highlighting the dangers of unregistered mopeds and the need for better buyer education. The law responds to a sharp rise in moped-related injuries and community complaints across New York City.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

We are wedded to the improvements that congestion pricing will provide for mass transit or safety on our streets for cleaner air." Sen. Liz Krueger is open to a new fee if it raises $1 billion yearly. Sen. Jabari Brisport criticized the lack of study and feedback in the process, calling it "irresponsible."

The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified' for both the driver and the pedestrian. No information is provided about the vehicle type or the driver. The victim's actions are described as 'Other Actions in Roadway,' but the report does not cite any pedestrian behavior as a contributing factor. The deadly force of the car and the lack of identified driver error in the report highlight the systemic dangers faced by pedestrians on city streets, especially in the early hours.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

It doubles fines for unauthorized moped dealers from $1,000 to $2,000 and requires registration at the point of sale. The bill is expected to pass the Assembly, where Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas co-sponsors. The matter summary states: 'Fines against unauthorized moped dealers would be doubled.' Kruger said, 'My bill makes sure we know who is selling mopeds.' González-Rojas added, 'The bill will help alleviate some of the challenges we see around mopeds.' Advocates like Ligia Guallpa of the Workers Justice Project support enforcement at the point of sale, noting many dealers are unlicensed. The bill targets vendors, not riders, aiming to protect vulnerable delivery workers and pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On April 18, 2024, state lawmakers advanced legislation enabling New York City to reduce its default speed limit to 20 mph. The measure, known as Sammy’s Law, is part of the state budget deal and awaits final publication. Sponsored by Assemblymember Linda Rosenthal and Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal, the bill allows the City Council to set lower limits on most streets, but excludes roads with three or more lanes in one direction. The bill’s title honors Sammy Cohen Eckstein, a 12-year-old killed by a speeding driver in 2013. Rosenthal said, “This is about trying to eliminate all unnecessary deaths, and one of the ways you do that is by making the speed limit lower.” Hoylman-Sigal credited persistent advocacy by Sammy’s mother and Families for Safe Streets. The City Council and Mayor must still approve the change. Advocates and city officials say the law gives New York City a vital tool to prevent traffic violence and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
