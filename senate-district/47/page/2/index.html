The police report lists 'Outside Car Distraction' and 'Reaction to Uninvolved Vehicle' as contributing factors on the part of the driver. The victim’s actions—crossing with the signal—are noted, but the crash was precipitated by the driver’s failure to yield and inattention.

The legislation, sponsored by State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assemblymember Alex Bores, requires retailers to register mopeds at the point of sale, provide safety information, and prohibit the sale of substandard lithium-ion batteries. The law also mandates crash reporting and new safety training for first responders. Hoylman-Sigal said, 'I've received more complaints about the hazards these mopeds cause than just about any other issue.' Bores added, 'By requiring the registration of mopeds at point of sale and the collection of e-bike collision data, we are making our streets safer and increasing accountability.' The law shifts accountability to retailers, aiming to improve street safety without penalizing delivery workers. Council Member Shekar Krishnan and State Senator Liz Kruger also voiced support, highlighting the dangers of unregistered mopeds and the need for better buyer education.

The debate, reported by Gothamist, centers on whether a lower toll could unfreeze the program while still funding the MTA. Hoylman-Sigal said, "Nobody's wedded to $15. We are wedded to the improvements that congestion pricing will provide for mass transit or safety on our streets for cleaner air." Sen. Liz Krueger is open to a new fee if it raises $1 billion yearly. Sen. Jabari Brisport criticized the lack of study and feedback in the process, calling it "irresponsible." Any change needs legislative, MTA, and federal approval. Trump has promised to end congestion pricing if elected. No formal safety analysis was provided for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, reported as 'MTA in dark over Gov. Hochul’s talks to revive congestion pricing with lower tolls,' highlights confusion and division. Hoylman-Sigal supports lowering the toll, saying, 'The goal should be mend it don’t end it.' He urges keeping the program alive to save mass transit. Sen. Liz Krueger is open to tweaks if goals are met. Assemblyman Gary Pretlow opposes any revival. The MTA faces a $15 billion shortfall after the program’s pause. Policy experts warn that lowering the toll could weaken congestion relief and transit funding. No clear plan exists. Vulnerable road users remain at risk as gridlock and uncertainty persist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
