Sixty-three left with serious injuries.</strong> Nearly 6,500 crashes since 2022. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. A 69-year-old woman, crossing with the light at Amsterdam and 96th, was struck and killed by a turning SUV. She had the signal. She did not make it home. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p>Just last month, a food cart broke loose from a van on 42nd Street. It slammed into a parked car with a woman and a ten-year-old boy inside. Firefighters found the van packed with 76 propane tanks and 75 gallons of gasoline. The driver was charged with reckless endangerment. The woman and child survived, but the street was one spark away from disaster. Firefighters <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/cops-bust-minivan-driver-in-manhattan-for-carrying-propane-tanks/>removed 76 propane cylinders and 15 fuel containers</a>.</p><p>On July 2nd, two buses collided inside the Port Authority Terminal. Fourteen people were hurt. Emergency crews had to drive the wrong way up a ramp to reach the injured. &ldquo;One bus made contact with the rear of the other bus,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/2-buses-collide-port-authority-shutting-down-14-injured/16916303/>said Deputy Chief Jason Saffon</a>. &ldquo;It required some extrication, meaning they had to use some equipment to free the patient.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=the-policy-response-progress-and-gaps>The Policy Response: Progress and Gaps</h3><p><strong>Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal has moved.</strong> He co-sponsored and voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed-limiting devices. He backed the extension of school speed zones. He sponsored bills for automated bike and bus lane enforcement. He pushed for moped registration and safer e-bike batteries. He fought for the law that lets New York City drop the speed limit to 20 mph. &ldquo;This is about trying to eliminate all unnecessary deaths, and one of the ways you do that is by making the speed limit lower,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/lawmakers-to-allow-nyc-to-lower-speed-limit-to-20-mph>said Senator Hoylman-Sigal</a>.</p><p>But the streets are not safe yet. <strong>SUVs and trucks still kill. Buses still crush. Repeat speeders still drive.</strong> The city has the power to lower the speed limit. It has not done so citywide. The carnage continues.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every death is preventable.</strong> Every injury is a failure of policy, not fate. The time for half-measures is over. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to use the laws Senator Hoylman-Sigal helped pass. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand enforcement that targets the real killers—speed, red lights, blocked lanes. <strong>Do not let another family become a number.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Hoylman-Sigal said, 'This is about the economic engine for the entire region.' Assembly Member Tony Simone and others demanded investment in transportation deserts and accessible stations. Advocates cited the MTA’s ADA settlement, noting only a quarter of stations are wheelchair-accessible, with the fewest in low-income areas.

The report states the cyclist was ejected from his bike, suffering a severe head injury with significant bleeding after his skull struck the pavement. The bus, a 2006 GMC, was parked and sustained no damage. The police report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor in the crash. No helmet was in use, as noted in the data, but this is mentioned only after the driver error. The narrative describes a violent impact and the aftermath: 'Blood pooled on the asphalt. The bus, untouched. The man, broken.' The crash underscores the consequences of distraction and the hazards that persist even when vehicles are stationary.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The cyclist suffered crush injuries to the head and was found unconscious at the scene. The report also notes 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' and that the cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but these are mentioned only after the primary driver error.

The report states she was 'crossing with the light' in the crosswalk when a Ford SUV, making a left turn, struck her with its left front bumper. She suffered fatal injuries to her lower leg and died at the scene. The police report lists 'Outside Car Distraction' and 'Reaction to Uninvolved Vehicle' as contributing factors on the part of the driver. The victim’s actions—crossing with the signal—are noted, but the crash was precipitated by the driver’s failure to yield and inattention.

The article, titled 'Opinion: Worried About E-Bike Safety? Make the Roads Safer First,' highlights the dangers faced by cyclists and pedestrians due to poor infrastructure. It supports Council Member Lincoln Restler’s bill to enforce bike and bus lane obstruction rules and backs state Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal’s proposal for employer-based delivery worker licensing. The piece states: 'Such proposals are heavy-handed and will deter and discourage e-bike ridership without effectively ensuring their safe operations on the street.'
