The dead include four people over 65. The injured are young and old, walkers and cyclists, children and elders. The numbers do not heal. They do not forget.</p><p>Just last week, thirty people were hurt when a New Jersey Transit bus slammed into another on the Port Authority ramp. The FDNY described the aftermath: <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/multiple-injuries-2-buses-crash-ramp-port-authority-nyc/17274379/>&ldquo;A lot of them with musculoskeletal injuries, neck pain, back pain.&rdquo;</a> Another report called it the second bus crash at the terminal this month, a pattern that leaves passengers and bystanders at risk. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/about-30-people-injured-as-buses-crash-on-port-authority-ramp>&ldquo;About 30 people were injured in a bus collision on the Port Authority Bus Terminal ramp on Thursday morning, according to the FDNY and alerts from transit agencies.&rdquo;</a></p><p>SUVs, trucks, and sedans do most of the harm. In three years, they killed 14 people and injured hundreds more. Bikes and mopeds also hurt, but the carnage is driven by bigger, faster vehicles. The streets are not safe for the frail or the quick, the careful or the distracted. The disaster is slow, but it does not stop.</p><h2 id=what-has-senator-hoylman-sigal-done>What Has Senator Hoylman-Sigal Done?</h2><p>Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal has moved. He co-sponsored and voted for the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, which would force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. He backed the law that lets New York City <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/lawmakers-to-allow-nyc-to-lower-speed-limit-to-20-mph>lower its speed limit to 20 mph</a>. He pushed for <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S3304>automated bike lane enforcement</a> and tougher rules for mopeds and e-bikes, aiming to shift accountability to retailers and repeat offenders, not delivery workers. But the blood on the street says it is not enough. The city has the power to lower speeds. It has not done so.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-ours>The Next Step Is Ours</h2><p>Every day the city delays, another family risks losing someone. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand the city use the laws Albany gave it. Demand real protection for the people who walk, ride, and wait at the curb. The disaster is not fate. It is policy. It can be stopped. But only if you act.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The rally targeted Governor Hochul’s $252 billion budget, which omits $33 billion needed for transit upgrades. The event, covered by amny.com, highlighted the matter: 'NYC transit advocates urge Hochul to fully fund MTA Capital Plan with guaranteed state budget revenue.' Hoylman-Sigal said, 'This is about the economic engine for the entire region.' Assembly Member Tony Simone and others demanded investment in transportation deserts and accessible stations. Advocates cited the MTA’s ADA settlement, noting only a quarter of stations are wheelchair-accessible, with the fewest in low-income areas. The rally underscored that without full funding, vulnerable riders—especially those with disabilities—face continued barriers and danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
