A truck keeps moving. On April 4, a 39-year-old pedestrian was crushed by a box truck on West 40th and 9th. He died in the street. No second chances. Just nineteen days later, a 57-year-old man was killed by an SUV while crossing Broadway at West 86th. The numbers do not stop. <strong>In the last twelve months, SD 47 saw 6 deaths, 20 serious injuries, and 879 people hurt in 1,738 crashes</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p><strong>The old, the young, the ones just trying to get home.</strong></p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>SUVs, trucks, sedans—they do most of the damage. <strong>SUVs alone killed 4 pedestrians and injured 185 more in this district since 2022</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Buses and bikes hurt too, but the weight of steel and speed is what breaks bodies. The city’s own data shows the pattern: the bigger the vehicle, the greater the harm (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal has taken steps. He voted yes on the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, a bill to force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed-limiting tech. He sponsored a bill for <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S3304>automated bike lane enforcement</a>, aiming to keep lanes clear for cyclists. He co-sponsored <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S153>bus lane camera enforcement</a>. He backed <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Sammy’s Law</a>, which lets NYC lower speed limits. But the blood keeps flowing. <strong>&ldquo;One bus made contact with the rear of the other bus,&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/2-buses-collide-port-authority-shutting-down-14-injured/16916303/>ABC7</a>) said FDNY Deputy Chief Jason Saffon after a crash at Port Authority that left 14 injured. <strong>&ldquo;It required some extrication, meaning they had to use some equipment to free the patient.&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/2-buses-collide-port-authority-shutting-down-14-injured/16916303/>ABC7</a>)</p><h3 id=the-work-left-to-do>The Work Left to Do</h3><p><strong>The crisis is not over.</strong> Laws that sound tough often land hardest on the vulnerable. Crackdowns on cyclists and e-bike riders do not stop SUVs from killing. Cameras in bike lanes help, but only if the lanes are protected and clear. Speed limits save lives, but only if enforced. The dead cannot speak. The living must.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call Senator Hoylman-Sigal. Demand a 20 mph speed limit.

The board called on the Department of Motor Vehicles to impose civil penalties on unregistered dealers and urged city and state officials to enforce laws against selling non-street-legal mopeds. The resolution also asks the city to consider a buy-back program for gas-powered mopeds. The matter, titled 'Upper West Side Panel Backs Resolution to Rein in Dangerous Mopeds,' supports Albany legislation requiring sellers to register mopeds with the DMV before sale. State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assembly Member Alex Bores sponsor the bill. Bores said, 'We need to cut off the flow of these vehicles before they get onto these streets.' The board’s move aims to close loopholes, protect vulnerable road users, and address the chaos caused by unregistered mopeds.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill aims to block illegal, unregistered mopeds from city streets. Dealers, not riders, would handle paperwork. Advocates say this targets bad actors and protects pedestrians from rogue machines.</p><p class=mb3>On October 23, 2023, State Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal (D-Manhattan) introduced a bill in Albany to require moped dealers to register vehicles with the DMV before buyers leave the shop. The bill, supported by Assembly Member Alex Bores (D-Upper East Side), seeks to close a loophole that lets illegal mopeds flood city streets. The matter summary states: 'New legislation in Albany seeks to eliminate the use of illegal mopeds by requiring sellers to register them with the DMV before buyers can take them out of the shop.' Hoylman-Sigal said, 'This common-sense bill would simply ensure that the registration happens at the point of sale, before someone rides out of the shop.' Ligia Guallpa of the Worker's Justice Project backs the move, stressing manufacturer responsibility. Attorney Daniel Flanzig says the law could clear streets of unregistered, dangerous vehicles. The bill is not yet law, but enforcement actions against illegal mopeds are already underway.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, discussed in October 2023, has not specified a streamlined process for licensing. The matter’s summary states: 'Holden's bill does nothing to rectify the fundamental issues of inadequate space and dangerous workplace practices.' Holden and his colleagues push regulation, but critics say the bill ignores the real threats: narrow sidewalks, blocked crosswalks, and unsafe delivery work. The proposal would burden riders and discourage micromobility, while failing to address illegal mopeds or car dominance. State Senator Brad Hoylman’s employer-provided ID plan is cited as a better alternative. The opinion calls for protected bike lanes, wider sidewalks, and fair enforcement, not more bureaucracy.

Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary sponsor), Gale A. Brewer, Shaun Abreu, Lynn C. Schulman, and Amanda Farías backed the resolution.

Police claim safety, but data show cars and trucks cause most harm. App companies profit. Immigrant workers pay. Advocates say crackdowns punish the vulnerable, not the reckless. The city misses the real threat.</p><p class=mb3>On July 14, 2023, NYPD officers from Brooklyn’s 78th Precinct seized illegal mopeds from delivery workers outside fast-food chains. The enforcement action follows years of crackdowns dating back to Mayor Bloomberg, ramped up under Mayor de Blasio. Police say the seizures make streets safer, but city crash data show cars and trucks—not e-bikes or mopeds—cause most pedestrian injuries. Delivery worker Roziev Akmal warned, 'Livelihoods will be ruined because of the seizure.' Ligia Guallpa of the Worker’s Justice Project called it 'another example where you see deliveristas being economically impacted.' State Sen. Brad Hoylman and Council Member Gale Brewer cited constituent complaints, but advocates and legal experts argue enforcement targets workers, not the root causes. The crackdown leaves low-paid, mostly immigrant workers exposed to fines, lost income, and road danger, while app companies escape responsibility.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
