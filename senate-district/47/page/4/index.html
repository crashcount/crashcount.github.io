The bodies are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. On May 31, a 79-year-old man died in a tangle of SUVs on West 77th Street. In April, a 57-year-old man was crushed crossing Broadway at 86th. A cyclist, age 74, was killed on West End Avenue. The list goes on. No week passes without blood on the asphalt.</p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>The pain is not abstract. It is a neck twisted in a bus seat, a father holding his son’s hand in the crosswalk, a woman struck twice by bikes in Central Park and left with kidney damage. &ldquo;A lot of them with musculoskeletal injuries, neck pain, back pain,&rdquo; said <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/multiple-injuries-2-buses-crash-ramp-port-authority-nyc/17274379/>FDNY Deputy Assistant Chief Joseph Pataky</a> after a bus slammed into another at Port Authority. The system shrugs. The ramp where it happened is a known bottleneck, set for replacement years from now. The next crash is already on the calendar.</p><h2 id=leadership-progress-and-pressure>Leadership: Progress and Pressure</h2><p>Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal has taken real steps. He voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed-limiting devices. He co-sponsored bills for automated bike lane enforcement and moped registration. He backed Sammy’s Law, giving the city power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the deaths keep coming. The bills are not yet law. The streets are not yet safe. &ldquo;This is about trying to eliminate all unnecessary deaths, and one of the ways you do that is by making the speed limit lower,&rdquo; said <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/lawmakers-to-allow-nyc-to-lower-speed-limit-to-20-mph>Assemblymember Linda Rosenthal</a>, echoing the urgency.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p>The crisis is not fate. It is policy. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand action on repeat speeders. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill aims to block illegal, unregistered mopeds from city streets. Dealers, not riders, would handle paperwork. Advocates say this targets bad actors and protects pedestrians from rogue machines.</p><p class=mb3>On October 23, 2023, State Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal (D-Manhattan) introduced a bill in Albany to require moped dealers to register vehicles with the DMV before buyers leave the shop. The bill, supported by Assembly Member Alex Bores (D-Upper East Side), seeks to close a loophole that lets illegal mopeds flood city streets. The matter summary states: 'New legislation in Albany seeks to eliminate the use of illegal mopeds by requiring sellers to register them with the DMV before buyers can take them out of the shop.' Hoylman-Sigal said, 'This common-sense bill would simply ensure that the registration happens at the point of sale, before someone rides out of the shop.' Ligia Guallpa of the Worker's Justice Project backs the move, stressing manufacturer responsibility. Attorney Daniel Flanzig says the law could clear streets of unregistered, dangerous vehicles. The bill is not yet law, but enforcement actions against illegal mopeds are already underway.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, discussed in October 2023, has not specified a streamlined process for licensing. The matter’s summary states: 'Holden's bill does nothing to rectify the fundamental issues of inadequate space and dangerous workplace practices.' Holden and his colleagues push regulation, but critics say the bill ignores the real threats: narrow sidewalks, blocked crosswalks, and unsafe delivery work. The proposal would burden riders and discourage micromobility, while failing to address illegal mopeds or car dominance. State Senator Brad Hoylman’s employer-provided ID plan is cited as a better alternative. The opinion calls for protected bike lanes, wider sidewalks, and fair enforcement, not more bureaucracy.

The city stalls.</p><p class=mb3>On September 26, 2023, Councilmember Shahana Hanif (District 39) issued a statement following a severe crash at Fifth Avenue and Union Street in Park Slope. The incident left Jacob Priley, a cyclist and advocate, critically injured. Hanif highlighted the intersection’s deadly history, referencing the 2021 death of Arcellie Muschamp. She pressed the Department of Transportation for urgent safety upgrades, saying, 'How many more crashes until the DOT pays attention?' Hanif noted the recent completion of a protected bike lane on Ninth Street but stressed that more action is needed. She thanked neighbors for their support and vowed to work with the DOT. So far in 2023, 3,702 cyclists have been injured and 22 killed on New York City streets. The city’s pace on safety remains too slow for those at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crisis demands a fix beyond punishing workers.</p><p class=mb3>This policy debate, published August 23, 2023, analyzes New York City’s 'moped crisis.' The article, reviewed by Streetsblog NYC, highlights systemic failures: unsafe streets, lack of charging infrastructure, and tech companies shifting risk onto underpaid delivery workers. Council Member Alexa Aviles urges rapid expansion of e-bike charging stations and blames corporate greed. State Senators Jessica Ramos and Brad Hoylman-Sigal call for industry accountability and a standardized, safe delivery vehicle. The matter summary states, 'The city needs a systemic fix, justice for workers and accountability by tech giants.' Advocacy groups reject punitive crackdowns on workers, pushing instead for expanded bike lanes and public infrastructure. The piece concludes that only a multi-pronged, structural approach—never just enforcement—will protect vulnerable road users and delivery workers alike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
