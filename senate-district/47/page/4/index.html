Sixty-three left with serious injuries.</strong> Nearly 6,500 crashes since 2022. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. A 69-year-old woman, crossing with the light at Amsterdam and 96th, was struck and killed by a turning SUV. She had the signal. She did not make it home. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p>Just last month, a food cart broke loose from a van on 42nd Street. It slammed into a parked car with a woman and a ten-year-old boy inside. Firefighters found the van packed with 76 propane tanks and 75 gallons of gasoline. The driver was charged with reckless endangerment. The woman and child survived, but the street was one spark away from disaster. Firefighters <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/cops-bust-minivan-driver-in-manhattan-for-carrying-propane-tanks/>removed 76 propane cylinders and 15 fuel containers</a>.</p><p>On July 2nd, two buses collided inside the Port Authority Terminal. Fourteen people were hurt. Emergency crews had to drive the wrong way up a ramp to reach the injured. &ldquo;One bus made contact with the rear of the other bus,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/2-buses-collide-port-authority-shutting-down-14-injured/16916303/>said Deputy Chief Jason Saffon</a>. &ldquo;It required some extrication, meaning they had to use some equipment to free the patient.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=the-policy-response-progress-and-gaps>The Policy Response: Progress and Gaps</h3><p><strong>Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal has moved.</strong> He co-sponsored and voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed-limiting devices. He backed the extension of school speed zones. He sponsored bills for automated bike and bus lane enforcement. He pushed for moped registration and safer e-bike batteries. He fought for the law that lets New York City drop the speed limit to 20 mph. &ldquo;This is about trying to eliminate all unnecessary deaths, and one of the ways you do that is by making the speed limit lower,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/lawmakers-to-allow-nyc-to-lower-speed-limit-to-20-mph>said Senator Hoylman-Sigal</a>.</p><p>But the streets are not safe yet. <strong>SUVs and trucks still kill. Buses still crush. Repeat speeders still drive.</strong> The city has the power to lower the speed limit. It has not done so citywide. The carnage continues.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every death is preventable.</strong> Every injury is a failure of policy, not fate. The time for half-measures is over. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Tell them to use the laws Senator Hoylman-Sigal helped pass. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand enforcement that targets the real killers—speed, red lights, blocked lanes. <strong>Do not let another family become a number.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Advocates say this targets bad actors and protects pedestrians from rogue machines.</p><p class=mb3>On October 23, 2023, State Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal (D-Manhattan) introduced a bill in Albany to require moped dealers to register vehicles with the DMV before buyers leave the shop. The bill, supported by Assembly Member Alex Bores (D-Upper East Side), seeks to close a loophole that lets illegal mopeds flood city streets. The matter summary states: 'New legislation in Albany seeks to eliminate the use of illegal mopeds by requiring sellers to register them with the DMV before buyers can take them out of the shop.' Hoylman-Sigal said, 'This common-sense bill would simply ensure that the registration happens at the point of sale, before someone rides out of the shop.' Ligia Guallpa of the Worker's Justice Project backs the move, stressing manufacturer responsibility. Attorney Daniel Flanzig says the law could clear streets of unregistered, dangerous vehicles. The bill is not yet law, but enforcement actions against illegal mopeds are already underway.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter’s summary states: 'Holden's bill does nothing to rectify the fundamental issues of inadequate space and dangerous workplace practices.' Holden and his colleagues push regulation, but critics say the bill ignores the real threats: narrow sidewalks, blocked crosswalks, and unsafe delivery work. The proposal would burden riders and discourage micromobility, while failing to address illegal mopeds or car dominance. State Senator Brad Hoylman’s employer-provided ID plan is cited as a better alternative. The opinion calls for protected bike lanes, wider sidewalks, and fair enforcement, not more bureaucracy.

The matter summary states, 'The city needs a systemic fix, justice for workers and accountability by tech giants.' Advocacy groups reject punitive crackdowns on workers, pushing instead for expanded bike lanes and public infrastructure. The piece concludes that only a multi-pronged, structural approach—never just enforcement—will protect vulnerable road users and delivery workers alike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city misses the real threat.</p><p class=mb3>On July 14, 2023, NYPD officers from Brooklyn’s 78th Precinct seized illegal mopeds from delivery workers outside fast-food chains. The enforcement action follows years of crackdowns dating back to Mayor Bloomberg, ramped up under Mayor de Blasio. Police say the seizures make streets safer, but city crash data show cars and trucks—not e-bikes or mopeds—cause most pedestrian injuries. Delivery worker Roziev Akmal warned, 'Livelihoods will be ruined because of the seizure.' Ligia Guallpa of the Worker’s Justice Project called it 'another example where you see deliveristas being economically impacted.' State Sen. Brad Hoylman and Council Member Gale Brewer cited constituent complaints, but advocates and legal experts argue enforcement targets workers, not the root causes. The crackdown leaves low-paid, mostly immigrant workers exposed to fines, lost income, and road danger, while app companies escape responsibility.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
