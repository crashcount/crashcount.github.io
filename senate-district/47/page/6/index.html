A truck crushes him on 9th Avenue. He is 39. Dead at the scene. A 69-year-old woman crosses with the light at Amsterdam and 96th. An SUV turns left. She never makes it to the other side. Five people have died on these streets in the last year. <strong>Nearly 800 more are injured.</strong> Seventeen are left with wounds that will never heal. The numbers do not flinch: <strong>20 killed, 2,812 injured, 60 seriously hurt</strong> in SD 47 since 2022, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-is-relentless>The Pattern Is Relentless</h3><p>The machines do not care. <strong>SUVs, sedans, trucks, and buses</strong> are the main weapons.

He backed the expansion of <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>24/7 speed cameras</a> and called for more protected bike lanes. He has spoken out for laws that target reckless drivers, not just vulnerable road users. But the work is not done. The city can lower the speed limit now. The state can pass the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>. The council can demand more daylighted intersections and camera enforcement for blocked bike lanes. The senator has moved, but the crisis moves faster.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay means another name on the list.</strong> Call your council member. Call the senator. Demand the 20 mph limit. Demand action against repeat speeders. <strong>Do not wait for another empty chair.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill would require all new cars registered in the state to have speed-limiting technology by 2024. It also directs the Department of Motor Vehicles to set visibility rules for vehicles over 3,000 pounds, like SUVs and pickups, to ensure drivers can see pedestrians and cyclists. The bill summary states: 'A new bill in the New York State Senate would require all new cars registered in the state to have speed-limiting technology by 2024.' Senator Hoylman sponsored the bill, citing the 'failure of the promise of Vision Zero.' Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives praised the measure, calling it 'common-sense.' The bill comes as pedestrian deaths hit a 40-year high. If passed, it would force automakers to include safety tech and could make some monster trucks illegal on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lawmakers extended New York City's school-zone speed camera program for three years, allowing 24/7 operation—a win for street safety. The bill, however, was watered down. Other measures under the 'Crash Victims Rights and Safety Act' saw mixed results: some passed, like upstate towns setting 25 mph speed limits and increased complete streets funding; others, like 'Sammy's Law' for NYC speed limits and expanded safe passing for cyclists, stalled. The matter title called the session 'historic, yet deeply disappointing.' Adams was not a sponsor but was referenced in the debate. Advocates and senators voiced frustration at the lack of progress on local speed limit control and measures against repeat reckless drivers.

Drivers idle near playgrounds, hospitals. Danger grows.</p><p class=mb3>On March 4, 2022, the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) held a public hearing on a proposed rule change to New York City's vehicle idling law. The change would broaden the definition of 'processing device,' letting more vehicles idle legally. Manhattan Community Board 4 voted unanimously to reject the change, warning, 'These exemptions... would create an argument that just about any activity that requires power in a vehicle is an idling defense.' State Sen. Brad Hoylman testified, 'Drivers most often idle in front of highly trafficked pedestrian areas... those that live near large roadways face serious health repercussions.' Advocates, residents, and Dr. Patrick Schnell all opposed the proposal, citing health and environmental harm. Spectrum requested a variance, but all testimony opposed it. The DEP claims the change clarifies the law, but enforcement is already weak and large companies are frequent violators. No safety analyst assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
