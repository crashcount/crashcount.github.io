Twenty seriously hurt. In the last year alone, 881 people in Senate District 47 were injured in crashes. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about the weather or the hour. They do not care if you are young or old. A 69-year-old woman, crossing with the light at Amsterdam and 96th, was killed by a turning SUV. She had the right of way. She is gone. See the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash records</a>.</p><p>On April 24, a 74-year-old man riding his bike was killed at West End Avenue and 70th. A bus and a bicycle. The bus was parked. The man died. No warning. No second chance.

They are walking, riding, crossing, living. The streets are not safe. Trucks, SUVs, taxis, bikes—all can kill. But the biggest toll comes from cars and trucks: six deaths, sixteen serious injuries, 580 crashes in the last three years. Bikes and mopeds hurt too, but the numbers are smaller. The pain is not.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h2><p>Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal has voted for safer street design and supported bills for lower speed limits and better enforcement. He backed the law that lets New York City set its own speed limits. He voted yes on the complete streets bill. He supported more speed cameras and called for camera enforcement of blocked bike lanes. But the pace is slow. The danger does not wait.</p><p>The city and state talk about Vision Zero. But the bodies keep coming. &ldquo;One bus made contact with the rear of the other bus,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/2-buses-collide-port-authority-shutting-down-14-injured/16916303/>said an FDNY chief</a> after a crash that injured fourteen at Port Authority. &ldquo;It required some extrication, meaning they had to use some equipment to free the patient.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=the-call-to-action>The Call to Action</h2><p>Every day of delay is another day of risk. Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand enforcement that targets the real danger—speed, reckless driving, blocked bike lanes. Join the fight. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The plan, discussed in committee, seeks to reduce or eliminate parking minimums for new developments. The matter summary states the proposal will 'prioritize people over parking, aiming to make streets safer and reduce parking requirements to enable more housing and amenities.' Restler said, 'In urban hubs like Lower Manhattan, the heart of the South Bronx, Downtown Brooklyn or Downtown Jamaica, we need affordable housing, economic development with good jobs, and dynamic mixed use buildings, not more parking.' The bill has drawn support from advocates and developers, who argue that parking mandates drive up housing costs and disrupt pedestrian-friendly streets. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams remained noncommittal, focusing on the housing crisis and bureaucracy.

Council Member Lincoln Restler supports the move, saying, 'we need affordable housing, economic development... not more parking.' State Sen. Brad Hoylman calls parking spaces a poor use of land amid a housing crisis. Advocates like Sara Lind urge full elimination, citing pollution and congestion. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams remains noncommittal, focusing on the housing crisis and open to review. The proposal is in early stages, with state legislation also in play.

The bill would require all new cars registered in the state to have speed-limiting technology by 2024. It also directs the Department of Motor Vehicles to set visibility rules for vehicles over 3,000 pounds, like SUVs and pickups, to ensure drivers can see pedestrians and cyclists. The bill summary states: 'A new bill in the New York State Senate would require all new cars registered in the state to have speed-limiting technology by 2024.' Senator Hoylman sponsored the bill, citing the 'failure of the promise of Vision Zero.' Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives praised the measure, calling it 'common-sense.' The bill comes as pedestrian deaths hit a 40-year high. If passed, it would force automakers to include safety tech and could make some monster trucks illegal on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lawmakers extended New York City's school-zone speed camera program for three years, allowing 24/7 operation—a win for street safety. The bill, however, was watered down. Other measures under the 'Crash Victims Rights and Safety Act' saw mixed results: some passed, like upstate towns setting 25 mph speed limits and increased complete streets funding; others, like 'Sammy's Law' for NYC speed limits and expanded safe passing for cyclists, stalled. The matter title called the session 'historic, yet deeply disappointing.' Adams was not a sponsor but was referenced in the debate. Advocates and senators voiced frustration at the lack of progress on local speed limit control and measures against repeat reckless drivers. The session left vulnerable road users without key protections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lawmakers extended and expanded New York City’s school-zone speed camera program to operate 24/7 for three more years. The bill passed, but was watered down from its original form. Other key street safety bills, including 'Sammy’s Law'—which would let NYC set its own speed limits—did not advance. Senator Andrew Gounardes called the speed camera win 'monumental,' while Senator Brad Hoylman said, 'not as much as any of us would have wanted to see, but for the first time, speed cameras are normalized.' Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives voiced disappointment over the failure of Sammy’s Law, calling it a top priority for Families for Safe Streets. Several other bills to protect pedestrians and cyclists stalled or died in committee. The session brought some progress, but left many dangers unaddressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill aims to fine drivers $50 for each infraction, targeting those who block or drive in bike lanes. The matter summary states: 'NYC pols propose traffic cameras to deter drivers from using bike lanes.' Mamdani and Hoylman argue that enforcement is critical, with Mamdani stating, 'You consistently see cars driving in the bike lane. We know that these cameras work to deter drivers from breaking the law.' DOT supports the measure, calling it 'life-saving automated enforcement technology.' The bill awaits City Council approval, with Mamdani pledging to advance it through the summer and fall.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
