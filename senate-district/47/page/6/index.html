The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about age. A 69-year-old woman was killed crossing with the signal at Amsterdam and 96th. A 39-year-old man died under the wheels of a truck on West 40th. A 74-year-old cyclist was struck by a bus on West End Avenue. The street does not forgive.</p><h2 id=the-latest-wounds>The Latest Wounds</h2><p>Just weeks ago, a van loaded with 76 propane tanks and 75 gallons of gasoline broke loose and slammed into a parked car with a woman and child inside. The driver was arrested for reckless endangerment. Firefighters forced entry to remove the fuel. The woman and boy went to the hospital. The air stank of gas and fear. Firefighters <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/cops-bust-minivan-driver-in-manhattan-for-carrying-propane-tanks/>forced entry into the van, removing 76 20-pound propane cylinders and 15 five-gallon fuel containers</a>.

The <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/driver-arrested-nypd-discovers-75-gallons-gasoline-10-diesel-inside-van-manhattan-nyc/17154624/>driver was arrested and facing several charges, including reckless endangerment and multiple fire code violations</a>.</p><h2 id=leadership-progress-and-pressure>Leadership: Progress and Pressure</h2><p>Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal has moved. He co-sponsored and voted yes on the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting devices. He backed the <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/lawmakers-to-allow-nyc-to-lower-speed-limit-to-20-mph>law that lets NYC drop speed limits to 20 mph</a>. He sponsored bills for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/07/12/moped-and-e-bike-safety-legislation-becomes-state-law>automated bike lane enforcement</a> and <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S3304>moped registration</a>.

The plan, discussed in committee, seeks to reduce or eliminate parking minimums for new developments. The matter summary states the proposal will 'prioritize people over parking, aiming to make streets safer and reduce parking requirements to enable more housing and amenities.' Restler said, 'In urban hubs like Lower Manhattan, the heart of the South Bronx, Downtown Brooklyn or Downtown Jamaica, we need affordable housing, economic development with good jobs, and dynamic mixed use buildings, not more parking.' The bill has drawn support from advocates and developers, who argue that parking mandates drive up housing costs and disrupt pedestrian-friendly streets.

Council Member Lincoln Restler supports the move, saying, 'we need affordable housing, economic development... not more parking.' State Sen. Brad Hoylman calls parking spaces a poor use of land amid a housing crisis. Advocates like Sara Lind urge full elimination, citing pollution and congestion. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams remains noncommittal, focusing on the housing crisis and open to review. The proposal is in early stages, with state legislation also in play.

The bill would require all new cars registered in the state to have speed-limiting technology by 2024. It also directs the Department of Motor Vehicles to set visibility rules for vehicles over 3,000 pounds, like SUVs and pickups, to ensure drivers can see pedestrians and cyclists. The bill summary states: 'A new bill in the New York State Senate would require all new cars registered in the state to have speed-limiting technology by 2024.' Senator Hoylman sponsored the bill, citing the 'failure of the promise of Vision Zero.' Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives praised the measure, calling it 'common-sense.' The bill comes as pedestrian deaths hit a 40-year high. If passed, it would force automakers to include safety tech and could make some monster trucks illegal on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lawmakers extended New York City's school-zone speed camera program for three years, allowing 24/7 operation—a win for street safety. The bill, however, was watered down. Other measures under the 'Crash Victims Rights and Safety Act' saw mixed results: some passed, like upstate towns setting 25 mph speed limits and increased complete streets funding; others, like 'Sammy's Law' for NYC speed limits and expanded safe passing for cyclists, stalled. The matter title called the session 'historic, yet deeply disappointing.' Adams was not a sponsor but was referenced in the debate. Advocates and senators voiced frustration at the lack of progress on local speed limit control and measures against repeat reckless drivers.
