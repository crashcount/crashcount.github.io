The dead include four people over 65. The injured are young and old, walkers and cyclists, children and elders. The numbers do not heal. They do not forget.</p><p>Just last week, thirty people were hurt when a New Jersey Transit bus slammed into another on the Port Authority ramp. The FDNY described the aftermath: <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/multiple-injuries-2-buses-crash-ramp-port-authority-nyc/17274379/>&ldquo;A lot of them with musculoskeletal injuries, neck pain, back pain.&rdquo;</a> Another report called it the second bus crash at the terminal this month, a pattern that leaves passengers and bystanders at risk. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/about-30-people-injured-as-buses-crash-on-port-authority-ramp>&ldquo;About 30 people were injured in a bus collision on the Port Authority Bus Terminal ramp on Thursday morning, according to the FDNY and alerts from transit agencies.&rdquo;</a></p><p>SUVs, trucks, and sedans do most of the harm. In three years, they killed 14 people and injured hundreds more. Bikes and mopeds also hurt, but the carnage is driven by bigger, faster vehicles. The streets are not safe for the frail or the quick, the careful or the distracted. The disaster is slow, but it does not stop.</p><h2 id=what-has-senator-hoylman-sigal-done>What Has Senator Hoylman-Sigal Done?</h2><p>Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal has moved. He co-sponsored and voted for the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, which would force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. He backed the law that lets New York City <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/lawmakers-to-allow-nyc-to-lower-speed-limit-to-20-mph>lower its speed limit to 20 mph</a>. He pushed for <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S3304>automated bike lane enforcement</a> and tougher rules for mopeds and e-bikes, aiming to shift accountability to retailers and repeat offenders, not delivery workers. But the blood on the street says it is not enough. The city has the power to lower speeds. It has not done so.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-ours>The Next Step Is Ours</h2><p>Every day the city delays, another family risks losing someone. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand the city use the laws Albany gave it. Demand real protection for the people who walk, ride, and wait at the curb. The disaster is not fate. It is policy. It can be stopped. But only if you act.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, sponsored by Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal, has stalled in the legislature before. Hochul’s State of the State address declared, 'she will introduce her own version of the existing "Sammy's Law" bill.' Hoylman-Sigal called City Council members his 'partners' and urged their support. Amy Cohen, whose son was killed by a speeding driver, pressed the Council to act, saying, 'We need the Council to make it a priority to support Sammy's Law and redesign streets ... at a safe speed limit.' DOT spokesman Vin Barone added, 'DOT strongly supports Sammy’s Law.' The Adams administration and street safety advocates back the measure. If passed, the law would let the city drop speed limits below 25 mph citywide and below 15 mph near schools, giving local officials real power to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, discussed in committee, seeks to reduce or eliminate parking minimums for new developments. The matter summary states the proposal will 'prioritize people over parking, aiming to make streets safer and reduce parking requirements to enable more housing and amenities.' Restler said, 'In urban hubs like Lower Manhattan, the heart of the South Bronx, Downtown Brooklyn or Downtown Jamaica, we need affordable housing, economic development with good jobs, and dynamic mixed use buildings, not more parking.' The bill has drawn support from advocates and developers, who argue that parking mandates drive up housing costs and disrupt pedestrian-friendly streets. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams remained noncommittal, focusing on the housing crisis and bureaucracy. The proposal’s fate will shape the city’s streets and who they serve.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, now under council review, seeks to eliminate or reduce parking minimums citywide. The proposal’s summary states it will 'prioritize people over parking,' aiming to make streets safer and housing more affordable. Council Member Lincoln Restler supports the move, saying, 'we need affordable housing, economic development... not more parking.' State Sen. Brad Hoylman calls parking spaces a poor use of land amid a housing crisis. Advocates like Sara Lind urge full elimination, citing pollution and congestion. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams remains noncommittal, focusing on the housing crisis and open to review. The proposal is in early stages, with state legislation also in play. No formal safety analysis for vulnerable road users has been published.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill would require all new cars registered in the state to have speed-limiting technology by 2024. It also directs the Department of Motor Vehicles to set visibility rules for vehicles over 3,000 pounds, like SUVs and pickups, to ensure drivers can see pedestrians and cyclists. The bill summary states: 'A new bill in the New York State Senate would require all new cars registered in the state to have speed-limiting technology by 2024.' Senator Hoylman sponsored the bill, citing the 'failure of the promise of Vision Zero.' Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives praised the measure, calling it 'common-sense.' The bill comes as pedestrian deaths hit a 40-year high. If passed, it would force automakers to include safety tech and could make some monster trucks illegal on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
