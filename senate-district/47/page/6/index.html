According to the police report, a 48-year-old unlicensed woman riding a motorscooter was struck head-on by a southbound motorcycle. She wore a helmet, but it did not save her. She was ejected and died from severe head wounds. The 26-year-old man on the motorcycle survived, suffering injuries to his lower leg and foot. The police report lists 'Unsafe Speed' as a contributing factor in the collision. The motorscooter driver was unlicensed, but the report centers on speed as the primary cause. No pedestrians or bystanders were involved. The force of the impact left one dead and one injured, marking another violent night on New York City streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
