In the last twelve months, seven people died and 1,009 were injured in 2,034 crashes. Twenty-three suffered serious injuries. The old and the young are not spared. Four people over 65 died. Children under 18 were hurt forty-six times. Each number is a body, a family, a life changed or ended.</p><p>Just last month, two buses collided at the Port Authority ramp. Thirty people were sent to the hospital. The FDNY called it &ldquo;a lot of them with musculoskeletal injuries, neck pain, back pain,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/multiple-injuries-2-buses-crash-ramp-port-authority-nyc/17274379/>said Deputy Assistant Chief Joseph Pataky</a>. The ramp is a known bottleneck. The city says it will be fixed by 2032. That is seven years and hundreds of crashes away.</p><h2 id=the-system-fails-the-vulnerable>The System Fails the Vulnerable</h2><p>SUVs and cars do the most harm. In this district, they killed six and injured hundreds more. Trucks and buses killed two. Bikes caused over 100 injuries. The streets are not safe for anyone who walks, rides, or waits for a bus. The old rules do not protect the old bones.</p><p>In Central Park, a 72-year-old woman was hit by cyclists twice. She suffered kidney damage. The NYPD never followed up. &ldquo;Ninety percent of their crashes have no police report and in 90 percent of these crashes over 90 percent the rider flees the scene,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/she-was-hit-twice-by-bikes-in-central-park-and-says-nypd-never-followed-up-IH4810802>said Janet Schroeder</a>. The city counts the dead, but not the broken.</p><h2 id=leadership-progress-and-pressure>Leadership: Progress and Pressure</h2><p>Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal has taken steps. He co-sponsored and voted for the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed-limiting devices <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>see bill S 4045</a>. He backed the law letting NYC lower speed limits to 20 mph <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/lawmakers-to-allow-nyc-to-lower-speed-limit-to-20-mph>see Sammy’s Law</a>. He sponsored bills for automated bike lane enforcement and safer bus lanes. But the streets are still killing. The laws are not yet enough.</p><p>Every day without action is another day of blood on the asphalt.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-demand-more-demand-now>Call to Action: Demand More, Demand Now</h2><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call Senator Hoylman-Sigal. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat speeders. Demand streets that put people before cars. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, sponsored by Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal, has stalled in the legislature before. Hochul’s State of the State address declared, 'she will introduce her own version of the existing "Sammy's Law" bill.' Hoylman-Sigal called City Council members his 'partners' and urged their support. Amy Cohen, whose son was killed by a speeding driver, pressed the Council to act, saying, 'We need the Council to make it a priority to support Sammy's Law and redesign streets ... at a safe speed limit.' DOT spokesman Vin Barone added, 'DOT strongly supports Sammy’s Law.' The Adams administration and street safety advocates back the measure. If passed, the law would let the city drop speed limits below 25 mph citywide and below 15 mph near schools, giving local officials real power to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, discussed in committee, seeks to reduce or eliminate parking minimums for new developments. The matter summary states the proposal will 'prioritize people over parking, aiming to make streets safer and reduce parking requirements to enable more housing and amenities.' Restler said, 'In urban hubs like Lower Manhattan, the heart of the South Bronx, Downtown Brooklyn or Downtown Jamaica, we need affordable housing, economic development with good jobs, and dynamic mixed use buildings, not more parking.' The bill has drawn support from advocates and developers, who argue that parking mandates drive up housing costs and disrupt pedestrian-friendly streets. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams remained noncommittal, focusing on the housing crisis and bureaucracy. The proposal’s fate will shape the city’s streets and who they serve.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal’s summary states it will 'prioritize people over parking,' aiming to make streets safer and housing more affordable. Council Member Lincoln Restler supports the move, saying, 'we need affordable housing, economic development... not more parking.' State Sen. Brad Hoylman calls parking spaces a poor use of land amid a housing crisis. Advocates like Sara Lind urge full elimination, citing pollution and congestion. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams remains noncommittal, focusing on the housing crisis and open to review. The proposal is in early stages, with state legislation also in play.
