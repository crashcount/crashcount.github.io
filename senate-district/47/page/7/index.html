A truck crushes him on 9th Avenue. He does not get up. A cyclist, 74, collides with a bus on West End Avenue. He dies at the scene. An elderly woman, 69, is killed crossing with the signal at Amsterdam and 96th. The SUV that hits her is making a left turn. The numbers do not soften: <strong>20 dead, 60 seriously injured, 2,808 hurt</strong> in SD 47 since 2022. The old, the young, the ones just trying to get home.</p><p>Just last week, three NJ Transit buses crashed at Port Authority. Fourteen people were hurt. The ramp was closed for hours. &ldquo;One with moderate injuries that required extrication, 10 patients with minor injuries all transported to local area hospitals,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/port-authority-bus-terminal-accident-nyc/>said FDNY Deputy Chief Jason Saffon</a>. The city rerouted traffic. The pain stayed put.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p>The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors. The old man on a bike. The woman in the crosswalk. The man dragged by a truck. <strong>SUVs and cars killed six. Trucks and buses killed two. Bikes killed none.</strong> The pattern is clear. The largest vehicles do the most harm. The city records the bodies, the broken bones, the lives cut short. The street does not care who had the light. Only who is left standing.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal has voted for safer street design, for more cameras, for lower speed limits. He backed the law that lets NYC set its own speed. He sponsored new rules to register mopeds and collect crash data. &ldquo;By requiring the registration of mopeds at point of sale and the collection of e-bike collision data, we are making our streets safer and increasing accountability,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/07/12/moped-and-e-bike-safety-legislation-becomes-state-law>said Assemblymember Alex Bores</a>. Hoylman-Sigal has called for more. But the deaths keep coming. The city has the power to lower speeds to 20 mph. It has not done so everywhere. The law is not enough. The street is not safe.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit on every street. Demand action, not delay.</strong> The dead cannot speak.

Drivers idle near playgrounds, hospitals. Danger grows.</p><p class=mb3>On March 4, 2022, the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) held a public hearing on a proposed rule change to New York City's vehicle idling law. The change would broaden the definition of 'processing device,' letting more vehicles idle legally. Manhattan Community Board 4 voted unanimously to reject the change, warning, 'These exemptions... would create an argument that just about any activity that requires power in a vehicle is an idling defense.' State Sen. Brad Hoylman testified, 'Drivers most often idle in front of highly trafficked pedestrian areas... those that live near large roadways face serious health repercussions.' Advocates, residents, and Dr. Patrick Schnell all opposed the proposal, citing health and environmental harm. Spectrum requested a variance, but all testimony opposed it. The DEP claims the change clarifies the law, but enforcement is already weak and large companies are frequent violators. No safety analyst assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No summons was issued to the driver or passenger for the illegal act. The area, plagued by 913 crashes in three years, has injured dozens of cyclists and pedestrians. Council Member Erik Bottcher and State Senator Brad Hoylman responded by rallying with advocacy groups, demanding protected bike lanes on 10th and 11th avenues. Hoylman tweeted, 'The City must make the streets of the West Side safer!' The Hudson River Greenway, a nearby bike path, bans legal e-bikes, forcing riders like Kwan onto dangerous streets. This was the city’s first cyclist death of 2022, amid a rising toll of road fatalities.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill targets car dominance, aims to cut congestion, and free space for homes. Sen. Hoylman leads the charge. The move could shift city streets, making room for people, not just cars.</p><p class=mb3>Senate Bill, introduced by Sen. Brad Hoylman (D-Manhattan), would ban cities from forcing developers to build off-street parking in new projects. The bill, considered as of January 31, 2022, is under review by the state legislature. The measure, described as aiming to 'encourage public transit use, reduce car ownership, and address climate change,' would give New York City 180 days to update zoning if passed. Sen. Hoylman, the sponsor, calls parking minimums 'backwards' and a barrier to affordable housing. Sen. Alessandra Biaggi (D-Bronx) has shown support for similar efforts. The Department of City Planning and the governor's office will review the legislation if it advances. The bill does not ban parking outright, but removes the mandate, letting developers decide. Advocates say this could lower costs and open space for housing or community needs.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
