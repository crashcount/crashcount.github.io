In the last twelve months, seven people died and 1,009 were injured in 2,034 crashes. Twenty-three suffered serious injuries. The old and the young are not spared. Four people over 65 died. Children under 18 were hurt forty-six times. Each number is a body, a family, a life changed or ended.</p><p>Just last month, two buses collided at the Port Authority ramp. Thirty people were sent to the hospital. The FDNY called it &ldquo;a lot of them with musculoskeletal injuries, neck pain, back pain,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/multiple-injuries-2-buses-crash-ramp-port-authority-nyc/17274379/>said Deputy Assistant Chief Joseph Pataky</a>. The ramp is a known bottleneck. The city says it will be fixed by 2032. That is seven years and hundreds of crashes away.</p><h2 id=the-system-fails-the-vulnerable>The System Fails the Vulnerable</h2><p>SUVs and cars do the most harm. In this district, they killed six and injured hundreds more. Trucks and buses killed two. Bikes caused over 100 injuries. The streets are not safe for anyone who walks, rides, or waits for a bus. The old rules do not protect the old bones.</p><p>In Central Park, a 72-year-old woman was hit by cyclists twice. She suffered kidney damage. The NYPD never followed up. &ldquo;Ninety percent of their crashes have no police report and in 90 percent of these crashes over 90 percent the rider flees the scene,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/she-was-hit-twice-by-bikes-in-central-park-and-says-nypd-never-followed-up-IH4810802>said Janet Schroeder</a>. The city counts the dead, but not the broken.</p><h2 id=leadership-progress-and-pressure>Leadership: Progress and Pressure</h2><p>Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal has taken steps. He co-sponsored and voted for the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed-limiting devices <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>see bill S 4045</a>. He backed the law letting NYC lower speed limits to 20 mph <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/lawmakers-to-allow-nyc-to-lower-speed-limit-to-20-mph>see Sammy’s Law</a>. He sponsored bills for automated bike lane enforcement and safer bus lanes. But the streets are still killing. The laws are not yet enough.</p><p>Every day without action is another day of blood on the asphalt.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-demand-more-demand-now>Call to Action: Demand More, Demand Now</h2><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call Senator Hoylman-Sigal. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat speeders. Demand streets that put people before cars. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Lawmakers extended New York City's school-zone speed camera program for three years, allowing 24/7 operation—a win for street safety. The bill, however, was watered down. Other measures under the 'Crash Victims Rights and Safety Act' saw mixed results: some passed, like upstate towns setting 25 mph speed limits and increased complete streets funding; others, like 'Sammy's Law' for NYC speed limits and expanded safe passing for cyclists, stalled. The matter title called the session 'historic, yet deeply disappointing.' Adams was not a sponsor but was referenced in the debate. Advocates and senators voiced frustration at the lack of progress on local speed limit control and measures against repeat reckless drivers.

Other key street safety bills, including 'Sammy’s Law'—which would let NYC set its own speed limits—did not advance.

Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives voiced disappointment over the failure of Sammy’s Law, calling it a top priority for Families for Safe Streets.

The change would broaden the definition of 'processing device,' letting more vehicles idle legally. Manhattan Community Board 4 voted unanimously to reject the change, warning, 'These exemptions... would create an argument that just about any activity that requires power in a vehicle is an idling defense.' State Sen. Brad Hoylman testified, 'Drivers most often idle in front of highly trafficked pedestrian areas... those that live near large roadways face serious health repercussions.' Advocates, residents, and Dr. Patrick Schnell all opposed the proposal, citing health and environmental harm. Spectrum requested a variance, but all testimony opposed it. The DEP claims the change clarifies the law, but enforcement is already weak and large companies are frequent violators.

Brad Hoylman (D-Manhattan), would ban cities from forcing developers to build off-street parking in new projects. The bill, considered as of January 31, 2022, is under review by the state legislature. The measure, described as aiming to 'encourage public transit use, reduce car ownership, and address climate change,' would give New York City 180 days to update zoning if passed. Sen. Hoylman, the sponsor, calls parking minimums 'backwards' and a barrier to affordable housing. Sen. Alessandra Biaggi (D-Bronx) has shown support for similar efforts. The Department of City Planning and the governor's office will review the legislation if it advances. The bill does not ban parking outright, but removes the mandate, letting developers decide.
