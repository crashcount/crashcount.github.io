Sixty-three left with serious injuries.</strong> Nearly 2,900 hurt since 2022. Each number is a name, a life, a family changed. The dead include children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians. The violence does not stop.</p><p>Just this spring, a <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>74-year-old cyclist was killed by a bus</a> at West 70th and West End. A <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>57-year-old man was crushed by an SUV</a> at Broadway and 86th. A <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>69-year-old woman was struck and killed by a turning SUV</a> while crossing with the signal at Amsterdam and 96th. The street does not forgive. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=the-system-respondsslowly>The System Responds—Slowly</h3><p><strong>Most deaths come from cars and trucks.</strong> SUVs alone killed six, left sixteen with serious injuries, and hurt hundreds more. Trucks and buses killed two, with dozens of injuries. Bikes and mopeds are not blameless, but the carnage is driven by larger vehicles.</p><p>The news does not stop. On July 2, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/02/new-york-port-authority-bus-terminal-crash/>three NJ Transit buses collided at Port Authority</a>, injuring a dozen. &ldquo;One with moderate injuries that required extrication, 10 patients with minor injuries all transported to local area hospitals,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/port-authority-bus-terminal-accident-nyc/>said FDNY Deputy Chief Jason Saffon</a>. The tunnel closed. Commuters waited. The city shrugged.</p><h3 id=what-has-senator-hoylman-sigal-done>What Has Senator Hoylman-Sigal Done?</h3><p>Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal has moved. He <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>co-sponsored and voted yes</a> on the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting devices. He <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/lawmakers-to-allow-nyc-to-lower-speed-limit-to-20-mph>backed the law</a> giving NYC the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. He <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/07/12/moped-and-e-bike-safety-legislation-becomes-state-law>supported new rules</a> for moped and e-bike safety, shifting accountability to retailers and away from workers. But the deaths keep coming. The pace of change is slow. The streets are not safe yet.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call Senator Hoylman-Sigal. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat speeders. Demand streets that do not kill. The dead cannot call. You can.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter summary states: 'NYC pols propose traffic cameras to deter drivers from using bike lanes.' Mamdani and Hoylman argue that enforcement is critical, with Mamdani stating, 'You consistently see cars driving in the bike lane.

The change would broaden the definition of 'processing device,' letting more vehicles idle legally. Manhattan Community Board 4 voted unanimously to reject the change, warning, 'These exemptions... would create an argument that just about any activity that requires power in a vehicle is an idling defense.' State Sen. Brad Hoylman testified, 'Drivers most often idle in front of highly trafficked pedestrian areas... those that live near large roadways face serious health repercussions.' Advocates, residents, and Dr. Patrick Schnell all opposed the proposal, citing health and environmental harm. Spectrum requested a variance, but all testimony opposed it. The DEP claims the change clarifies the law, but enforcement is already weak and large companies are frequent violators.

The bill targets car dominance, aims to cut congestion, and free space for homes. Sen. Hoylman leads the charge. The move could shift city streets, making room for people, not just cars.</p><p class=mb3>Senate Bill, introduced by Sen. Brad Hoylman (D-Manhattan), would ban cities from forcing developers to build off-street parking in new projects. The bill, considered as of January 31, 2022, is under review by the state legislature. The measure, described as aiming to 'encourage public transit use, reduce car ownership, and address climate change,' would give New York City 180 days to update zoning if passed. Sen. Hoylman, the sponsor, calls parking minimums 'backwards' and a barrier to affordable housing. Sen. Alessandra Biaggi (D-Bronx) has shown support for similar efforts. The Department of City Planning and the governor's office will review the legislation if it advances. The bill does not ban parking outright, but removes the mandate, letting developers decide. Advocates say this could lower costs and open space for housing or community needs.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
