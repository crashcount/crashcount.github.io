The dead: a 69-year-old woman crossing with the light, crushed by an SUV at Amsterdam and 96th. A 74-year-old cyclist, helmet on, struck down by a bus at West End and 70th.

The NYPD’s new Quality of Life Division targets reckless e-bike use, but without updated laws, criminal summonses remain their only tool.

The article quotes Darnell Sealy-McCrorey: 'This epidemic is preventable. It doesn't have to be this way.' Lawmakers show mixed support. Some cite privacy fears or question the seriousness of multiple speeding violations. Jackson Chabot notes, 'A lot of people have understood the bill because of the tragic and fatal crashes recently.'
