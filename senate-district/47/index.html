Eight hundred seventy-nine injured.</strong> That is the price of traffic violence in Senate District 47 in the last year alone. Twenty lives shattered by serious injury. The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie.</p><p>Last month, a food cart broke loose on 42nd Street. It slammed into a parked car. Inside: a woman and her ten-year-old son. They went to the hospital. Police found the van packed with 76 propane tanks and 75 gallons of gasoline. The driver was charged with reckless endangerment. Firefighters forced entry. The smell of fuel hung in the air. Firefighters <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/cops-bust-minivan-driver-in-manhattan-for-carrying-propane-tanks/>forced an entry into the van, removing 76 20-pound propane cylinders and 15 five-gallon fuel containers</a>.</p><p>A week before, a car fire in the Lincoln Tunnel trapped drivers for an hour. One commuter went to the hospital. Five more were treated at the scene.

Nearly 3,000 have been hurt. SUVs and cars did most of the killing—six deaths, 16 serious injuries. Trucks and buses, two deaths. Bikes, five serious injuries. The numbers are cold. The pain is not.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h2><p>Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal has moved. He voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters. He co-sponsored a bill for automated bike lane enforcement. He backed the law letting New York City lower speed limits to 20 mph. But the streets are not yet safe. The dead do not come back. The injured do not heal with promises.</p><h2 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call your senator. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat speeders. Demand streets that protect the ones who walk and ride. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The debate, covered by Streetsblog NYC, highlighted Amsterdam’s balanced approach: licensing e-bikes and expanding bike infrastructure. Celestin called the city’s crackdown 'hypocrisy' without safer streets, quoting, 'enforcement can't fix the problems of car-first design.' He opposes enforcement without redesign and supports infrastructure expansion. The safety analyst warns: 'Harsh enforcement against e-bikes without improving street design places undue burden on vulnerable users, discourages mode shift, and fails to address systemic safety issues, potentially reducing overall safety for pedestrians and cyclists.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He pledged six-minute service on subways and buses and action on street homelessness. StreetsPAC’s endorsement signals strong support for policies that prioritize vulnerable road users.

The bill, titled 'Relates to requiring the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices for repeated violation of maximum speed limits,' mandates these devices for drivers who rack up eleven or more points in 24 months, or six speed or red light camera tickets in a year. The measure aims to curb repeat dangerous driving. Senators including Jamaal Bailey, Jabari Brisport, and others voted yes. The bill targets drivers with a pattern of violations, seeking to cut risk for pedestrians and cyclists by limiting repeat speeding.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Commissioner Tisch told the Council, "Pass e-bike regulations." Cyclists object to criminal charges for minor violations, arguing for civil penalties instead. The article highlights the case of Renee Baruch, hospitalized after an e-bike crash left her with facial fractures and a spinal injury. The NYPD’s new Quality of Life Division targets reckless e-bike use, but without updated laws, criminal summonses remain their only tool. The policy gap leaves vulnerable road users exposed and enforcement inconsistent.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The coalition pushes for the SAFE Streets Package, including speed-limiting devices for repeat offenders and the 'Idaho stop' for cyclists. The article quotes Darnell Sealy-McCrorey: 'This epidemic is preventable. It doesn't have to be this way.' Lawmakers show mixed support. Some cite privacy fears or question the seriousness of multiple speeding violations. Jackson Chabot notes, 'A lot of people have understood the bill because of the tragic and fatal crashes recently.'
