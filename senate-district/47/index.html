He has spoken out for laws that target reckless drivers, not just vulnerable road users. But the work is not done. The city can lower the speed limit now. The state can pass the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>.

The debate, covered by Streetsblog NYC, highlighted Amsterdam’s balanced approach: licensing e-bikes and expanding bike infrastructure. Celestin called the city’s crackdown 'hypocrisy' without safer streets, quoting, 'enforcement can't fix the problems of car-first design.' He opposes enforcement without redesign and supports infrastructure expansion. The safety analyst warns: 'Harsh enforcement against e-bikes without improving street design places undue burden on vulnerable users, discourages mode shift, and fails to address systemic safety issues, potentially reducing overall safety for pedestrians and cyclists.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

An illegal electric unicycle hit a cyclist, sending its operator to the hospital in critical but stable condition. The cyclist, Carolyn Backus, was wrongly charged with leaving the scene, though she "remained on scene for about 45 minutes after the crash and waited for paramedics." The Manhattan D.A. dismissed the charge, noting Backus rode a non-motorized bike. The article highlights the risk of high-speed e-vehicles in crowded park zones, where "unpredictable congestion makes it the last place...anyone should be speeding."</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The endorsement, reported by Streetsblog NYC and covered by Gersh Kuntzman, followed a review of candidate plans. StreetsPAC called Lander’s proposal 'by far the most comprehensive blueprint ... we've ever seen from a candidate for any office.' Lander promised more protected bike lanes, a citywide Bus Rapid Transit network, and using congestion pricing revenue for busways and bikeways. He pledged six-minute service on subways and buses and action on street homelessness. StreetsPAC’s endorsement signals strong support for policies that prioritize vulnerable road users. Their safety analyst noted: 'A comprehensive plan for safer streets and better public transit typically prioritizes vulnerable road users, supports mode shift, and aligns with best practices for population-level safety improvements.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The rally targeted Governor Hochul’s $252 billion budget, which omits $33 billion needed for transit upgrades. The event, covered by amny.com, highlighted the matter: 'NYC transit advocates urge Hochul to fully fund MTA Capital Plan with guaranteed state budget revenue.' Hoylman-Sigal said, 'This is about the economic engine for the entire region.' Assembly Member Tony Simone and others demanded investment in transportation deserts and accessible stations. Advocates cited the MTA’s ADA settlement, noting only a quarter of stations are wheelchair-accessible, with the fewest in low-income areas. The rally underscored that without full funding, vulnerable riders—especially those with disabilities—face continued barriers and danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The impact crushed her leg, leaving her conscious but severely injured. The police report cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the primary contributing factor. The driver’s failure to pay attention directly led to the collision. The report also notes the pedestrian was 'Getting On/Off Vehicle Other Than School Bus' and lists 'Listening/Using Headphones' as an additional factor, but only after the driver’s distraction. The cab showed no visible damage, and the narrative underscores the pain left on the street. The crash highlights the danger posed when drivers fail to remain alert, especially around vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
