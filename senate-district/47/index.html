Sixty people have been left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, five more lives ended in the road, with seventeen others marked by wounds that will not heal. These are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors. A 69-year-old woman, crossing with the light at Amsterdam and 96th, killed by a turning SUV. A 74-year-old man, helmet on, struck dead while riding his bike near West End Avenue and 70th. A 39-year-old man crushed by a truck on 9th Avenue. The city moves on. Their families do not. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=recent-crashes-unanswered-pain>Recent Crashes, Unanswered Pain</h3><p>The violence does not slow. On July 2, three NJ Transit buses collided at Port Authority. Fourteen people were hurt. One driver was trapped and had to be cut free. The crash shut the terminal for hours. &ldquo;One bus made contact with the rear of the other bus,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/2-buses-collide-port-authority-shutting-down-14-injured/16916303/>said Deputy Chief Jason Saffon of FDNY EMS</a>. &ldquo;It required some extrication, meaning they had to use some equipment to free the patient.&rdquo;</p><p>In Central Park, a man on an electric unicycle was left in critical condition after a hit-and-run with a cyclist. The cyclist fled. Police found her later. The victim was rushed to the hospital. The story ends with a charge: &ldquo;She was arrested Wednesday morning and charged with leaving the scene of an accident that caused a serious injury,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/02/nyc-electric-unicycle-rider-critically-hurt-by-hit-run-bicyclist-in-central-park-crash/>police said</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p><strong>Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal has voted for safer streets.</strong> He backed the law to let New York City lower its speed limits. He supported the expansion of 24/7 speed cameras. He co-sponsored the new moped registration law, shifting accountability to retailers and away from delivery workers. He voted yes on the complete streets bill, demanding safer design for all. But the blood on the street says it is not enough. The city can set a 20 mph limit now. It has not. The dead keep coming.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another family broken.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call Senator Hoylman-Sigal. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand the Stop Super Speeders Act. Demand streets that do not kill. The city will not change unless you force it.</p><p><strong>The street will not wait.

The rally targeted Governor Hochul’s $252 billion budget, which omits $33 billion needed for transit upgrades. The event, covered by amny.com, highlighted the matter: 'NYC transit advocates urge Hochul to fully fund MTA Capital Plan with guaranteed state budget revenue.' Hoylman-Sigal said, 'This is about the economic engine for the entire region.' Assembly Member Tony Simone and others demanded investment in transportation deserts and accessible stations. Advocates cited the MTA’s ADA settlement, noting only a quarter of stations are wheelchair-accessible, with the fewest in low-income areas. The rally underscored that without full funding, vulnerable riders—especially those with disabilities—face continued barriers and danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
