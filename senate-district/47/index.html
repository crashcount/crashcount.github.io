A truck crushes him on 9th Avenue. He is 39. He dies in the street. A 74-year-old cyclist collides with a bus on West End Avenue. He does not get up. A 69-year-old woman, walking with the light at Amsterdam and 96th, is struck by an SUV turning left. She dies at the intersection. These are not rare stories. They are the drumbeat of life and death in Senate District 47.</p><p><strong>In the last 12 months, five people have died in crashes here. Seventeen more suffered serious injuries.</strong> In total, 793 people were hurt. The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross the street. The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><h3 id=the-system-fails-the-vulnerable>The System Fails the Vulnerable</h3><p>Most deaths come from cars and trucks. <strong>SUVs killed four. Trucks killed two.</strong> Bikes and mopeds hurt, but they do not kill like steel and speed. The city’s streets are not built for the softest bodies. They are built for the biggest vehicles. The cost is measured in funerals and empty chairs.</p><p>Last week, a car fire in the Lincoln Tunnel trapped commuters for over an hour. One was hospitalized. Five more were treated at the scene. The fire was put out, but the fear lingers. &ldquo;One commuter was taken to Mount Sinai West to be treated for injuries. The extent of the victim&rsquo;s injuries was unclear,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/08/us-news/lincoln-tunnel-closed-for-an-hour-in-rush-hour-nightmare-as-car-fire-snarls-traffic/>said the FDNY</a>. The tunnel reopened, but the city did not change.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-pressure>Leadership: Progress and Pressure</h3><p>Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal has voted for safer street design. He backed the bill to require &ldquo;complete street design principles&rdquo;—a step toward roads that protect everyone, not just drivers. He has supported speed cameras, lower speed limits, and better enforcement. But the deaths keep coming. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so. The law is on the books. The blood is on the asphalt.</p><p>&ldquo;One bus made contact with the rear of the other bus,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/2-buses-collide-port-authority-shutting-down-14-injured/16916303/>said Deputy Chief Jason Saffon</a>, after a crash at Port Authority left 14 injured. The system is brittle. The bodies are real.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand enforcement against the worst repeat offenders. Join <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>.

The debate, covered by Streetsblog NYC, highlighted Amsterdam’s balanced approach: licensing e-bikes and expanding bike infrastructure. Celestin called the city’s crackdown 'hypocrisy' without safer streets, quoting, 'enforcement can't fix the problems of car-first design.' He opposes enforcement without redesign and supports infrastructure expansion. The safety analyst warns: 'Harsh enforcement against e-bikes without improving street design places undue burden on vulnerable users, discourages mode shift, and fails to address systemic safety issues, potentially reducing overall safety for pedestrians and cyclists.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
