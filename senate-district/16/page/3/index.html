Twenty-seven seriously hurt.</strong> In the last year alone, Senate District 16 has seen 2,342 crashes. The bodies are not numbers. They are neighbors. A 78-year-old woman, crossing Northern Boulevard near Parsons, struck down by a minivan that did not stop. She died in the hospital. The driver kept going. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/woman-78-killed-queens-hit-and-run-driver/>&ldquo;A 78-year-old woman was fatally struck by a hit-and-run driver as she crossed a Queens street, police said.&rdquo;</a></p><p>A child pinned under a car at 32nd Avenue and 138th Street.

The bigger the machine, the deeper the wound.</p><h3 id=what-has-john-liu-done>What Has John Liu Done?</h3><p>Senator John Liu has voted for safety. He backed bills to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>require speed limiters for repeat offenders</a> and to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>redesign streets for all users</a>.

He called for more speed cameras near schools. He fought for a greenway expansion, but <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/11/20/hochul-vetoes-bill-to-expand-eastern-queens-greenway>Albany said no</a>.</p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The votes are not enough. The street does not wait for laws to catch up.</p><h3 id=what-next>What Next?</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> Call Senator Liu.

The report states the collision occurred at 6:40 a.m. The pedestrian suffered severe lacerations to his head, with blood visible on the street, but remained conscious at the scene.
