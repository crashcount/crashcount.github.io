Thirty-four suffered serious injuries. The bodies are not numbers. They are neighbors, elders, children.</p><p>On June 11, Eric Wexler, age 74, tried to cross 217th Street and Northern Boulevard. A Chevy Tahoe hit him. He died at the hospital. The driver kept going east. The street stayed open. The city moved on. <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/2-pedestrians-killed-separate-nyc-crashes-same-day-nypd-says>&ldquo;Wexler was found with head and body trauma. He was transported to North Shore Manhasset Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.&rdquo;</a></p><p>Just days ago, an MTA bus in Flushing jumped the curb and smashed into a pole. Seven people were hurt. The driver, only 25, told investigators he &ldquo;misjudged the curb.&rdquo; Video showed more. Officials now believe he fell asleep at the wheel. The MTA pulled him from service. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>&ldquo;I was all the way in the back and all of a sudden the bus hit the curb, I guess, jumped the curb, I went this way and that way and banged into the side of the bus.&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=the-pattern-who-pays-the-price>The Pattern: Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> In three years, they took thirteen lives and left hundreds broken. Trucks and buses followed. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes are in the numbers, but the real threat is heavy and fast. The old and the young are hit hardest. In the last year, two people over 75 died. One child did not make it home.</p><h3 id=what-has-senator-john-liu-done>What Has Senator John Liu Done?</h3><p>Senator John Liu has voted for safer streets. He <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>backed the bill to require speed limiters for repeat speeders</a>. He <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>voted for complete street design</a>. He <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/07/10/bus-advocates-renew-push-for-flatbush-avenue-bus-lane-despite-mayors-lack-of-support>co-sponsored a fare-free bus pilot</a>. He <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/11/18/car-free-streets-are-good-for-business-yet-another-report-shows>stood with those who want car-free streets and congestion pricing</a>. He has not been silent. But the deaths keep coming. The work is not done.</p><h3 id=what-next>What Next?</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day without change is a choice. Call Senator Liu. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed limiters for repeat offenders. Demand streets built for people, not cars. Do not wait for another name on the list. <strong>Act now.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Storefronts fill up. Pedestrians and cyclists bring life and cash. Cars do not. Vacancy rates drop where traffic is banned. Volunteers keep these corridors alive, but city support lags behind their success.</p><p class=mb3>On November 18, 2024, the Department of City Planning released a report titled 'Storefront Activity in NYC Neighborhoods.' The analysis, covered by Streetsblog NYC, finds that open streets—car-free corridors—have about half the vacant storefronts of car-filled streets. The report states: 'vibrant public spaces are key to the success of local businesses.' City officials like Ya-Ting Liu, chief public realm officer, and volunteers such as Alex Morano and Brent Bovenzi, praised the program's impact. Bovenzi noted, 'the program is shrinking because too much of the burden falls upon volunteer labor.' The Open Streets program, now permanent, covers over 130 locations but relies heavily on volunteers. Advocates urge the city to invest more, as the data shows people-centric design drives economic recovery and safer, more vibrant neighborhoods.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crash left two passengers in the SUV injured: a 49-year-old woman in the front seat suffered head injuries, while a 21-year-old man in the rear seat sustained crush injuries to his lower leg. The report describes, 'The woman in front took the blow to her head. The young man behind could not move his leg. Belts held them in place. Blood pooled. Engines cooled.' Both vehicles were traveling straight ahead at the time of impact. The police report lists contributing factors as 'Unspecified' for both injured passengers and does not cite any specific driver error. No mention is made of victim behavior as a contributing factor.

Justice deferred.</p><p class=mb3>On July 10, 2024, a coalition of transit advocates and labor unions renewed calls for a Flatbush Avenue bus lane. The campaign, not tied to a specific council bill, has drawn support from Council Members Crystal Hudson and Rita Joseph. The matter, described as a 'no-brainer solution,' highlights slow bus speeds—often under 5 mph—and the urgent need for safer, faster transit. Jolyse Race of Riders Alliance stressed the economic justice at stake, noting bus riders earn half as much as car owners. Mayor Eric Adams has withheld support, citing community engagement and raising concerns about gentrification. The Department of Transportation's plans have stalled under his administration. Healthcare workers and union leaders spoke of missed shifts and unreliable service. Advocates now plan to survey bus riders to show support. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the campaign centers the needs of vulnerable bus riders and pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, highlighted in the report 'Realm of Possibility,' aims to 'lift some of the bureaucratic and cost hurdles faced by the largely volunteer open streets groups.' Key elements include lowering or waiving liability insurance for small events, standardizing maintenance agreements, and launching a 'Public Space Academy' to train organizers. Jim Burke, organizer for 34th Avenue, called for removing barriers to make the program equitable. Gib Veconi of Prospect Heights Neighborhood Development Council and Jackson Chabot of Open Plans both praised the reforms, citing burdensome permit processes and high costs as threats to open streets. The proposal responds to advocates' warnings that city policies have stifled car-free spaces, risking the loss of vital corridors for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as 'Albany pumps the brakes on MTA funding plan in rebuke of Hochul’s move to ditch congestion pricing,' left the MTA without the $1 billion annual revenue congestion pricing would have provided. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins announced the session’s close without a deal. Lawmakers including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris, State Sen. John Liu, Assemblyman Harvey Epstein, and Assemblyman Tony Simone criticized the governor’s decision and the proposed IOU bailout. Gounardes said, 'I cannot in good conscience ratify a decision that will eliminate a significant, dedicated revenue source for the MTA’s capital plan.' The pause leaves the city’s transit future—and the safety of those who rely on it—uncertain.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'City Officials Demand Congestion Pricing Despite Eric Adams’s Deference to Hochul,' saw Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi, MTA board member Midori Valdivia, City Planning Chair Dan Garodnick, DOT Chief of Staff Ryan Lynch, and public space czar Ya-Ting Liu all speak out. Valdivia warned, 'today it was announced, without MTA Board consultation, the cancellation of projects such as the Second Avenue Subway Phase II, our accessibility program... and a fully zero-emission bus fleet.' Joshi declared, 'It needs to happen now.' Garodnick cited a 'significant hole' in the MTA budget. Liu called congestion pricing 'the only policy' for transit and traffic. The New York City Independent Budget Office also warned of economic harm and delayed improvements.
