In the last 12 months, 10 people died and 1,770 were injured in crashes. Thirty-eight were left with serious injuries—bodies broken, lives changed. The old and the young fall alike. One child dead. Two elders gone. The numbers do not flinch.</p><p>Just weeks ago, on July 31, Zhao Feng Zhen, 55, was struck and killed by a Nissan Rogue on Hollis Court Blvd. The driver stayed. Police are still investigating. There is no comfort in the aftermath. Police said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/two-dead-in-separate-nyc-electric-vehicle-crashes-cops/>&ldquo;On Thursday around 2:15 p.m., e-bike rider Zhao Feng Zhen, 55, died after the 62-year-old driver of a 2015 Nissan Rogue struck her while heading south on Hollis Court Blvd. approaching 50th Ave. in Auburndale.&rdquo;</a></p><p>On July 11, a Q20 bus in Flushing jumped the curb and smashed into a pole. Seven people were hurt. The driver, just 25, told investigators he &ldquo;misjudged the curb.&rdquo; Later, video showed he had fallen asleep at the wheel. Investigators found, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>&ldquo;After investigators downloaded video from the bus&rsquo;s onboard cameras, it is now believed he had fallen asleep at the wheel.&rdquo;</a></p><h2 id=the-pattern-no-one-is-safe>The Pattern: No One Is Safe</h2><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the killing. In the last three years, SUVs alone took 13 lives and left hundreds more hurt. Trucks, buses, motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes all play their part, but the heaviest toll falls on foot. The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross the street. The sidewalk is no refuge.</p><h2 id=what-has-senator-john-liu-done>What Has Senator John Liu Done?</h2><p>Senator John Liu has not been silent. He co-sponsored and <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters. He voted to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>extend school speed zones</a>, protecting children on their way to class.

It is policy. Call Senator Liu. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat speeders.

Riders and vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On February 2, 2025, NYC officials responded to reports of a federal move to repeal congestion pricing, just weeks after its January 5 launch. At a press conference, Council Member John Liu warned, “This is not for fancy stuff. This is basic transit maintenance.” Liu said losing congestion pricing would erase a billion dollars in annual MTA revenue, threatening $15 billion in planned upgrades. The money funds new subway cars, buses, station repairs, and safety improvements. U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand joined Liu, stressing millions rely on transit daily. Both officials opposed the repeal, highlighting the risk to the city’s transit backbone. The bill is not numbered, but the threat is clear: without congestion pricing, the city’s streets and subways grow more dangerous for everyone outside a car.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Storefronts fill up. Pedestrians and cyclists bring life and cash. Cars do not. Vacancy rates drop where traffic is banned. Volunteers keep these corridors alive, but city support lags behind their success.</p><p class=mb3>On November 18, 2024, the Department of City Planning released a report titled 'Storefront Activity in NYC Neighborhoods.' The analysis, covered by Streetsblog NYC, finds that open streets—car-free corridors—have about half the vacant storefronts of car-filled streets. The report states: 'vibrant public spaces are key to the success of local businesses.' City officials like Ya-Ting Liu, chief public realm officer, and volunteers such as Alex Morano and Brent Bovenzi, praised the program's impact. Bovenzi noted, 'the program is shrinking because too much of the burden falls upon volunteer labor.' The Open Streets program, now permanent, covers over 130 locations but relies heavily on volunteers. Advocates urge the city to invest more, as the data shows people-centric design drives economic recovery and safer, more vibrant neighborhoods.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The campaign, not tied to a specific council bill, has drawn support from Council Members Crystal Hudson and Rita Joseph. The matter, described as a 'no-brainer solution,' highlights slow bus speeds—often under 5 mph—and the urgent need for safer, faster transit. Jolyse Race of Riders Alliance stressed the economic justice at stake, noting bus riders earn half as much as car owners. Mayor Eric Adams has withheld support, citing community engagement and raising concerns about gentrification. The Department of Transportation's plans have stalled under his administration. Healthcare workers and union leaders spoke of missed shifts and unreliable service. Advocates now plan to survey bus riders to show support.
