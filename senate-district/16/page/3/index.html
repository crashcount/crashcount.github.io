The report states the vehicle’s front bumper hit her directly, causing severe bleeding from her head. The woman remained conscious at the scene. Police cite 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the primary contributing factor. The driver was reportedly distracted at the time of the collision.

The plan slashes insurance demands and trains new groups. Advocates say high costs and paperwork choke car-free events. The move could revive lost corridors and let more New Yorkers reclaim the road.</p><p class=mb3>On June 18, 2024, Chief Public Realm Officer Ya-Ting Liu released a report proposing major reforms to New York City's open streets program. The plan, highlighted in the report 'Realm of Possibility,' aims to 'lift some of the bureaucratic and cost hurdles faced by the largely volunteer open streets groups.' Key elements include lowering or waiving liability insurance for small events, standardizing maintenance agreements, and launching a 'Public Space Academy' to train organizers. Jim Burke, organizer for 34th Avenue, called for removing barriers to make the program equitable. Gib Veconi of Prospect Heights Neighborhood Development Council and Jackson Chabot of Open Plans both praised the reforms, citing burdensome permit processes and high costs as threats to open streets. The proposal responds to advocates' warnings that city policies have stifled car-free spaces, risking the loss of vital corridors for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2024, the New York State legislative session ended without passing a replacement funding plan for the MTA after Governor Kathy Hochul paused congestion pricing. The matter, described as 'Albany pumps the brakes on MTA funding plan in rebuke of Hochul’s move to ditch congestion pricing,' left the MTA without the $1 billion annual revenue congestion pricing would have provided. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins announced the session’s close without a deal. Lawmakers including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris, State Sen. John Liu, Assemblyman Harvey Epstein, and Assemblyman Tony Simone criticized the governor’s decision and the proposed IOU bailout. Gounardes said, 'I cannot in good conscience ratify a decision that will eliminate a significant, dedicated revenue source for the MTA’s capital plan.' The pause leaves the city’s transit future—and the safety of those who rely on it—uncertain.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'City Officials Demand Congestion Pricing Despite Eric Adams’s Deference to Hochul,' saw Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi, MTA board member Midori Valdivia, City Planning Chair Dan Garodnick, DOT Chief of Staff Ryan Lynch, and public space czar Ya-Ting Liu all speak out. Valdivia warned, 'today it was announced, without MTA Board consultation, the cancellation of projects such as the Second Avenue Subway Phase II, our accessibility program... and a fully zero-emission bus fleet.' Joshi declared, 'It needs to happen now.' Garodnick cited a 'significant hole' in the MTA budget. Liu called congestion pricing 'the only policy' for transit and traffic. The New York City Independent Budget Office also warned of economic harm and delayed improvements.
