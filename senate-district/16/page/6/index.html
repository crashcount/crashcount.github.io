The announcement, made at One Police Plaza, highlighted the bill sponsored by Simon and Sen. John Liu. The matter summary states, 'Officials called on Albany to pass legislation to lower the BAC threshold to .05%, arguing it would reduce DWI fatalities by about 10% and align with other countries.' Simon declared, 'Lowering the BAC limit from .08% to .05% is desperately needed to adequately tackle this epidemic of traffic violence.' NYPD Chief Kim Royster and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez echoed the urgency. The bill awaits action in Albany.

The message: don’t drink and drive.</p><p class=mb3>On February 7, 2023, Queens State Senator John Liu, representing District 16, publicly supported a bill in the State Legislature to lower the legal blood alcohol concentration (BAC) limit for drivers from 0.08 to 0.05. The bill’s summary states, 'The 0.05 BAC simply says, don’t drink and drive.' Liu, as the bill’s primary sponsor, emphasized that anyone found with a BAC over 0.05 would be charged with DWI. City Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez joined the push, warning, 'Whether they are at 0.06 or 0.12 or 0.20, the consequences can be deadly.' Drunk driving caused 307 deaths in New York State in 2019, nearly a third of all fatal crashes. Utah’s adoption of a 0.05 BAC limit led to a 20% drop in fatal crashes in its first year.

Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and NYPD’s Kim Royster also spoke, focusing on enforcement and urging drivers to avoid drinking before driving. Advocates like Alisa McMorris of Mothers Against Drunk Driving called for stronger messaging: 'We want people to make choices before they leave their home.'
