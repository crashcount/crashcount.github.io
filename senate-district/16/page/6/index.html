Twenty-seven seriously hurt.</strong> In the last year alone, Senate District 16 has seen 2,342 crashes. The bodies are not numbers. They are neighbors. A 78-year-old woman, crossing Northern Boulevard near Parsons, struck down by a minivan that did not stop. She died in the hospital. The driver kept going. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/woman-78-killed-queens-hit-and-run-driver/>&ldquo;A 78-year-old woman was fatally struck by a hit-and-run driver as she crossed a Queens street, police said.&rdquo;</a></p><p>A child pinned under a car at 32nd Avenue and 138th Street.

The street did not forgive. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-pedestrians-hit-man-pinned-vehicle-child-injured-being-car/16014608/>Police responded and found an adult man pinned under a vehicle.</a></p><p><strong>The old, the young, the careful, the hurried. All at risk.</strong></p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage.</strong> In three years, cars and SUVs killed 12, left 27 with serious wounds, and hurt hundreds more. Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds, none. Bikes, none. The street is not equal. The bigger the machine, the deeper the wound.</p><h3 id=what-has-john-liu-done>What Has John Liu Done?</h3><p>Senator John Liu has voted for safety. He backed bills to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>require speed limiters for repeat offenders</a> and to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>redesign streets for all users</a>. He pushed for lower drunk driving limits, saying, &ldquo;The 0.05 BAC simply says, don’t drink and drive.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/politics/city-transportation-chief-joins-state-push-to-lower-blood-alcohol-limits/>Liu said</a>. He called for more speed cameras near schools. He fought for a greenway expansion, but <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/11/20/hochul-vetoes-bill-to-expand-eastern-queens-greenway>Albany said no</a>.</p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The votes are not enough. The street does not wait for laws to catch up.</p><h3 id=what-next>What Next?</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> Call Senator Liu. Call your council member. Demand lower speed limits. Demand more cameras. Demand streets built for people, not just cars. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The legislative session nears its end with no clear action. State Sen. Jabari Brisport supports the bill, calling for round-the-clock enforcement. Sen. John Liu backs maintaining cameras but won’t commit to S5602. Some City Council members demand that camera revenue fund local road improvements. Assembly Member Dick Gottfried doubts the Council will send the required home rule message in time, while Assembly Member William Magnarelli promises to advance the bill if they do. Mayor Adams’ team claims safety was discussed in Albany, but the mayor himself stayed silent. The bill faces opposition over increased penalties and insurance notifications. Without action, the city’s speed cameras—and the safety of its streets—are at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
