He voted for <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>complete street design</a> to make roads safer for everyone. He co-sponsored a <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4421>fare-free bus pilot</a>, and supported <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/drunk-driving-crackdown-new-years-2024/>drunk driving crackdowns</a>.

At a press conference, Council Member John Liu warned, “This is not for fancy stuff. This is basic transit maintenance.” Liu said losing congestion pricing would erase a billion dollars in annual MTA revenue, threatening $15 billion in planned upgrades. The money funds new subway cars, buses, station repairs, and safety improvements. U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand joined Liu, stressing millions rely on transit daily. Both officials opposed the repeal, highlighting the risk to the city’s transit backbone. The bill is not numbered, but the threat is clear: without congestion pricing, the city’s streets and subways grow more dangerous for everyone outside a car.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The analysis, covered by Streetsblog NYC, finds that open streets—car-free corridors—have about half the vacant storefronts of car-filled streets. The report states: 'vibrant public spaces are key to the success of local businesses.' City officials like Ya-Ting Liu, chief public realm officer, and volunteers such as Alex Morano and Brent Bovenzi, praised the program's impact. Bovenzi noted, 'the program is shrinking because too much of the burden falls upon volunteer labor.' The Open Streets program, now permanent, covers over 130 locations but relies heavily on volunteers. Advocates urge the city to invest more, as the data shows people-centric design drives economic recovery and safer, more vibrant neighborhoods.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The campaign, not tied to a specific council bill, has drawn support from Council Members Crystal Hudson and Rita Joseph. The matter, described as a 'no-brainer solution,' highlights slow bus speeds—often under 5 mph—and the urgent need for safer, faster transit. Jolyse Race of Riders Alliance stressed the economic justice at stake, noting bus riders earn half as much as car owners. Mayor Eric Adams has withheld support, citing community engagement and raising concerns about gentrification. The Department of Transportation's plans have stalled under his administration. Healthcare workers and union leaders spoke of missed shifts and unreliable service. Advocates now plan to survey bus riders to show support. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the campaign centers the needs of vulnerable bus riders and pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, highlighted in the report 'Realm of Possibility,' aims to 'lift some of the bureaucratic and cost hurdles faced by the largely volunteer open streets groups.' Key elements include lowering or waiving liability insurance for small events, standardizing maintenance agreements, and launching a 'Public Space Academy' to train organizers. Jim Burke, organizer for 34th Avenue, called for removing barriers to make the program equitable. Gib Veconi of Prospect Heights Neighborhood Development Council and Jackson Chabot of Open Plans both praised the reforms, citing burdensome permit processes and high costs as threats to open streets. The proposal responds to advocates' warnings that city policies have stifled car-free spaces, risking the loss of vital corridors for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as 'Albany pumps the brakes on MTA funding plan in rebuke of Hochul’s move to ditch congestion pricing,' left the MTA without the $1 billion annual revenue congestion pricing would have provided. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins announced the session’s close without a deal. Lawmakers including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris, State Sen. John Liu, Assemblyman Harvey Epstein, and Assemblyman Tony Simone criticized the governor’s decision and the proposed IOU bailout. Gounardes said, 'I cannot in good conscience ratify a decision that will eliminate a significant, dedicated revenue source for the MTA’s capital plan.'
