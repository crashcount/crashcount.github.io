A minivan hit her and kept going. She died on the street. The driver did not stop. Police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/woman-78-killed-queens-hit-and-run-driver/>reported</a> that &ldquo;a 78-year-old woman was fatally struck by a hit-and-run driver as she crossed a Queens street.&rdquo;</p><p>Two days earlier, a man and a child were hit at 32nd Avenue and 138th Street. The man was pinned under a car. The child, maybe ten, was sent to the hospital. Police <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-pedestrians-hit-man-pinned-vehicle-child-injured-being-car/16014608/>responded</a> and found the man crushed beneath the metal.</p><p>In the last year, <strong>9 people died</strong> in crashes here. <strong>24 suffered serious injuries.</strong> Children, elders, men, women—no one is spared.

The threat is heavy, fast, and steel.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-done>What Has Been Done</h2><p>Senator John Liu has voted for change. He backed a law to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters on their cars (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>File S 4045</a>). He voted for safer street designs (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>File S 9718</a>) and more speed cameras near schools. He pushed to lower the legal blood alcohol limit (<a href=https://www.amny.com/politics/city-transportation-chief-joins-state-push-to-lower-blood-alcohol-limits/>City transportation chief joins state push to lower blood alcohol limits</a>). He stood with others to <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/drunk-driving-crackdown-new-years-2024/>demand a crackdown on drunk driving</a>, saying, &ldquo;Cracking down on drunk driving, which continues to destroy lives and families, is the right focus as New Year&rsquo;s approaches.&rdquo;</p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The laws move slow. The streets do not wait.</p><h2 id=what-must-happen-next>What Must Happen Next</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay means another family shattered.</strong> Call Senator Liu. Call your council member. Demand lower speed limits, more cameras, and streets built for people, not cars. Do not wait for another body in the road.</p><p><strong>Act now. Demand action.

Her vehicle collided with a parked Jeep, striking the left rear bumper and damaging the Jeep’s left rear quarter panel. The report lists 'Fell Asleep' as the contributing factor. The force of the crash triggered the airbag, and the driver suffered a head injury with severe bleeding but remained conscious at the scene. No other occupants or bystanders were involved. The parked Jeep was unoccupied. The police report does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor.

The crash occurred as both vehicles traveled north. The SUV’s front end folded, and its sole occupant—a 63-year-old man—remained conscious despite sustaining head trauma and crush injuries. The police report lists 'Following Too Closely' and 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' as contributing factors, both attributed to the SUV driver. The bus, a 2016 New Flyer, showed no damage and its driver was uninjured. The report makes no mention of any victim behavior contributing to the crash. The impact underscores the lethal consequences when drivers fail to maintain safe following distances and proper lane usage.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Sean Ryan (District 61) and co-sponsored by Liz Krueger, Monica Martinez, Jack M. Martins, Anthony H. Palumbo, and Julia Salazar, passed both votes despite opposition. The measure calls for redesigning streets to protect all users, not just drivers. The vote was not unanimous—several senators voted no, but the majority carried it through. The bill’s focus is clear: safer streets for people on foot, on bikes, and in vehicles. No safety analyst note was provided, but the intent is to cut danger at the curb and crosswalk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The narrative states he suffered crush injuries to his entire body yet remained conscious at the scene. The vehicle involved fled, leaving the man behind, his injuries described as 'entire body' and 'crush injuries.' The police report does not specify the type of vehicle, the direction of travel, or any contributing factors from the driver, but it makes clear the driver left the scene without stopping. No driver errors are explicitly listed in the data, but the act of fleeing after a collision is a grave systemic failure. No contributing factors are attributed to the pedestrian. The report centers the violence of the impact and the abandonment that followed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
