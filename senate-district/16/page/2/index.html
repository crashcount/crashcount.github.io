Thirty-four suffered serious injuries. The bodies are not numbers. They are neighbors, elders, children.</p><p>On June 11, Eric Wexler, age 74, tried to cross 217th Street and Northern Boulevard. A Chevy Tahoe hit him. He died at the hospital. The driver kept going east. The street stayed open. The city moved on. <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/2-pedestrians-killed-separate-nyc-crashes-same-day-nypd-says>&ldquo;Wexler was found with head and body trauma. He was transported to North Shore Manhasset Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.&rdquo;</a></p><p>Just days ago, an MTA bus in Flushing jumped the curb and smashed into a pole. Seven people were hurt. The driver, only 25, told investigators he &ldquo;misjudged the curb.&rdquo; Video showed more. Officials now believe he fell asleep at the wheel. The MTA pulled him from service. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>&ldquo;I was all the way in the back and all of a sudden the bus hit the curb, I guess, jumped the curb, I went this way and that way and banged into the side of the bus.&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=the-pattern-who-pays-the-price>The Pattern: Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> In three years, they took thirteen lives and left hundreds broken. Trucks and buses followed. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes are in the numbers, but the real threat is heavy and fast. The old and the young are hit hardest. In the last year, two people over 75 died. One child did not make it home.</p><h3 id=what-has-senator-john-liu-done>What Has Senator John Liu Done?</h3><p>Senator John Liu has voted for safer streets. He <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>backed the bill to require speed limiters for repeat speeders</a>. He <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>voted for complete street design</a>. He <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/07/10/bus-advocates-renew-push-for-flatbush-avenue-bus-lane-despite-mayors-lack-of-support>co-sponsored a fare-free bus pilot</a>. He <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/11/18/car-free-streets-are-good-for-business-yet-another-report-shows>stood with those who want car-free streets and congestion pricing</a>. He has not been silent. But the deaths keep coming. The work is not done.</p><h3 id=what-next>What Next?</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day without change is a choice. Call Senator Liu. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed limiters for repeat offenders. Demand streets built for people, not cars. Do not wait for another name on the list. <strong>Act now.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Riders and vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On February 2, 2025, NYC officials responded to reports of a federal move to repeal congestion pricing, just weeks after its January 5 launch. At a press conference, Council Member John Liu warned, “This is not for fancy stuff. This is basic transit maintenance.” Liu said losing congestion pricing would erase a billion dollars in annual MTA revenue, threatening $15 billion in planned upgrades. The money funds new subway cars, buses, station repairs, and safety improvements. U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand joined Liu, stressing millions rely on transit daily. Both officials opposed the repeal, highlighting the risk to the city’s transit backbone. The bill is not numbered, but the threat is clear: without congestion pricing, the city’s streets and subways grow more dangerous for everyone outside a car.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
