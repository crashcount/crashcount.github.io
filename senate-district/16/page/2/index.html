In the last 12 months, 10 people died and 1,770 were injured in crashes. Thirty-eight were left with serious injuries—bodies broken, lives changed. The old and the young fall alike. One child dead. Two elders gone. The numbers do not flinch.</p><p>Just weeks ago, on July 31, Zhao Feng Zhen, 55, was struck and killed by a Nissan Rogue on Hollis Court Blvd. The driver stayed. Police are still investigating. There is no comfort in the aftermath. Police said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/two-dead-in-separate-nyc-electric-vehicle-crashes-cops/>&ldquo;On Thursday around 2:15 p.m., e-bike rider Zhao Feng Zhen, 55, died after the 62-year-old driver of a 2015 Nissan Rogue struck her while heading south on Hollis Court Blvd. approaching 50th Ave. in Auburndale.&rdquo;</a></p><p>On July 11, a Q20 bus in Flushing jumped the curb and smashed into a pole. Seven people were hurt. The driver, just 25, told investigators he &ldquo;misjudged the curb.&rdquo; Later, video showed he had fallen asleep at the wheel. Investigators found, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>&ldquo;After investigators downloaded video from the bus&rsquo;s onboard cameras, it is now believed he had fallen asleep at the wheel.&rdquo;</a></p><h2 id=the-pattern-no-one-is-safe>The Pattern: No One Is Safe</h2><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the killing. In the last three years, SUVs alone took 13 lives and left hundreds more hurt. Trucks, buses, motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes all play their part, but the heaviest toll falls on foot. The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross the street. The sidewalk is no refuge.</p><h2 id=what-has-senator-john-liu-done>What Has Senator John Liu Done?</h2><p>Senator John Liu has not been silent. He co-sponsored and <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters. He voted to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>extend school speed zones</a>, protecting children on their way to class. He has backed <a href="http://www.curbed.com/article/14th-street-overhaul-redesign-busway.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=social_acct&amp;utm_campaign=feed-part">car-free streets</a>, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/06/city-officials-demand-congestion-pricing-despite-eric-adamss-deference-to-hochul>congestion pricing</a>, and a <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/drunk-driving-crackdown-new-years-2024/>lower drunk driving threshold</a>.

It is policy. Call Senator Liu. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat speeders.

The motorbike’s driver license status is listed as 'Unlicensed.' The police report makes no mention of any actions by the sedan driver contributing to the crash.
