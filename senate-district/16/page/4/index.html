The campaign, not tied to a specific council bill, has drawn support from Council Members Crystal Hudson and Rita Joseph. The matter, described as a 'no-brainer solution,' highlights slow bus speeds—often under 5 mph—and the urgent need for safer, faster transit. Jolyse Race of Riders Alliance stressed the economic justice at stake, noting bus riders earn half as much as car owners. Mayor Eric Adams has withheld support, citing community engagement and raising concerns about gentrification. The Department of Transportation's plans have stalled under his administration. Healthcare workers and union leaders spoke of missed shifts and unreliable service. Advocates now plan to survey bus riders to show support. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the campaign centers the needs of vulnerable bus riders and pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, highlighted in the report 'Realm of Possibility,' aims to 'lift some of the bureaucratic and cost hurdles faced by the largely volunteer open streets groups.' Key elements include lowering or waiving liability insurance for small events, standardizing maintenance agreements, and launching a 'Public Space Academy' to train organizers. Jim Burke, organizer for 34th Avenue, called for removing barriers to make the program equitable. Gib Veconi of Prospect Heights Neighborhood Development Council and Jackson Chabot of Open Plans both praised the reforms, citing burdensome permit processes and high costs as threats to open streets. The proposal responds to advocates' warnings that city policies have stifled car-free spaces, risking the loss of vital corridors for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins announced the session’s close without a deal. Lawmakers including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris, State Sen. John Liu, Assemblyman Harvey Epstein, and Assemblyman Tony Simone criticized the governor’s decision and the proposed IOU bailout. Gounardes said, 'I cannot in good conscience ratify a decision that will eliminate a significant, dedicated revenue source for the MTA’s capital plan.'

Joshi declared, 'It needs to happen now.' Garodnick cited a 'significant hole' in the MTA budget. Liu called congestion pricing 'the only policy' for transit and traffic.
