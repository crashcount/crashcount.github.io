Twenty-seven seriously hurt.</strong> In the last year alone, Senate District 16 has seen 2,342 crashes. The bodies are not numbers. They are neighbors. A 78-year-old woman, crossing Northern Boulevard near Parsons, struck down by a minivan that did not stop. She died in the hospital. The driver kept going. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/woman-78-killed-queens-hit-and-run-driver/>&ldquo;A 78-year-old woman was fatally struck by a hit-and-run driver as she crossed a Queens street, police said.&rdquo;</a></p><p>A child pinned under a car at 32nd Avenue and 138th Street. The man beside him, critical. The driver stayed. The street did not forgive. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-pedestrians-hit-man-pinned-vehicle-child-injured-being-car/16014608/>Police responded and found an adult man pinned under a vehicle.</a></p><p><strong>The old, the young, the careful, the hurried. All at risk.</strong></p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage.</strong> In three years, cars and SUVs killed 12, left 27 with serious wounds, and hurt hundreds more. Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds, none. Bikes, none. The street is not equal. The bigger the machine, the deeper the wound.</p><h3 id=what-has-john-liu-done>What Has John Liu Done?</h3><p>Senator John Liu has voted for safety. He backed bills to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>require speed limiters for repeat offenders</a> and to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>redesign streets for all users</a>. He pushed for lower drunk driving limits, saying, &ldquo;The 0.05 BAC simply says, don’t drink and drive.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/politics/city-transportation-chief-joins-state-push-to-lower-blood-alcohol-limits/>Liu said</a>. He called for more speed cameras near schools. He fought for a greenway expansion, but <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/11/20/hochul-vetoes-bill-to-expand-eastern-queens-greenway>Albany said no</a>.</p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The votes are not enough. The street does not wait for laws to catch up.</p><h3 id=what-next>What Next?</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> Call Senator Liu. Call your council member. Demand lower speed limits. Demand more cameras. Demand streets built for people, not just cars. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill passed both the state Senate and Assembly unanimously. The matter summary called for a study to extend the greenway, which runs parallel to the hazardous Union Turnpike. State Senator John Liu sponsored the bill and vowed to keep pushing for the project, saying, 'I’m confident we’ll get there.' Hochul’s veto cited budget concerns and the risk of 'duplication and unnecessary bureaucracy.' Advocates like Joby Jacob called the veto a blow to years of organizing, noting that people are forced to walk dirt paths where sidewalks should be.

State Sen. John Liu urges more service in neighborhoods where buses can move. Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance says, "With better service, the path to more service is a much clearer one." ABLE cameras have improved bus speeds by 5 percent on enforced routes. Despite promises, Mayor Eric Adams has not delivered on expanding bus lanes.

Police ramp up DWI patrols for Memorial Day. Officials urge Albany to drop legal BAC to .05%. They cite rising deaths. Advocates say alcohol fuels a third of crashes. Streets stay deadly.</p><p class=mb3>On May 26, 2023, Assemblymember Jo Anne Simon (District 52) joined NYPD and city officials to announce increased traffic enforcement for Memorial Day and to advocate for state legislation lowering the legal blood-alcohol concentration (BAC) threshold from .08% to .05%. The announcement, made at One Police Plaza, highlighted the bill sponsored by Simon and Sen. John Liu. The matter summary states, 'Officials called on Albany to pass legislation to lower the BAC threshold to .05%, arguing it would reduce DWI fatalities by about 10% and align with other countries.' Simon declared, 'Lowering the BAC limit from .08% to .05% is desperately needed to adequately tackle this epidemic of traffic violence.' NYPD Chief Kim Royster and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez echoed the urgency. The bill awaits action in Albany. No formal safety analyst note was provided, but officials cite 43 NYC DWI deaths in 2021 and say 30% of state crashes involve alcohol.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
