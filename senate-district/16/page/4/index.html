She died. Police said the driver stayed at the scene and the case is under investigation, reported the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/two-dead-in-separate-nyc-electric-vehicle-crashes-cops/>Daily News</a>.

Eight were hurt. Investigators later believed the operator had fallen asleep; the MTA pulled him from service pending review, said <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>ABC7</a>. “I was all the way in the back and all of a sudden the bus hit the curb,” passenger Ken Baur said to <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>ABC7</a>. CBS said seven had minor injuries and the probe was ongoing (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>CBS New York</a>).</p><h3 id=the-toll-of-big-cars>The toll of big cars</h3><p>In this district since 2022, SUVs and sedans dominate pedestrian harm. They account for most of the deaths and injuries recorded in crashes with people on foot: SUVs are tied to 7 pedestrian deaths; sedans to 8, in incidents counted in the dataset through Aug 27, 2025. The rollup is clear in the city’s files on <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crashes, persons, and vehicles</a>. The numbers are not abstract. They are bodies.</p><p>In the last 12 months, SD 16 saw 3,025 crashes, with 12 people killed and 1,833 injured. Serious injuries: 42. Year‑to‑date crashes are up 40% over last year’s pace; serious injuries up 71%. This comes from our district cut of the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city collision data</a>.</p><h3 id=what-albany-and-city-hall-have-on-the-table>What Albany and City Hall have on the table</h3><p>The Senate moved a bill to stop repeat speeders. It would make drivers who rack up violations install intelligent speed assistance. Senator John Liu co‑sponsored and voted yes in committee on <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a> on June 11 and June 12. The aim is simple: keep cars from going more than 5 mph over the limit after too many tickets, as summarized in the bill file noted in our <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>timeline</a>.</p><p>Albany also extended 24‑hour school‑zone cameras through 2030, according to our timeline’s Senate votes on S 8344. Advocates say cameras cut speeding. City officials have also pushed congestion pricing to cut car trips and fund transit, as documented in coverage we track, while local leaders call for safer, people‑first streets.</p><h3 id=slow-the-streets-save-the-living>Slow the streets, save the living</h3><p>We know what works. <strong>Lower the default speed limit citywide.</strong> <strong>Force repeat offenders to install speed limiters.</strong> Call it policy, or call it mercy. Either way, the numbers will move. The names will stop piling up.

The plan, highlighted in the report 'Realm of Possibility,' aims to 'lift some of the bureaucratic and cost hurdles faced by the largely volunteer open streets groups.' Key elements include lowering or waiving liability insurance for small events, standardizing maintenance agreements, and launching a 'Public Space Academy' to train organizers. Jim Burke, organizer for 34th Avenue, called for removing barriers to make the program equitable. Gib Veconi of Prospect Heights Neighborhood Development Council and Jackson Chabot of Open Plans both praised the reforms, citing burdensome permit processes and high costs as threats to open streets. The proposal responds to advocates' warnings that city policies have stifled car-free spaces, risking the loss of vital corridors for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as 'Albany pumps the brakes on MTA funding plan in rebuke of Hochul’s move to ditch congestion pricing,' left the MTA without the $1 billion annual revenue congestion pricing would have provided. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins announced the session’s close without a deal. Lawmakers including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris, State Sen. John Liu, Assemblyman Harvey Epstein, and Assemblyman Tony Simone criticized the governor’s decision and the proposed IOU bailout. Gounardes said, 'I cannot in good conscience ratify a decision that will eliminate a significant, dedicated revenue source for the MTA’s capital plan.'

Valdivia warned, 'today it was announced, without MTA Board consultation, the cancellation of projects such as the Second Avenue Subway Phase II, our accessibility program... and a fully zero-emission bus fleet.' Joshi declared, 'It needs to happen now.' Garodnick cited a 'significant hole' in the MTA budget. Liu called congestion pricing 'the only policy' for transit and traffic.
