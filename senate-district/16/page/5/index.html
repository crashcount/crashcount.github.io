In the last 12 months, 10 people died and 1,770 were injured in crashes. Thirty-eight were left with serious injuries—bodies broken, lives changed. The old and the young fall alike. One child dead. Two elders gone. The numbers do not flinch.</p><p>Just weeks ago, on July 31, Zhao Feng Zhen, 55, was struck and killed by a Nissan Rogue on Hollis Court Blvd. The driver stayed. Police are still investigating. There is no comfort in the aftermath. Police said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/two-dead-in-separate-nyc-electric-vehicle-crashes-cops/>&ldquo;On Thursday around 2:15 p.m., e-bike rider Zhao Feng Zhen, 55, died after the 62-year-old driver of a 2015 Nissan Rogue struck her while heading south on Hollis Court Blvd. approaching 50th Ave. in Auburndale.&rdquo;</a></p><p>On July 11, a Q20 bus in Flushing jumped the curb and smashed into a pole. Seven people were hurt. The driver, just 25, told investigators he &ldquo;misjudged the curb.&rdquo; Later, video showed he had fallen asleep at the wheel. Investigators found, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>&ldquo;After investigators downloaded video from the bus&rsquo;s onboard cameras, it is now believed he had fallen asleep at the wheel.&rdquo;</a></p><h2 id=the-pattern-no-one-is-safe>The Pattern: No One Is Safe</h2><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the killing. In the last three years, SUVs alone took 13 lives and left hundreds more hurt. Trucks, buses, motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes all play their part, but the heaviest toll falls on foot. The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross the street. The sidewalk is no refuge.</p><h2 id=what-has-senator-john-liu-done>What Has Senator John Liu Done?</h2><p>Senator John Liu has not been silent. He co-sponsored and <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed limiters. He voted to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>extend school speed zones</a>, protecting children on their way to class.

It is policy. Call Senator Liu. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat speeders.

The police report lists 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' and 'Unsafe Speed' as contributing factors. The Hyundai’s left rear bumper was struck by the Mercedes’ right front bumper. An 82-year-old male driver, belted in, suffered severe facial bleeding but remained conscious. The report does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor.

The crash left a 21-year-old woman pinned behind the wheel, her legs crushed, conscious but trapped. The report states, 'Two sedans collided head-on.

The effort, led by the NYPD and Department of Transportation, aims to keep inebriated motorists off the roads. Senator John Liu, representing District 16, publicly supported the crackdown and advocated for lowering the legal blood alcohol limit from .08 to .05. The campaign includes increased police patrols and active speed cameras. The official matter summary states: 'Drunk driving crackdown: NYC launches aggressive enforcement campaign for New Year’s weekend.' Liu said, 'Cracking down on drunk driving, which continues to destroy lives and families, is the right focus as New Year's approaches.' The DOT notes fatalities from drunk driving have risen nearly 30% in recent years. City lawmakers back state legislation to reduce the DWI threshold, aiming to save lives and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists and pedestrians lose a safe route. Lawmakers backed the plan. The veto leaves vulnerable road users with dirt paths and danger. The greenway remains unfinished.</p><p class=mb3>On November 20, 2023, Governor Kathy Hochul vetoed a bill that would have required the state Department of Parks and Recreation and the Office of Mental Health to study expanding the Vanderbilt Motor Parkway greenway into Nassau County. The bill passed both the state Senate and Assembly unanimously. The matter summary called for a study to extend the greenway, which runs parallel to the hazardous Union Turnpike. State Senator John Liu sponsored the bill and vowed to keep pushing for the project, saying, 'I’m confident we’ll get there.' Hochul’s veto cited budget concerns and the risk of 'duplication and unnecessary bureaucracy.' Advocates like Joby Jacob called the veto a blow to years of organizing, noting that people are forced to walk dirt paths where sidewalks should be. The veto blocks progress on a safer route for cyclists and pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article, titled "City Traffic Helps Make Bus Service Unbearable, Expensive And Difficult To Improve," highlights how traffic congestion, double-parking, and outdated routes cripple bus efficiency. State Sen. John Liu urges more service in neighborhoods where buses can move. Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance says, "With better service, the path to more service is a much clearer one." ABLE cameras have improved bus speeds by 5 percent on enforced routes. Despite promises, Mayor Eric Adams has not delivered on expanding bus lanes. The MTA and advocates call for more funding and better service. Riders remain stuck, exposed to traffic danger, while systemic failures persist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
