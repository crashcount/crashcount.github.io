The bill passed both the state Senate and Assembly unanimously. The matter summary called for a study to extend the greenway, which runs parallel to the hazardous Union Turnpike. State Senator John Liu sponsored the bill and vowed to keep pushing for the project, saying, 'I’m confident we’ll get there.' Hochul’s veto cited budget concerns and the risk of 'duplication and unnecessary bureaucracy.' Advocates like Joby Jacob called the veto a blow to years of organizing, noting that people are forced to walk dirt paths where sidewalks should be.

ABLE cameras have improved bus speeds by 5 percent on enforced routes. Despite promises, Mayor Eric Adams has not delivered on expanding bus lanes.
