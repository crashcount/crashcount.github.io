Twenty-seven seriously hurt.</strong> In the last year alone, Senate District 16 has seen 2,342 crashes. The bodies are not numbers. They are neighbors. A 78-year-old woman, crossing Northern Boulevard near Parsons, struck down by a minivan that did not stop. She died in the hospital. The driver kept going. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/woman-78-killed-queens-hit-and-run-driver/>&ldquo;A 78-year-old woman was fatally struck by a hit-and-run driver as she crossed a Queens street, police said.&rdquo;</a></p><p>A child pinned under a car at 32nd Avenue and 138th Street. The man beside him, critical. The driver stayed. The street did not forgive. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-pedestrians-hit-man-pinned-vehicle-child-injured-being-car/16014608/>Police responded and found an adult man pinned under a vehicle.</a></p><p><strong>The old, the young, the careful, the hurried. All at risk.</strong></p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage.</strong> In three years, cars and SUVs killed 12, left 27 with serious wounds, and hurt hundreds more. Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds, none. Bikes, none. The street is not equal. The bigger the machine, the deeper the wound.</p><h3 id=what-has-john-liu-done>What Has John Liu Done?</h3><p>Senator John Liu has voted for safety. He backed bills to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>require speed limiters for repeat offenders</a> and to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>redesign streets for all users</a>. He pushed for lower drunk driving limits, saying, &ldquo;The 0.05 BAC simply says, don’t drink and drive.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/politics/city-transportation-chief-joins-state-push-to-lower-blood-alcohol-limits/>Liu said</a>. He called for more speed cameras near schools. He fought for a greenway expansion, but <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/11/20/hochul-vetoes-bill-to-expand-eastern-queens-greenway>Albany said no</a>.</p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The votes are not enough. The street does not wait for laws to catch up.</p><h3 id=what-next>What Next?</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> Call Senator Liu. Call your council member. Demand lower speed limits. Demand more cameras. Demand streets built for people, not just cars. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill requires drivers who rack up eleven or more points in 24 months, or six speed or red-light camera tickets in twelve months, to install intelligent speed assistance devices. Primary sponsor Andrew Gounardes led the push, joined by co-sponsors Samra Brouk, Cordell Cleare, and others. The vote passed with support from senators including Jeremy Cooney, Pete Harckham, and Jessica Ramos. The measure aims to rein in repeat offenders and reduce deadly speeding. The bill’s language is blunt: 'Requires the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices if a driver accumulates eleven or more points on their driving record during a 24 month period, or receives 6 speed camera or red light camera tickets during a twelve month period.'
