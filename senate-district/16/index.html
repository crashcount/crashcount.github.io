Police said the driver stayed. They are investigating <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/two-dead-in-separate-nyc-electric-vehicle-crashes-cops/>the crash</a>.

He died at the hospital. Patch named him Eric Wexler and reported no charges as of that afternoon <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/2-pedestrians-killed-separate-nyc-crashes-same-day-nypd-says>here</a>. The city’s file lists a pedestrian killed at that corner by an eastbound SUV <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>in the dataset</a>.</li><li>On December 18, a 65‑year‑old man was struck and killed on the Long Island Expressway by a westbound flatbed truck. The driver action is recorded as going straight. The file lists “Driver Inattention/Distraction.” The pedestrian died at the scene <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>in the city log</a>.</li></ul><h3 id=the-numbers-dont-blink>The numbers don’t blink</h3><ul><li>In the last 12 months in this district: <strong>11 deaths</strong>, <strong>1,834 injuries</strong>, <strong>3,021 crashes</strong>.

Seven or eight injured, depending on the outlet. ABC7 reported investigators now believe the 25‑year‑old driver “had fallen asleep at the wheel.” The MTA pulled him from service pending the probe <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>ABC7</a>, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>CBS New York</a>.</li><li>“The 25-year-old driver of the Q20 bus said he had a green light and misjudged the curb,” ABC7 reported, before the video review. “It is now believed he had fallen asleep at the wheel.” The injuries were described as minor by authorities <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>ABC7</a>, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>CBS New York</a>.</li></ul><h3 id=northern-boulevard-keeps-taking>Northern Boulevard keeps taking</h3><ul><li>Eric Wexler, 74, crossing at 217 St. A Chevy SUV.

School‑zone speed cameras are extended through 2030, legislators say. But the worst repeat offenders keep racking up tickets. The Senate moved a bill to force speed limiters on cars of chronic violators. Senator John Liu voted yes in committee on <strong>S 4045</strong>, which would require intelligent speed assistance for drivers with repeated violations <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Senate file</a>. As advocates have shown, a small share of drivers cause a large share of deaths <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/20/the-1-5-percent-of-drivers-who-cause-21-percent-of-pedestrian-deaths>Streetsblog</a>.</li><li>The city already has the power to lower speeds. It has not done it citywide. New Yorkers are asking for a <strong>20 mph default</strong> and enforcement that stops the worst repeat speeders.
