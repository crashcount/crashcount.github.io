Same ending.</p><ul><li><p>On July 3, a Ford Mustang tried a left at East 149th and Courtlandt. It jumped the curb and hit six people. The driver ran. Police said all six went to Lincoln in stable condition. “Police are searching for a driver who struck several pedestrians,” said <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/police-searching-for-driver-who-hit-several-pedestrians-in-the-bronx/>CBS New York</a>. Witnesses told ABC7, “People were yelling… crying.” The car ended up under the scaffold. The suspects fled on foot. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>ABC7</a> and the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/driver-plows-into-six-people-after-botching-left-turn-in-the-bronx/>Daily News</a> confirm the same corner and the same tally: six pedestrians, minor injuries.</p></li><li><p>On April 2, a man, 52, was killed at East 149th and Morris. Three SUVs in a westbound line. One moving, two stopped. He died of crush injuries. The state crash file lists him as a pedestrian outside the intersection. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a> CrashID 4803347.</p></li><li><p>On Feb. 25, at East 149th and Brook, an MTA Nova bus turned left and struck a 57‑year‑old man riding an e‑bike eastbound. He was ejected and died. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a> CrashID 4795059.</p></li><li><p>On April 17, on Oak Point and Coster, a 61‑year‑old man was crushed when a Hino box truck started from parking. He died there. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a> CrashID 4807051.</p></li><li><p>Last year, at 3rd Avenue and East 106th, a BMW motorcycle and a Toyota SUV collided. Two people on the bike were killed. The police file notes “traffic control disregarded” for two involved. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4763117</a>.</p></li></ul><p>The map keeps repeating the same lines. East 149th. 3rd Avenue. Trucks turning. Left turns. People on foot.</p><p>Speed spreads the damage. In this Senate district since 2022, there have been <strong>10,912 crashes</strong>, with <strong>36 dead</strong> and <strong>6,034 injured</strong>. SUVs lead the count of pedestrian harm: <strong>338 pedestrian casualties tied to SUVs</strong>, including <strong>5 deaths</strong>. Sedans: <strong>303</strong> with <strong>2 deaths</strong>. Trucks: <strong>44</strong> with <strong>3 deaths</strong>. Bikes and mopeds add more pain. All from the same dataset. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>This year. Worse than last.</p><p>From January through August 24, crashes in this district are up <strong>33%</strong> over last year. Injuries up <strong>30%</strong>. Serious injuries up <strong>44%</strong>. Deaths are down on paper, but the bodies named above say enough. Period stats sourced from the same city files. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>A child waits in a car. The car gets taken.</p><p>On August 10 in East Harlem, a man stole a minivan with a 9‑year‑old inside. He brought it back and ran. “The girl was unharmed,” police said, according to the <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/08/11/us-news/jumpy-nyc-crook-steals-car-but-returns-it-when-he-finds-9-year-old-inside-sources/>New York Post</a>. No arrest.</p><p>Officials know what works — do they?</p><p>Albany moved on speed. The Senate advanced the Stop Super Speeders bill. Senator José M. Serrano co‑sponsored and voted yes in committee on <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S 4045</a>. The bill would require intelligent speed limiters for drivers who rack up repeat violations. Committee votes passed on June 11 and 12. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>.</p><p>Cameras will stay on. Lawmakers extended 24‑hour school‑zone speed cameras through 2030, according to our published guide. Use the tools, then finish the job. Make it hard to speed.
