Steel met flesh in the cold morning light.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a 2022 Chevy SUV traveling north on York Avenue near 92nd Street struck a 77-year-old woman who was crossing alone at dawn. The report states, 'The front end hit her full. She lay bleeding from the head. The driver’s view was blocked. She was conscious.' The pedestrian suffered a head injury with severe bleeding, but remained conscious at the scene. The official contributing factor listed is 'View Obstructed/Limited,' indicating the driver’s line of sight was compromised. The data does not cite any pedestrian behavior as a contributing factor. The crash underscores the lethal risk when drivers proceed with limited visibility, especially in areas where vulnerable road users cross.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
