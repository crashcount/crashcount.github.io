Six people were walking. The car hit one, then five more, before smashing into scaffolding. The driver and passenger ran. The street was left with pain and panic. “People were yelling, were in pain, so yelling, crying, it was very upsetting,” <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>said Vivian Cole</a>. All six went to the hospital. They survived. This time.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-dont-lie>The Numbers Don’t Lie</h3><p><strong>In the last twelve months, SD 29 saw 8 deaths and over 2,000 injuries from crashes.</strong> Thirty-two people were seriously hurt. The bodies pile up. The stories blur. A cyclist killed by a bus on 149th. A pedestrian crushed by a truck on Oak Point. A man dead under the wheels of an SUV. The sidewalk, the crosswalk, the bike lane—none of them safe.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-and-silence>Leadership: Votes and Silence</h3><p>State Senator Jose Serrano has voted yes on bills to create safety zones and extend school speed cameras. He co-sponsored and <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted for the Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, which would force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from going too fast. These are steps. But the blood on the street says it is not enough. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not. The most dangerous drivers keep driving.</p><h3 id=the-voices-in-the-street>The Voices in the Street</h3><p>After the Mustang hit, the fear was raw. “We thought it was a bomb or something, because we are all panicking around here,” <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>said Christina Sieh</a>. The city moves on. The sidewalk is swept. The pain stays.</p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Senator Serrano. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real consequences for repeat offenders. <strong>Do not wait for another body on the sidewalk.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
