A cyclist lay dead on Brook Avenue, struck by a turning bus. In the last twelve months alone, <strong>11 people died and 27 suffered serious injuries</strong> on the streets of Senate District 29. <strong>Pedestrians, cyclists, and children are the first to fall.</strong></p><p>On Randall’s Island, a mother riding her e-bike home was beaten and left with brain injuries. Her daughter pleaded: <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/suspect-in-brutal-beating-of-e-bike-commuter-on-randalls-island-ordered-jailed>&ldquo;We need more protection, we need more lights.&rdquo;</a> The path had no lights. No cameras. No safety for the tired or the vulnerable.</p><p>In Hunts Point, a man sleeping under a box truck was crushed when the driver pulled away. A worker nearby said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/17/man-sleeping-under-box-truck-crushed-dead-hunts-point-bronx/>&ldquo;Nobody checks under their car [to see] if someone is there.&rdquo;</a> On these blocks, danger is routine. Death is common.</p><h2 id=the-numbers-that-dont-lie>The Numbers That Don’t Lie</h2><p><strong>In the past year, SD 29 saw 2,600 crashes, 1,585 injuries, and 11 deaths.</strong> Serious injuries are up 62% from the year before. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, parents, children. Most were walking or riding a bike. Most never saw it coming.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs killed more than any other vehicle.</strong> Trucks, buses, motorcycles, and bikes all took their share. The streets do not forgive mistakes. They punish the slow, the tired, the unlucky.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—and What Hasn’t</h2><p>Senator Jose Serrano voted yes on a bill to force safer street design statewide. The bill calls for roads built for people, not just cars. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>He voted for it.</a> That is a start. But the blood on the crosswalks says it is not enough.</p><p><strong>No press quotes. No public demands. No urgent push for more.</strong> The silence is loud. The crisis is not over. The next victim is already on the street.</p><h2 id=what-you-must-do>What You Must Do</h2><p><strong>Call Senator Serrano. Call your council member. Demand more.</strong> Demand lower speed limits, more protected crossings, and real accountability. Join <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a> and <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a>. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p><p><strong>The streets will not change themselves.
