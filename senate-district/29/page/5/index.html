Twenty-five left with injuries that will never heal.</strong> In the last year alone, Senate District 29 saw 2,560 crashes. These are not just numbers—they are neighbors, children, workers. In three years, 36 people have died: five killed by SUVs, three by trucks, one by a bike, the rest by cars, motorcycles, and buses. The streets do not forgive.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>A 15-year-old boy on a scooter was struck by a motorcyclist who ran a red light and sped away, leaving him fighting for his life.

The bill passed. It is a start. But the carnage continues. Cameras catch speeders, but the law that keeps them running is always under threat. The city can lower speed limits, but waits. The dead keep coming.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Call Senator Serrano.
