Six people walking in the crosswalk were hit. The driver and passenger ran. The car was left behind, battered and stripped of plates. The youngest victim was 30. The oldest, 79. All were sent to Lincoln Hospital. None died, but pain echoed through the street. “People were yelling, were in pain, so yelling, crying, it was very upsetting,” <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>said Vivian Cole</a>. The police are still looking for the driver. No one has been held to account.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-that-dont-lie>The Numbers That Don’t Lie</h3><p><strong>In the past 12 months, SD 29 saw 11 deaths and 1,734 injuries from crashes.</strong> Twenty-three people were seriously hurt. The toll is highest for those on foot or bike. SUVs and sedans did most of the damage. Trucks, buses, motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes all left bodies broken. The violence is not rare. It is routine. “We thought it was a bomb or something, because we are all panicking around here,” <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/03/us-news/6-pedestrians-struck-by-ford-mustang-that-crashed-into-nyc-scaffolding-before-driver-passenger-flee/>said Christina Sieh</a>.</p><h3 id=what-has-senator-serrano-done>What Has Senator Serrano Done?</h3><p>Senator Jose Serrano has voted for bills to curb repeat speeders and expand school speed cameras. He backed the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, which would force the worst offenders to install speed-limiting tech. He voted yes on <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8117>school speed cameras</a> and <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2021/S1078>driver education reforms</a>. These are steps forward. But the blood on the sidewalk says more is needed. Cameras and laws do not stop a Mustang with no plates. They do not heal a broken leg or erase a child’s fear.</p><h3 id=the-call-demand-more-than-words>The Call: Demand More Than Words</h3><p><strong>Six people hit. No arrests. Eleven dead in a year.</strong> This is not fate. It is policy. Call Senator Serrano. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat offenders. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
