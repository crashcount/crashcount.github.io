A Ford Mustang turned, hit a woman in the crosswalk, then jumped the curb and struck five more before smashing into scaffolding at East 149th and Courtlandt. The driver and passenger ran. The car stayed. The pain stayed. “People were yelling, were in pain, so yelling, crying, it was very upsetting,” <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>said Vivian Cole</a>. The youngest victim was 30. The oldest, 79. All were walking. None were safe.</p><p>This is not rare.

It will not be the last. “We thought it was a bomb or something, because we are all panicking around here,” <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>said Christina Sieh</a>.
