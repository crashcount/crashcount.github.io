A boy on a scooter is struck, left bleeding on Jerome Avenue. In the last twelve months, <strong>12 people have died</strong> on the streets of Senate District 29. <strong>Twenty-five more suffered serious injuries</strong>. The numbers do not flinch: <strong>over 1,500 injured, 2,560 crashes</strong>. Each one a life changed, or ended, in a moment.</p><p><strong>Children are not spared.</strong> Sixty-three kids were hurt. The old are broken too—no age is safe. Cars, trucks, bikes, buses: all take their share. <strong>SUVs alone killed eight pedestrians</strong> in this district since 2022. The city calls them accidents. The families know better.</p><h3 id=the-stories-that-stay>The Stories That Stay</h3><p>A 15-year-old boy rides his scooter north on Jerome. A motorcycle runs the red. The boy is hit, left in critical condition. The driver flees. Police ask for help, but the street stays the same. Police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/11/boy-15-on-scooter-struck-by-hit-and-run-bronx-motorcyclist-critically-hurt/>reported</a> that &ldquo;a 15-year-old boy riding his scooter was critically hurt when a Bronx motorcyclist blew through a red light, slammed into him and sped away.&rdquo;</p><p>A man sleeps under a box truck in Hunts Point. The driver pulls away, not knowing. The man dies. A worker <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/17/man-sleeping-under-box-truck-crushed-dead-hunts-point-bronx/>said</a>, &ldquo;Of course it wasn&rsquo;t his fault, but you know it&rsquo;s really hard knowing that by your accident a man died. It could happen with anybody. Anybody.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-miles-to-go>Leadership: Steps Forward, Miles to Go</h3><p><strong>Senator Jose Serrano voted yes</strong> on a bill to require safer street design for all users, not just drivers. He <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>backed S 9718, a measure to build streets that protect people on foot and on bikes.</a> This is a start. But the deaths keep coming. The bill passed, but the streets do not change overnight. There are no public quotes from Serrano demanding faster action or more funding. No press conference at the crash site. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> The bodies in the street are not the price of doing business. They are the cost of delay. <strong>Call Senator Serrano. Demand he fight for lower speed limits, more protected crossings, and real accountability for drivers who kill and flee.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The contributing factor listed is 'Traffic Control Disregarded.' This means a driver ignored a traffic signal, a critical error that led to the crash. The impact was severe: a 21-year-old woman, riding as a front passenger, was killed. Her injuries were described as affecting her entire body, and she was pronounced dead at the scene. The report notes a parked box truck was present but was not involved in the collision. No driver or vehicle errors are attributed to the victim. The fatal outcome stemmed from a driver’s failure to obey traffic controls, as documented by police.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
