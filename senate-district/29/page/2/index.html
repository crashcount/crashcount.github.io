Thirteen seriously hurt.</strong> That is just since January in Senate District 29. These numbers are not names, but every one was a life. In the last twelve months, <strong>eleven people killed, twenty-five left with life-changing wounds</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Last week, a driver ran a red light at Hunts Point Avenue and hit three men on the sidewalk. One is still fighting for his life. Police said the driver &ldquo;slammed on the gas and sped off east on Hunts Point Ave., blowing through a red light&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/driver-flees-bronx-car-stop-crash/>NY Daily News</a>). He ran, but the blood stayed behind.</p><p>A few months back, a cyclist was killed by a turning MTA bus on East 149th. In April, a man crossing Oak Point Avenue was crushed by a box truck. The stories do not stop. The street does not forgive.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> In three years, cars and trucks killed at least eight. Motorcycles and mopeds killed two. Bikes killed one (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The dead are old and young, men and women. Some were walking home. Some were riding to work. Some were just in the wrong place when a driver did not stop.</p><p>The city blames the walker, the biker, the weather. But the street is built for speed, not for life. The numbers do not lie. <strong>SUVs and cars caused the most harm—8 deaths, 745 injuries.</strong> Trucks and buses killed 3. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes killed fewer, but the pain is the same (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=what-has-been-done>What Has Been Done</h3><p>State Senator Jose Serrano voted yes on a bill to force safer street design (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>Open States S 9718</a>). The bill says streets must be built for all, not just for cars. It passed. But the blood keeps flowing. There are no public quotes. No press releases. No comfort for the families left behind.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. Call Senator Serrano. Call your council member. Demand streets that do not kill. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

It pushes for complete street design. The aim: safer roads for everyone. Pedestrians, cyclists, and passengers stand to gain. The vote split. Some senators said no. But the bill moved forward. Streets may change.</p><p class=mb3>Senate Bill S 9718, titled "Enables safe access to public roads for all users by utilizing complete street design principles," advanced through the Senate with committee votes on May 28 and June 3, 2024. The bill, sponsored by Sean Ryan (District 61) and co-sponsored by Liz Krueger, Monica Martinez, Jack M. Martins, Anthony H. Palumbo, and Julia Salazar, passed both votes despite opposition. The measure calls for redesigning streets to protect all users, not just drivers. The vote was not unanimous—several senators voted no, but the majority carried it through. The bill’s focus is clear: safer streets for people on foot, on bikes, and in vehicles. No safety analyst note was provided, but the intent is to cut danger at the curb and crosswalk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
