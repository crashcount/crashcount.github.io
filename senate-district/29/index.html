A cyclist lay dead on Brook Avenue, struck by a turning bus. In the last twelve months alone, <strong>11 people died and 27 suffered serious injuries</strong> on the streets of Senate District 29. <strong>Pedestrians, cyclists, and children are the first to fall.</strong></p><p>On Randall’s Island, a mother riding her e-bike home was beaten and left with brain injuries.

The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, parents, children. Most were walking or riding a bike. Most never saw it coming.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs killed more than any other vehicle.</strong> Trucks, buses, motorcycles, and bikes all took their share. The streets do not forgive mistakes. They punish the slow, the tired, the unlucky.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—and What Hasn’t</h2><p>Senator Jose Serrano voted yes on a bill to force safer street design statewide.

But the blood on the crosswalks says it is not enough.</p><p><strong>No press quotes. No public demands. No urgent push for more.</strong> The silence is loud. The crisis is not over.
