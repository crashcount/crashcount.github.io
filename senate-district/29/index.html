The driver lost control, mounted the curb, and plowed into six people. He left the car and ran. Six bodies on the ground, sirens in the heat. All sent to Lincoln Hospital. The police are still looking for him. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/bronx-sidewalk-shed-crash-melrose/>&ldquo;Once I heard the noise I turned around and it was already on the curb. It immediately backed up and fled.&rdquo;</a> said Melvin Pemberton, a witness. The city called it minor injuries. There is nothing minor about a car on the sidewalk.</p><h3 id=the-toll-death-and-injury-year-after-year>The Toll: Death and Injury, Year After Year</h3><p>In the last twelve months, SD 29 saw <strong>10 deaths, 25 serious injuries, and 1,881 people hurt</strong> in 3,189 crashes. The dead include children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians. The numbers do not stop. They only grow. In the last year, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crashes rose nearly 24%</a>. Injuries climbed by <strong>18%</strong>. The faces change, the pain repeats.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p>SUVs and cars did the most harm—<strong>8 deaths, 16 serious injuries</strong>. Trucks and buses killed <strong>3</strong>, left <strong>6</strong> with life-changing wounds. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes took more. The sidewalk, the crosswalk, the street—none are safe. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/bronx-sidewalk-shed-crash-melrose/>Police say all six victims were taken to Lincoln Hospital with minor injuries.</a></p><h3 id=what-has-senator-serrano-done>What Has Senator Serrano Done?</h3><p>State Senator Jose Serrano voted yes on bills to extend school speed zones and create safety zones. He co-sponsored the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, which would force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting devices. He voted yes in committee. But the law is not yet passed. The dead cannot wait for Albany.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-now>Call to Action: Demand More, Now</h3><p><strong>Call Senator Serrano. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand the Stop Super Speeders Act. Demand streets where a child can walk and live.</strong></p><p>The sidewalk is not safe. The crosswalk is not safe.
