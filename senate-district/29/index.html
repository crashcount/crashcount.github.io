Eighty-one more are left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 5,600 have been hurt since 2022. The streets run through <a href=/neighborhood/bx0101/>Mott Haven</a>, <a href=/neighborhood/bx0102/>Melrose</a>, <a href=/neighborhood/bx0402/>Highbridge</a>, and the <a href=/neighborhood/mn0803/>Upper East Side</a>. The violence does not stop for age or daylight. It comes for children, elders, anyone who dares to walk, ride, or cross.</p><p><strong>Just this July, a Ford Mustang jumped the curb at East 149th and Courtlandt. Six people were hit.</strong> Witnesses did not see a car—they saw chaos. &ldquo;People were yelling, were in pain, so yelling, crying, it was very upsetting,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>said Vivian Cole</a>. The driver ran. The sidewalk was left with blood and broken bodies. No arrests. No answers.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p>The dead are not numbers. They are the 52-year-old man crushed by SUVs on Morris Avenue. The 57-year-old cyclist killed by a turning bus on East 149th. The 61-year-old man, sleeping under a truck, who never woke up. <strong>SUVs and cars caused the most pain—eight deaths, hundreds hurt. Trucks and buses killed three. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes claimed others.</strong></p><h3 id=what-has-senator-serrano-done>What Has Senator Serrano Done?</h3><p><strong>Senator Jose Serrano has voted yes on key safety bills.</strong> He backed the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, which would force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed limiters. He voted to extend school speed zones and fund safer street designs. These are steps. But the blood keeps coming. The Mustang keeps running. The sidewalk is never safe enough.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This crisis is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Senator Serrano. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat offenders. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
