Since 2022, <strong>36 people have died</strong> and <strong>80 have been seriously injured</strong> in crashes here. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, workers, elders. In the last twelve months alone, <strong>11 killed, 25 left with life-altering wounds</strong>—and the year is only half done.</p><p><strong>Just last week, three pedestrians were mowed down on a Bronx sidewalk</strong>. One man, 33, is fighting for his life. Police say the driver &ldquo;slammed on the gas and sped off east on Hunts Point Ave., blowing through a red light&rdquo; before the car spun onto the curb and crushed them. The <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/driver-flees-bronx-car-stop-crash/>unlicensed 28-year-old driver is facing multiple counts of vehicular assault, cops said</a>. He ran. The street did not let the victims run.</p><p>A few days before, a cyclist in Central Park hit a pedestrian and died after striking his head on the curb. The pedestrian walked away with a minor injury. The cyclist did not walk away at all. <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/e-biker-dies-in-central-park-accident-with-pedestrian-YA4736414>He ran into the unidentified 41-year-old pedestrian. Nico-Garcia was then flung from his bike and struck his head on the curb, the NYPD said.</a></p><h3 id=patterns-in-metal-and-flesh>Patterns in Metal and Flesh</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars did the most harm</strong>—8 deaths, 15 serious injuries, hundreds hurt. Trucks and buses killed 3, left 6 with broken bodies. Motorcycles and mopeds, 2 dead, 1 maimed. Bikes, too, can kill: 1 death, 3 serious injuries. The numbers do not lie. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-a-vote-but-not-enough>Leadership: A Vote, But Not Enough</h3><p>State Senator Jose Serrano voted yes on a bill to force safer street design. The <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>bill passed</a>. It is a start. But the blood keeps flowing. The dead keep coming. The law is not yet the street. The curb is still a killing ground.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-make-them-hear-you>Call to Action: Make Them Hear You</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Senator Serrano. Call your council member. Demand a street where you can walk and live. Demand action, not words. The next name could be yours.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
