It hit a woman in the crosswalk, then mounted the curb and struck five more under the scaffolding. The driver and passenger ran, leaving the car behind. Six people went to Lincoln Hospital. They were alive. They were lucky. &ldquo;People were yelling, were in pain, so yelling, crying, it was very upsetting,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>said Vivian Cole</a>.
