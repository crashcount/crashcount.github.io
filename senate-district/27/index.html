It struck a man on his bike and a woman sitting on a bench. Both died where they fell. The city called it a crash. The families call it loss. The driver tried to run. Police found guns and a bottle of alcohol in the car. The city promised changes, but the blood on the sidewalk is still fresh. <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/07/chinatown-deadly-crash-safety-upgrades-canal-street>A stolen vehicle, allegedly driven at more than 100 miles per hour, crashed into them.</a></p><p>This is not rare.

They only count the bodies.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-behind-the-names>The Numbers Behind the Names</h3><p>Since 2022, there have been <strong>27 deaths</strong> and <strong>60 serious injuries</strong> in SD 27. Most victims were not behind the wheel. Cars and trucks did the worst damage—<strong>10 deaths</strong> and hundreds hurt. Trucks and buses killed <strong>7</strong>. Bikes killed <strong>1</strong>. The city counts the dead. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=what-has-senator-kavanagh-done>What Has Senator Kavanagh Done?</h3><p>State Senator Brian Kavanagh has voted for safety. He backed the bill to force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. He <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes</a> to extend school speed zones. He pushed for sensors to catch overweight trucks on the BQE. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/20/manhattan-bp-wants-to-raze-fdr-drive-south-of-brooklyn-bridge>&ldquo;We will work with the borough president.&rdquo;</a></p><p>But the deaths keep coming.

Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real redesigns, not just talk.</strong> Every day of delay is another family broken. The dead cannot call.

Fines become court dates. Advocates warn of escalation. Lawmakers push for e-bike registration after a fatal crash. Streets grow tense. Riders and pedestrians caught in the crossfire.</p><p class=mb3>West Side Spirit reported on May 13, 2025, that NYPD has begun issuing criminal summonses, not just traffic tickets, to cyclists and e-bike riders for violations like running red lights or riding on sidewalks. The change means accused riders must appear in criminal court, not just pay a fine. The move follows the death of Priscilla Loke, struck by an e-bike in 2023. Advocates like Transportation Alternatives call the new policy 'a dangerous escalation.' The NYC E-Vehicle Safety Alliance urges lawmakers to require license plates for e-bikes and scooters. The article notes, 'Under the new policy, a person issued a criminal summons must turn up in person in criminal court.' The shift highlights growing tension over enforcement and the push for stricter regulation after high-profile crashes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
