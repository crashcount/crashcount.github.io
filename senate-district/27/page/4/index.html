The street does not care who you are.</p><p>A cyclist rides west on Broome. A van door swings open. He is thrown under a truck. He dies on the street. The van driver says, &ldquo;I opened the door.

It calls for streets that do not kill.</p><p>Kavanagh has also backed plans to remove the FDR Drive south of the Brooklyn Bridge, giving space back to people on foot and on bikes. He supported sensors to catch overweight trucks on the BQE, a danger to everyone not behind the wheel. But the sensors are still not live. The trucks keep coming.</p><h3 id=what-still-must-be-done>What Still Must Be Done</h3><p><strong>The deaths keep coming. The injuries keep coming.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has the power to build real protection for people outside cars. It has the power to keep speed cameras running. It does not always use it.</p><p><strong>Call your leaders. Tell them to use every tool.</strong> Tell them to build streets that do not kill.

Levine wrote, 'The Hudson River Greenway is one of the most heavily used bike paths in the country... congestion has worsened significantly.' He sent his letter to state DOT Commissioner Therese Dominguez and city DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. Local elected officials and Community Board 1, which voted 41-3 in May 2020 to support the change, also back the plan. State senators, assembly members, and council members signed a letter urging the same. Levine and supporters argue the new lane would ease crowding and give e-bike delivery workers—many of them immigrants—a safe, legal route. The state DOT has resisted, citing car congestion.
