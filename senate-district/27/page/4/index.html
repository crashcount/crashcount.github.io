The driver, 23, sped off the Manhattan Bridge, lost control at Canal and Bowery, and killed two people. Kevin Cruickshank was riding his bike. May Kwok was sitting on a bench. Both are gone. The car crashed into a police van. Drugs and alcohol were found inside. The driver had a record—arrested for leaving the scene of a crash that badly hurt a pedestrian in April, but released without bail. The city failed to stop her.</p><p>A witness said, &ldquo;the driver was speeding when tragedy struck&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/pedestrian-cyclist-killed-in-chinatown-crash/>CBS New York</a>. The mayor called it &ldquo;excessive speed&rdquo; and said, &ldquo;No one should lose their life in that manner.&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/man-morning-bike-ride-killed-among-victims-chinatown-crash-2-women-arrested/17215969/>ABC7</a>.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h3><p>In the last 12 months, SD 27 saw 4 killed and 25 seriously injured in traffic crashes. Over 1,200 were hurt. In three and a half years, 27 people have died. Nearly 60 suffered life-changing injuries. Most were walking or riding. Cars and SUVs did the most harm—killing 10, seriously injuring 15. Trucks and buses killed 7. Bikes killed 1. No one is safe. The street is a gauntlet.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Senator Brian Kavanagh has voted for safety. He backed the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>. He voted to renew school speed zones. He supported truck weight sensors on the BQE and plans to reclaim the FDR for people, not cars. But the carnage continues. Laws are slow. Streets stay deadly. The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not done it. The dead keep coming.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-no-more-waiting>Call to Action: No More Waiting</h3><p>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action on repeat speeders. Join the fight. Every day of delay is another life lost. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

He calls for federal funds to turn the highway into a bike and pedestrian haven. The plan faces legal and political hurdles but aims to reclaim space for people.</p><p class=mb3>On September 20, 2023, Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine revived a proposal to remove the FDR Drive viaduct south of the Brooklyn Bridge. The plan, not yet in committee or assigned a bill number, seeks federal support through the Reconnecting Communities and Neighborhoods grant. Levine urges Mayor Adams to apply for funding, stating, 'We’re a perfect candidate for Reconnecting Communities.' State Senator Brian Kavanagh voiced support, saying, 'We will work with the borough president.' The proposal would transform the underused highway into a waterfront space for cyclists and pedestrians, echoing successful removals in cities like Seattle and Seoul. The project faces major legal, environmental, and jurisdictional obstacles, as the FDR is state-owned and exempt from congestion pricing. The city previously considered this removal for coastal resiliency, but dropped it from the final plan. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the plan centers vulnerable road users by reclaiming space from cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
