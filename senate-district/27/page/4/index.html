It struck a man on his bike and a woman sitting on a bench. Both died where they fell. The city called it a crash. The families call it loss. The driver tried to run. Police found guns and a bottle of alcohol in the car. The city promised changes, but the blood on the sidewalk is still fresh. <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/07/chinatown-deadly-crash-safety-upgrades-canal-street>A stolen vehicle, allegedly driven at more than 100 miles per hour, crashed into them.</a></p><p>This is not rare. In the last twelve months, SD 27 saw <strong>4 deaths</strong> and <strong>24 serious injuries</strong> from crashes. Cyclists, walkers, children. The numbers do not heal. They only count the bodies.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-behind-the-names>The Numbers Behind the Names</h3><p>Since 2022, there have been <strong>27 deaths</strong> and <strong>60 serious injuries</strong> in SD 27. Most victims were not behind the wheel. Cars and trucks did the worst damage—<strong>10 deaths</strong> and hundreds hurt. Trucks and buses killed <strong>7</strong>. Bikes killed <strong>1</strong>. The city counts the dead. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=what-has-senator-kavanagh-done>What Has Senator Kavanagh Done?</h3><p>State Senator Brian Kavanagh has voted for safety. He backed the bill to force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. He <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes</a> to extend school speed zones. He pushed for sensors to catch overweight trucks on the BQE. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/20/manhattan-bp-wants-to-raze-fdr-drive-south-of-brooklyn-bridge>&ldquo;We will work with the borough president.&rdquo;</a></p><p>But the deaths keep coming. Promises and votes are not enough. The street does not care about bills. It cares about speed, steel, and flesh.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p><strong>Call Senator Kavanagh. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real redesigns, not just talk.</strong> Every day of delay is another family broken. The dead cannot call.

The event, covered by Charles Komanoff, featured MTA specialists Julia Kite-Laidlaw and Daniel Randell, with State Senator Brian Kavanagh moderating. Council Member Christopher Marte questioned the zone’s boundaries. Assembly Member Deborah Glick demanded action on toll theft. The MTA repeated the need for revenue and warned that exemptions would push more traffic into environmental-justice neighborhoods. The forum’s matter title: 'What Was Left Unsaid to Congestion Pricing Opponents.' The debate exposed deep mistrust and skepticism about government promises.

He calls for federal funds to turn the highway into a bike and pedestrian haven. The plan faces legal and political hurdles but aims to reclaim space for people.</p><p class=mb3>On September 20, 2023, Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine revived a proposal to remove the FDR Drive viaduct south of the Brooklyn Bridge. The plan, not yet in committee or assigned a bill number, seeks federal support through the Reconnecting Communities and Neighborhoods grant. Levine urges Mayor Adams to apply for funding, stating, 'We’re a perfect candidate for Reconnecting Communities.' State Senator Brian Kavanagh voiced support, saying, 'We will work with the borough president.' The proposal would transform the underused highway into a waterfront space for cyclists and pedestrians, echoing successful removals in cities like Seattle and Seoul. The project faces major legal, environmental, and jurisdictional obstacles, as the FDR is state-owned and exempt from congestion pricing. The city previously considered this removal for coastal resiliency, but dropped it from the final plan. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the plan centers vulnerable road users by reclaiming space from cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
