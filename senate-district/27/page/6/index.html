The e-bike rider, a 54-year-old man, was ejected and suffered a head injury with severe bleeding. According to the police report, the crash involved 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' and 'Turning Improperly' as contributing factors. The SUV driver’s actions—improper lane use and an unsafe U-turn—created the conditions for the collision. The rider was unhelmeted, as noted in the report, but the primary causes listed are driver errors. No injuries were reported for the SUV occupants.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
