Police found guns and alcohol in the overdue rental. The driver refused a breathalyzer. The crash site was known as dangerous. It was not a surprise. It was a pattern.</p><p>Sarah Witt, Cruickshank’s sister, stood at the vigil and said, <strong>“His trip was cut short at an intersection known to some to be very dangerous. It is time to make this known to all and time for the city to take action.”</strong> (<a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/manhattan-bridge-crash-driver-faces-murder-rap-marte-blasts-dot-for-neglect-KB4883851>said Cruickshank’s sister</a>).</p><p>Days later, another hit-and-run in Chinatown killed a pedestrian and a cyclist. The driver fled. The intersection on Canal Street had a history. The community gathered to mourn. The news anchor said, <strong>“The crash is raising questions about a bigger safety problem at an intersection of Canal Street.”</strong> (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/vigil-held-for-pedestrian-cyclist-killed-in-chinatown-hit-and-run/>reported CBS New York</a>).</p><h3 id=the-numbers-relentless-and-rising>The Numbers: Relentless and Rising</h3><p><strong>In the last 12 months, SD 27 saw 4 deaths, 24 serious injuries, and 1,292 people hurt in 2,632 crashes.</strong> Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians are among the dead. The numbers do not rest. They do not lie. Cars and trucks killed or injured the most, but bikes and mopeds also left scars. The disaster is slow, but it is steady.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-and-the-road-ahead>Leadership: Votes and the Road Ahead</h3><p>State Senator Brian Kavanagh has voted yes on bills to curb repeat speeders and extend school speed zones. He backed the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a> and supported safety zones. He stood with those calling for truck weight sensors on the BQE. These are steps, but the blood on the street says it is not enough. The city has the power to lower speed limits. The state can do more to stop repeat offenders. The time for delay is over.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more>Call to Action: Demand More</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable. Every death is a failure.</strong> Call Senator Kavanagh. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat speeders. Stand with the families who have lost. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The street remembers. So should we.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
