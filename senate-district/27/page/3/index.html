Fifty-six left with serious injuries.</strong> In just the last twelve months, nine people killed, twenty-four left with wounds that will not heal. Cyclists, pedestrians, children. The street does not care who you are.</p><p>A cyclist rides west on Broome. A van door swings open. He is thrown under a truck. He dies on the street. The van driver says, &ldquo;I opened the door. I didn’t even see the guy. I only saw the accident.

It calls for streets that do not kill.</p><p>Kavanagh has also backed plans to remove the FDR Drive south of the Brooklyn Bridge, giving space back to people on foot and on bikes. He supported sensors to catch overweight trucks on the BQE, a danger to everyone not behind the wheel. But the sensors are still not live. The trucks keep coming.</p><h3 id=what-still-must-be-done>What Still Must Be Done</h3><p><strong>The deaths keep coming. The injuries keep coming.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has the power to build real protection for people outside cars. It has the power to keep speed cameras running. It does not always use it.</p><p><strong>Call your leaders. Tell them to use every tool.</strong> Tell them to build streets that do not kill.

The plan, not yet in committee or assigned a bill number, seeks federal support through the Reconnecting Communities and Neighborhoods grant. Levine urges Mayor Adams to apply for funding, stating, 'We’re a perfect candidate for Reconnecting Communities.' State Senator Brian Kavanagh voiced support, saying, 'We will work with the borough president.' The proposal would transform the underused highway into a waterfront space for cyclists and pedestrians, echoing successful removals in cities like Seattle and Seoul. The project faces major legal, environmental, and jurisdictional obstacles, as the FDR is state-owned and exempt from congestion pricing. The city previously considered this removal for coastal resiliency, but dropped it from the final plan. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the plan centers vulnerable road users by reclaiming space from cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
