The crash occurred at 9:30 p.m. The report describes, 'A Tesla slammed into a parked taxi. Steel crumpled. The 35-year-old driver was trapped, crushed in the cab.' Emergency responders arrived as the street stood silent, pierced only by sirens and the sound of twisted metal. The taxi driver, a 35-year-old man, suffered crush injuries and was not ejected from the vehicle. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified.' The data shows the taxi was parked and the Tesla was traveling straight ahead before the impact. No driver errors are explicitly named in the report, but the sequence of events centers on the moving vehicle colliding with a stationary one, leaving the vulnerable driver trapped in the aftermath.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
