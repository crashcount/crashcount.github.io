The streets do not forgive. A cyclist crushed in the West Village. A pedestrian struck dead on the FDR. A city worker slashed by an e-bike rider while fixing a sign at dawn—&ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t even in the bike lane, they were parked on the corner, fixing the light or the sign or something&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/electric-biker-slashes-city-worker-nearly-crash-lower-manhattan/>said a witness</a>. Blood on the sidewalk. The city moves on.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>Cars and trucks do most of the damage.</strong> Sedans, SUVs, and taxis killed 9. Trucks and buses killed 7. Motorcycles and mopeds took no lives but left dozens hurt. Bikes killed 1 and injured many more. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not. A pickup veers. A box truck crushes. A taxi runs a light. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><h2 id=what-has-senator-kavanagh-done>What Has Senator Kavanagh Done?</h2><p><strong>Senator Brian Kavanagh has voted for safety, but the crisis is not over.</strong> He voted yes to require speed-limiting devices for repeat speeders, a move meant to stop the worst offenders <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>supported by Open States</a>. He backed the extension of school speed zones. He supported weigh-in-motion sensors to catch overweight trucks on the BQE. But the streets are still dangerous. The laws are not enough. &ldquo;This was an abhorrent assault of a NYC DOT employee who performs critical work to keep our city moving,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/dot-worker-slashed-by-e-biker-manhattan/>said a DOT spokesperson</a>. The work is not done.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay means more blood on the street.</strong> Call Senator Kavanagh. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real action against repeat offenders. Join the fight. Do not wait for the next siren.</p><p><strong>Act now.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report states: 'A bus turned right. The rear wheel struck a man’s head. He was 45. Blood pooled on the pavement. The bus showed no damage. He died where he fell.' The pedestrian was at the intersection, engaged in 'other actions in roadway' as described in the report. The vehicle, a 2018 bus, was undamaged and driven by a licensed male driver. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified.' No driver errors are explicitly cited, but the narrative centers the lethal consequences of a turning bus and the vulnerability of those on foot.

The event, covered by Charles Komanoff, featured MTA specialists Julia Kite-Laidlaw and Daniel Randell, with State Senator Brian Kavanagh moderating. Council Member Christopher Marte questioned the zone’s boundaries. Assembly Member Deborah Glick demanded action on toll theft. The MTA repeated the need for revenue and warned that exemptions would push more traffic into environmental-justice neighborhoods. The forum’s matter title: 'What Was Left Unsaid to Congestion Pricing Opponents.' The debate exposed deep mistrust and skepticism about government promises. No direct safety analysis was provided, but the stakes for vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, transit riders—remain high as congestion pricing inches forward.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
