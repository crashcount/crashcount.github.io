It struck a man on his bike and a woman sitting on a bench. Both died where they fell. The city called it a crash. The families call it loss. The driver tried to run. Police found guns and a bottle of alcohol in the car. The city promised changes, but the blood on the sidewalk is still fresh. <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/07/chinatown-deadly-crash-safety-upgrades-canal-street>A stolen vehicle, allegedly driven at more than 100 miles per hour, crashed into them.</a></p><p>This is not rare. In the last twelve months, SD 27 saw <strong>4 deaths</strong> and <strong>24 serious injuries</strong> from crashes. Cyclists, walkers, children. The numbers do not heal. They only count the bodies.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-behind-the-names>The Numbers Behind the Names</h3><p>Since 2022, there have been <strong>27 deaths</strong> and <strong>60 serious injuries</strong> in SD 27. Most victims were not behind the wheel. Cars and trucks did the worst damage—<strong>10 deaths</strong> and hundreds hurt. Trucks and buses killed <strong>7</strong>. Bikes killed <strong>1</strong>. The city counts the dead. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=what-has-senator-kavanagh-done>What Has Senator Kavanagh Done?</h3><p>State Senator Brian Kavanagh has voted for safety. He backed the bill to force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. He <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes</a> to extend school speed zones. He pushed for sensors to catch overweight trucks on the BQE. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/20/manhattan-bp-wants-to-raze-fdr-drive-south-of-brooklyn-bridge>&ldquo;We will work with the borough president.&rdquo;</a></p><p>But the deaths keep coming. Promises and votes are not enough. The street does not care about bills. It cares about speed, steel, and flesh.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p><strong>Call Senator Kavanagh. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real redesigns, not just talk.</strong> Every day of delay is another family broken. The dead cannot call.

The report states the 19-year-old rider was ejected, landing hard on the asphalt, bleeding severely from his eye but remaining conscious. The police report lists 'Following Too Closely' as the contributing factor in the collision. The rear cyclist's failure to maintain a safe distance led directly to the violent impact, sending the victim forward onto the street. The report describes the point of impact as the right rear bumper of the lead bike and the left front quarter panel of the trailing bike.
