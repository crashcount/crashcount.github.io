The street does not care who you are.</p><p>A cyclist rides west on Broome. A van door swings open. He is thrown under a truck. He dies on the street. The van driver says, &ldquo;I opened the door. I didn’t even see the guy. I only saw the accident.

It calls for streets that do not kill.</p><p>Kavanagh has also backed plans to remove the FDR Drive south of the Brooklyn Bridge, giving space back to people on foot and on bikes. He supported sensors to catch overweight trucks on the BQE, a danger to everyone not behind the wheel. But the sensors are still not live. The trucks keep coming.</p><h3 id=what-still-must-be-done>What Still Must Be Done</h3><p><strong>The deaths keep coming. The injuries keep coming.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has the power to build real protection for people outside cars. It has the power to keep speed cameras running. It does not always use it.</p><p><strong>Call your leaders. Tell them to use every tool.</strong> Tell them to build streets that do not kill.

According to the police report, the truck’s wheels crushed the pedestrian’s skull, causing fatal injuries at the scene. The report explicitly lists 'Backing Unsafely' as the contributing factor for the crash. The victim was not at an intersection and was described as performing 'Other Actions in Roadway,' but the report does not cite any pedestrian behavior as a cause. The focus remains on the driver’s action: reversing a large refuse vehicle without adequate care, as documented by police. This crash underscores the lethal consequences when heavy vehicles back unsafely on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
