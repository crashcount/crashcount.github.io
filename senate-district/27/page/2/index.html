Twenty-five left with life-altering wounds.</strong> In the last year alone, Senate District 27 has seen 1,326 crashes. Cyclists crushed. Pedestrians broken. These are not just numbers—they are bodies on Bowery, sirens on Broome, blood on the FDR.</p><p>On May 1, George Smaragdis, a 44-year-old cyclist, was doored on Broome Street. The door flung open. He hit it, fell, and a truck ran him over. He died at Bellevue. The van driver <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/02/biker-died-manhattan-identified-police/>said, &ldquo;It happened so fast.

Twenty-five suffered serious injuries. Most were walking or riding. Most never saw it coming.</p><p>The killers are cars, trucks, SUVs. In this district, cars and trucks caused 669 pedestrian injuries and deaths. Motorcycles and mopeds, 44. Bikes, 101. The street is a gauntlet. The odds are against you if you are not behind the wheel.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>State Senator Brian Kavanagh has voted for bills to curb repeat speeders and create safety zones. He backed the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, which would force the worst offenders to install speed-limiting devices. He voted to extend school speed zones. He supported <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/bqe-truck-weight-sensors-take-year-for-setup-dot/>truck weight sensors on the BQE</a>. These are steps. But the blood keeps coming.</p><p><strong>No law has yet stopped the next door from swinging open, the next driver from running the light.</strong></p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people who walk and ride.</strong> Every day you wait is another day someone does not come home.

The report does not list any victim behavior as a contributing factor.
