It struck a man on his bike and a woman sitting on a bench. Both died where they fell. The city called it a crash. The families call it loss. The driver tried to run. Police found guns and a bottle of alcohol in the car. The city promised changes, but the blood on the sidewalk is still fresh. <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/07/chinatown-deadly-crash-safety-upgrades-canal-street>A stolen vehicle, allegedly driven at more than 100 miles per hour, crashed into them.</a></p><p>This is not rare. In the last twelve months, SD 27 saw <strong>4 deaths</strong> and <strong>24 serious injuries</strong> from crashes. Cyclists, walkers, children. The numbers do not heal. They only count the bodies.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-behind-the-names>The Numbers Behind the Names</h3><p>Since 2022, there have been <strong>27 deaths</strong> and <strong>60 serious injuries</strong> in SD 27. Most victims were not behind the wheel. Cars and trucks did the worst damage—<strong>10 deaths</strong> and hundreds hurt. Trucks and buses killed <strong>7</strong>. Bikes killed <strong>1</strong>. The city counts the dead. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=what-has-senator-kavanagh-done>What Has Senator Kavanagh Done?</h3><p>State Senator Brian Kavanagh has voted for safety. He backed the bill to force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. He <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes</a> to extend school speed zones. He pushed for sensors to catch overweight trucks on the BQE. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/20/manhattan-bp-wants-to-raze-fdr-drive-south-of-brooklyn-bridge>&ldquo;We will work with the borough president.&rdquo;</a></p><p>But the deaths keep coming. Promises and votes are not enough. The street does not care about bills. It cares about speed, steel, and flesh.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p><strong>Call Senator Kavanagh. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real redesigns, not just talk.</strong> Every day of delay is another family broken. The dead cannot call.

The crash happened around 10:10 a.m. on Broome Street near Centre Street. The van driver told the outlet, "I opened the door. I didn’t even see the guy. I only saw the accident." The collision forced the cyclist into the path of a red delivery truck, which then struck him. The 54-year-old truck driver stayed at the scene. Police had not determined if charges would be filed. The article highlights the lethal risk of dooring and the vulnerability of cyclists in mixed traffic.

The incident occurred at 8:50 a.m. in Manhattan. The cyclist suffered severe facial lacerations, with blood running down his face as described in the narrative. The report explicitly lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'View Obstructed/Limited' as contributing factors. The BMW driver, licensed in New Jersey, was present and reportedly looked away at the moment of impact. The cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but helmet use is not cited as a contributing factor in the police report. The focus remains on the driver’s inattention and the systemic danger posed by inattentive dooring in dense city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
