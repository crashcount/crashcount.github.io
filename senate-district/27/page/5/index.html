The pilot program, enabled by a state bill signed December 22, aims to fine illegally overweight trucks. The bill was introduced by State lawmakers Brian Kavanagh and Jo Anne Simon. Council Member Lincoln Restler, representing District 33, pressed for rapid installation, warning, "There are extremely overweight trucks barreling down the triple cantilever every single day that are a hazard to the health and safety of our community." The matter title states: "Tonnage sensors on the BQE will take a year to set up: DOT." The project is complex, requiring city and state DOT coordination and a 90-day grace period once operational. Vulnerable road users remain exposed while the system is delayed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored in the state legislature by Brian Kavanagh and Jo Anne Simon, was signed into law on December 22. The measure, described as a 'critical project' by DOT, aims to catch and fine overweight trucks using new sensors. Restler said, 'There are extremely overweight trucks barreling down the triple cantilever every single day that are a hazard to the health and safety of our community.' DOT claims the system will be operational by year’s end, citing technical complexity. The Brooklyn Heights Association and local officials demand faster action. The pilot is the first of its kind in the nation.
