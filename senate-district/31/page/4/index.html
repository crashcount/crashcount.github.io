The battery was dead. A black Mercedes slammed into him from behind. He called again, this time to say he could not breathe. He died before help arrived. The driver ran. Police have not found him. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/24/beloved-club-promoter-darryl-mathis-jr-killed-by-hit-run-bronx-mercedes-driver/>“He called to get a jump, and after that, he got hit from behind, a hit-and-run. They were on their way to come give him a jump and he got hit waiting for them. And then he called to let them know, I&rsquo;ve been hit. I can&rsquo;t breathe.”</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>eight people died</strong> in Senate District 31. <strong>Twenty-four were seriously injured.</strong> Over a thousand were hurt. The dead include the old and the young. A 65-year-old man was killed crossing with the signal. A 24-year-old woman was struck in a crosswalk. The street does not care who you are.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage.</strong> In three years, they killed seven pedestrians, left twenty with serious injuries, and caused 190 moderate injuries. Trucks and buses killed three. Motorcycles and mopeds caused one serious injury and sixteen moderate injuries. Bikes caused one serious injury and eight moderate injuries. The numbers do not lie. The street is a battlefield, and the weapons are heavy and fast.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-done-what-has-not>What Has Been Done, What Has Not</h3><p>Senator Robert Jackson has voted for safer streets. He backed the law to force complete street design, to protect people on foot and on bikes. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>He voted yes.</a> He co-sponsored bills for fare-free buses and for public safety ratings on cars.

The cameras do not cover every street. The laws do not slow every car. The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not done so. The dead wait for action.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-no-more-waiting>Call to Action: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand 20 mph on every street.

Levine wrote, 'The Hudson River Greenway is one of the most heavily used bike paths in the country... congestion has worsened significantly.' He sent his letter to state DOT Commissioner Therese Dominguez and city DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. Local elected officials and Community Board 1, which voted 41-3 in May 2020 to support the change, also back the plan. State senators, assembly members, and council members signed a letter urging the same. Levine and supporters argue the new lane would ease crowding and give e-bike delivery workers—many of them immigrants—a safe, legal route. The state DOT has resisted, citing car congestion. Advocates say more space for cyclists is overdue.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
