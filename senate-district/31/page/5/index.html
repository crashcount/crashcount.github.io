Since 2022, 29 people have died in crashes. Sixty-nine have been seriously injured. These are not just numbers—they are fathers, daughters, neighbors. In the last twelve months alone, six more lives ended on these streets. Over 1,200 people were hurt. The pain is not spread evenly. Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt. Cars and SUVs do the most damage, but trucks, motorcycles, and bikes all leave scars (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Just this spring, a 39-year-old man was stranded on the Major Deegan. He called friends for help. A Mercedes slammed into him. He called again, said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t breathe.&rdquo; His friends found him dying. The driver ran. The police are still looking. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/24/beloved-club-promoter-darryl-mathis-jr-killed-by-hit-run-bronx-mercedes-driver/>&ldquo;He called to get a jump, and after that, he got hit from behind, a hit-and-run,&rdquo; said a friend.</a></p><h3 id=the-system-respondsbut-not-fast-enough>The System Responds—But Not Fast Enough</h3><p>Senator Robert Jackson has voted for safety. He backed the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed limiters (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>). He voted to extend school speed zones (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>school speed zones</a>). He co-sponsored bills for safer buses and a pedestrian safety rating for vehicles. He has spoken up for 24/7 speed cameras, saying, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/06/01/state-senate-overwhelmingly-supports-24-7-speed-cameras-for-the-city>&ldquo;Cars speeding in New York kill New Yorkers, injure New Yorkers.&rdquo;</a></p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The cameras catch speeders, but the worst drivers keep driving. The law moves slow. The street moves fast. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so citywide. The most dangerous drivers are still on the road.</p><h3 id=the-work-left-to-do>The Work Left to Do</h3><p>Every delay costs lives. The families know it. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/surveillance-video-nypd-officers-fiery-crash-inwood/>&ldquo;To think he was in that car suffering for that long. One minute&rsquo;s too long. Imagine more than 15 minutes,&rdquo; said a stepmother after police left a burning crash scene without helping.</a></p><p>This is not fate. It is policy.</p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p>Demand more. Call Senator Jackson. Call your council member. Tell them: Lower the speed limit. Pass the bills. Enforce the laws. Protect the people who walk and ride.
