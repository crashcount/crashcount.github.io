The battery was dead. A black Mercedes slammed into him from behind. He called again, this time to say he could not breathe. He died before help arrived. The driver ran. Police have not found him. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/24/beloved-club-promoter-darryl-mathis-jr-killed-by-hit-run-bronx-mercedes-driver/>“He called to get a jump, and after that, he got hit from behind, a hit-and-run. They were on their way to come give him a jump and he got hit waiting for them. And then he called to let them know, I&rsquo;ve been hit. I can&rsquo;t breathe.”</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>eight people died</strong> in Senate District 31. <strong>Twenty-four were seriously injured.</strong> Over a thousand were hurt. The dead include the old and the young. A 65-year-old man was killed crossing with the signal. A 24-year-old woman was struck in a crosswalk. The street does not care who you are.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage.</strong> In three years, they killed seven pedestrians, left twenty with serious injuries, and caused 190 moderate injuries. Trucks and buses killed three. Motorcycles and mopeds caused one serious injury and sixteen moderate injuries. Bikes caused one serious injury and eight moderate injuries. The numbers do not lie. The street is a battlefield, and the weapons are heavy and fast.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-done-what-has-not>What Has Been Done, What Has Not</h3><p>Senator Robert Jackson has voted for safer streets. He backed the law to force complete street design, to protect people on foot and on bikes. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>He voted yes.</a> He co-sponsored bills for fare-free buses and for public safety ratings on cars.

The dead wait for action.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-no-more-waiting>Call to Action: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand 20 mph on every street.

The collision left the front passenger, a 39-year-old man, with severe crush injuries to his shoulder and upper arm. The report states the van was stationary ('Parked') when it was hit, and the impact targeted the right front quarter panel. The narrative describes the violence of the crash: 'The front passenger, 39, crushed in his seat. His shoulder shattered. The lap belt held. Metal screamed. Flesh gave.' No driver errors or contributing factors are listed in the police data. The focus remains on the devastating outcome for the passenger, who was restrained by a lap belt but still suffered grave injuries.

The collision ejected a fifteen-year-old girl riding as a rear passenger on the moped. She was not wearing a helmet, but the report does not cite this as a contributing factor. The narrative states, 'The girl on the back flew off. No helmet. Fifteen years old. She hit the pavement and lay still.' The impact killed her. The crash underscores the lethal consequences of improper passing and unlicensed operation, as documented by the responding officers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The law would sunset in 2029.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Bill (unnumbered) was introduced by Brooklyn Assembly Member Brian Cunningham on April 25, 2024. The bill is pending in the state legislature. It would allow New York City to mount enforcement cameras on street sweepers to ticket cars parked illegally during street cleaning hours. The bill summary states it 'fulfills the Sanitation Department's longstanding ask for help getting vehicles out of the way of road-cleaning operations.' Cunningham, who sponsors the bill, said, 'Dirty streets are totally unacceptable.' Sanitation Commissioner Jessica Tisch supports the change, noting that state law must allow automated ticketing. Uptown Manhattan State Senator Robert Jackson introduced a similar Senate bill. The law would phase in after a year and expire by mid-2029, giving officials time to assess its impact. No formal safety analysis for vulnerable road users was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
