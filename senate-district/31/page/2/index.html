The police narrative notes the crash ended in 'silence, sirens, and blood.'

The collision left the front passenger, a 39-year-old man, with severe crush injuries to his shoulder and upper arm. The report states the van was stationary ('Parked') when it was hit, and the impact targeted the right front quarter panel. The narrative describes the violence of the crash: 'The front passenger, 39, crushed in his seat. His shoulder shattered. The lap belt held. Metal screamed. Flesh gave.'

The pedestrian was crossing with the signal when the vehicle hit him, resulting in a traumatic amputation of his arm. The report states the driver was inattentive and distracted, and also cites 'Unsafe Speed' as a contributing factor. The narrative confirms the driver 'didn’t see him.' The pedestrian remained conscious after the collision. The police report makes no mention of any pedestrian error or unsafe behavior, emphasizing instead the role of driver inattention and speed.

Repeat offenders rack up most tickets. Lawmakers say dirty streets and blocked drains endanger everyone. The law would sunset in 2029.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Bill (unnumbered) was introduced by Brooklyn Assembly Member Brian Cunningham on April 25, 2024. The bill is pending in the state legislature. It would allow New York City to mount enforcement cameras on street sweepers to ticket cars parked illegally during street cleaning hours. The bill summary states it 'fulfills the Sanitation Department's longstanding ask for help getting vehicles out of the way of road-cleaning operations.' Cunningham, who sponsors the bill, said, 'Dirty streets are totally unacceptable.' Sanitation Commissioner Jessica Tisch supports the change, noting that state law must allow automated ticketing. Uptown Manhattan State Senator Robert Jackson introduced a similar Senate bill. The law would phase in after a year and expire by mid-2029, giving officials time to assess its impact. No formal safety analysis for vulnerable road users was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
