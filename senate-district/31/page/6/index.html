She was struck by an SUV turning into a driveway. The driver did not stop. Police are still searching. A neighbor saw it happen: <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/07/suv-driver-turning-into-driveway-of-bronx-apartment-building-fatally-strikes-woman/>&ldquo;he just rolled over that woman and killed her.&rdquo;</a></p><p>This is not rare.

The numbers do not rest. They climb.</p><h2 id=patterns-of-harm-who-pays-the-price>Patterns of Harm: Who Pays the Price</h2><p>The wounds fall hardest on the vulnerable. Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt. <strong>SUVs and cars are the main weapons—causing 7 deaths and 24 serious injuries</strong> to people on foot or bike since 2022. Trucks and buses killed 3 more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll.

He <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>co-sponsored and voted for the Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, a bill to force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed limiters. He voted to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4421>extend school speed zones</a> and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/02/13/from-the-assignment-desk-open-plans-helps-get-you-ready-for-tuesdays-council-vision-zero-hearing>create safety zones</a>.

These are real actions. But the blood keeps flowing. The work is not done.</p><h2 id=the-call-no-more-waiting>The Call: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a failure of policy and will.

The street stayed the same.</p><p><strong>Call Senator Jackson. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat offenders.
