Over 1,400 injured.</strong> That is the price paid on the streets of Senate District 31 in the past year alone (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The wounds are not numbers. They are broken bodies, families left with silence where laughter used to be. Just this spring, a 65-year-old man was killed crossing with the signal at University Avenue and West Kingsbridge Road. He was crushed by a van making a right turn. He had the light. He did not make it home (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data CrashID 4801942</a>).</p><p>On the Major Deegan Expressway, a driver stranded by a dead battery was hit from behind and left to die.

I can&rsquo;t breathe.&rdquo;</em> The driver who struck him ran. The city moved on.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-no-end-in-sight>The Pattern: No End in Sight</h2><p><strong>Crashes keep coming.</strong> In the last twelve months, SD 31 saw 2,342 crashes, 25 serious injuries, and 6 deaths (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Pedestrians and cyclists bear the brunt. Cars and SUVs are the main killers—<strong>7 deaths and 22 serious injuries</strong> from these vehicles since 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Trucks and buses killed 3 more. Motorcycles and mopeds, 1 serious injury. Bikes, 1 serious injury. The violence is steady, the pain routine.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-miles-to-go>Leadership: Steps Forward, Miles to Go</h2><p>State Senator Robert Jackson has backed some measures. He <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>voted yes</a> to curb repeat speeders with mandatory speed limiters and <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>supported</a> extending school speed zones. He <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4421>co-sponsored</a> a fare-free bus pilot and a bill to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S1675>rate vehicles for pedestrian safety</a>. These are steps. But the bodies keep coming. The bills are not enough. The streets are not safe.</p><h2 id=the-call-demand-more>The Call: Demand More</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by leaders who allow speed, chaos, and neglect. The Bronx District Attorney <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/23/bronx-hit-run-driver-arrested-2-years-after-dragging-pedestrian-950-feet-to-death-da/>said</a>, <em>&ldquo;The defendant allegedly drove her car over the victim&mldr; then after looking under her vehicle&mldr; she allegedly drove away without reporting what happened. Her alleged actions are egregious and show a lack of humanity.&rdquo;</em> The horror is not rare. It is routine.</p><p><strong>Call Senator Jackson. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph citywide speed limit. Demand action against repeat speeders.

A 23-year-old pedestrian, not at an intersection, was struck and suffered crush injuries to his hip and upper leg. According to the police report, driver inexperience, improper passing or lane usage, and alcohol involvement contributed to the crash. The moped driver, a 36-year-old man, was partially ejected and injured. The SUV driver held only a permit. Helmet use was noted for the moped driver, but only after the listed driver errors.

Patrick Hendry of the Police Benevolent Association claimed officers "lost sight of the car and did not know it crashed," but the family's attorney, Jeremy Feigenbaum, said their investigation "has not corroborated the officers' claim."

The article notes the police are investigating if officers left the scene without reporting the crash. The incident came three months after NYPD restricted car chases for low-level offenses. Commissioner Tisch said, “Our officers deserve clear guidance and smart protocols when determining whether to engage in a vehicle pursuit on our streets.” The pursuit was reportedly justified under new policy, which still allows chases for serious crimes. The fatal fire highlights the ongoing risks of police pursuits and questions the effectiveness of recent reforms.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The officers, from the 50th Precinct, reportedly followed a stolen Honda CRV into Manhattan, then turned back to the Bronx without reporting the crash. An unidentified person died in the burning vehicle. Retired NYPD Chief Robert Boyce told ABC7, 'The most troubling thing here is it's not rendering aid to a vehicle that gets into a crash like that.' The NYPD stated the incident is under review by its Force Investigation Division and the Attorney General's office. Surveillance footage and an autopsy are pending. The case highlights potential failures in police response and raises questions about accountability and reporting procedures after crashes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The van's right front bumper struck a 65-year-old man who was crossing the intersection with the pedestrian signal. The report states the man suffered fatal head injuries and died at the scene. The van sustained no damage. Police cite 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as the primary contributing factor. The victim's action—'Crossing With Signal'—is noted in the report, but only after the driver's failure to yield.
