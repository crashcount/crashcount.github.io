She was struck by an SUV turning into a driveway. The driver did not stop. Police are still searching. A neighbor saw it happen: <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/07/suv-driver-turning-into-driveway-of-bronx-apartment-building-fatally-strikes-woman/>&ldquo;he just rolled over that woman and killed her.&rdquo;</a></p><p>This is not rare.

Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt. <strong>SUVs and cars are the main weapons—causing 7 deaths and 24 serious injuries</strong> to people on foot or bike since 2022.

He voted to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4421>extend school speed zones</a> and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/02/13/from-the-assignment-desk-open-plans-helps-get-you-ready-for-tuesdays-council-vision-zero-hearing>create safety zones</a>.

They did not report the incident to supervisors. Both officers have been suspended as the NYPD and Attorney General investigate. The article notes, 'The NYPD's enforcement efforts must never put the public or the police at undue risk,' quoting Commissioner Jessica Tisch, who recently restricted police pursuits for non-violent crimes.
