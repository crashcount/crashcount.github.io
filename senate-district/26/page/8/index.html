A BMW ran the red light. The car did not brake. Both men, ages 59 and 80, died in the street. The driver left them behind and sped away. Police found him later. He told them, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/12/hit-and-run-bmw-driver-who-killed-2-in-brooklyn-had-downed-beers-body-matter-found-on-car-da/>&ldquo;I had a six pack of Modelos and two drinks. I was driving the car by myself last night. It&rsquo;s my fault. After I hit them, I came home.&rdquo;</a></p><p>The men may have been on their way to a food pantry. City Harvest said, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/sunset-park-deadly-hit-run-driver-charged-fatal-collision-2-men-brooklyn-nyc-arraigned-court/17083850/>&ldquo;We understand they may have been on their way to our Mobile Market simply trying to access food like so many New Yorkers in need.&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h3><p><strong>In the last twelve months, SD 26 saw 7 deaths and 1,711 injuries from 3,126 crashes.</strong> Fourteen people suffered serious injuries. Most of the dead were older. Most of the injured were young. Cars and SUVs did the most harm, but trucks, bikes, and mopeds all left bodies behind. The street is not safe for anyone.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-the-long-road-ahead>Leadership: Progress and the Long Road Ahead</h3><p>Senator Andrew Gounardes has pushed for change. He sponsored and voted for the law that keeps speed cameras running in school zones through 2030. He called it clear: <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/18/albany-reauthorizes-city-speed-camera-program-for-5-more-years>&ldquo;Speed cameras save lives and make our streets safer for everyone&mldr; At the end of the day, this is about keeping New Yorkers safe. I&rsquo;m proud to have fought for this program from the beginning, and to renew it now for five years.&rdquo;</a></p><p>He also sponsored the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed-limiting devices. The bill passed committee but has not yet become law. The carnage continues.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay means another family shattered.</strong> Call Senator Gounardes. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat offenders. Do not wait for another body in the crosswalk.</p><p><strong>Act now.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers must hold a hearing before a vote. Speaker Adrienne Adams and Brooks-Powers have not signed on, citing negotiations. The bill’s summary states: 'Life-saving legislation that would allow New York City to set speed limits below 25 miles per hour failed to make it into this year's state budget.'

The bill, now before the legislature, would replace the outdated 'level of service' metric—focused on driver delay—with a mandate to reduce total vehicle miles traveled (VMT) by 15 percent by 2050. The bill summary states: 'By eliminating the relevance of level of service as a metric and utilizing vehicle miles traveled reduction instead, we can provide a new criteria for determining the significance of transportation impacts.' Gounardes, the bill’s sponsor, argues this shift will cut emissions and promote safer, multimodal streets. Advocates like Jon Orcutt and Sara Lind back the measure, calling it a long-overdue update that could finally let safety and climate take priority over car traffic.

Gounardes, the bill's sponsor, wants the city—not the MTA—to control the funds. City Hall has not taken a position but said it welcomes ideas to limit emissions and advance infrastructure.

The meeting excluded some officials who support shrinking the highway, such as Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon and State Senator Andrew Gounardes, who cite environmental and community health concerns.

Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi claimed some locals want three lanes each way, but 17 elected officials, including State Sen. Julia Salazar, Sen. Andrew Gounardes, Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, and Council Member Lincoln Restler, publicly rejected the idea. Salazar said, 'no to three lanes. Two lanes at most.' Gounardes confirmed, 'all support a two-lane highway.' Gallagher wrote, '2 lanes if any.' Restler called City Hall’s statements 'plainly inaccurate.' The Department of Transportation delayed environmental review to study both options. Advocates and officials urge investment in mass transit, not highway expansion. Vulnerable road users remain at risk as the city weighs more lanes for cars and trucks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>Governor Hochul’s 2023 state budget proposal, analyzed March 3, 2023, keeps New York State’s long-running refusal to match MTA funding under law 18-b. The budget, now under legislative review, forces New York City to cover a $500 million gap, while the state sits on an $8.7 billion surplus. The matter: 'Hochul's budget not only asks city residents to cover the largest chunk of the MTA's budget gap, but does so in part by continuing long-running practices that essentially under-fund the MTA by millions of dollars each year.' Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas and State Sen. Andrew Gounardes both object, demanding the state honor its legal obligations. Riders Alliance and Reinvent Albany condemn the austerity. With fare hikes looming and no service improvements, city transit riders—often pedestrians and cyclists—bear the brunt. The budget leaves vulnerable road users exposed, as transit stagnates and car dominance persists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens.

Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint.
