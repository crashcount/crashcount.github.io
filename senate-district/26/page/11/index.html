A mother holds her child&rsquo;s hand. A cyclist waits for the light. In Senate District 26, these moments end in sirens too often. <strong>In the last twelve months, 7 people died and 1,627 were injured in 2,955 crashes.</strong> Fourteen were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The old, the young, the ones just passing through. The street does not care.</p><p><strong>Now the toll is higher.</strong> Since 2022, there have been 10,369 crashes. Five thousand, two hundred sixteen people hurt. Thirty dead. The numbers rise. The sirens do not stop. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the data</a>.</p><p>The old are not spared. Five people over 75 are dead. Eight between 65 and 74. Children are hurt—391 under 18, their lives changed in an instant. The street does not care about age.</p><p>A woman steps from a taxi on Flatbush Avenue. She does not make it across. The drivers stay. The tape goes up. The street is closed. The story is over for her. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/boerum-hill-fatal-crash-woman-struck-killed-car-exiting-taxi-brooklyn-nyc/15966918/>Report details</a>.</p><p>Cars and SUVs killed 5, left 188 with broken bones or worse, and battered 210 more. Trucks and buses killed 2, hurt dozens. Bikes and mopeds, too, left their mark, but the steel and speed of cars do most of the damage.</p><h3 id=leadership-in-the-crosshairs>Leadership in the Crosshairs</h3><p>Senator Andrew Gounardes has not stood silent. He backed the <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/stop-super-speeders-bill-advances-in-senate-committee>Stop Super Speeders bill</a>, which would force the worst repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no longer simply enough to shake our heads in despair when these preventable tragedies occur—it&rsquo;s time for us to act,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-lawmakers-push-super-speeder-bill-after-brooklyn-crash-kills-mom-2-kids>said Gounardes</a> after a driver with a suspended license and dozens of violations killed a mother and her two daughters in Brooklyn. He also sponsored a bill to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S7336>expand speed camera enforcement</a>, closing loopholes for drivers who hide their plates.</p><p>But the carnage continues. Each new name added to the list is a measure of delay. As one advocate put it, &ldquo;I definitely believe these super speeders really, they&rsquo;re criminals. They should not be allowed to drive, they really shouldn&rsquo;t. I think [the city] is being nice.&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-lawmakers-push-super-speeder-bill-after-brooklyn-crash-kills-mom-2-kids>said the advocate</a>.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>The disaster is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day without action is another day of blood on the street. Call Senator Gounardes. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras that never go dark. Demand streets where a child can cross without fear.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong> <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill grants a three-year extension. Cameras will operate 24/7. Deborah Glick expected to sponsor in Assembly. The measure aims to curb reckless driving and protect people on foot and bike.</p><p class=mb3>Bill to extend New York City's speed camera program for three years is advancing. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes introduced the measure on May 19, 2022. The bill allows cameras in up to 750 school zones to run around the clock until July 1, 2025. Assemblymember Deborah Glick, District 66, is expected to sponsor the bill in the Assembly. The bill summary states it will 'allow New York City to extend its soon-to-expire speed camera program and keep the devices running 24 hours a day.' Mayor Eric Adams called the deal 'a major victory for New Yorkers that will save lives and help stem the tide of traffic violence.' The bill dropped harsher penalties for repeat offenders, focusing on the extension and expanded hours. The City Council must approve a home rule message before the state Legislature votes.

The measure, confirmed by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, grants a three-year extension with 24/7 camera operation. The original bill would have suspended registrations for repeat speeders, notified insurers, and raised fines. These provisions were removed after concerns from lawmakers, including co-sponsor Sen. Roxanne Persaud. The matter summary: 'Albany lawmakers reached a deal to renew and expand New York City's speed camera program, keeping them on 24/7, but only after key provisions...were removed.' Mayor Adams called the deal 'a major victory,' but advocates like Eric McClure of StreetsPAC said, 'it’s not enough.' The City Council must submit a home rule message before final passage. The compromise keeps cameras rolling but leaves dangerous drivers unchecked.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Mayor Eric Adams and advocates want home rule for NYC on speed cameras and speed limits, but Albany resists.

Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymember Bobby Carroll, would require all new drivers in New York State to complete six hours of professional driving instruction before taking the road test. The bill was announced on March 29, 2022. Gounardes slammed the current rules as too lenient, saying, "For some drivers, the first time they take the wheel [as a licensed driver] they are in sole control of their car." Carroll called the requirement "reasonable." Stephen Walling, president of the New York State Association of Professional Driving Schools, said the bill would "go a long way towards keeping all New Yorkers safer on our roads." The NYC Department of Transportation called driver education "crucial" for the safety of pedestrians, cyclists, and other road users, and is reviewing the proposal. The bill awaits committee action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill was proposed on March 29, 2022. It is currently under consideration in committee. The measure’s summary states it would mandate 'directed training with a professional.' Gounardes called out the current system, linking lack of experience to crashes and road violence. Carroll said professional training means better drivers. The bill has backing from the New York State Association of Professional Driving Schools and the city Department of Transportation. Both stress the need for real training to protect all road users. The DMV has not commented. The bill aims to close deadly gaps in driver preparation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Adams criticized the law that forces cameras off at 10 p.m., asking, 'Who are we protecting? We're protecting the speeders?' He cited clear data showing cameras cut violations and crashes. State Senator Andrew Gounardes echoed Adams, questioning why lawmakers outside the city control local street safety. Adams admitted NYPD traffic enforcement has dropped and pledged to prioritize it. Advocates argue enforcement alone is not enough and call for street redesigns to protect pedestrians and cyclists. Traffic deaths remain high, especially when cameras are off. The push highlights a fight for local control and safer streets for all vulnerable New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable lives lost.</p><p class=mb3>On March 25, 2022, Mayor Adams held a press conference on street safety and traffic enforcement policy. The event spotlighted the city’s struggle to control its own traffic laws. Adams slammed state rules that force red light and speed cameras off between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., calling it 'unbelievable.' He said, 'Who are we protecting? We’re protecting the speeders. How about protecting Isaiah?' State Senator Andrew Gounardes, district 26, echoed Adams: 'It makes no sense that the city cannot control its own destiny on these streets.' Adams admitted NYPD traffic enforcement lags, with summonses down by more than half since 2019. Twenty-seven pedestrians have died so far this year—three more than last year. The mayor pressed for 24/7 camera operation and renewed NYPD focus. The council and advocates demand Albany act before more lives are lost.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
