A BMW ran the red. The car did not stop. Both men died in the crosswalk. The driver left them in the street and sped away. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/sunset-park-deadly-hit-run-driver-charged-fatal-collision-2-men-brooklyn-nyc-arraigned-court/17083850/>Police found him later</a>. He told them, &ldquo;I had a six pack of Modelos and two drinks&mldr; It&rsquo;s my fault.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/12/hit-and-run-bmw-driver-who-killed-2-in-brooklyn-had-downed-beers-body-matter-found-on-car-da/>He faces manslaughter charges</a>.</p><p><strong>This is not rare.</strong> In the last 12 months, SD 26 has seen 11 deaths and 1,961 injuries from crashes. Eighty people have been killed or seriously hurt on this two-mile stretch since 2018. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/sunset-park-residents-call-for-improvements-on-a-deadly-stretch-of-third-avenue>The city’s answer? A sign that says: &lsquo;be careful,&rsquo;**</a> <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/sunset-park-residents-call-for-improvements-on-a-deadly-stretch-of-third-avenue>said State Senator Andrew Gounardes</a>. &ldquo;This is not meant to be a highway. This is where people walk. This is where people live. This is where kids go to school.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=the-toll-of-delay>The Toll of Delay</h2><p><strong>The carnage is steady.</strong> In the past year, five more people have died in SD 26. Over 1,200 have been injured. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. Cars and trucks do most of the killing: 7 deaths and 19 serious injuries from sedans and SUVs alone. Trucks killed three more. Bikes and mopeds hurt dozens, but they do not kill. The street is not safe for anyone who walks.</p><h2 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h2><p>Senator Gounardes has spoken out. He called out the city’s inaction after the latest deaths: <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>&ldquo;We wait until someone dies. We wait until a tragedy. We wait to say, &lsquo;oh my gosh, how could this possibly have happened?&rsquo; We let this happen time and time again.&rdquo;</a> He has pushed for speed cameras and sponsored bills to force repeat speeders to install limiters. He voted yes to extend school speed zones. But the street remains the same. The city has delayed real fixes for years. The dead keep coming.</p><h2 id=what-now>What Now?</h2><p><strong>No more waiting.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph citywide speed limit. Demand the Stop Super Speeders Act. Demand real redesigns, not just signs. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice. Make them choose life.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, sponsored in the State Senate by Andrew Gounardes, passed in Albany and was signed by Governor Hochul in June. The measure extends the program for three years and ends the old rule that shut cameras off overnight and on weekends. The Department of Transportation has installed about 2,000 cameras in 750 school zones. The bill’s summary: 'expands the safety technology around the clock.' Gounardes said, 'Your right to speed does not supersede anyone’s rights to live on the streets safely.' Mayor Eric Adams joined advocates to celebrate, stating, 'A city that never sleeps deserves a camera system that won’t take a nap.' DOT data shows 59% of traffic deaths happened during off hours. The expansion aims to close that deadly gap.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Gov. Hochul said, 'It is common sense to make pedestrian and bike safety education mandatory for drivers.' Gounardes noted that driver instruction had not kept pace with the growing presence of cyclists and micro-mobility users. In 2021, driver inexperience contributed to over 2,500 injury crashes in NYC.

The bill is limited to drunk drivers for now, but Gounardes hopes to expand it to all reckless drivers who kill. Few drivers are convicted under these charges in New York City.

The measure, sponsored by Assemblymember Deborah Glick (District 66) and Senator Andrew Gounardes, allows speed cameras to operate 24/7 in up to 750 school zones. The bill was set to expire but now runs through July 1, 2025. The matter summary states: 'New York City is now able to operate its speed cameras 24 hours a day.' Glick, who sponsored the bill, dismissed criticism that cameras are a cash grab, saying, 'The city isn't in the car with you... If you don't want to get a ticket, don't speed.' Mayor Eric Adams called the cameras a deterrent, not a punishment. Advocates say the law will slow cars and protect pedestrians, especially children. The bill passed just before the legislative session ended, closing a deadly loophole in city enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Assembly Member Deborah Glick and State Senator Andrew Gounardes, was passed after statistics showed rising crashes and injuries near schools. The matter summary: 'The city's school zone speed cameras will now operate 24/7 year-round.' Hochul cited student deaths and the need for constant protection. Mayor Adams called the program a national model, noting, '72 percent of fatalities have been happening when the cameras were off.' The bill was weakened from its original form, dropping escalating fines and stricter penalties for repeat offenders due to City Council concerns. Glick and Gounardes pledged to push for stronger measures. A separate bill to expand red light cameras failed. The new law closes deadly loopholes but leaves enforcement gaps for repeat offenders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lawmakers extended New York City's school-zone speed camera program for three years, allowing 24/7 operation—a win for street safety. The bill, however, was watered down.

The matter title called the session 'historic, yet deeply disappointing.' Adams was not a sponsor but was referenced in the debate. Advocates and senators voiced frustration at the lack of progress on local speed limit control and measures against repeat reckless drivers.

The measure passed 51-12 and now moves to the Assembly. The bill allows cameras to operate 24/7 in nearly 2,000 locations across 750 school zones until July 1, 2025. The matter summary states, 'The proposal to extend New York City's speed camera program for another three years and expand it to run every day and around the clock easily passed.' Senator Andrew Gounardes sponsored the bill, saying, 'We are going to see a marked reduction in traffic violence on our streets at a time when traffic deaths are at their highest in a decade.' Simcha Felder, Democrat from District 44, voted against. The expansion targets off-hours, which account for 59% of traffic deaths. Speeding dropped 72% and deaths fell 55% where cameras operated. The city pushed for this as fatalities rose under Mayor Adams. Some penalties for repeat speeders were removed during negotiations.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
