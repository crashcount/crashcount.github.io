A mother holds her child&rsquo;s hand. A cyclist waits for the light. In Senate District 26, these moments end in sirens too often. <strong>In the last twelve months, 7 people died and 1,632 were injured in 2,955 crashes.</strong> Fourteen were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The old, the young, the ones just passing through. The street does not care.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs killed more than any other machine.</strong> In three years, they took 5 lives, left 188 with broken bones or worse, and battered 210 more. Trucks and buses killed 2, hurt dozens. Bikes and mopeds, too, left their mark, but the steel and speed of cars do most of the damage. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the data</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-in-the-crosshairs>Leadership in the Crosshairs</h3><p>Senator Andrew Gounardes has not stood silent. He backed the <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/stop-super-speeders-bill-advances-in-senate-committee>Stop Super Speeders bill</a>, which would force the worst repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no longer simply enough to shake our heads in despair when these preventable tragedies occur—it&rsquo;s time for us to act,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-lawmakers-push-super-speeder-bill-after-brooklyn-crash-kills-mom-2-kids>said Gounardes</a> after a driver with a suspended license and dozens of violations killed a mother and her two daughters in Brooklyn. He also sponsored a bill to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S7336>expand speed camera enforcement</a>, closing loopholes for drivers who hide their plates.</p><p>But the carnage continues. Each new name added to the list is a measure of delay. As one advocate put it, &ldquo;I definitely believe these super speeders really, they&rsquo;re criminals. They should not be allowed to drive, they really shouldn&rsquo;t. I think [the city] is being nice.&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-lawmakers-push-super-speeder-bill-after-brooklyn-crash-kills-mom-2-kids>said the advocate</a>.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>The disaster is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day without action is another day of blood on the street. Call Senator Gounardes. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras that never go dark. Demand streets where a child can cross without fear.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong> <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Mayor Eric Adams joined advocates to celebrate, stating, 'A city that never sleeps deserves a camera system that won’t take a nap.' DOT data shows 59% of traffic deaths happened during off hours. The expansion aims to close that deadly gap.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The intersection, despite a history of crashes, has not been redesigned. No charges were filed against the driver, even though evidence suggested a failure to yield. Days earlier, Monica Chen, a pedestrian, was killed by a turning driver in Bay Ridge. Again, no charges. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and City Council Member Justin Brannan expressed outrage, stating, "We are both outraged that the epidemic of traffic violence continues and as a result, a 67 year old woman is dead." They pledged to press the Department of Transportation for more safety measures. The NYPD declined comment. The Bronx faces a surge in road deaths.

The bill's summary states it aims to 'educate drivers about the dangers faced by cyclists and pedestrians and will create a thoughtful road culture going forward.' Gounardes sponsored the bill, which takes effect in January. Until now, the driver's manual offered only a single page on sharing the road. The law directs the state to consult law enforcement, advocates, and medical experts to shape the curriculum.

The bill, led by Assemblymember Emily Gallagher and Senator Andrew Gounardes, updates the five-hour pre-licensing course and driver's manual. The matter summary states: 'The law addresses a longstanding gap in driver education, which had previously left generations of motorists with little awareness of road-sharing with pedestrians and cyclists.' Gov. Hochul said, 'It is common sense to make pedestrian and bike safety education mandatory for drivers.' Gounardes noted that driver instruction had not kept pace with the growing presence of cyclists and micro-mobility users. In 2021, driver inexperience contributed to over 2,500 injury crashes in NYC. The law took 11 years to pass, reflecting persistent advocacy for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal, announced July 8, 2022, mirrors a Tennessee law. The bill targets drivers convicted of vehicular manslaughter (first or second degree) or aggravated vehicular homicide. Gounardes said, 'If you drive recklessly, you are going to be held accountable.' He stressed the lack of accountability and financial compensation for victims’ families. The bill is limited to drunk drivers for now, but Gounardes hopes to expand it to all reckless drivers who kill. Few drivers are convicted under these charges in New York City.
