The dead include children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians. Each number is a name, a family, a life cut short. In the last twelve months alone, seven more are gone.</p><p><strong>Just weeks ago, a 22-year-old moped rider was killed at Third Avenue and 67th Street.</strong> His brother remembered him simply: <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>&ldquo;He never stopped working.&rdquo;</a> The driver who killed him was drunk and unlicensed. The passenger survived with broken bones. The street remains the same.</p><p>In February, a woman stepped out of a taxi on Flatbush Avenue. She was struck and killed. Both drivers stayed. The city moved on. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/boerum-hill-fatal-crash-woman-struck-killed-car-exiting-taxi-brooklyn-nyc/15966918/>No arrests have been made.</a></p><h3 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt?</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs killed five pedestrians here.</strong> Trucks and buses killed two more. Bikes and mopeds left dozens injured. The most vulnerable—those on foot, on bikes, on small wheels—pay the price for every policy delay, every loophole, every unlicensed driver who slips through.</p><h3 id=what-has-senator-gounardes-done>What Has Senator Gounardes Done?</h3><p>Senator Andrew Gounardes has backed speed cameras and pushed for their renewal. He called the program <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>&ldquo;an extra boost&rdquo; for safety</a> and praised its record. He sponsored a bill to let cameras catch drivers who hide or deface their plates, closing loopholes for reckless drivers. He voted yes on redesigning streets for all users, not just cars. But the work is not done. <strong>Repeat offenders still drive. Streets still kill.</strong></p><h3 id=what-next-demand-more>What Next? Demand More</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> Call Senator Gounardes. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real consequences for repeat offenders. Join <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>.

The matter arose after attorney Adam White was arrested for removing plastic from an obscured license plate; charges were later dropped by Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez, citing 'insufficient evidence.' The bill, discussed at a press conference, aims to crack down on license plate defacement and illegal parking, which Restler says is rampant among city workers and police. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes introduced a similar bill at the state level. Both lawmakers stress the need for public accountability and tougher enforcement to protect vulnerable road users from drivers who evade responsibility.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, 'Both drivers had looked away.' The listed contributing factor for both vehicles was 'Driver Inattention/Distraction.'

The request follows complaints after Schermerhorn Street’s redesign, which added a protected bike lane but made all crossings one-way southbound, causing gridlock and blocking access for services. The Community Board’s Transportation and Public Safety Committee, chaired by Sid Meyer, voted to support the change and insisted DOT maintain and protect the Bond Street bike lane with a physical barrier. Restler said, 'We believe that this proposal will improve traffic flow and enhance the public’s access to essential services, deliveries, and residences.' DOT is reviewing the proposal.

The project, championed by Councilmember Lincoln Restler, followed years of complaints about blocked, unprotected lanes and frequent crashes. The matter, described as a 'complete transformation of the look and feel of the corridor,' converted Schermerhorn from a chaotic two-way street to a one-way with parking-protected bike lanes. Restler, who once failed to ride the stretch without leaving the lane due to illegal parking, called the redesign 'real safety in downtown Brooklyn.' DOT data shows 29 cyclists injured and one killed on this stretch since 2012. The overhaul separates cyclists from moving vehicles, reducing risk for Brooklyn’s most vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

In the first three weeks, cameras issued 513,777 tickets—70 percent more than before. The bill, championed by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, removed harsher penalties but kept round-the-clock enforcement. The matter summary states, 'speed safety cameras are working as they should—catching more speeding drivers and combatting reckless driving.' Council members and advocates, including Elizabeth Adams and Jehiah Czebotar, backed the move. They point to data showing most extra tickets came at night and weekends, exposing a hidden threat to pedestrians and cyclists. Officials insist the expansion will save lives and curb reckless driving.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
