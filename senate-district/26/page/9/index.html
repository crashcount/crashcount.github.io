Two men, Kex Un Chen, 80, and Faqiu Lin, 59, were crossing with the signal. The car did not brake. Both men died in the street. The driver fled. He was caught later, charged with manslaughter and homicide. They were on their way to a food pantry. The line there is always long. The dead do not eat.</p><p>Since 2018, drivers have killed or seriously injured <strong>80 people on this two-mile stretch</strong>. The city’s answer: a sign that says &ldquo;be careful.&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/sunset-park-residents-call-for-improvements-on-a-deadly-stretch-of-third-avenue>&ldquo;We should all be offended. Angry. Insulted. That the response from our city to two deaths blocks away from here is a sign that says: &lsquo;be careful,&rsquo;&rdquo;</a> said State Senator Andrew Gounardes.</p><h2 id=the-toll-keeps-rising>The Toll Keeps Rising</h2><p>In the last twelve months, SD 26 saw <strong>11 deaths and 19 serious injuries</strong>. Most were pedestrians or cyclists. The old, the young, the ones just trying to get by. Cars and SUVs did most of the killing—<strong>8 deaths, 19 serious injuries</strong>—but trucks, buses, bikes, and mopeds all took their share. The numbers do not stop. They only climb.</p><h2 id=promises-delays-and-the-fight-for-change>Promises, Delays, and the Fight for Change</h2><p>The city promised a redesign for Third Avenue. The plan is stalled. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>&ldquo;We started talking about a plan in 2014 and it&rsquo;s now 2025. What is going on?&rdquo;</a> asked Assemblymember Marcela Mitaynes. Gounardes stood with families and called for action: <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/advocates-slam-third-avenue-safety-delay/>&ldquo;This is not meant to be a highway. This is where people walk. This is where people live. This is where kids go to school.&rdquo;</a></p><p>Senator Gounardes has pushed for speed cameras and for the Stop Super Speeders Act. He votes for bills that target repeat offenders. He shows up at vigils. But the deaths keep coming. The street stays the same.</p><p><strong>No more waiting.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the city finish the job. <strong>Redesign Third Avenue. Lower the speed. Stop the killing.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill remains in committee. The measure would give whistleblowers 25% of the ticket, up to $75. The matter targets drivers who obscure or remove plates to dodge automated enforcement. As city and state agencies rely more on cameras to catch speeders and red-light runners, more drivers hide their plates. The Department of Transportation says cameras failed to ticket over 4% of violators last fall, up from 1% in 2019. Advocates accuse police of lax enforcement and even breaking the law themselves.

The matter arose after attorney Adam White was arrested for removing plastic from an obscured license plate; charges were later dropped by Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez, citing 'insufficient evidence.' The bill, discussed at a press conference, aims to crack down on license plate defacement and illegal parking, which Restler says is rampant among city workers and police. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes introduced a similar bill at the state level. Both lawmakers stress the need for public accountability and tougher enforcement to protect vulnerable road users from drivers who evade responsibility.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Gounardes urged the governor to include MTA funding in the initial budget. Gallagher criticized the gas tax holiday, urging funds go to transit.

The project, championed by Councilmember Lincoln Restler, followed years of complaints about blocked, unprotected lanes and frequent crashes. The matter, described as a 'complete transformation of the look and feel of the corridor,' converted Schermerhorn from a chaotic two-way street to a one-way with parking-protected bike lanes. Restler, who once failed to ride the stretch without leaving the lane due to illegal parking, called the redesign 'real safety in downtown Brooklyn.' DOT data shows 29 cyclists injured and one killed on this stretch since 2012. The overhaul separates cyclists from moving vehicles, reducing risk for Brooklyn’s most vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
