Fourteen left with life-changing injuries.</strong> In the last year alone, 1,617 people were hurt in crashes across Senate District 26. The numbers do not bleed, but the streets do. Each figure is a body broken, a family changed.</p><p>Just last week, a 22-year-old man named Joel Mota died at Third Avenue and 67th Street. His moped hit the side of a car. He lived less than half a mile from where he died. His brother remembered him: <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>&ldquo;He was a hardworking man. He had a lot of love for his family.&rdquo;</a> His passenger left with broken bones. The driver was drunk and unlicensed. She was arrested and released.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-unlicensed-unstopped>The Pattern: Unlicensed, Unstopped</h2><p>This is not rare. In May, another unlicensed driver killed a motorcyclist on the BQE. The city’s streets are open season for those who drive without fear of consequence. <strong>Cars and SUVs killed five. Trucks killed two. Bikes and mopeds left dozens more injured.</strong></p><p>The dead are old and young. A 73-year-old man, crushed on the expressway. A woman, 45, killed in a car on Flatbush. A cyclist, 43, struck on the Belt Parkway. The list grows. The pain does not end.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Senator Andrew Gounardes has pushed for speed cameras. He called them a way to <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/18/albany-reauthorizes-city-speed-camera-program-for-5-more-years>&ldquo;save lives and make our streets safer for everyone.&rdquo;</a> He voted for bills to redesign streets and expand enforcement. He sponsored a law to catch drivers who hide their plates. But the most dangerous drivers—those who rack up ticket after ticket—still slip through. The Stop Super Speeders Act, which would have forced repeat offenders to slow down, was set aside. Gounardes <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/10/advocates-slam-albany-pols-after-stop-super-speeders-bill-is-set-aside>vowed to keep fighting</a>. The streets remain deadly.</p><h2 id=the-call-demand-more-than-words>The Call: Demand More Than Words</h2><p><strong>Speed cameras alone are not enough. Laws that do not pass do not save lives.</strong> The dead do not get a second chance. Call Senator Gounardes. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat offenders. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The request follows complaints after Schermerhorn Street’s redesign, which added a protected bike lane but made all crossings one-way southbound, causing gridlock and blocking access for services. The Community Board’s Transportation and Public Safety Committee, chaired by Sid Meyer, voted to support the change and insisted DOT maintain and protect the Bond Street bike lane with a physical barrier. Restler said, 'We believe that this proposal will improve traffic flow and enhance the public’s access to essential services, deliveries, and residences.' DOT is reviewing the proposal.

The project, championed by Councilmember Lincoln Restler, followed years of complaints about blocked, unprotected lanes and frequent crashes. The matter, described as a 'complete transformation of the look and feel of the corridor,' converted Schermerhorn from a chaotic two-way street to a one-way with parking-protected bike lanes. Restler, who once failed to ride the stretch without leaving the lane due to illegal parking, called the redesign 'real safety in downtown Brooklyn.' DOT data shows 29 cyclists injured and one killed on this stretch since 2012. The overhaul separates cyclists from moving vehicles, reducing risk for Brooklyn’s most vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary reads: 'DOT cuts ribbon on newly fortified Schermerhorn Street bike lane.'

The old lanes were unprotected and blocked by double-parked cars, forcing cyclists into traffic. Since 2012, 29 cyclists have been injured and one killed along this stretch.
