Two men, Kex Un Chen, 80, and Faqiu Lin, 59, tried to cross Third Avenue at 52nd Street. A BMW ran the red. The car did not slow. The driver left them dead in the crosswalk and sped away. Police found him later. He told them, &ldquo;I had a six pack of Modelos and two drinks. I was driving the car by myself last night. It&rsquo;s my fault. After I hit them, I came home.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/12/hit-and-run-bmw-driver-who-killed-2-in-brooklyn-had-downed-beers-body-matter-found-on-car-da/>NY Daily News</a></p><p>The men were steps from a food pantry. &ldquo;We understand they may have been on their way to our Mobile Market simply trying to access food like so many New Yorkers in need,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/sunset-park-deadly-hit-run-driver-charged-fatal-collision-2-men-brooklyn-nyc-arraigned-court/17083850/>said City Harvest</a>.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h3><p><strong>In the last 12 months, SD 26 saw 7 deaths and 1,721 injuries in 3,099 crashes.</strong> Fourteen people were seriously injured. The dead are not numbers. They are elders, children, neighbors. Cars and SUVs did most of the killing—5 deaths, 18 serious injuries, 633 injuries. Trucks and buses killed 2, injured 100. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left dozens more hurt. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Senator Andrew Gounardes has fought for speed cameras and tougher rules for repeat speeders. &ldquo;The verdict came in a long time ago: speed cameras save lives and make our streets safer for everyone&mldr; At the end of the day, this is about keeping New Yorkers safe.

He sponsored the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force the worst offenders to slow down or lose their cars. He voted yes to extend school speed zones. But the city has not lowered the default speed limit to 20 mph. The carnage continues.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-no-more-waiting>Call to Action: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph citywide speed limit. Demand the city use every tool—speed cameras, street redesign, real penalties for repeat offenders.</strong> Every day of delay is another funeral. The dead cannot call.

The bill remains in committee. The measure would give whistleblowers 25% of the ticket, up to $75. The matter targets drivers who obscure or remove plates to dodge automated enforcement. As city and state agencies rely more on cameras to catch speeders and red-light runners, more drivers hide their plates. The Department of Transportation says cameras failed to ticket over 4% of violators last fall, up from 1% in 2019. Advocates accuse police of lax enforcement and even breaking the law themselves. Gounardes’s bill, still stalled, aims to close this loophole and put power in the hands of citizens. Vulnerable road users remain at risk while enforcement lags.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter arose after attorney Adam White was arrested for removing plastic from an obscured license plate; charges were later dropped by Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez, citing 'insufficient evidence.' The bill, discussed at a press conference, aims to crack down on license plate defacement and illegal parking, which Restler says is rampant among city workers and police. State Sen.

The request follows complaints after Schermerhorn Street’s redesign, which added a protected bike lane but made all crossings one-way southbound, causing gridlock and blocking access for services. The Community Board’s Transportation and Public Safety Committee, chaired by Sid Meyer, voted to support the change and insisted DOT maintain and protect the Bond Street bike lane with a physical barrier. Restler said, 'We believe that this proposal will improve traffic flow and enhance the public’s access to essential services, deliveries, and residences.' DOT is reviewing the proposal. The matter centers on the impact of traffic changes on residents and the need to safeguard vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, championed by Councilmember Lincoln Restler, followed years of complaints about blocked, unprotected lanes and frequent crashes. The matter, described as a 'complete transformation of the look and feel of the corridor,' converted Schermerhorn from a chaotic two-way street to a one-way with parking-protected bike lanes. Restler, who once failed to ride the stretch without leaving the lane due to illegal parking, called the redesign 'real safety in downtown Brooklyn.' DOT data shows 29 cyclists injured and one killed on this stretch since 2012. The overhaul separates cyclists from moving vehicles, reducing risk for Brooklyn’s most vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary reads: 'DOT cuts ribbon on newly fortified Schermerhorn Street bike lane.' Councilmember Lincoln Restler, who championed the redesign, attended the event and called it 'a great friggin day for Brooklyn.' The old lanes were unprotected and blocked by double-parked cars, forcing cyclists into traffic. Since 2012, 29 cyclists have been injured and one killed along this stretch.
