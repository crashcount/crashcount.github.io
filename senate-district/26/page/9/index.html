The bill, now under review, aims to raise $226 million yearly for city infrastructure. Gounardes said, "We're proposing an infrastructure fund to help pay for some of the capital costs to mitigate some of the consequences of last-mile trucking, and freight growth." The bill responds to a surge in daily package deliveries, now at 2.3 million, and forecasts of 200,000 trucks a day by 2045. Gounardes, the bill's sponsor, wants the city—not the MTA—to control the funds. City Hall has not taken a position but said it welcomes ideas to limit emissions and advance infrastructure. The bill joins other efforts to regulate last-mile delivery and warehouse placement. No formal safety analysis for vulnerable road users was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, organized by Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi, focused on whether to reduce the BQE from three lanes to two. Former Brooklyn Democratic Party Chair Frank Seddio opposed the lane reduction, urging allies to resist the change. The meeting excluded some officials who support shrinking the highway, such as Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon and State Senator Andrew Gounardes, who cite environmental and community health concerns.

The budget, now under legislative review, forces New York City to cover a $500 million gap, while the state sits on an $8.7 billion surplus. The matter: 'Hochul's budget not only asks city residents to cover the largest chunk of the MTA's budget gap, but does so in part by continuing long-running practices that essentially under-fund the MTA by millions of dollars each year.' Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas and State Sen. Andrew Gounardes both object, demanding the state honor its legal obligations. Riders Alliance and Reinvent Albany condemn the austerity. With fare hikes looming and no service improvements, city transit riders—often pedestrians and cyclists—bear the brunt.

I strongly support any and all efforts to crack down on reckless drivers and to keep our streets safe for all. I look forward to partnering with Mayor Adams to achieve that goal," he said." -- Andrew Gounardes</p><p class=mb3>On January 26, 2023, Mayor Adams delivered his State of the City address, outlining new transportation and public space plans. The speech promised a $375-million investment in public spaces, permanent open streets, and a push for zero-emission for-hire vehicles by 2030. Adams also highlighted bills targeting reckless drivers and announced a new Director of the Public Realm. The mayor said, 'We will require the 100,000-plus high-volume for-hire vehicles to be zero-emissions by 2030.' Council Member Andrew Gounardes praised the ROADS Act, saying it 'could save hundreds of lives each year.' But advocates like Open Plans and Betsy Plum criticized the lack of action on transit equity, parking reform, and access for low-income New Yorkers. The address left out bus lane expansion, Fair Fares growth, and city fleet reduction, drawing fire for missing bold, systemic change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The intersection lacked a pedestrian crosswalk. Council Member Justin Brannan attended the vigil and tweeted, 'Confronting traffic violence also means taking personal responsibility [and] safe driving habits. It will take all of us.' The driver remained at the scene but faced no charges. Fruchter’s son Lev condemned the New York Automobile Insurance Plan for letting dangerous drivers stay insured. Community leaders, including NYC Comptroller Brad Lander and State Senator Andrew Gounardes, joined in mourning and frustration. Fruchter’s wife Rachel was also killed by a reckless driver in 1997, a tragedy that helped spark Vision Zero. Nearly three decades later, traffic laws remain weak. No systemic change.
