It comes in the dark and in daylight, at corners and crosswalks, on bikes and on foot. Since January 2022, 31 people have died and 5,484 have been injured in crashes here. Seventy-five suffered serious injuries. The dead include children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians—neighbors who never made it home.</p><p>Just weeks ago, on June 21, a 22-year-old moped rider was killed at 67th Street and 3rd Avenue. Police said the driver who hit him was drunk and unlicensed. His passenger left with broken bones. The driver was arrested at the scene. His brother <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>described him as &ldquo;a hardworking man&rdquo; who &ldquo;had a lot of love for his family.&rdquo;</a> The loss is sharp and final.</p><p>In February, a woman stepped out of a taxi on Flatbush Avenue and was struck and killed by a passing car. Both drivers stayed. No arrests. The street swallowed another life. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/boerum-hill-fatal-crash-woman-struck-killed-car-exiting-taxi-brooklyn-nyc/15966918/>First responders transported the victim to New York-Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital, where she was pronounced dead.</a></p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p>Most victims are not behind the wheel. In these years, cars and trucks caused 656 injuries or deaths to pedestrians. Motorcycles and mopeds added 35 more. Bikes, 68. These numbers are bodies. The bodies are neighbors.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn’t</h2><p>State Senator Andrew Gounardes has pushed for change. He sponsored the bill that renewed New York City’s speed camera program through 2030. Gounardes <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/18/albany-reauthorizes-city-speed-camera-program-for-5-more-years>said, &ldquo;Speed cameras save lives and make our streets safer for everyone&mldr; At the end of the day, this is about keeping New Yorkers safe. I&rsquo;m proud to have fought for this program from the beginning, and to renew it now for five years.&rdquo;</a></p><p>But cameras alone are not enough. Unlicensed, reckless drivers keep killing. The law still lets repeat offenders back behind the wheel. The city’s default speed limit is still above what’s proven to save lives. Each delay is another risk. Each loophole is another funeral.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do-now>What You Can Do Now</h2><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Call your council member. Call Senator Gounardes. Demand a 20 mph citywide speed limit. Demand real penalties for repeat speeders and unlicensed drivers. Join groups like Transportation Alternatives and Families for Safe Streets. Do not wait for another family to lose someone.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Fifty-nine people died in three months. Pedestrians and children bore the brunt. Advocates and Senator Gounardes call for urgent street redesigns and expanded camera enforcement. City Hall and Albany face mounting pressure.</p><p class=mb3>On April 20, 2022, advocates and Senator Andrew Gounardes (District 26) sounded the alarm as traffic deaths in New York City surged. The report, titled 'Advocates demand action as NYC traffic deaths rise 44% in 2022,' revealed 59 deaths in the year's first quarter, the highest since Vision Zero began in 2014. Pedestrians and minors suffered most. Gounardes declared, 'It is unacceptable that there have been more traffic fatalities this year than since Vision Zero began.' Transportation Alternatives called for Mayor Adams to back a $3.1 billion DOT street redesign plan and for Albany to grant NYC home rule over traffic cameras. Advocates demand more bike lanes, safer intersections, and unrestricted camera enforcement. The push aims to end the deadly toll on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Gounardes called out the current system, linking lack of experience to crashes and road violence. Carroll said professional training means better drivers. The bill has backing from the New York State Association of Professional Driving Schools and the city Department of Transportation. Both stress the need for real training to protect all road users. The DMV has not commented.

Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymember Bobby Carroll, would require all new drivers in New York State to complete six hours of professional driving instruction before taking the road test. The bill was announced on March 29, 2022. Gounardes slammed the current rules as too lenient, saying, "For some drivers, the first time they take the wheel [as a licensed driver] they are in sole control of their car." Carroll called the requirement "reasonable." Stephen Walling, president of the New York State Association of Professional Driving Schools, said the bill would "go a long way towards keeping all New Yorkers safer on our roads." The NYC Department of Transportation called driver education "crucial" for the safety of pedestrians, cyclists, and other road users, and is reviewing the proposal.

The event spotlighted the city’s struggle to control its own traffic laws. Adams slammed state rules that force red light and speed cameras off between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., calling it 'unbelievable.' He said, 'Who are we protecting? We’re protecting the speeders. How about protecting Isaiah?' State Senator Andrew Gounardes, district 26, echoed Adams: 'It makes no sense that the city cannot control its own destiny on these streets.' Adams admitted NYPD traffic enforcement lags, with summonses down by more than half since 2019. Twenty-seven pedestrians have died so far this year—three more than last year. The mayor pressed for 24/7 camera operation and renewed NYPD focus.

State Senator Andrew Gounardes echoed Adams, questioning why lawmakers outside the city control local street safety. Adams admitted NYPD traffic enforcement has dropped and pledged to prioritize it. Advocates argue enforcement alone is not enough and call for street redesigns to protect pedestrians and cyclists. Traffic deaths remain high, especially when cameras are off.
