The corridor has a record of high-speed harm. After another deadly hit-and-run, local officials and neighbors begged City Hall to stop delaying a DOT safety plan for Third Avenue. “This is not meant to be a highway. This is where people walk.

Robert Jackson and Gounardes defending it: 'Cars speeding in New York kill New Yorkers, injure New Yorkers.' Gounardes called the cameras 'life-saving.' Opponents, including Sen. Andrew Lanza, dismissed the program as a 'cash register.' Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives said, 'When New York City’s speed safety cameras turn off, speeding increases and crashes rise.'

Mayor Eric Adams called it 'a major victory for New Yorkers that will save lives.' Advocacy groups and lawmakers voiced frustration at Albany’s reluctance to adopt stronger safety tools. The final law removes blackout periods for cameras, but leaves dangerous drivers with fewer consequences.

John Liu backs maintaining cameras but won’t commit to S5602. Some City Council members demand that camera revenue fund local road improvements. Assembly Member Dick Gottfried doubts the Council will send the required home rule message in time, while Assembly Member William Magnarelli promises to advance the bill if they do. Mayor Adams’ team claims safety was discussed in Albany, but the mayor himself stayed silent. The bill faces opposition over increased penalties and insurance notifications.

The article, titled "New App Helps Reckless Drivers Thumb Their Noses at City’s Speed Cameras," details how the app lets drivers evade enforcement and dispute tickets. Safe-streets groups, including Transportation Alternatives and engineer Jehiah Czebotar, condemned the app. Jacob deCastro of Transportation Alternatives said, "If drivers want to avoid speeding tickets, they simply should not speed." Czebotar added, "Any demand for notifications to help drivers avoid speed cameras is proof that actually enforcing the speed limit does change driver behavior for the better." The NYPD warned that such apps undermine public safety. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes is pushing to reauthorize and expand the speed camera program.

State Sen. Andrew Gounardes called the grade unacceptable, urging passage of his road-sharing training bill and support for Sen. Brad Hoylman’s bill to lower speed limits.
