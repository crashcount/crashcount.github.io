Since January 2022, 31 people have died and 74 have been seriously injured on these streets (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The dead include children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians. The living carry scars. In the last twelve months alone, seven people died and 14 were left with life-changing injuries. The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie.</p><p>Just weeks ago, on June 21, 2025, Joel Mota, 22, was killed riding his moped in Bay Ridge. His brother remembered him simply: <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>&ldquo;He never stopped working.&rdquo;</a> His passenger, a young man, left with broken bones. The driver who struck them was drunk and unlicensed. She was arrested, then released without bail (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/woman-charged-with-driving-while-intoxicated-without-license-in-fatal-brooklyn-crash>Gothamist coverage</a>).</p><p>On February 28, a woman stepped out of a taxi on Flatbush Avenue. She was struck and killed by a passing car. Both drivers stayed. She did not (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/boerum-hill-fatal-crash-woman-struck-killed-car-exiting-taxi-brooklyn-nyc/15966918/>ABC7 report</a>).</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p>The violence is not random. Cars and SUVs are the main killers—responsible for five of every death, hundreds of injuries, and most of the pain. Trucks and buses crush, bikes and mopeds break bones, but it is the weight and speed of cars that do the worst. The old and the young are not spared. In the last year, three people over 65 died. Two people under 24 did not make it home.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>State Senator Andrew Gounardes has fought for speed cameras and tougher laws. He called it plain: <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/18/albany-reauthorizes-city-speed-camera-program-for-5-more-years>&ldquo;Speed cameras save lives and make our streets safer for everyone&mldr; At the end of the day, this is about keeping New Yorkers safe.&rdquo;</a> He sponsored bills to crack down on license plate cheats and expand camera enforcement. He voted for street redesigns and supported cutting car use. But Albany failed to pass the toughest bills (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/25/d-minus-the-annual-albany-report-card-for-2025>Albany report card</a>). The cameras are back, but the streets are not yet safe.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call Senator Gounardes. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit, more protected bike lanes, and real penalties for repeat offenders. Do not wait for another name to be carved into stone.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The review, covered by Streetsblog, highlighted the lack of a defined safe passing distance, restrictions on local speed limits, and missing public data on police stops. The League of American Bicyclists noted, 'New York is way behind other states on having a safe passage law, as 38 other states do.' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes called for urgent legislative fixes, including road-sharing training, lower speed limits, and keeping speed cameras on. Emily Gallagher, District 50, was mentioned in the advocacy push. The report underscores how state inaction leaves cyclists and pedestrians at risk, despite some progress in infrastructure and enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Pedestrians and minors suffered most. Gounardes declared, 'It is unacceptable that there have been more traffic fatalities this year than since Vision Zero began.'
