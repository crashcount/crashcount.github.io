He told them, &ldquo;I had a six pack of Modelos and two drinks. I was driving the car by myself last night. It&rsquo;s my fault.

Adams called for meetings with precincts and targeting dangerous intersections. But he gave no specifics on enforcement, legislative changes, or expanding the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program. Advocates like Eric McClure (StreetsPAC) and Sara Lind (Open Plans) welcomed the words but demanded concrete action, especially from the NYPD. The city’s current laws limit its power to remove dangerous drivers. Pending state bills could help, but for now, the mayor’s promise remains just that—words, not protection for those most at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
