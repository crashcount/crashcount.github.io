The car hit two men in the crosswalk. Kex Un Chen was 80. Faqiu Lin was 59. Both died where they fell. The driver fled. Police found him later. The charge: manslaughter. The street stayed the same. Police <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/suspect-in-2-brooklyn-hit-and-run-homicides-facing-arraignment-saturday>said the car &ldquo;sped through a red light&rdquo; and never braked</a>. The men were trying to reach a food pantry. They never made it.</p><p>Since 2018, drivers have killed or seriously injured <strong>80 people on this two-mile stretch</strong>. The city promised a redesign. It never came. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>Assemblymember Marcela Mitaynes said</a>, &ldquo;We started talking about a plan in 2014 and it&rsquo;s now 2025. What is going on? There&rsquo;s been no conversation, no updates.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=the-toll-in-numbers>The Toll in Numbers</h3><p><strong>In the last 12 months, 11 people died and 1,944 were injured in SD 26.</strong> Eighteen suffered serious injuries. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. Cars and SUVs did the most harm, but trucks, bikes, and mopeds all left bodies broken. The disaster is slow, but it never stops.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>State Senator Andrew Gounardes has fought for speed cameras and for laws to stop repeat speeders. He <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>sponsored the bill</a> to force the worst drivers to install speed limiters. He voted yes. He <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/18/albany-reauthorizes-city-speed-camera-program-for-5-more-years>praised the renewal</a> of the city’s speed camera program: &ldquo;Speed cameras save lives and make our streets safer for everyone&mldr; At the end of the day, this is about keeping New Yorkers safe.&rdquo;</p><p>But the city’s promises to redesign deadly streets like Third Avenue have stalled. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>&ldquo;We wait until someone dies. We wait until a tragedy. We let this happen time and time again,&rdquo;</a> said Gounardes at the scene. The dead keep coming. The waiting goes on.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the city finish the job.</strong> Tell Senator Gounardes to keep pushing for speed limiters and real street redesigns. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice. It is time to choose life.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The measure, awaiting City Council and state approval, aims to keep cameras running nights and weekends—when 41% of crashes occur. The matter summary states: 'the Legislature is poised to do the right thing and allow the speed cameras...to keep operating around the clock.' Gounardes, a key advocate, joins Mayor Adams and crash victims’ families in support. The endorsement highlights that automated enforcement cuts reckless driving and reduces injuries. The deal falls short by lacking escalating penalties for repeat speeders and lasting only three years.

The 40-year-old e-scooter rider was ejected and suffered severe bleeding from his arm. According to the police report, 'A taxi struck an eastbound e-scooter. The rider, 40, flew off. No helmet. Blood streamed from his arm. The brakes had failed.' The report lists 'Brakes Defective' as a contributing factor for both vehicles. No helmet was worn by the e-scooter rider, but this is noted only after the mechanical failure. Three taxi occupants were involved but reported no injuries. The crash highlights the danger when vehicle systems fail on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Vulnerable New Yorkers still wait for real change.</p><p class=mb3>On April 27, 2022, Mayor Adams made a public statement on traffic enforcement and street safety policy. He announced a $904 million budget for safety improvements and said, 'We need to find them proactively, and get them off the streets.' Adams called for meetings with precincts and targeting dangerous intersections. But he gave no specifics on enforcement, legislative changes, or expanding the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program. Advocates like Eric McClure (StreetsPAC) and Sara Lind (Open Plans) welcomed the words but demanded concrete action, especially from the NYPD. The city’s current laws limit its power to remove dangerous drivers. Pending state bills could help, but for now, the mayor’s promise remains just that—words, not protection for those most at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Gounardes also pushed to keep speed cameras active. Advocates like Jon Orcutt acknowledged progress, such as the MTA’s bike strategy and new greenway funding, but stressed the need for stronger laws.

The League of American Bicyclists noted, 'New York is way behind other states on having a safe passage law, as 38 other states do.' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes called for urgent legislative fixes, including road-sharing training, lower speed limits, and keeping speed cameras on. Emily Gallagher, District 50, was mentioned in the advocacy push.
