A BMW ran the red light. The car did not brake. Both men, ages 59 and 80, died in the street. The driver left them behind and sped away. Police found him later. He told them, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/12/hit-and-run-bmw-driver-who-killed-2-in-brooklyn-had-downed-beers-body-matter-found-on-car-da/>&ldquo;I had a six pack of Modelos and two drinks. I was driving the car by myself last night. It&rsquo;s my fault. After I hit them, I came home.&rdquo;</a></p><p>The men may have been on their way to a food pantry. City Harvest said, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/sunset-park-deadly-hit-run-driver-charged-fatal-collision-2-men-brooklyn-nyc-arraigned-court/17083850/>&ldquo;We understand they may have been on their way to our Mobile Market simply trying to access food like so many New Yorkers in need.&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h3><p><strong>In the last twelve months, SD 26 saw 7 deaths and 1,711 injuries from 3,126 crashes.</strong> Fourteen people suffered serious injuries. Most of the dead were older. Most of the injured were young. Cars and SUVs did the most harm, but trucks, bikes, and mopeds all left bodies behind. The street is not safe for anyone.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-the-long-road-ahead>Leadership: Progress and the Long Road Ahead</h3><p>Senator Andrew Gounardes has pushed for change. He sponsored and voted for the law that keeps speed cameras running in school zones through 2030. He called it clear: <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/18/albany-reauthorizes-city-speed-camera-program-for-5-more-years>&ldquo;Speed cameras save lives and make our streets safer for everyone&mldr; At the end of the day, this is about keeping New Yorkers safe. I&rsquo;m proud to have fought for this program from the beginning, and to renew it now for five years.&rdquo;</a></p><p>He also sponsored the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed-limiting devices. The bill passed committee but has not yet become law. The carnage continues.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay means another family shattered.</strong> Call Senator Gounardes. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat offenders. Do not wait for another body in the crosswalk.</p><p><strong>Act now.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The NYPD warned that such apps undermine public safety. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes is pushing to reauthorize and expand the speed camera program.

The report, titled 'Advocates demand action as NYC traffic deaths rise 44% in 2022,' revealed 59 deaths in the year's first quarter, the highest since Vision Zero began in 2014. Pedestrians and minors suffered most. Gounardes declared, 'It is unacceptable that there have been more traffic fatalities this year than since Vision Zero began.' Transportation Alternatives called for Mayor Adams to back a $3.1 billion DOT street redesign plan and for Albany to grant NYC home rule over traffic cameras. Advocates demand more bike lanes, safer intersections, and unrestricted camera enforcement. The push aims to end the deadly toll on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Carroll called the requirement "reasonable." Stephen Walling, president of the New York State Association of Professional Driving Schools, said the bill would "go a long way towards keeping all New Yorkers safer on our roads."

He said, 'Who are we protecting? We’re protecting the speeders. How about protecting Isaiah?' State Senator Andrew Gounardes, district 26, echoed Adams: 'It makes no sense that the city cannot control its own destiny on these streets.' Adams admitted NYPD traffic enforcement lags, with summonses down by more than half since 2019. Twenty-seven pedestrians have died so far this year—three more than last year. The mayor pressed for 24/7 camera operation and renewed NYPD focus.
