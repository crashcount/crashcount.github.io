A mother holds her child&rsquo;s hand. A cyclist waits for the light. In Senate District 26, these moments end in sirens too often. <strong>In the last twelve months, 7 people died and 1,627 were injured in 2,955 crashes.</strong> Fourteen were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The old, the young, the ones just passing through. The street does not care.</p><p><strong>Now the toll is higher.</strong> Since 2022, there have been 10,369 crashes. Five thousand, two hundred sixteen people hurt. Thirty dead. The numbers rise. The sirens do not stop. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the data</a>.</p><p>The old are not spared. Five people over 75 are dead. Eight between 65 and 74. Children are hurt—391 under 18, their lives changed in an instant. The street does not care about age.</p><p>A woman steps from a taxi on Flatbush Avenue. She does not make it across. The drivers stay. The tape goes up. The street is closed. The story is over for her. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/boerum-hill-fatal-crash-woman-struck-killed-car-exiting-taxi-brooklyn-nyc/15966918/>Report details</a>.</p><p>Cars and SUVs killed 5, left 188 with broken bones or worse, and battered 210 more. Trucks and buses killed 2, hurt dozens. Bikes and mopeds, too, left their mark, but the steel and speed of cars do most of the damage.</p><h3 id=leadership-in-the-crosshairs>Leadership in the Crosshairs</h3><p>Senator Andrew Gounardes has not stood silent. He backed the <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/stop-super-speeders-bill-advances-in-senate-committee>Stop Super Speeders bill</a>, which would force the worst repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no longer simply enough to shake our heads in despair when these preventable tragedies occur—it&rsquo;s time for us to act,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-lawmakers-push-super-speeder-bill-after-brooklyn-crash-kills-mom-2-kids>said Gounardes</a> after a driver with a suspended license and dozens of violations killed a mother and her two daughters in Brooklyn. He also sponsored a bill to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S7336>expand speed camera enforcement</a>, closing loopholes for drivers who hide their plates.</p><p>But the carnage continues. Each new name added to the list is a measure of delay. As one advocate put it, &ldquo;I definitely believe these super speeders really, they&rsquo;re criminals. They should not be allowed to drive, they really shouldn&rsquo;t. I think [the city] is being nice.&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-lawmakers-push-super-speeder-bill-after-brooklyn-crash-kills-mom-2-kids>said the advocate</a>.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>The disaster is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day without action is another day of blood on the street. Call Senator Gounardes. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras that never go dark. Demand streets where a child can cross without fear.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong> <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The letter, organized by Local Progress, states: 'This means projects that expanded cycling infrastructure, pedestrian walkways, and public transit were prioritized over outdated highway expansions and lane widening.' State Senator Andrew Gounardes sponsors the bill. Alex Marion, Syracuse city auditor, signed on, saying, 'If we can reduce the vehicle miles traveled, we can look at the space of streets differently.' The bill would force planners to consider car miles in every project, shifting focus from car movement to safer, people-first streets.

The matter, titled 'Congestion Pricing Opponents Are Blocking Disabled Access to Mass Transit, Politicians Charge,' highlights how legal challenges from New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, the United Federation of Teachers, and others have forced the MTA to halt critical accessibility upgrades. Gounardes declared, 'That’s not gonna happen if the money’s not there.' The MTA earmarked $6 billion for accessibility, aiming to make 70 stations ADA accessible and modernize 78 elevators. Disability advocates like Elizabeth Valdez and Joe Rappaport stressed that most disabled New Yorkers rely on subways and buses, not private cars. Christopher Schuyler noted congestion pricing would speed up paratransit and wheelchair-accessible vehicles. Without funding, the city’s most vulnerable remain stranded.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident left a 49-year-old woman in critical condition. The driver, Stanley Manel, was arrested and charged with failure to yield and failure to exercise due care. The officials' statement read: 'We’re deeply saddened and outraged at the news of yet another pedestrian being struck by an unsafe driver in Greenpoint.' Restler and colleagues highlighted the intersection's dangers and the driver's history—35 tickets since 2019, including 26 speed camera violations. They urged support for bills requiring speed control devices for repeat offenders and for Sammy’s Law, which would let NYC set its own speed limits. The group called on the Department of Transportation to install raised crosswalks and daylighting to protect pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, backed by New Yorkers for Transportation Equity, was introduced last year and is under consideration. The measure’s summary promises to 'improve air quality and reduce fatal crashes.' Gounardes, representing Brooklyn’s western edge, champions the shift: 'A new approach will not only protect our climate, but also make New York a safer, more affordable place to live.' Analysis from the Rocky Mountain Institute projects 593 fewer traffic deaths each year, with thousands more lives saved through active transportation. The bill’s focus is clear: less driving, more safety, cleaner air, and real savings for families.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Gounardes said, "We fundamentally want to be shifting how we think about transportation infrastructure." The measure responds to data showing over 90 percent of infrastructure funds go to roads, not transit. Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance called for an "about-face," noting highway projects have torn apart poor communities and endangered pedestrians and cyclists. The bill sits before the state legislature. No direct safety analyst assessment, but advocates stress the law would shift funding from car-centric projects to transit and greenways, reducing systemic danger for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Andrew Gounardes introduced a bill requiring New York to reduce vehicle miles traveled by 20 percent by 2050. The bill, modeled after Minnesota law, is not yet passed or assigned to a committee. It would amend the state’s climate law, forcing transportation officials to align highway projects with the goal of fewer car trips. Gounardes warns, 'If we’re just going to use that money to double down on the transportation of the past, on just purely automobile usage, we’re making a great mistake.' Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance says the bill is about shifting priorities to climate and equity. Advocates note that over 90 percent of recent infrastructure funds went to roads, not transit. The measure would require revisions or offsets for projects that don’t cut driving. Gov. Hochul’s office declined comment. The bill aims to halt the cycle of road expansion, rising traffic, and mounting deaths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
