A BMW ran the red light. The car did not brake. Both men, ages 59 and 80, died in the street. The driver left them behind and sped away. Police found him later. He told them, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/12/hit-and-run-bmw-driver-who-killed-2-in-brooklyn-had-downed-beers-body-matter-found-on-car-da/>&ldquo;I had a six pack of Modelos and two drinks. I was driving the car by myself last night. It&rsquo;s my fault. After I hit them, I came home.&rdquo;</a></p><p>The men may have been on their way to a food pantry. City Harvest said, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/sunset-park-deadly-hit-run-driver-charged-fatal-collision-2-men-brooklyn-nyc-arraigned-court/17083850/>&ldquo;We understand they may have been on their way to our Mobile Market simply trying to access food like so many New Yorkers in need.&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h3><p><strong>In the last twelve months, SD 26 saw 7 deaths and 1,711 injuries from 3,126 crashes.</strong> Fourteen people suffered serious injuries. Most of the dead were older. Most of the injured were young. Cars and SUVs did the most harm, but trucks, bikes, and mopeds all left bodies behind. The street is not safe for anyone.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-the-long-road-ahead>Leadership: Progress and the Long Road Ahead</h3><p>Senator Andrew Gounardes has pushed for change. He sponsored and voted for the law that keeps speed cameras running in school zones through 2030. He called it clear: <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/18/albany-reauthorizes-city-speed-camera-program-for-5-more-years>&ldquo;Speed cameras save lives and make our streets safer for everyone&mldr; At the end of the day, this is about keeping New Yorkers safe. I&rsquo;m proud to have fought for this program from the beginning, and to renew it now for five years.&rdquo;</a></p><p>He also sponsored the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed-limiting devices. The bill passed committee but has not yet become law. The carnage continues.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay means another family shattered.</strong> Call Senator Gounardes. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat offenders. Do not wait for another body in the crosswalk.</p><p><strong>Act now.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The project, led by NYC DOT, brings mid-block crossings, concrete pedestrian islands, curb enhancements, and split-phase signals to one of Brooklyn’s deadliest corridors. The matter, titled 'Atlantic Avenue upgrade: Locals celebrate major safety fixes coming to dangerous corridor,' highlights years of advocacy after repeated crashes. Restler, who has long pushed for these changes, praised the progress: 'Atlantic Avenue has been extremely dangerous my whole life. I'm excited by the progress we're making in partnership with DOT to expand mid-block crossings and other smart interventions to slow down cars and advance safety in our community.' The announcement follows a deadly crash last spring and is part of the city’s Vision Zero push.

The matter, discussed in Streetsblog, quotes Adams: “Each Council member is going to have to weigh in on how they feel it should be enacted or should not be enacted in their district.” Adams hesitated to commit to a citywide 20 mph limit, instead suggesting community-by-community decisions. Eric McClure of StreetsPAC called this approach “chaotic and dangerous,” pushing for a uniform 20 mph limit to save lives. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives urged a comprehensive, data-driven plan. State Senator Andrew Gounardes and Brad Hoylman-Sigal pressed the Council to use its new powers. The Department of Transportation clarified its limited authority.

The matter, described as 'Albany pumps the brakes on MTA funding plan in rebuke of Hochul’s move to ditch congestion pricing,' left the MTA without the $1 billion annual revenue congestion pricing would have provided.

The report states the e-scooter rider suffered crush injuries to his arm but remained awake and conscious at the scene. The SUV, registered in New York and operated by a licensed driver from New Jersey, was described as 'starting from parking' at the time of the crash.

The pickup, a 2007 Chevrolet, was making a left turn when it collided with the e-bike, which was traveling straight. The police report describes the aftermath: 'The bike lay twisted. The truck bore blood and silence.' The e-bike rider was ejected and suffered crush injuries to the entire body. The data does not specify helmet use or other victim behaviors as contributing factors.

The letter states, 'The state Legislature should pass the law before the end of this session in June, which could pivot transportation funding toward more beneficial uses like mass transit and biking and walking infrastructure.' Stewart-Cousins is mentioned as a key recipient. The bill would force agencies to prioritize projects for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit riders over highway expansion.

On May 15, 2024, more than a dozen local officials sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, urging passage before session’s end in June. The letter, organized by Local Progress, states: 'This means projects that expanded cycling infrastructure, pedestrian walkways, and public transit were prioritized over outdated highway expansions and lane widening.' State Senator Andrew Gounardes sponsors the bill. Alex Marion, Syracuse city auditor, signed on, saying, 'If we can reduce the vehicle miles traveled, we can look at the space of streets differently.' The bill would force planners to consider car miles in every project, shifting focus from car movement to safer, people-first streets. The policy could help undo decades of harm from highways that split communities and reinforce segregation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
