Two men, Kex Un Chen, 80, and Faqiu Lin, 59, tried to cross Third Avenue at 52nd Street. A BMW ran the red. The car did not slow. The driver left them dead in the crosswalk and sped away. Police found him later. He told them, &ldquo;I had a six pack of Modelos and two drinks. I was driving the car by myself last night. It&rsquo;s my fault. After I hit them, I came home.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/12/hit-and-run-bmw-driver-who-killed-2-in-brooklyn-had-downed-beers-body-matter-found-on-car-da/>NY Daily News</a></p><p>The men were steps from a food pantry. &ldquo;We understand they may have been on their way to our Mobile Market simply trying to access food like so many New Yorkers in need,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/sunset-park-deadly-hit-run-driver-charged-fatal-collision-2-men-brooklyn-nyc-arraigned-court/17083850/>said City Harvest</a>.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h3><p><strong>In the last 12 months, SD 26 saw 7 deaths and 1,721 injuries in 3,099 crashes.</strong> Fourteen people were seriously injured. The dead are not numbers. They are elders, children, neighbors. Cars and SUVs did most of the killing—5 deaths, 18 serious injuries, 633 injuries. Trucks and buses killed 2, injured 100. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left dozens more hurt. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Senator Andrew Gounardes has fought for speed cameras and tougher rules for repeat speeders. &ldquo;The verdict came in a long time ago: speed cameras save lives and make our streets safer for everyone&mldr; At the end of the day, this is about keeping New Yorkers safe.

He sponsored the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force the worst offenders to slow down or lose their cars. He voted yes to extend school speed zones. But the city has not lowered the default speed limit to 20 mph. The carnage continues.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-no-more-waiting>Call to Action: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph citywide speed limit. Demand the city use every tool—speed cameras, street redesign, real penalties for repeat offenders.</strong> Every day of delay is another funeral. The dead cannot call.

The matter, discussed in Streetsblog, quotes Adams: “Each Council member is going to have to weigh in on how they feel it should be enacted or should not be enacted in their district.” Adams hesitated to commit to a citywide 20 mph limit, instead suggesting community-by-community decisions. Eric McClure of StreetsPAC called this approach “chaotic and dangerous,” pushing for a uniform 20 mph limit to save lives. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives urged a comprehensive, data-driven plan. State Senator Andrew Gounardes and Brad Hoylman-Sigal pressed the Council to use its new powers. The Department of Transportation clarified its limited authority. The Council’s delay leaves vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as 'Albany pumps the brakes on MTA funding plan in rebuke of Hochul’s move to ditch congestion pricing,' left the MTA without the $1 billion annual revenue congestion pricing would have provided. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins announced the session’s close without a deal. Lawmakers including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris, State Sen. John Liu, Assemblyman Harvey Epstein, and Assemblyman Tony Simone criticized the governor’s decision and the proposed IOU bailout. Gounardes said, 'I cannot in good conscience ratify a decision that will eliminate a significant, dedicated revenue source for the MTA’s capital plan.'

The measure is championed by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and backed by a coalition of local officials. On May 15, 2024, a letter to Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins called for swift passage before the session ends in June. The letter states, 'The state Legislature should pass the law before the end of this session in June, which could pivot transportation funding toward more beneficial uses like mass transit and biking and walking infrastructure.' Stewart-Cousins is mentioned as a key recipient. The bill would force agencies to prioritize projects for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit riders over highway expansion. Advocates argue this shift will save lives, cut pollution, and undo harms from car-centric planning.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lives at stake.</p><p class=mb3>Bill A4120/S1981 aims to cut vehicle miles traveled in New York by 20% by 2050. On May 15, 2024, more than a dozen local officials sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, urging passage before session’s end in June. The letter, organized by Local Progress, states: 'This means projects that expanded cycling infrastructure, pedestrian walkways, and public transit were prioritized over outdated highway expansions and lane widening.' State Senator Andrew Gounardes sponsors the bill. Alex Marion, Syracuse city auditor, signed on, saying, 'If we can reduce the vehicle miles traveled, we can look at the space of streets differently.' The bill would force planners to consider car miles in every project, shifting focus from car movement to safer, people-first streets. The policy could help undo decades of harm from highways that split communities and reinforce segregation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Kathy Hochul publicly supported reauthorizing New York City’s red light camera program, which is set to expire in December. The bill, sponsored by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, would renew the program for six years and expand cameras from 150 to 1,325 intersections. Hochul, at a ceremony for 'Sammy’s Law,' said, 'local governments should be making these decisions,' but did not endorse the expansion. The Adams administration and DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez have pushed for more cameras. Hochul’s stance signals support for local control over traffic enforcement, but leaves the fate of a broader camera rollout uncertain. Vulnerable road users remain at risk while Albany debates the city’s authority to protect its streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure remains in committee. The bill responds to a fatal flaw: 'We have no mechanism right now, under law, to crack down on extremely reckless drivers,' said Brooklyn State Sen. Andrew Gounardes. The current law lets drivers rack up dozens of camera tickets and keep driving, since no points are added to licenses. Gianaris’s bill aims to close this loophole. DOT and crash victims’ families, including Juliane Williams, whose daughter was killed by a speeding driver, press for stronger penalties and expansion of the red light camera program. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program expired with little effect.
