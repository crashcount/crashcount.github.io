On July 11, a BMW tore through the crosswalk at Third Avenue and 52nd Street in Sunset Park. Kex Un Chen, 80, and Faqiu Lin, 59, were walking to a food pantry. The car did not brake. The bodies landed hard. The driver fled. Police found him later and charged him with manslaughter and leaving the scene. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-brooklyn-deadly-hit-and-run/>Councilmember Alexa Avilés said she was &ldquo;saddened and angered at the tragic and senseless killing of two individuals earlier this morning. Instances like this remind us of why Third Avenue needs serious investments in safety enhancements from both the state and the city.&rdquo;</a></p><p>This was not a surprise. Since City Hall paused a safety redesign for Third Avenue, 96 crashes have injured 80 people. The city knew this stretch was deadly. The community knew. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/11/hit-and-run-driver-kills-two-pedestrians-on-third-ave-corridor-eric-adams-refuses-to-make-safer>Julio Peña said, &ldquo;It was only a matter of time before somebody else died on this corridor and here we are. Every death is preventable, and once again we are in a place of frustration where we have this incredibly dangerous corridor and the city just refusin&mldr;&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=the-slow-disaster>The Slow Disaster</h3><p>In the last year, SD 26 saw 3 killed, 9 seriously hurt, and 996 injured in 1,844 crashes. Most victims were walking or cycling. Cars and SUVs did the most harm, but trucks, bikes, and mopeds all left bodies behind. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors. They are gone.</p><h3 id=what-has-senator-gounardes-done>What Has Senator Gounardes Done?</h3><p>Senator Andrew Gounardes has pushed for safety. He sponsored the bill to expand speed camera enforcement and close loopholes for drivers who hide their plates. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/18/albany-reauthorizes-city-speed-camera-program-for-5-more-years>He said, &ldquo;The verdict came in a long time ago: speed cameras save lives and make our streets safer for everyone&mldr; At the end of the day, this is about keeping New Yorkers safe. I&rsquo;m proud to have fought for this program from the beginning, and to renew it now for five years.&rdquo;</a> He voted yes on complete street design. He has backed bills to cut driving and force repeat speeders to slow down. But the carnage continues. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so.</p><h3 id=what-next-demand-more>What Next? Demand More</h3><p>Every crash is preventable. Call Senator Gounardes. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real redesigns for deadly corridors. Demand action before another neighbor dies.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The letter, organized by Local Progress, states: 'This means projects that expanded cycling infrastructure, pedestrian walkways, and public transit were prioritized over outdated highway expansions and lane widening.' State Senator Andrew Gounardes sponsors the bill. Alex Marion, Syracuse city auditor, signed on, saying, 'If we can reduce the vehicle miles traveled, we can look at the space of streets differently.' The bill would force planners to consider car miles in every project, shifting focus from car movement to safer, people-first streets.

The measure remains in committee. The bill responds to a fatal flaw: 'We have no mechanism right now, under law, to crack down on extremely reckless drivers,' said Brooklyn State Sen. Andrew Gounardes. The current law lets drivers rack up dozens of camera tickets and keep driving, since no points are added to licenses. Gianaris’s bill aims to close this loophole. DOT and crash victims’ families, including Juliane Williams, whose daughter was killed by a speeding driver, press for stronger penalties and expansion of the red light camera program. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program expired with little effect. The city’s vulnerable road users remain at risk while repeat offenders face few real consequences.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The campaign, led by Bike South Brooklyn, the Bay Ridge Environmental Group, and Transportation Alternatives, demands a 'better, safer Fourth Avenue' with a road diet and protected bike lanes. Council Member Justin Brannan, who represents Bay Ridge, has a mixed record—once supportive, now silent as his term ends. State Senator Andrew Gounardes supports the redesign, citing risks to pedestrians and cyclists: 'the design of the street puts your safety at risk.' The DOT has not proposed changes south of Sunset Park, leaving Bay Ridge exposed. Advocates vow to keep fighting for safety, regardless of political will.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'Congestion Pricing Opponents Are Blocking Disabled Access to Mass Transit, Politicians Charge,' highlights how legal challenges from New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, the United Federation of Teachers, and others have forced the MTA to halt critical accessibility upgrades. Gounardes declared, 'That’s not gonna happen if the money’s not there.' The MTA earmarked $6 billion for accessibility, aiming to make 70 stations ADA accessible and modernize 78 elevators. Disability advocates like Elizabeth Valdez and Joe Rappaport stressed that most disabled New Yorkers rely on subways and buses, not private cars. Christopher Schuyler noted congestion pricing would speed up paratransit and wheelchair-accessible vehicles.

Restler and colleagues highlighted the intersection's dangers and the driver's history—35 tickets since 2019, including 26 speed camera violations. They urged support for bills requiring speed control devices for repeat offenders and for Sammy’s Law, which would let NYC set its own speed limits.

Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance says the bill is about shifting priorities to climate and equity. Advocates note that over 90 percent of recent infrastructure funds went to roads, not transit. The measure would require revisions or offsets for projects that don’t cut driving. Gov. Hochul’s office declined comment.
