Kex Un Chen, 80, and Faqiu Lin, 59, were crossing. The car did not slow. The driver fled. Both men died where they fell. Police found the car later. The man behind the wheel, 23, told them, “I had a six pack of Modelos and two drinks. I was driving the car by myself last night. It&rsquo;s my fault. After I hit them, I came home.” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/12/hit-and-run-bmw-driver-who-killed-2-in-brooklyn-had-downed-beers-body-matter-found-on-car-da/>the NY Daily News reported</a>.</p><p><strong>This is not rare.</strong> In the last 12 months, SD 26 saw 7 deaths and 1,721 injuries in 3,099 crashes.

Most are not counted by name. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data tracks every crash</a>.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>The old. The young. The ones on foot.</strong> In the last year, three people over 65 died. Children were hurt 131 times. Cars and SUVs did most of the killing—five deaths, 440 minor injuries, 193 moderate, 18 serious. Trucks and buses killed two more. Bikes, mopeds, motorcycles: none killed, but dozens injured. The street does not care who you are.</p><p><strong>The site of Friday’s crash is no stranger to blood.</strong> In five years, a three-block stretch around 52nd and 3rd saw 59 crashes and 80 injuries, <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/brooklyn/pedestrians-hit-and-run-brooklyn/>according to amNY</a>.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p><strong>Senator Andrew Gounardes has fought for speed cameras and tougher laws.</strong> He called the verdict clear: “Speed cameras save lives and make our streets safer for everyone&mldr; At the end of the day, this is about keeping New Yorkers safe. I&rsquo;m proud to have fought for this program from the beginning, and to renew it now for five years,” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/18/albany-reauthorizes-city-speed-camera-program-for-5-more-years>he told Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p><p>He voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force the worst repeat offenders to install speed limiters, <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>according to Open States</a>.</p><p>But the deaths keep coming. Cameras catch speeders, but the city’s default speed limit is still above 20 mph. The worst drivers keep their keys.

It is policy.</strong> Call Senator Gounardes. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph default speed limit. Demand real consequences for repeat offenders.

Committee Chair Jeremy Cooney was compelled to place it on the agenda. Democrats may use 'Aye Without Recommendation' to let the bill advance without clear support. A watchdog coalition, including Reinvent Albany and Bike New York, called the bill 'contrary to notions of basic fairness.' The same day, activists lobbied for the Idaho Stop bill (S639/A7071), sponsored by Sen. Rachel May and Assembly Member Karen McMahon. The bill would let cyclists treat red lights as stop signs and stop signs as yield signs, a move proven to reduce injuries. Despite support, the bill remains blocked. NYPD continues harsh enforcement against cyclists, who make up a small share of city trips but receive a disproportionate number of tickets. Cyclist deaths keep rising.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He noted Yarimi’s 21 speeding and five red-light tickets did not trigger license points or insurance penalties. Gonzalez questioned why the NYPD cannot seize cars based on repeated violations and called for legislative change. He endorsed State Sen. Andrew Gounardes’s bill (S7621), which would require speed limiter technology for drivers with six or more automated enforcement tickets in a year, describing it as a way to fight 'violent car culture.'

The bill, stalled for years in Albany, gained urgency after a fatal Brooklyn crash on April 1, 2025. Gallagher, joined by State Senator Andrew Gounardes and city Comptroller Brad Lander, rallied at Borough Hall, urging swift passage. The bill targets drivers with 11 or more license points in 24 months, or six camera violations in a year. Gallagher said, 'A lot of what happens when it comes to getting a bill to the top of the list is really through a movement and folks fighting for the bill.' Gounardes added, 'It’s no longer simply enough to shake our heads in despair when these preventable tragedies occur—it’s time for us to act.' The legislation mirrors past efforts like the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Act, aiming to hold reckless drivers accountable and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Her car had 99 violations in a year, including 21 speeding and five red-light tickets. Advocates, including Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives, blame Albany’s delay in passing Senator Andrew Gounardes’s bill to require speed-limiting devices for repeat offenders. Furnas said, “If Albany had passed this bill when it was first introduced, this vehicle would already have been speed limited and this crash would never have happened.” The bill remains pending.

State Senators Andrew Gounardes and Zellnor Myrie condemned the action, warning, 'Trump will be directly responsible for more traffic, more crashes, more polluted air, slower buses and less funding for our transit system.'
