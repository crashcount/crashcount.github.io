A BMW ran the red. The car did not stop. Both men died in the crosswalk. The driver left them in the street and sped away. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/sunset-park-deadly-hit-run-driver-charged-fatal-collision-2-men-brooklyn-nyc-arraigned-court/17083850/>Police found him later</a>. He told them, &ldquo;I had a six pack of Modelos and two drinks&mldr; It&rsquo;s my fault.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/12/hit-and-run-bmw-driver-who-killed-2-in-brooklyn-had-downed-beers-body-matter-found-on-car-da/>He faces manslaughter charges</a>.</p><p><strong>This is not rare.</strong> In the last 12 months, SD 26 has seen 11 deaths and 1,961 injuries from crashes. Eighty people have been killed or seriously hurt on this two-mile stretch since 2018. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/sunset-park-residents-call-for-improvements-on-a-deadly-stretch-of-third-avenue>The city’s answer? A sign that says: &lsquo;be careful,&rsquo;**</a> <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/sunset-park-residents-call-for-improvements-on-a-deadly-stretch-of-third-avenue>said State Senator Andrew Gounardes</a>. &ldquo;This is not meant to be a highway. This is where people walk. This is where people live. This is where kids go to school.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=the-toll-of-delay>The Toll of Delay</h2><p><strong>The carnage is steady.</strong> In the past year, five more people have died in SD 26. Over 1,200 have been injured. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. Cars and trucks do most of the killing: 7 deaths and 19 serious injuries from sedans and SUVs alone. Trucks killed three more. Bikes and mopeds hurt dozens, but they do not kill. The street is not safe for anyone who walks.</p><h2 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h2><p>Senator Gounardes has spoken out. He called out the city’s inaction after the latest deaths: <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>&ldquo;We wait until someone dies. We wait until a tragedy. We wait to say, &lsquo;oh my gosh, how could this possibly have happened?&rsquo; We let this happen time and time again.&rdquo;</a> He has pushed for speed cameras and sponsored bills to force repeat speeders to install limiters. He voted yes to extend school speed zones. But the street remains the same. The city has delayed real fixes for years. The dead keep coming.</p><h2 id=what-now>What Now?</h2><p><strong>No more waiting.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph citywide speed limit. Demand the Stop Super Speeders Act. Demand real redesigns, not just signs. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice. Make them choose life.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Prevention takes a back seat.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13, 2025, the New York State Senate passed a bill requiring food delivery apps to provide insurance for delivery workers, pedestrians, and cyclists. The bill, sponsored by Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger, mandates up to $50,000 per person for basic economic loss, regardless of citizenship or employment status. Assembly Member Robert Carroll authored the original Assembly version, stating, 'It is time we require delivery apps to take responsibility for keeping delivery workers and pedestrians safe.' Sen. Andrew Gounardes defended a related speed-limiting bill, but it was weakened. Safety analysts warn: 'Focusing on insurance rather than speed limits shifts responsibility away from prevention and system design, failing to reduce crash risk and potentially discouraging mode shift by not addressing the root causes of danger for pedestrians and cyclists.' Lawmakers back insurance, but leave the streets risky.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city’s deadliest keep rolling. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On June 11, 2025, the New York State Senate amended the Super Speeder Bill, sponsored by Sen. Andrew Gounardes (D-Bay Ridge). The bill originally required drivers with six or more speed or red-light camera tickets in a year to install speed-limiting devices. The Senate raised the threshold to sixteen speed-camera tickets, and removed red-light violations from the count. Streetsblog NYC reports, 'the state Senate moved to help more than 130,000 reckless drivers avoid accountability.' Gounardes defended the change, saying it would allow the program to grow slowly. Assembly Member Michaell Novakhov (R-Midwood) argued the threshold was too low. The amendment means only 17,000 drivers, not 150,000, will face restrictions. According to safety analysts, this move undermines deterrence, increases risk to pedestrians and cyclists, and signals that dangerous driving is tolerated. Vulnerable road users remain at risk. The bill’s status now sets a weaker standard for accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure passed with just two 'no' votes out of 13. The bill requires speed-limiting devices in cars of drivers with six or more camera-issued speeding tickets in a year. Streetsblog NYC reports, 'A bill that would prevent the most-reckless drivers from speeding easily moved forward on Tuesday.' Senator Andrew Gounardes sponsors the bill, emphasizing it targets the most dangerous drivers. Assembly sponsor Emily Gallagher raised concerns about cost and judicial bias, but stressed that speeding endangers everyone. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins backs the bill's safety focus. According to safety analysts, restricting repeat speeders directly tackles a major threat to pedestrians and cyclists, likely reducing crashes and making streets safer citywide.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Action, not talk.</p><p class=mb3>On May 16, 2025, the New York State Senate debated the Stop Super Speeders bill (S4045/A2029), which requires speed-limiting devices for drivers with six or more speed-camera violations in a year. The bill, sponsored by Sen. Andrew Gounardes, aims to curb reckless driving. Initially, Sen. Anthony Palumbo (R-Suffolk) opposed the measure, citing concerns about government overreach and enforcement. He compared it to ignition locks for drunk drivers, which he supports. After discussion with Gounardes, Palumbo shifted, supporting the bill if it meets its goal. The bill’s summary states it targets repeat speeders with court orders and misdemeanor charges for non-compliance. Data shows 21 percent of fatal pedestrian crashes in NYC involve vehicles with six or more camera tickets in the prior year. Speed limiters have been shown to reduce traffic deaths by 37 percent. Palumbo now signals willingness to take strong action against reckless drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lawmakers clash, then unite. Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On May 16, 2025, State Sen. Anthony Palumbo, Republican from Suffolk, changed course on the Stop Super Speeders bill (S4045/A2029). The bill, sponsored by Sen. Andrew Gounardes, would require speed-limiting devices in cars of drivers with six or more speed-camera violations in a year. Palumbo first called the measure 'government overreach,' preferring license suspensions. After debate and a detailed comparison to ignition locks for drunk drivers, Palumbo agreed to support the bill if it meets its goal. Gounardes explained, 'We mimicked the ignition lock process and procedure.' The bill gained momentum after a deadly crash. According to the safety analyst, the event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action affecting pedestrians or cyclists, so no safety impact can be determined.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Committee Chair Jeremy Cooney was compelled to place it on the agenda. Democrats may use 'Aye Without Recommendation' to let the bill advance without clear support. A watchdog coalition, including Reinvent Albany and Bike New York, called the bill 'contrary to notions of basic fairness.' The same day, activists lobbied for the Idaho Stop bill (S639/A7071), sponsored by Sen. Rachel May and Assembly Member Karen McMahon. The bill would let cyclists treat red lights as stop signs and stop signs as yield signs, a move proven to reduce injuries. Despite support, the bill remains blocked. NYPD continues harsh enforcement against cyclists, who make up a small share of city trips but receive a disproportionate number of tickets. Cyclist deaths keep rising.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crash happened near Tillary Street just before 10 p.m. on May 10, when 27-year-old Sean Johnson, riding a Suzuki motorcycle, collided with Cordova’s stopped Honda Accord. Johnson was found in critical condition and later died at Brooklyn Hospital Center. The article notes, 'Police arrested 44-year-old Laura Cordova... for driving without a license and using a vehicle without ignition interlock.' The NYPD Highway Collision Investigation Squad is still investigating.

The bill, now pending, would let courts require drivers with six or more automated speeding tickets in a year to install speed limiter devices. Salaam’s resolution, co-sponsored by five council members, urges Albany to act. The matter title: 'Council Member Yusef Salaam Throws Support Behind Albany Push To Rein In Speeding Drivers.' Salaam said, 'It's very simple: it's to save lives.' The hearing drew families of crash victims and advocates like Amy Cohen and Darnell Sealy-McCrorey, who lost loved ones to reckless drivers.
