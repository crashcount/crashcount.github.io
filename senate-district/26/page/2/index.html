In the last twelve months, seven people died and 1,613 were injured in crashes across Senate District 26. Fourteen of those injuries were severe. The dead include a 22-year-old moped rider, struck before sunrise at Third Avenue and 67th Street. His name was Joel Mota. He lived less than half a mile from where he died. His brother remembered him simply: “He was a hardworking man. He had a lot of love for his family. He was always passionate about the things that he did.” (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>Unlicensed, drunk, and behind the wheel—the driver who killed him was arrested at the scene. The passenger on the moped left with broken bones. The street stayed quiet after the sirens faded (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/woman-charged-with-driving-while-intoxicated-without-license-in-fatal-brooklyn-crash>Gothamist</a>).</p><h3 id=the-numbers-a-relentless-drumbeat>The Numbers: A Relentless Drumbeat</h3><p>In SD 26, cars and trucks did most of the damage. Five killed, 634 injured by sedans and SUVs. Trucks took two more lives. Motorcycles and mopeds left dozens more hurt. Bikes, too, are not spared—43 minor injuries, 22 moderate, three serious. The numbers do not lie. They do not comfort.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Senator Andrew Gounardes has pushed for more speed cameras, voting to expand and renew the city’s program. He called them “lifesaving” and said they “make our streets safer for everyone” (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/18/albany-reauthorizes-city-speed-camera-program-for-5-more-years>Streetsblog NYC</a>). But the fight is not over.

The most dangerous drivers keep their keys. The city can set a 20 mph speed limit now. It has not.</p><h3 id=the-call-demand-more-than-words>The Call: Demand More Than Words</h3><p>Every crash is preventable. Every death is a choice made by leaders who delay. Call your council member.

Vulnerable road users get a fighting chance.</p><p class=mb3>Senate bill S 7336, sponsored by Andrew Gounardes of District 26, sits at the sponsorship stage. The bill, titled 'Relates to the use of certain photo speed violation monitoring systems for the purposes of enforcement of license plate obstruction; repealer,' was introduced on April 11, 2025. It permits New York City to use speed cameras not just for speeding, but also to enforce against license plate obstruction, concealment, and distortion. The measure also extends speed camera enforcement in school zones. Gounardes leads the charge, aiming to close loopholes that let reckless drivers dodge accountability. The bill gives the city sharper teeth to catch those who hide from the law. Vulnerable road users—kids, walkers, cyclists—stand to benefit as the city cracks down on plate cheats and speeds near schools.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report explicitly cites 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as the primary contributing factor, with 'Passenger Distraction' also noted. The boy was crossing with the signal at the intersection.

The letter called the block a 'missing link in Brooklyn’s protected bike lane network.' Brooklyn Community Board 2 backed the demand.

Advocates like Kathy Park Price slammed the city: 'Private interests are able to redesign our streets, prioritizing vehicles over safety at a critical corridor.' Despite unanimous support, DOT keeps the street dangerous.

The bill adds pets to protected victims in traffic law. It hikes fines for drivers who hit animals and flee. Lawmakers push for real consequences when cars strike dogs, cats, and other companions.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0723-2025 sits in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced January 23, 2025, it urges the state to pass A10660/S9915, the Protecting Animals Walking on the Street (PAWS) Act. The resolution states: 'add the term companion animals to the list of possible victim classes should a driver fail to exercise due care to avoid striking pedestrians and to increase the fine for striking a pet with a vehicle and leaving the scene without reporting the incident.' Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary sponsor), Lynn C. Schulman, Carlina Rivera, and Justin L. Brannan back the measure. The PAWS Act would raise fines for drivers who hit pets and leave, and would recognize companion animals as protected victims under traffic law. The move targets a gap in current law, where penalties for striking animals are minor—on par with an illegal U-turn. The Council’s action signals a push for stronger accountability when vehicles harm the city’s most vulnerable, including its animals.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The vehicle veered left and collided with a Lexus, with the impact crushing the front of both vehicles. The police report lists 'Illness' and 'Lost Consciousness' as contributing factors. The man, who was wearing a lap belt and harness, suffered fatal chest injuries and was not ejected from the vehicle. The report states, 'A 73-year-old man lost consciousness at the wheel. His Ford SUV veered left, crushing into a Lexus.' No driver errors such as distraction or speeding are cited beyond the medical emergency. The crash underscores the lethal consequences when a driver becomes incapacitated at speed.

The report states she was 'crossing with the light' when a speeding e-bike struck her, causing 'severe lacerations' to her entire body. She remained conscious after the impact. The e-bike operator, described as unlicensed, did not stop at the scene. The police report lists 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' as contributing factors. The e-bike showed no visible damage. The victim’s action—crossing with the signal—is noted in the report, but the primary focus remains on the rider’s speed, improper lane usage, and lack of a valid license. The crash underscores the dangers posed by reckless operation and systemic failures to control unlicensed riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The plan charges $9 for cars and $14.40 for trucks entering Manhattan below 60th Street. amNew York Metro polled nearly 3,000 residents: 53.8% support, 44.9% oppose. The matter, titled 'Here’s how New Yorkers really feel about congestion pricing,' reveals sharp divides. Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30, Queens) condemned the move, calling it a 'blatant political move and a shameless betrayal of New Yorkers.' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes backed the plan, citing needed transit upgrades. The bill’s impact on vulnerable road users was not assessed. The debate centers on funding transit versus burdening drivers.

The Parks Committee and full board both voted unanimously for the $30 million overhaul, which includes $20.97 million for the Shore Road Promenade and $9.25 million for Leif Ericson Park. The project, described as 'Destination: Greenways!', will expand green space, separate bike and pedestrian lanes, add lighting, and install new amenities. Brannan, a key funder and supporter, said, 'Our local parks are the lungs of our city.' The overhaul aims to improve recreational cycling, repair pothole-ridden paths, and increase accessibility. Board members raised concerns about safety and sanitation, which the Parks Department pledged to address in final designs.
