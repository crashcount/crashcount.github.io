A mother holds her child&rsquo;s hand. A cyclist waits for the light. In Senate District 26, these moments end in sirens too often. <strong>In the last twelve months, 7 people died and 1,632 were injured in 2,955 crashes.</strong> Fourteen were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The old, the young, the ones just passing through. The street does not care.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs killed more than any other machine.</strong> In three years, they took 5 lives, left 188 with broken bones or worse, and battered 210 more. Trucks and buses killed 2, hurt dozens. Bikes and mopeds, too, left their mark, but the steel and speed of cars do most of the damage. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the data</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-in-the-crosshairs>Leadership in the Crosshairs</h3><p>Senator Andrew Gounardes has not stood silent. He backed the <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/stop-super-speeders-bill-advances-in-senate-committee>Stop Super Speeders bill</a>, which would force the worst repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no longer simply enough to shake our heads in despair when these preventable tragedies occur—it&rsquo;s time for us to act,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-lawmakers-push-super-speeder-bill-after-brooklyn-crash-kills-mom-2-kids>said Gounardes</a> after a driver with a suspended license and dozens of violations killed a mother and her two daughters in Brooklyn. He also sponsored a bill to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S7336>expand speed camera enforcement</a>, closing loopholes for drivers who hide their plates.</p><p>But the carnage continues. Each new name added to the list is a measure of delay. As one advocate put it, &ldquo;I definitely believe these super speeders really, they&rsquo;re criminals. They should not be allowed to drive, they really shouldn&rsquo;t. I think [the city] is being nice.&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-lawmakers-push-super-speeder-bill-after-brooklyn-crash-kills-mom-2-kids>said the advocate</a>.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>The disaster is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day without action is another day of blood on the street. Call Senator Gounardes. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras that never go dark. Demand streets where a child can cross without fear.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong> <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, introduced in the New York State Legislature, would require drivers with at least six speeding tickets in a single year, or 11 points in 18 months, to install speed limiter devices in their vehicles. The matter summary states: "We are going to literally force you to slow down by requiring you to install a speed limiter on your car." Gounardes led the announcement at the Atlantic Avenue intersection where a driver killed Katherine Harris. Gallagher, co-sponsor, said, "Cars and trucks can act as weapons when used recklessly." The bill aims to bypass bureaucratic hurdles and act automatically, modeled after ignition interlock devices for drunk drivers. Advocates and city officials joined the call, citing data that speed limiters can reduce traffic deaths by 37 percent. The bill targets the most dangerous drivers, seeking to end impunity for repeat offenders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Gounardes said, 'There is a persistent cohort of drivers... driving on our streets recklessly without any consequences.' The bill was unveiled at the site of a fatal pedestrian crash in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn.

Council Member Jen Gutierrez carried the resolution; Selvena Brooks-Powers later signed on. The bill targets corridors like Bushwick Avenue, Laurelton Parkway, and East Gun Hill Road—sites of hundreds of crashes and dozens killed or maimed since 2019. The matter summary states: 'Because people are dying and being maimed on New York's most-dangerous 25-mile-per-hour streets.' Supporters, including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, cite the science: lower speeds mean less force, fewer deaths. Research shows 20 mph zones cut crashes by 60 percent. The bill does not mandate, but allows, lower limits where carnage is highest.
