The project, led by the Department of Transportation, aimed to create a protected bike lane from the Manhattan Bridge to Barclays Center. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso said, "New York City is regressing on meeting its Vision Zero goals ... and stalled street safety improvements, like those slated for Ashland Place, are a part of the reason why." State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Council Member Crystal Hudson joined the outcry, with Hudson lamenting the incomplete corridor for cyclists. The DOT confirmed the southernmost block would not be converted, following objections from developer Two Trees Management. Advocates cited 88 crashes and multiple injuries in two years, with the most dangerous block excluded from improvements. Residents and advocates rallied, accusing the mayor of prioritizing business over public safety. City Hall deflected, blaming e-bikes for rising cyclist deaths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists now dodge cars and illegal parking. Elected officials and advocates demand action. DOT cites traffic, but danger grows. Pedestrians lose safe crossings. The agency stays silent. Streets stay deadly.</p><p class=mb3>On September 18, 2023, a coalition of elected officials and advocates called out the Department of Transportation for removing protected bike lanes on Brooklyn’s Fourth Avenue during construction. The matter, described as 'DOT continues to ignore dangers it created on Brooklyn’s Fourth Ave,' centers on DOT’s decision to replace bike lanes with a second car lane, violating a city law that requires temporary bike lanes during such work. Council Members Lincoln Restler, Alexa Aviles, Shahana Hanif, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, State Senator Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, and groups like Bike New York and Transportation Alternatives sent a letter demanding the bike lane’s return and physical barriers to stop illegal parking on pedestrian islands. The letter urges DOT to 'ensure curb lanes be preserved for safe cyclist passage' and to 'deploy quick-build physical elements' for pedestrian safety. DOT has not responded. Cyclists and pedestrians remain at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Transportation Committee, led by Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, pressed the Department of Transportation (DOT) for a final report on the program’s effectiveness. The bill required drivers with 15 speed-camera or five red-light tickets in a year to take a safety course or risk vehicle seizure. Council Member Shahana Hanif voiced disappointment, noting, 'We need to not only reauthorize this program, but strengthen it.' Despite over 34,000 drivers meeting the threshold in the last year, only about 1,200 took the course in three years. DOT has not explained the reporting delay or provided outcome data. The lack of enforcement leaves dangerous drivers on the road and vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They warn free bridges funnel traffic into certain neighborhoods. Their letter calls for fairness. The MTA stays silent. The Traffic Mobility Review Board will decide. Streets hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On July 18, 2023, Council Member Shahana Hanif and other Brooklyn officials called for 'equalized tolling on all crossings into Manhattan' as congestion pricing nears. Their letter to the Traffic Mobility Review Board states: 'No one community should disproportionately bear the burden of the cars and trucks passing through their neighborhood.' Hanif, along with Lincoln Restler, Alexa Avilés, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Crystal Hudson, joined borough, state, and federal colleagues in this push. They propose a credit system to balance costs between DOT bridges and MTA tunnels, aiming to protect neighborhoods like the Brooklyn waterfront and the BQE corridor from traffic surges. The MTA declined comment. The Board will soon set final toll rates and rules. The federal government has approved the congestion pricing plan, with tolls for cars expected between $9 and $23. Over 100 exemption requests, including from taxi and for-hire vehicle drivers, are under review.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
