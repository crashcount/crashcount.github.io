A BMW ran the red light. It did not slow. It struck Kex Un Chen, 80, and Faqiu Lin, 59. Both died in the street. The driver fled. Police found him later. He told them, &ldquo;I had a six pack of Modelos and two drinks. I was driving the car by myself last night. It&rsquo;s my fault.

The project, led by the Department of Transportation, aimed to create a protected bike lane from the Manhattan Bridge to Barclays Center. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso said, "New York City is regressing on meeting its Vision Zero goals ... and stalled street safety improvements, like those slated for Ashland Place, are a part of the reason why." State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Council Member Crystal Hudson joined the outcry, with Hudson lamenting the incomplete corridor for cyclists. The DOT confirmed the southernmost block would not be converted, following objections from developer Two Trees Management. Advocates cited 88 crashes and multiple injuries in two years, with the most dangerous block excluded from improvements. Residents and advocates rallied, accusing the mayor of prioritizing business over public safety. City Hall deflected, blaming e-bikes for rising cyclist deaths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Gounardes, a safe streets advocate, said, 'That's really what this conversation should be about—how are we holding people accountable when they have violations to their record and zero consequences for it.' He supports lowering speed limits and tougher penalties but stressed that enforcement is lacking. Senator Iwen Chu urged the NYC DOT to study the area for safety upgrades, stating, 'We must recognize that our streets need to be designed with safety in mind.' The DOT is reviewing the intersection. The call is clear: repeat offenders face little consequence, and street design still puts pedestrians at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Members Lincoln Restler, Alexa Aviles, Shahana Hanif, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, State Senator Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, and groups like Bike New York and Transportation Alternatives sent a letter demanding the bike lane’s return and physical barriers to stop illegal parking on pedestrian islands. The letter urges DOT to 'ensure curb lanes be preserved for safe cyclist passage' and to 'deploy quick-build physical elements' for pedestrian safety. DOT has not responded.

The bill required drivers with 15 speed-camera or five red-light tickets in a year to take a safety course or risk vehicle seizure. Council Member Shahana Hanif voiced disappointment, noting, 'We need to not only reauthorize this program, but strengthen it.' Despite over 34,000 drivers meeting the threshold in the last year, only about 1,200 took the course in three years. DOT has not explained the reporting delay or provided outcome data.

This stretch of Atlantic Avenue is notorious for deadly crashes. Council Member Lincoln Restler responded, stating, “Our community is unified in demanding immediate changes to dramatically slow down traffic, improve safety at intersections, and install new mid block crossings.” The incident marks the second fatal crash on this corridor in 2023. Despite calls from Restler and other local officials for mid-block crossings and traffic calming after previous deaths, the city has not acted. The bill or action is a public statement, not legislation, but it highlights urgent demands for redesign and enforcement to protect vulnerable road users. No safety improvements have been implemented yet.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Reckless drivers face real consequences.</p><p class=mb3>On August 2, 2023, State Senator Andrew Gounardes and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher announced new legislation targeting recidivist reckless drivers. The bill, introduced in the New York State Legislature, would require drivers with at least six speeding tickets in a single year, or 11 points in 18 months, to install speed limiter devices in their vehicles. The matter summary states: "We are going to literally force you to slow down by requiring you to install a speed limiter on your car." Gounardes led the announcement at the Atlantic Avenue intersection where a driver killed Katherine Harris. Gallagher, co-sponsor, said, "Cars and trucks can act as weapons when used recklessly." The bill aims to bypass bureaucratic hurdles and act automatically, modeled after ignition interlock devices for drunk drivers. Advocates and city officials joined the call, citing data that speed limiters can reduce traffic deaths by 37 percent. The bill targets the most dangerous drivers, seeking to end impunity for repeat offenders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Gounardes said, 'There is a persistent cohort of drivers... driving on our streets recklessly without any consequences.' The bill was unveiled at the site of a fatal pedestrian crash in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program, which mandates safety courses for repeat offenders, has faced criticism for weak enforcement.

Hanif, along with Lincoln Restler, Alexa Avilés, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Crystal Hudson, joined borough, state, and federal colleagues in this push. They propose a credit system to balance costs between DOT bridges and MTA tunnels, aiming to protect neighborhoods like the Brooklyn waterfront and the BQE corridor from traffic surges. The MTA declined comment. The Board will soon set final toll rates and rules. The federal government has approved the congestion pricing plan, with tolls for cars expected between $9 and $23.
