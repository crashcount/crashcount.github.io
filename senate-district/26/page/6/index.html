The car hit two men in the crosswalk. Kex Un Chen was 80. Faqiu Lin was 59. Both died where they fell. The driver fled. Police found him later. The charge: manslaughter. The street stayed the same. Police <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/suspect-in-2-brooklyn-hit-and-run-homicides-facing-arraignment-saturday>said the car &ldquo;sped through a red light&rdquo; and never braked</a>. The men were trying to reach a food pantry. They never made it.</p><p>Since 2018, drivers have killed or seriously injured <strong>80 people on this two-mile stretch</strong>. The city promised a redesign. It never came. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>Assemblymember Marcela Mitaynes said</a>, &ldquo;We started talking about a plan in 2014 and it&rsquo;s now 2025. What is going on? There&rsquo;s been no conversation, no updates.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=the-toll-in-numbers>The Toll in Numbers</h3><p><strong>In the last 12 months, 11 people died and 1,944 were injured in SD 26.</strong> Eighteen suffered serious injuries. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. Cars and SUVs did the most harm, but trucks, bikes, and mopeds all left bodies broken. The disaster is slow, but it never stops.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>State Senator Andrew Gounardes has fought for speed cameras and for laws to stop repeat speeders. He <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>sponsored the bill</a> to force the worst drivers to install speed limiters. He voted yes. He <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/18/albany-reauthorizes-city-speed-camera-program-for-5-more-years>praised the renewal</a> of the city’s speed camera program: &ldquo;Speed cameras save lives and make our streets safer for everyone&mldr; At the end of the day, this is about keeping New Yorkers safe.&rdquo;</p><p>But the city’s promises to redesign deadly streets like Third Avenue have stalled. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>&ldquo;We wait until someone dies. We wait until a tragedy. We let this happen time and time again,&rdquo;</a> said Gounardes at the scene. The dead keep coming. The waiting goes on.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the city finish the job.</strong> Tell Senator Gounardes to keep pushing for speed limiters and real street redesigns. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice. It is time to choose life.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

They called for 'universal daylighting with hardened materials such as boulders, planters, and bike corrals' at intersections. The officials cited recent fatal crashes and urged the city to opt into a state law banning parking within 20 feet of corners. They want federal funds used for these changes. The group opposes DOT’s slow pace and reliance on paint, demanding physical barriers. Community board leaders and advocates support the move.

Joana Flores, MTA spokesperson, said it is more efficient for riders to transfer to the subway. Critics, including Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance, countered, "Bad traffic is not an excuse for not improving bus service, it’s an impetus for decongesting the street." Past proposals to extend the M22 or restore the B71 with a Manhattan extension were dismissed over cost and logistics. Advocates argue that buses move more people than cars and that congestion pricing should clear the way for better transit. The proposal remains stalled, leaving vulnerable riders waiting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, led by the Department of Transportation, aimed to create a protected bike lane from the Manhattan Bridge to Barclays Center. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso said, "New York City is regressing on meeting its Vision Zero goals ... and stalled street safety improvements, like those slated for Ashland Place, are a part of the reason why." State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Council Member Crystal Hudson joined the outcry, with Hudson lamenting the incomplete corridor for cyclists. The DOT confirmed the southernmost block would not be converted, following objections from developer Two Trees Management. Advocates cited 88 crashes and multiple injuries in two years, with the most dangerous block excluded from improvements. Residents and advocates rallied, accusing the mayor of prioritizing business over public safety. City Hall deflected, blaming e-bikes for rising cyclist deaths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He supports lowering speed limits and tougher penalties but stressed that enforcement is lacking. Senator Iwen Chu urged the NYC DOT to study the area for safety upgrades, stating, 'We must recognize that our streets need to be designed with safety in mind.' The DOT is reviewing the intersection.

Council Members Lincoln Restler, Alexa Aviles, Shahana Hanif, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, State Senator Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, and groups like Bike New York and Transportation Alternatives sent a letter demanding the bike lane’s return and physical barriers to stop illegal parking on pedestrian islands. The letter urges DOT to 'ensure curb lanes be preserved for safe cyclist passage' and to 'deploy quick-build physical elements' for pedestrian safety. DOT has not responded.

The bill required drivers with 15 speed-camera or five red-light tickets in a year to take a safety course or risk vehicle seizure. Council Member Shahana Hanif voiced disappointment, noting, 'We need to not only reauthorize this program, but strengthen it.' Despite over 34,000 drivers meeting the threshold in the last year, only about 1,200 took the course in three years. DOT has not explained the reporting delay or provided outcome data.
