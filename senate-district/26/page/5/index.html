Thirty-one people dead. Seventy-four left with serious injuries. Over 10,000 crashes since 2022. The dead do not get second chances. The injured carry scars that do not fade.</p><p>Just weeks ago, on June 21, a 22-year-old moped rider was killed at Third Avenue and 67th Street. His passenger was left with broken bones. The driver who hit them was drunk and unlicensed. Police said, &ldquo;Moreno was driving west on 67th Street while Mota was driving south on Third Avenue, and he hit her passenger-side door&rdquo; (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/woman-charged-with-driving-while-intoxicated-without-license-in-fatal-brooklyn-crash>Gothamist</a>). The victim&rsquo;s brother remembered him simply: &ldquo;He was a hardworking man. He had a lot of love for his family. He was always passionate about the things that he did&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>In February, a woman stepped out of a taxi on Flatbush Avenue. She was struck and killed before she could reach the curb. No arrests. No answers. Only another family left with a hole that will never close (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/boerum-hill-fatal-crash-woman-struck-killed-car-exiting-taxi-brooklyn-nyc/15966918/>ABC7</a>).</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p>The most vulnerable pay first: children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians. Cars and SUVs killed five. Trucks and buses killed two. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left dozens more injured. The street does not care who you are. It only cares how fast you move and how hard you hit.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Senator Andrew Gounardes has pushed for more speed cameras and tougher enforcement. He sponsored a bill to let the city use cameras to catch drivers who hide or alter their plates, and to keep cameras running near schools (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S7336>Open States</a>). He voted yes on redesigning streets for safety, not speed (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>Open States</a>). He praised the renewal of the speed camera program, calling it a &ldquo;safety boost&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>AMNY</a>).</p><p>But the blood keeps flowing. Speed cameras catch, but they do not stop the worst repeat offenders. Laws stall in Albany. The city drags its feet on lowering speed limits. The dead keep coming.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p>Call Senator Gounardes. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand action on repeat speeders. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The street remembers every body. Make sure your leaders do too.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Announced February 6, 2024, the bill would require transportation officials to align projects with the goal of fewer car trips. Gounardes said, "We fundamentally want to be shifting how we think about transportation infrastructure." The measure responds to data showing over 90 percent of infrastructure funds go to roads, not transit. Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance called for an "about-face," noting highway projects have torn apart poor communities and endangered pedestrians and cyclists. The bill sits before the state legislature.

The law would force highway projects to prove they cut driving, not fuel it.</p><p class=mb3>State Sen. Andrew Gounardes introduced a bill requiring New York to reduce vehicle miles traveled by 20 percent by 2050. The bill, modeled after Minnesota law, is not yet passed or assigned to a committee. It would amend the state’s climate law, forcing transportation officials to align highway projects with the goal of fewer car trips. Gounardes warns, 'If we’re just going to use that money to double down on the transportation of the past, on just purely automobile usage, we’re making a great mistake.' Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance says the bill is about shifting priorities to climate and equity. Advocates note that over 90 percent of recent infrastructure funds went to roads, not transit.

The report cites 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as contributing factors. The narrative describes the aftermath: 'Steel meets flesh. He falls. Blood pools on the pavement. Head split. Eyes open. The cab did not stop.' The victim suffered a severe head injury and was conscious at the scene. The police report makes clear the driver failed to yield to a pedestrian lawfully crossing, underscoring the persistent danger faced by New York City’s most vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The moped rider, a 20-year-old man, was unlicensed and wore no safety equipment. The report details that the rider was ejected and suffered crush injuries to his leg. The contributing factors listed include 'Traffic Control Disregarded' and 'Turning Improperly.' The SUV's left front bumper struck the moped's center front end.

If lawmakers fail to act, the city’s red-light cameras—now capped at 150 intersections—will shut off December 1, 2024. The matter, described as 'reauthorize and expand the city's red-light camera program,' is championed by Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz and Senate co-sponsor Andrew Gounardes. Dinowitz, the sponsor, urges expansion, stating, 'We should have red-light cameras on every intersection.' Gounardes expects a review and expansion. DOT data backs them: violations and rear-end crashes have dropped at camera sites. Residents like Amy Bettys call the cap dangerous. Advocacy groups support the bills, though they are not a top priority. Dinowitz stresses automated enforcement is vital with limited police. The bills await committee action.

The bill responds to a new report showing Sunset Park and Red Hook face the city's highest truck volumes—over 9,000 daily trips—linked to sprawling Amazon, FedEx, and UPS facilities. The report states, 'a quarter of residents across the Empire State live within half a mile of a distribution center that’s at least 50,000 square feet, disproportionately harming Black and Latino communities.' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, representing the affected Brooklyn neighborhoods, calls for urgent action 'for the sake of our climate and the safety of our streets.' Assembly Member Marcela Mitaynes, whose district sees the most daily truck traffic, urges colleagues to pass the Act. Advocates like Kevin Garcia say the bill is 'key legislation to protect frontline communities from increased vehicular traffic and tailpipe emissions.' The Act would require emissions reviews, pollution minimization, and studies of low-emission zones in hotspots.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill targeted drivers with 15 camera-issued speeding tickets in a year, but few took the mandated safety course and almost no vehicles were seized. The matter summary: 'The program launched with a simple idea of getting reckless drivers' vehicles off our streets, so it's incredibly frustrating and disappointing that we're in this situation,' said Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and Mayor Adams showed little urgency. Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi said, 'We will look to the advocacy world for support to go to the state and get better restrictions and better enforcement tools.' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes is pushing for speed governors and tougher laws, but state efforts have failed. The city’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users at risk.

The fight for fair transit continues.</p><p class=mb3>On October 23, 2023, Red Hook residents and advocates renewed calls for a direct bus route to Manhattan. The Red Hook Civic Association sent a letter urging the MTA to create a regular-fare bus through the Hugh Carey Tunnel. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes backed the push, saying, "The people of Red Hook really deserve this." The MTA rejected the idea, citing congestion in the tunnel and Lower Manhattan. Joana Flores, MTA spokesperson, said it is more efficient for riders to transfer to the subway. Critics, including Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance, countered, "Bad traffic is not an excuse for not improving bus service, it’s an impetus for decongesting the street." Past proposals to extend the M22 or restore the B71 with a Manhattan extension were dismissed over cost and logistics. Advocates argue that buses move more people than cars and that congestion pricing should clear the way for better transit. The proposal remains stalled, leaving vulnerable riders waiting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Eighty-eight crashes scar the street. Safety took a back seat.</p><p class=mb3>On October 13, 2023, local officials and advocates criticized Mayor Adams for halting the Ashland Place redesign. The project, led by the Department of Transportation, aimed to create a protected bike lane from the Manhattan Bridge to Barclays Center. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso said, "New York City is regressing on meeting its Vision Zero goals ... and stalled street safety improvements, like those slated for Ashland Place, are a part of the reason why." State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Council Member Crystal Hudson joined the outcry, with Hudson lamenting the incomplete corridor for cyclists. The DOT confirmed the southernmost block would not be converted, following objections from developer Two Trees Management. Advocates cited 88 crashes and multiple injuries in two years, with the most dangerous block excluded from improvements. Residents and advocates rallied, accusing the mayor of prioritizing business over public safety. City Hall deflected, blaming e-bikes for rising cyclist deaths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
