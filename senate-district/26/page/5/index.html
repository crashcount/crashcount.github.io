One was just 18. <strong>Over 1,600 were injured.</strong> Fourteen suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same again. These are not numbers. They are fathers, daughters, neighbors. They are the man who never made it home from work. The woman who never finished her walk.</p><p>On June 21, a moped rider, Joel Mota, was killed at Third Avenue and 67th Street. Police said the driver who hit him was drunk and unlicensed. Mota’s brother remembered him simply: <strong>“He was a hardworking man. He had a lot of love for his family.”</strong> <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>NY Daily News</a>.</p><h3 id=the-usual-weapons-cars-trucks-and-speed>The Usual Weapons: Cars, Trucks, and Speed</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs killed five. Trucks killed two.</strong> Bikes and mopeds left dozens more hurt. The numbers are blunt: <strong>Cars and trucks caused 641 pedestrian injuries and 5 deaths.</strong> Motorcycles and mopeds, 35 injuries. Bikes, 68 injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>The violence is not random. It is routine. It happens on wide avenues, at corners with broken sightlines, in the dark before dawn. The drivers who kill are often unlicensed, drunk, or speeding. The victims are almost always the ones on foot, on bikes, or riding home late.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—and What Hasn’t</h3><p>Senator Andrew Gounardes has pushed for more speed cameras and tougher laws. He sponsored a bill to let the city use cameras to catch drivers who hide or deface their plates, and to extend school-zone speed enforcement <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S7336>Open States</a>. He voted yes on redesigning streets for safety <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>Open States</a>. He called speed cameras “possibly the most important street safety law on the books” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/18/albany-reauthorizes-city-speed-camera-program-for-5-more-years>Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p><p>But the deaths keep coming. Cameras catch speeders, but the city still drags its feet on redesigning deadly streets. Laws pass, but loopholes remain. <strong>“Our elected officials in Albany have failed the livable streets movement again,”</strong> wrote one advocate after another session ended with little change <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/25/d-minus-the-annual-albany-report-card-for-2025>Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Senator Gounardes. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real street redesigns, not just more cameras. <strong>Every day of delay is another family broken.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Announced February 6, 2024, the bill would require transportation officials to align projects with the goal of fewer car trips. Gounardes said, "We fundamentally want to be shifting how we think about transportation infrastructure." The measure responds to data showing over 90 percent of infrastructure funds go to roads, not transit. Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance called for an "about-face," noting highway projects have torn apart poor communities and endangered pedestrians and cyclists. The bill sits before the state legislature. No direct safety analyst assessment, but advocates stress the law would shift funding from car-centric projects to transit and greenways, reducing systemic danger for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Andrew Gounardes introduced a bill requiring New York to reduce vehicle miles traveled by 20 percent by 2050. The bill, modeled after Minnesota law, is not yet passed or assigned to a committee. It would amend the state’s climate law, forcing transportation officials to align highway projects with the goal of fewer car trips. Gounardes warns, 'If we’re just going to use that money to double down on the transportation of the past, on just purely automobile usage, we’re making a great mistake.' Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance says the bill is about shifting priorities to climate and equity. Advocates note that over 90 percent of recent infrastructure funds went to roads, not transit. The measure would require revisions or offsets for projects that don’t cut driving. Gov. Hochul’s office declined comment. The bill aims to halt the cycle of road expansion, rising traffic, and mounting deaths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, representing the affected Brooklyn neighborhoods, calls for urgent action 'for the sake of our climate and the safety of our streets.' Assembly Member Marcela Mitaynes, whose district sees the most daily truck traffic, urges colleagues to pass the Act. Advocates like Kevin Garcia say the bill is 'key legislation to protect frontline communities from increased vehicular traffic and tailpipe emissions.'

The matter summary: 'The program launched with a simple idea of getting reckless drivers' vehicles off our streets, so it's incredibly frustrating and disappointing that we're in this situation,' said Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and Mayor Adams showed little urgency. Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi said, 'We will look to the advocacy world for support to go to the state and get better restrictions and better enforcement tools.' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes is pushing for speed governors and tougher laws, but state efforts have failed. The city’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users at risk.

The MTA says no. Residents wait. Cars clog the tunnel. Advocates demand space for buses, not excuses. The city’s working class and disabled riders are left stranded. The fight for fair transit continues.</p><p class=mb3>On October 23, 2023, Red Hook residents and advocates renewed calls for a direct bus route to Manhattan. The Red Hook Civic Association sent a letter urging the MTA to create a regular-fare bus through the Hugh Carey Tunnel. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes backed the push, saying, "The people of Red Hook really deserve this." The MTA rejected the idea, citing congestion in the tunnel and Lower Manhattan. Joana Flores, MTA spokesperson, said it is more efficient for riders to transfer to the subway. Critics, including Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance, countered, "Bad traffic is not an excuse for not improving bus service, it’s an impetus for decongesting the street." Past proposals to extend the M22 or restore the B71 with a Manhattan extension were dismissed over cost and logistics. Advocates argue that buses move more people than cars and that congestion pricing should clear the way for better transit. The proposal remains stalled, leaving vulnerable riders waiting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
