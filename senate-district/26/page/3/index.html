Thirty-one people dead. Seventy-four left with serious injuries. Over 10,000 crashes since 2022. The dead do not get second chances. The injured carry scars that do not fade.</p><p>Just weeks ago, on June 21, a 22-year-old moped rider was killed at Third Avenue and 67th Street. His passenger was left with broken bones. The driver who hit them was drunk and unlicensed. Police said, &ldquo;Moreno was driving west on 67th Street while Mota was driving south on Third Avenue, and he hit her passenger-side door&rdquo; (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/woman-charged-with-driving-while-intoxicated-without-license-in-fatal-brooklyn-crash>Gothamist</a>). The victim&rsquo;s brother remembered him simply: &ldquo;He was a hardworking man. He had a lot of love for his family. He was always passionate about the things that he did&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>In February, a woman stepped out of a taxi on Flatbush Avenue. She was struck and killed before she could reach the curb. No arrests. No answers. Only another family left with a hole that will never close (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/boerum-hill-fatal-crash-woman-struck-killed-car-exiting-taxi-brooklyn-nyc/15966918/>ABC7</a>).</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p>The most vulnerable pay first: children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians. Cars and SUVs killed five. Trucks and buses killed two. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left dozens more injured. The street does not care who you are. It only cares how fast you move and how hard you hit.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Senator Andrew Gounardes has pushed for more speed cameras and tougher enforcement. He sponsored a bill to let the city use cameras to catch drivers who hide or alter their plates, and to keep cameras running near schools (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S7336>Open States</a>). He voted yes on redesigning streets for safety, not speed (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>Open States</a>). He praised the renewal of the speed camera program, calling it a &ldquo;safety boost&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>AMNY</a>).</p><p>But the blood keeps flowing. Speed cameras catch, but they do not stop the worst repeat offenders. Laws stall in Albany. The city drags its feet on lowering speed limits. The dead keep coming.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p>Call Senator Gounardes. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand action on repeat speeders. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The street remembers every body. Make sure your leaders do too.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The new proposal drops the peak toll from $15 to $9. The plan’s status is pending, with urgency to implement before a new presidential administration. Gounardes stressed, “It’s more important than ever that we start congestion pricing immediately, before Trump can block it.” The bill aims to fund the MTA’s 2020-2024 capital plan, but economist Charles Komanoff warns, “You don’t get the immediate traffic speed gain that a $15 toll would give.” The measure is meant to reduce traffic and improve transit, but the lower toll means less impact. The MTA has already paused $16 billion in work. The focus is on starting the program, but advocates note the diluted toll will not deliver the same safety and quality-of-life gains for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The $9 version, previously reviewed in environmental assessments, may lack those protections. Economist Charles Komanoff warns, 'You lose other benefits. Most noticeably, you don’t get the immediate traffic speed gain that a $15 toll would give.' State Senator Andrew Gounardes urges swift action, saying, 'The time to commit to better public transit, less traffic and cleaner air is now.' The lower toll is projected to improve traffic speeds by only 6.4 percent, far less than the 17 percent expected from the original plan. With less traffic reduction, streets remain dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, discussed in Streetsblog, quotes Adams: “Each Council member is going to have to weigh in on how they feel it should be enacted or should not be enacted in their district.” Adams hesitated to commit to a citywide 20 mph limit, instead suggesting community-by-community decisions. Eric McClure of StreetsPAC called this approach “chaotic and dangerous,” pushing for a uniform 20 mph limit to save lives. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives urged a comprehensive, data-driven plan. State Senator Andrew Gounardes and Brad Hoylman-Sigal pressed the Council to use its new powers. The Department of Transportation clarified its limited authority. The Council’s delay leaves vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states the pedestrian was 'crossing without a signal.' The truck, described as a 2018 KW-TRUCK/BUS, showed 'no damage' after the crash. The victim suffered fatal injuries to her entire body and was pronounced dead at the scene. Police list the contributing factors as 'Unspecified' for both the driver and the pedestrian. The report notes the truck's point of impact was the 'right front quarter panel.' The narrative describes the moment as one where 'her body bore the weight of steel, silence, and final breath.' No driver errors are explicitly cited in the data, and no victim behaviors are listed as contributing factors beyond the absence of a crossing signal.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The vehicle struck a 56-year-old cyclist, who was ejected and landed hard on the street. The cyclist suffered a head injury with severe bleeding and remained conscious on the pavement. The police report lists 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as the contributing factor for the crash. The SUV's right front bumper was the point of impact. The narrative states, 'A northbound SUV turned. A cyclist, 56, struck the bumper, thrown hard to the street. No helmet. Head bleeding. Conscious. The pavement held him. The driver stayed.' The driver’s failure to yield directly led to the collision and injury. The report notes the cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this is mentioned after the driver’s error.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Introduced June 20, 2024, it urges Albany to pass S.2447/A.5234. The measure’s title: 'increase the penalties for purposefully obstructed license plates.' Council Members Justin L. Brannan (primary sponsor, District 47) and Robert F. Holden (co-sponsor, District 30) lead the push. The bill targets drivers who cover or deface plates to evade speed, red-light, and bus-lane cameras. Data shows unreadable plates rose from 3.98% to 4.66% in one year. The city lost up to $38.7 million in unissued tickets between 2019 and 2022. The resolution calls for higher fines, confiscation of plate coverings, and registration suspensions. Lawmakers say this crackdown is needed to keep dangerous drivers from slipping through the cracks and to make streets safer for everyone.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2024, the New York State legislative session ended without passing a replacement funding plan for the MTA after Governor Kathy Hochul paused congestion pricing. The matter, described as 'Albany pumps the brakes on MTA funding plan in rebuke of Hochul’s move to ditch congestion pricing,' left the MTA without the $1 billion annual revenue congestion pricing would have provided. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins announced the session’s close without a deal. Lawmakers including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris, State Sen. John Liu, Assemblyman Harvey Epstein, and Assemblyman Tony Simone criticized the governor’s decision and the proposed IOU bailout. Gounardes said, 'I cannot in good conscience ratify a decision that will eliminate a significant, dedicated revenue source for the MTA’s capital plan.' The pause leaves the city’s transit future—and the safety of those who rely on it—uncertain.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
