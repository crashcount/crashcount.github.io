He slammed weak laws. Tickets pile up, but drivers dodge real punishment. Gonzalez backed a bill for speed limiters on chronic offenders. He demanded action to stop reckless driving and protect lives.</p><p class=mb3>On April 16, 2025, Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez issued a forceful statement after indicting Miriam Yarimi, a repeat speeder, for killing three family members in Brooklyn. Gonzalez criticized New York’s laws, saying, 'The law is very restrictive in allowing district attorney’s to pursue murder charges in these types of cases.' He noted Yarimi’s 21 speeding and five red-light tickets did not trigger license points or insurance penalties. Gonzalez questioned why the NYPD cannot seize cars based on repeated violations and called for legislative change. He endorsed State Sen. Andrew Gounardes’s bill (S7621), which would require speed limiter technology for drivers with six or more automated enforcement tickets in a year, describing it as a way to fight 'violent car culture.' Gonzalez urged lawmakers to make it easier to prosecute and prevent reckless driving, centering the deadly risk to families and vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled 'Relates to the use of certain photo speed violation monitoring systems for the purposes of enforcement of license plate obstruction; repealer,' lets cameras catch drivers who hide or alter plates and extends speed camera use in school zones. Senator Andrew Gounardes leads, joined by Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Luis R. Sepúlveda. The bill’s focus: more enforcement, less evasion.

DOT delays a promised bike lane. Elected officials and residents demand action. Private interests block progress. Cyclists face crashes and fear. The city shrugs. The gap remains. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On April 3, 2025, a coalition of Brooklyn officials—including Council Members Crystal Hudson, Shahana Hanif, Lincoln Restler, Assembly Members Andrew Gounardes, Jo Anne Simon, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, and Borough President Antonio Reynoso—sent a letter urging DOT to finish the protected bike lane on Ashland Place. The letter called the block a 'missing link in Brooklyn’s protected bike lane network.' Brooklyn Community Board 2 backed the demand. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and Borough Commissioner Keith Bray offered only vague replies. The block’s exclusion traces to a mayoral advisor’s intervention for developer Two Trees. Advocates like Kathy Park Price slammed the city: 'Private interests are able to redesign our streets, prioritizing vehicles over safety at a critical corridor.' Despite unanimous support, DOT keeps the street dangerous. The city’s inaction leaves cyclists exposed and the community frustrated.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The e-bike showed no visible damage. The victim’s action—crossing with the signal—is noted in the report, but the primary focus remains on the rider’s speed, improper lane usage, and lack of a valid license. The crash underscores the dangers posed by reckless operation and systemic failures to control unlicensed riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

One sedan was making a U-turn while the other was traveling straight north. The report identifies 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as contributing factors to the crash. A 55-year-old female passenger suffered a head injury with significant bleeding but remained conscious. Additional occupants, including a 31-year-old female driver and two passengers aged 9 and 15, sustained neck injuries consistent with whiplash. The report emphasizes that driver errors—specifically unsafe speed and failure to obey traffic controls—were central to the collision and resulting injuries. No victim behaviors were cited as contributing factors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The plan charges $9 for cars and $14.40 for trucks entering Manhattan below 60th Street. amNew York Metro polled nearly 3,000 residents: 53.8% support, 44.9% oppose. The matter, titled 'Here’s how New Yorkers really feel about congestion pricing,' reveals sharp divides. Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30, Queens) condemned the move, calling it a 'blatant political move and a shameless betrayal of New Yorkers.' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes backed the plan, citing needed transit upgrades. The bill’s impact on vulnerable road users was not assessed. The debate centers on funding transit versus burdening drivers. The city stands at a crossroads.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
