Two men, Kex Un Chen, 80, and Faqiu Lin, 59, were crossing with the signal. The car did not brake. Both men died in the street. The driver fled. He was caught later, charged with manslaughter and homicide. They were on their way to a food pantry. The line there is always long. The dead do not eat.</p><p>Since 2018, drivers have killed or seriously injured <strong>80 people on this two-mile stretch</strong>. The city’s answer: a sign that says &ldquo;be careful.&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/sunset-park-residents-call-for-improvements-on-a-deadly-stretch-of-third-avenue>&ldquo;We should all be offended. Angry. Insulted. That the response from our city to two deaths blocks away from here is a sign that says: &lsquo;be careful,&rsquo;&rdquo;</a> said State Senator Andrew Gounardes.</p><h2 id=the-toll-keeps-rising>The Toll Keeps Rising</h2><p>In the last twelve months, SD 26 saw <strong>11 deaths and 19 serious injuries</strong>. Most were pedestrians or cyclists. The old, the young, the ones just trying to get by. Cars and SUVs did most of the killing—<strong>8 deaths, 19 serious injuries</strong>—but trucks, buses, bikes, and mopeds all took their share. The numbers do not stop. They only climb.</p><h2 id=promises-delays-and-the-fight-for-change>Promises, Delays, and the Fight for Change</h2><p>The city promised a redesign for Third Avenue. The plan is stalled. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>&ldquo;We started talking about a plan in 2014 and it&rsquo;s now 2025. What is going on?&rdquo;</a> asked Assemblymember Marcela Mitaynes. Gounardes stood with families and called for action: <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/advocates-slam-third-avenue-safety-delay/>&ldquo;This is not meant to be a highway. This is where people walk. This is where people live. This is where kids go to school.&rdquo;</a></p><p>Senator Gounardes has pushed for speed cameras and for the Stop Super Speeders Act. He votes for bills that target repeat offenders. He shows up at vigils. But the deaths keep coming. The street stays the same.</p><p><strong>No more waiting.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the city finish the job. <strong>Redesign Third Avenue. Lower the speed. Stop the killing.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, stalled for years in Albany, gained urgency after a fatal Brooklyn crash on April 1, 2025. Gallagher, joined by State Senator Andrew Gounardes and city Comptroller Brad Lander, rallied at Borough Hall, urging swift passage. The bill targets drivers with 11 or more license points in 24 months, or six camera violations in a year. Gallagher said, 'A lot of what happens when it comes to getting a bill to the top of the list is really through a movement and folks fighting for the bill.' Gounardes added, 'It’s no longer simply enough to shake our heads in despair when these preventable tragedies occur—it’s time for us to act.' The legislation mirrors past efforts like the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Act, aiming to hold reckless drivers accountable and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

One sedan was making a U-turn while the other was traveling straight north. The report identifies 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as contributing factors to the crash. A 55-year-old female passenger suffered a head injury with significant bleeding but remained conscious. Additional occupants, including a 31-year-old female driver and two passengers aged 9 and 15, sustained neck injuries consistent with whiplash. The report emphasizes that driver errors—specifically unsafe speed and failure to obey traffic controls—were central to the collision and resulting injuries. No victim behaviors were cited as contributing factors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The plan charges $9 for cars and $14.40 for trucks entering Manhattan below 60th Street. amNew York Metro polled nearly 3,000 residents: 53.8% support, 44.9% oppose. The matter, titled 'Here’s how New Yorkers really feel about congestion pricing,' reveals sharp divides. Council Member Robert F. Holden (District 30, Queens) condemned the move, calling it a 'blatant political move and a shameless betrayal of New Yorkers.' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes backed the plan, citing needed transit upgrades. The bill’s impact on vulnerable road users was not assessed. The debate centers on funding transit versus burdening drivers. The city stands at a crossroads.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Parks Committee and full board both voted unanimously for the $30 million overhaul, which includes $20.97 million for the Shore Road Promenade and $9.25 million for Leif Ericson Park. The project, described as 'Destination: Greenways!', will expand green space, separate bike and pedestrian lanes, add lighting, and install new amenities. Brannan, a key funder and supporter, said, 'Our local parks are the lungs of our city.' The overhaul aims to improve recreational cycling, repair pothole-ridden paths, and increase accessibility. Board members raised concerns about safety and sanitation, which the Parks Department pledged to address in final designs.

The incident occurred at 9:49 a.m. The narrative states, 'A 65-year-old man lay still in the road. A southbound box truck passed. No screech, no crash, no damage. Just the crack of bone. The shoulder gave. Then silence.' The police report lists the pedestrian's location as 'not at intersection' and his action as 'other actions in roadway.' Both contributing factors for the pedestrian are marked as 'Unspecified.' The box truck, registered in Illinois and operated by a licensed driver from Pennsylvania, was reportedly 'avoiding object in roadway' before the crash. Despite the lack of visible vehicle damage, the impact proved fatal. The report does not cite any specific driver errors or victim behaviors as contributing factors, but the outcome underscores the lethal risk faced by pedestrians outside intersections in the presence of large vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The new proposal drops the peak toll from $15 to $9. The plan’s status is pending, with urgency to implement before a new presidential administration. Gounardes stressed, “It’s more important than ever that we start congestion pricing immediately, before Trump can block it.” The bill aims to fund the MTA’s 2020-2024 capital plan, but economist Charles Komanoff warns, “You don’t get the immediate traffic speed gain that a $15 toll would give.” The measure is meant to reduce traffic and improve transit, but the lower toll means less impact. The MTA has already paused $16 billion in work. The focus is on starting the program, but advocates note the diluted toll will not deliver the same safety and quality-of-life gains for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

"The time to commit to better public transit, less traffic and cleaner air is now."" -- Andrew Gounardes</p><p class=mb3>On November 8, 2024, Governor Hochul proposed lowering New York City’s congestion pricing toll from $15 to $9. The plan, a policy proposal to adjust congestion pricing, comes as officials rush to implement it before a new presidential administration can intervene. The original $15 toll, crafted by the Traffic Mobility Review Board and approved by the MTA Board, promised strong traffic reduction and included credits and caps. The $9 version, previously reviewed in environmental assessments, may lack those protections. Economist Charles Komanoff warns, 'You lose other benefits. Most noticeably, you don’t get the immediate traffic speed gain that a $15 toll would give.' State Senator Andrew Gounardes urges swift action, saying, 'The time to commit to better public transit, less traffic and cleaner air is now.' The lower toll is projected to improve traffic speeds by only 6.4 percent, far less than the 17 percent expected from the original plan. With less traffic reduction, streets remain dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
