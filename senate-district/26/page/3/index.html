Seventy-four seriously injured. Over 5,300 hurt.</strong> These are not just numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. They are the man who never made it home, the woman who stepped out of a taxi and never saw the next sunrise.</p><p><strong>Just weeks ago, on June 21, Joel Mota, 22, died on Third Avenue in Bay Ridge.</strong> His brother remembered him as &ldquo;a hardworking man. He had a lot of love for his family. He was always passionate about the things that he did&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>NY Daily News</a>. Mota’s passenger left with broken bones. The driver who struck them was drunk and unlicensed. She was arrested, then released. The street remains the same.</p><p><strong>In February, a woman was killed exiting a taxi on Flatbush Avenue.</strong> Both drivers stayed. The city moved on. &ldquo;First responders transported the victim to New York-Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital, where she was pronounced dead&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/boerum-hill-fatal-crash-woman-struck-killed-car-exiting-taxi-brooklyn-nyc/15966918/>ABC7</a>.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>The most vulnerable pay most.</strong> In the last year, children under 18 suffered 123 injuries. People over 65, 106 injuries and 3 deaths. Cars and SUVs did most of the harm—<strong>five deaths, 429 minor injuries, 190 moderate, 18 serious</strong>. Trucks and buses killed two. Bikes and mopeds left dozens more hurt. The street is a gauntlet.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Senator Andrew Gounardes has pushed for speed cameras and tougher enforcement. He sponsored a bill to let the city use cameras to catch drivers who hide their plates and speed near schools <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S7336>sponsored a bill</a>. He voted yes on a bill to redesign streets for all users <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>voted yes</a>. He backed the renewal of the city’s speed camera program, which has cut speeds and injuries where installed <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/nyc-speed-camera-program-extension-hochul/>backed the renewal</a>. But the pace is slow. The deaths keep coming.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Senator Gounardes. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real street redesigns, not just promises. <strong>Every day of delay is another family broken.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
