On July 11, a BMW tore through the crosswalk at Third Avenue and 52nd Street in Sunset Park. Kex Un Chen, 80, and Faqiu Lin, 59, were walking to a food pantry. The car did not brake. The bodies landed hard. The driver fled. Police found him later and charged him with manslaughter and leaving the scene. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-brooklyn-deadly-hit-and-run/>Councilmember Alexa Avilés said she was &ldquo;saddened and angered at the tragic and senseless killing of two individuals earlier this morning. Instances like this remind us of why Third Avenue needs serious investments in safety enhancements from both the state and the city.&rdquo;</a></p><p>This was not a surprise. Since City Hall paused a safety redesign for Third Avenue, 96 crashes have injured 80 people. The city knew this stretch was deadly. The community knew. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/11/hit-and-run-driver-kills-two-pedestrians-on-third-ave-corridor-eric-adams-refuses-to-make-safer>Julio Peña said, &ldquo;It was only a matter of time before somebody else died on this corridor and here we are. Every death is preventable, and once again we are in a place of frustration where we have this incredibly dangerous corridor and the city just refusin&mldr;&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=the-slow-disaster>The Slow Disaster</h3><p>In the last year, SD 26 saw 3 killed, 9 seriously hurt, and 996 injured in 1,844 crashes. Most victims were walking or cycling. Cars and SUVs did the most harm, but trucks, bikes, and mopeds all left bodies behind. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors. They are gone.</p><h3 id=what-has-senator-gounardes-done>What Has Senator Gounardes Done?</h3><p>Senator Andrew Gounardes has pushed for safety. He sponsored the bill to expand speed camera enforcement and close loopholes for drivers who hide their plates. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/18/albany-reauthorizes-city-speed-camera-program-for-5-more-years>He said, &ldquo;The verdict came in a long time ago: speed cameras save lives and make our streets safer for everyone&mldr; At the end of the day, this is about keeping New Yorkers safe. I&rsquo;m proud to have fought for this program from the beginning, and to renew it now for five years.&rdquo;</a> He voted yes on complete street design. He has backed bills to cut driving and force repeat speeders to slow down. But the carnage continues. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so.</p><h3 id=what-next-demand-more>What Next? Demand More</h3><p>Every crash is preventable. Call Senator Gounardes. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real redesigns for deadly corridors. Demand action before another neighbor dies.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The intersection, despite a history of crashes, has not been redesigned. No charges were filed against the driver, even though evidence suggested a failure to yield. Days earlier, Monica Chen, a pedestrian, was killed by a turning driver in Bay Ridge. Again, no charges. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and City Council Member Justin Brannan expressed outrage, stating, "We are both outraged that the epidemic of traffic violence continues and as a result, a 67 year old woman is dead." They pledged to press the Department of Transportation for more safety measures. The NYPD declined comment. The Bronx faces a surge in road deaths. Vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill's summary states it aims to 'educate drivers about the dangers faced by cyclists and pedestrians and will create a thoughtful road culture going forward.' Gounardes sponsored the bill, which takes effect in January. Until now, the driver's manual offered only a single page on sharing the road. The law directs the state to consult law enforcement, advocates, and medical experts to shape the curriculum.

The matter summary states: 'The law addresses a longstanding gap in driver education, which had previously left generations of motorists with little awareness of road-sharing with pedestrians and cyclists.' Gov. Hochul said, 'It is common sense to make pedestrian and bike safety education mandatory for drivers.' Gounardes noted that driver instruction had not kept pace with the growing presence of cyclists and micro-mobility users. In 2021, driver inexperience contributed to over 2,500 injury crashes in NYC.

Gounardes said, 'If you drive recklessly, you are going to be held accountable.' He stressed the lack of accountability and financial compensation for victims’ families. The bill is limited to drunk drivers for now, but Gounardes hopes to expand it to all reckless drivers who kill. Few drivers are convicted under these charges in New York City.

Glick, who sponsored the bill, dismissed criticism that cameras are a cash grab, saying, 'The city isn't in the car with you... If you don't want to get a ticket, don't speed.' Mayor Eric Adams called the cameras a deterrent, not a punishment. Advocates say the law will slow cars and protect pedestrians, especially children.

The bill was weakened from its original form, dropping escalating fines and stricter penalties for repeat offenders due to City Council concerns.

Lawmakers extended and expanded New York City’s school-zone speed camera program to operate 24/7 for three more years. The bill passed, but was watered down from its original form. Other key street safety bills, including 'Sammy’s Law'—which would let NYC set its own speed limits—did not advance. Senator Andrew Gounardes called the speed camera win 'monumental,' while Senator Brad Hoylman said, 'not as much as any of us would have wanted to see, but for the first time, speed cameras are normalized.' Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives voiced disappointment over the failure of Sammy’s Law, calling it a top priority for Families for Safe Streets. Several other bills to protect pedestrians and cyclists stalled or died in committee. The session brought some progress, but left many dangers unaddressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lawmakers extended New York City's school-zone speed camera program for three years, allowing 24/7 operation—a win for street safety. The bill, however, was watered down. Other measures under the 'Crash Victims Rights and Safety Act' saw mixed results: some passed, like upstate towns setting 25 mph speed limits and increased complete streets funding; others, like 'Sammy's Law' for NYC speed limits and expanded safe passing for cyclists, stalled. The matter title called the session 'historic, yet deeply disappointing.' Adams was not a sponsor but was referenced in the debate. Advocates and senators voiced frustration at the lack of progress on local speed limit control and measures against repeat reckless drivers. The session left vulnerable road users without key protections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Expansion aims to cut deadly crashes citywide.</p><p class=mb3>On May 31, 2022, the State Senate approved a bill to extend and expand New York City's speed camera program. The measure passed 51-12 and now moves to the Assembly. The bill allows cameras to operate 24/7 in nearly 2,000 locations across 750 school zones until July 1, 2025. The matter summary states, 'The proposal to extend New York City's speed camera program for another three years and expand it to run every day and around the clock easily passed.' Senator Andrew Gounardes sponsored the bill, saying, 'We are going to see a marked reduction in traffic violence on our streets at a time when traffic deaths are at their highest in a decade.' Simcha Felder, Democrat from District 44, voted against. The expansion targets off-hours, which account for 59% of traffic deaths. Speeding dropped 72% and deaths fell 55% where cameras operated. The city pushed for this as fatalities rose under Mayor Adams. Some penalties for repeat speeders were removed during negotiations.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Robert Jackson and Gounardes defending it: 'Cars speeding in New York kill New Yorkers, injure New Yorkers.' Gounardes called the cameras 'life-saving.' Opponents, including Sen. Andrew Lanza, dismissed the program as a 'cash register.' Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives said, 'When New York City’s speed safety cameras turn off, speeding increases and crashes rise.'
