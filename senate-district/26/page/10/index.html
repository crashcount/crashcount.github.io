In the last twelve months, seven people died and 1,613 were injured in crashes across Senate District 26. Fourteen of those injuries were severe. The dead include a 22-year-old moped rider, struck before sunrise at Third Avenue and 67th Street. His name was Joel Mota. He lived less than half a mile from where he died. His brother remembered him simply: “He was a hardworking man. He had a lot of love for his family. He was always passionate about the things that he did.” (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>Unlicensed, drunk, and behind the wheel—the driver who killed him was arrested at the scene. The passenger on the moped left with broken bones. The street stayed quiet after the sirens faded (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/woman-charged-with-driving-while-intoxicated-without-license-in-fatal-brooklyn-crash>Gothamist</a>).</p><h3 id=the-numbers-a-relentless-drumbeat>The Numbers: A Relentless Drumbeat</h3><p>In SD 26, cars and trucks did most of the damage. Five killed, 634 injured by sedans and SUVs. Trucks took two more lives. Motorcycles and mopeds left dozens more hurt. Bikes, too, are not spared—43 minor injuries, 22 moderate, three serious. The numbers do not lie. They do not comfort.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Senator Andrew Gounardes has pushed for more speed cameras, voting to expand and renew the city’s program. He called them “lifesaving” and said they “make our streets safer for everyone” (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/18/albany-reauthorizes-city-speed-camera-program-for-5-more-years>Streetsblog NYC</a>).

The most dangerous drivers keep their keys. The city can set a 20 mph speed limit now. It has not.</p><h3 id=the-call-demand-more-than-words>The Call: Demand More Than Words</h3><p>Every crash is preventable. Every death is a choice made by leaders who delay. Call your council member.

Vulnerable lives get a fighting chance.</p><p class=mb3>On August 1, 2022, a new law took effect expanding New York City’s speed camera program to operate 24/7. The bill, sponsored in the State Senate by Andrew Gounardes, passed in Albany and was signed by Governor Hochul in June. The measure extends the program for three years and ends the old rule that shut cameras off overnight and on weekends. The Department of Transportation has installed about 2,000 cameras in 750 school zones. The bill’s summary: 'expands the safety technology around the clock.' Gounardes said, 'Your right to speed does not supersede anyone’s rights to live on the streets safely.' Mayor Eric Adams joined advocates to celebrate, stating, 'A city that never sleeps deserves a camera system that won’t take a nap.' DOT data shows 59% of traffic deaths happened during off hours. The expansion aims to close that deadly gap.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The intersection, despite a history of crashes, has not been redesigned. No charges were filed against the driver, even though evidence suggested a failure to yield. Days earlier, Monica Chen, a pedestrian, was killed by a turning driver in Bay Ridge. Again, no charges. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and City Council Member Justin Brannan expressed outrage, stating, "We are both outraged that the epidemic of traffic violence continues and as a result, a 67 year old woman is dead." They pledged to press the Department of Transportation for more safety measures. The NYPD declined comment. The Bronx faces a surge in road deaths. Vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Gounardes sponsored the bill, which takes effect in January. Until now, the driver's manual offered only a single page on sharing the road. The law directs the state to consult law enforcement, advocates, and medical experts to shape the curriculum.

The bill, led by Assemblymember Emily Gallagher and Senator Andrew Gounardes, updates the five-hour pre-licensing course and driver's manual. The matter summary states: 'The law addresses a longstanding gap in driver education, which had previously left generations of motorists with little awareness of road-sharing with pedestrians and cyclists.' Gov. Hochul said, 'It is common sense to make pedestrian and bike safety education mandatory for drivers.' Gounardes noted that driver instruction had not kept pace with the growing presence of cyclists and micro-mobility users. In 2021, driver inexperience contributed to over 2,500 injury crashes in NYC.

The fight for safer streets continues.</p><p class=mb3>The 2022 New York State legislative session reviewed transportation and street safety policy, with Council Member Adrienne Adams (District 28) mentioned in coverage. Lawmakers extended New York City's school-zone speed camera program for three years, allowing 24/7 operation—a win for street safety. The bill, however, was watered down. Other measures under the 'Crash Victims Rights and Safety Act' saw mixed results: some passed, like upstate towns setting 25 mph speed limits and increased complete streets funding; others, like 'Sammy's Law' for NYC speed limits and expanded safe passing for cyclists, stalled. The matter title called the session 'historic, yet deeply disappointing.' Adams was not a sponsor but was referenced in the debate. Advocates and senators voiced frustration at the lack of progress on local speed limit control and measures against repeat reckless drivers. The session left vulnerable road users without key protections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Expansion aims to cut deadly crashes citywide.</p><p class=mb3>On May 31, 2022, the State Senate approved a bill to extend and expand New York City's speed camera program. The measure passed 51-12 and now moves to the Assembly. The bill allows cameras to operate 24/7 in nearly 2,000 locations across 750 school zones until July 1, 2025. The matter summary states, 'The proposal to extend New York City's speed camera program for another three years and expand it to run every day and around the clock easily passed.' Senator Andrew Gounardes sponsored the bill, saying, 'We are going to see a marked reduction in traffic violence on our streets at a time when traffic deaths are at their highest in a decade.' Simcha Felder, Democrat from District 44, voted against. The expansion targets off-hours, which account for 59% of traffic deaths. Speeding dropped 72% and deaths fell 55% where cameras operated. The city pushed for this as fatalities rose under Mayor Adams. Some penalties for repeat speeders were removed during negotiations.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Robert Jackson and Gounardes defending it: 'Cars speeding in New York kill New Yorkers, injure New Yorkers.' Gounardes called the cameras 'life-saving.' Opponents, including Sen. Andrew Lanza, dismissed the program as a 'cash register.' Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives said, 'When New York City’s speed safety cameras turn off, speeding increases and crashes rise.'
