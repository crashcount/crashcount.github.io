The corridor has a record of high-speed harm. After another deadly hit-and-run, local officials and neighbors begged City Hall to stop delaying a DOT safety plan for Third Avenue. “This is not meant to be a highway. This is where people walk.

Gounardes urged the governor to include MTA funding in the initial budget. Gallagher criticized the gas tax holiday, urging funds go to transit.

Restler, who once failed to ride the stretch without leaving the lane due to illegal parking, called the redesign 'real safety in downtown Brooklyn.'

Council members and advocates, including Elizabeth Adams and Jehiah Czebotar, backed the move.
