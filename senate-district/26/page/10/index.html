Two men, Kex Un Chen, 80, and Faqiu Lin, 59, were crossing with the signal. The car did not brake. Both men died in the street. The driver fled. He was caught later, charged with manslaughter and homicide. They were on their way to a food pantry. The line there is always long. The dead do not eat.</p><p>Since 2018, drivers have killed or seriously injured <strong>80 people on this two-mile stretch</strong>. The city’s answer: a sign that says &ldquo;be careful.&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/sunset-park-residents-call-for-improvements-on-a-deadly-stretch-of-third-avenue>&ldquo;We should all be offended. Angry. Insulted. That the response from our city to two deaths blocks away from here is a sign that says: &lsquo;be careful,&rsquo;&rdquo;</a> said State Senator Andrew Gounardes.</p><h2 id=the-toll-keeps-rising>The Toll Keeps Rising</h2><p>In the last twelve months, SD 26 saw <strong>11 deaths and 19 serious injuries</strong>. Most were pedestrians or cyclists. The old, the young, the ones just trying to get by. Cars and SUVs did most of the killing—<strong>8 deaths, 19 serious injuries</strong>—but trucks, buses, bikes, and mopeds all took their share. The numbers do not stop. They only climb.</p><h2 id=promises-delays-and-the-fight-for-change>Promises, Delays, and the Fight for Change</h2><p>The city promised a redesign for Third Avenue. The plan is stalled. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>&ldquo;We started talking about a plan in 2014 and it&rsquo;s now 2025. What is going on?&rdquo;</a> asked Assemblymember Marcela Mitaynes. Gounardes stood with families and called for action: <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/advocates-slam-third-avenue-safety-delay/>&ldquo;This is not meant to be a highway. This is where people walk. This is where people live. This is where kids go to school.&rdquo;</a></p><p>Senator Gounardes has pushed for speed cameras and for the Stop Super Speeders Act. He votes for bills that target repeat offenders. He shows up at vigils. But the deaths keep coming. The street stays the same.</p><p><strong>No more waiting.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand the city finish the job. <strong>Redesign Third Avenue. Lower the speed. Stop the killing.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The request follows complaints after Schermerhorn Street’s redesign, which added a protected bike lane but made all crossings one-way southbound, causing gridlock and blocking access for services. The Community Board’s Transportation and Public Safety Committee, chaired by Sid Meyer, voted to support the change and insisted DOT maintain and protect the Bond Street bike lane with a physical barrier. Restler said, 'We believe that this proposal will improve traffic flow and enhance the public’s access to essential services, deliveries, and residences.' DOT is reviewing the proposal. The matter centers on the impact of traffic changes on residents and the need to safeguard vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, championed by Councilmember Lincoln Restler, followed years of complaints about blocked, unprotected lanes and frequent crashes. The matter, described as a 'complete transformation of the look and feel of the corridor,' converted Schermerhorn from a chaotic two-way street to a one-way with parking-protected bike lanes. Restler, who once failed to ride the stretch without leaving the lane due to illegal parking, called the redesign 'real safety in downtown Brooklyn.' DOT data shows 29 cyclists injured and one killed on this stretch since 2012.

Gounardes said, 'Your right to speed does not supersede anyone’s rights to live on the streets safely.' Mayor Eric Adams joined advocates to celebrate, stating, 'A city that never sleeps deserves a camera system that won’t take a nap.' DOT data shows 59% of traffic deaths happened during off hours.
