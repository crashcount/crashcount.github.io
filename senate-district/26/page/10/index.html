A mother holds her child&rsquo;s hand. A cyclist waits for the light. In Senate District 26, these moments end in sirens too often. <strong>In the last twelve months, 7 people died and 1,627 were injured in 2,955 crashes.</strong> Fourteen were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. The old, the young, the ones just passing through. The street does not care.</p><p><strong>Now the toll is higher.</strong> Since 2022, there have been 10,369 crashes. Five thousand, two hundred sixteen people hurt. Thirty dead. The numbers rise. The sirens do not stop. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>See the data</a>.</p><p>The old are not spared. Five people over 75 are dead. Eight between 65 and 74. Children are hurt—391 under 18, their lives changed in an instant. The street does not care about age.</p><p>A woman steps from a taxi on Flatbush Avenue. She does not make it across. The drivers stay. The tape goes up. The street is closed. The story is over for her. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/boerum-hill-fatal-crash-woman-struck-killed-car-exiting-taxi-brooklyn-nyc/15966918/>Report details</a>.</p><p>Cars and SUVs killed 5, left 188 with broken bones or worse, and battered 210 more. Trucks and buses killed 2, hurt dozens. Bikes and mopeds, too, left their mark, but the steel and speed of cars do most of the damage.</p><h3 id=leadership-in-the-crosshairs>Leadership in the Crosshairs</h3><p>Senator Andrew Gounardes has not stood silent. He backed the <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/stop-super-speeders-bill-advances-in-senate-committee>Stop Super Speeders bill</a>, which would force the worst repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no longer simply enough to shake our heads in despair when these preventable tragedies occur—it&rsquo;s time for us to act,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-lawmakers-push-super-speeder-bill-after-brooklyn-crash-kills-mom-2-kids>said Gounardes</a> after a driver with a suspended license and dozens of violations killed a mother and her two daughters in Brooklyn. He also sponsored a bill to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S7336>expand speed camera enforcement</a>, closing loopholes for drivers who hide their plates.</p><p>But the carnage continues. Each new name added to the list is a measure of delay. As one advocate put it, &ldquo;I definitely believe these super speeders really, they&rsquo;re criminals. They should not be allowed to drive, they really shouldn&rsquo;t. I think [the city] is being nice.&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-lawmakers-push-super-speeder-bill-after-brooklyn-crash-kills-mom-2-kids>said the advocate</a>.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>The disaster is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day without action is another day of blood on the street. Call Senator Gounardes. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras that never go dark. Demand streets where a child can cross without fear.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong> <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The proposal, announced July 8, 2022, mirrors a Tennessee law. The bill targets drivers convicted of vehicular manslaughter (first or second degree) or aggravated vehicular homicide. Gounardes said, 'If you drive recklessly, you are going to be held accountable.' He stressed the lack of accountability and financial compensation for victims’ families. The bill is limited to drunk drivers for now, but Gounardes hopes to expand it to all reckless drivers who kill. Few drivers are convicted under these charges in New York City. The measure sends a clear message: kill a parent, pay for it—literally and for years.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, sponsored by Assemblymember Deborah Glick (District 66) and Senator Andrew Gounardes, allows speed cameras to operate 24/7 in up to 750 school zones. The bill was set to expire but now runs through July 1, 2025. The matter summary states: 'New York City is now able to operate its speed cameras 24 hours a day.' Glick, who sponsored the bill, dismissed criticism that cameras are a cash grab, saying, 'The city isn't in the car with you... If you don't want to get a ticket, don't speed.' Mayor Eric Adams called the cameras a deterrent, not a punishment. Advocates say the law will slow cars and protect pedestrians, especially children.

The bill was weakened from its original form, dropping escalating fines and stricter penalties for repeat offenders due to City Council concerns.

Simcha Felder, Democrat from District 44, voted against. The expansion targets off-hours, which account for 59% of traffic deaths. Speeding dropped 72% and deaths fell 55% where cameras operated.

The bill, sponsored by Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assembly Member Deborah Glick, originally included tougher measures: escalating fines, registration suspensions, and insurance reporting for repeat speeders. These provisions were stripped during negotiations, leaving only the round-the-clock camera operation. Assembly Member Glick said, 'keeping the cameras on 24/7 was that hill.' Mayor Eric Adams called it 'a major victory for New Yorkers that will save lives.' Advocacy groups and lawmakers voiced frustration at Albany’s reluctance to adopt stronger safety tools. The final law removes blackout periods for cameras, but leaves dangerous drivers with fewer consequences. The bill passed despite disappointment over its dilution, exposing the limits of legislative action for street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Crashes spike at night and on weekends. Cameras catch reckless drivers. Fewer end up in the ER. The fix is partial, but it will save lives.</p><p class=mb3>On May 21, 2022, State Senator Andrew Gounardes endorsed a legislative deal to allow speed cameras in 750 New York City school zones to operate 24/7. The measure, awaiting City Council and state approval, aims to keep cameras running nights and weekends—when 41% of crashes occur. The matter summary states: 'the Legislature is poised to do the right thing and allow the speed cameras...to keep operating around the clock.' Gounardes, a key advocate, joins Mayor Adams and crash victims’ families in support. The endorsement highlights that automated enforcement cuts reckless driving and reduces injuries. The deal falls short by lacking escalating penalties for repeat speeders and lasting only three years. Still, keeping cameras on at all hours is the most important fix, targeting the deadliest times for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
