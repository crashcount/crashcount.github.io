He sponsored a bill to let the city use cameras to catch drivers who hide or deface their plates, and to extend school-zone speed enforcement <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S7336>Open States</a>. He voted yes on redesigning streets for safety <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>Open States</a>. He called speed cameras “possibly the most important street safety law on the books” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/18/albany-reauthorizes-city-speed-camera-program-for-5-more-years>Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p><p>But the deaths keep coming. Cameras catch speeders, but the city still drags its feet on redesigning deadly streets. Laws pass, but loopholes remain. <strong>“Our elected officials in Albany have failed the livable streets movement again,”</strong> wrote one advocate after another session ended with little change <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/25/d-minus-the-annual-albany-report-card-for-2025>Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.

Bike lanes appear, but real safety gains remain unclear.</p><p class=mb3>On July 7, 2023, the Department of Transportation unveiled redesign concepts for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway’s Atlantic Avenue interchange. The plans, discussed in committee, propose new highway off-ramps on Hicks Street. The matter summary states: 'DOT proposals rely on outdated approaches by building new highway ramps instead of eliminating them.' Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon criticized the plan for increasing traffic and pollution near homes, urging a new approach: 'They need to go back to the drawing board.' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes called out the reliance on old infrastructure, saying, 'The proposals should not be doubling down on the infrastructure and transportation of the past.' Former DOT Commissioner Hank Gutman said, 'They don't improve safety, they don't improve traffic, and they certainly don't improve any of the surrounding communities.' All concepts include a buffered or protected bike lane on Atlantic Avenue, but the impact on vulnerable road users remains uncertain.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Mamdani said, 'This is an initiative to make our streets safer for our children.' Gounardes called out the public cost of 'mini-tanks.'

The bill, now under consideration, would 'raise the existing by-weight registration fees to make them more likely to disincentivize the purchase of larger cars.' The proposal responds to a Transportation Alternatives report showing a 91% jump in injuries and a 75% rise in fatalities from large vehicle crashes between 2016 and 2019. Mamdani, at a press conference, said, 'This is an initiative to make our streets safer for our children.' Gounardes added, 'We the public has had to bear the cost of people's decisions to drive these mini-tanks.' The bill earmarks new revenue for street safety projects, aiming to protect vulnerable road users from the growing threat of oversized vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Jen Gutierrez carried the resolution; Selvena Brooks-Powers later signed on. The bill targets corridors like Bushwick Avenue, Laurelton Parkway, and East Gun Hill Road—sites of hundreds of crashes and dozens killed or maimed since 2019. The matter summary states: 'Because people are dying and being maimed on New York's most-dangerous 25-mile-per-hour streets.' Supporters, including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, cite the science: lower speeds mean less force, fewer deaths. Research shows 20 mph zones cut crashes by 60 percent. The bill does not mandate, but allows, lower limits where carnage is highest. The council’s action centers the lives of pedestrians and cyclists, demanding the city act before more are lost.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It targets a 15% cut in vehicle miles by 2050. The plan favors safer streets, less pollution, and more ways to get around. Advocates say it’s overdue. The old system kept streets dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>State Bill S1234, introduced by Senator Andrew Gounardes on April 12, 2023, aims to overhaul New York’s environmental review process. The bill, now before the legislature, would replace the outdated 'level of service' metric—focused on driver delay—with a mandate to reduce total vehicle miles traveled (VMT) by 15 percent by 2050. The bill summary states: 'By eliminating the relevance of level of service as a metric and utilizing vehicle miles traveled reduction instead, we can provide a new criteria for determining the significance of transportation impacts.' Gounardes, the bill’s sponsor, argues this shift will cut emissions and promote safer, multimodal streets. Advocates like Jon Orcutt and Sara Lind back the measure, calling it a long-overdue update that could finally let safety and climate take priority over car traffic. The bill follows California’s lead and could set a national example.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>State Senator Andrew Gounardes introduced a bill on March 23, 2023, proposing a 25-cent surcharge on every online delivery package in New York City. The bill, now under review, aims to raise $226 million yearly for city infrastructure. Gounardes said, "We're proposing an infrastructure fund to help pay for some of the capital costs to mitigate some of the consequences of last-mile trucking, and freight growth." The bill responds to a surge in daily package deliveries, now at 2.3 million, and forecasts of 200,000 trucks a day by 2045. Gounardes, the bill's sponsor, wants the city—not the MTA—to control the funds. City Hall has not taken a position but said it welcomes ideas to limit emissions and advance infrastructure. The bill joins other efforts to regulate last-mile delivery and warehouse placement. No formal safety analysis for vulnerable road users was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
