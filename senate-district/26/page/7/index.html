It comes in the dark and in daylight, at corners and crosswalks, on bikes and on foot. Since January 2022, 31 people have died and 5,484 have been injured in crashes here. Seventy-five suffered serious injuries. The dead include children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians—neighbors who never made it home.</p><p>Just weeks ago, on June 21, a 22-year-old moped rider was killed at 67th Street and 3rd Avenue. Police said the driver who hit him was drunk and unlicensed. His passenger left with broken bones. The driver was arrested at the scene. His brother <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>described him as &ldquo;a hardworking man&rdquo; who &ldquo;had a lot of love for his family.&rdquo;</a> The loss is sharp and final.</p><p>In February, a woman stepped out of a taxi on Flatbush Avenue and was struck and killed by a passing car. Both drivers stayed. No arrests. The street swallowed another life. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/boerum-hill-fatal-crash-woman-struck-killed-car-exiting-taxi-brooklyn-nyc/15966918/>First responders transported the victim to New York-Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital, where she was pronounced dead.</a></p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p>Most victims are not behind the wheel. In these years, cars and trucks caused 656 injuries or deaths to pedestrians. Motorcycles and mopeds added 35 more. Bikes, 68. These numbers are bodies. The bodies are neighbors.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn’t</h2><p>State Senator Andrew Gounardes has pushed for change. He sponsored the bill that renewed New York City’s speed camera program through 2030. Gounardes <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/18/albany-reauthorizes-city-speed-camera-program-for-5-more-years>said, &ldquo;Speed cameras save lives and make our streets safer for everyone&mldr; At the end of the day, this is about keeping New Yorkers safe. I&rsquo;m proud to have fought for this program from the beginning, and to renew it now for five years.&rdquo;</a></p><p>But cameras alone are not enough. Unlicensed, reckless drivers keep killing. The law still lets repeat offenders back behind the wheel. The city’s default speed limit is still above what’s proven to save lives. Each delay is another risk. Each loophole is another funeral.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do-now>What You Can Do Now</h2><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Call your council member. Call Senator Gounardes. Demand a 20 mph citywide speed limit. Demand real penalties for repeat speeders and unlicensed drivers. Join groups like Transportation Alternatives and Families for Safe Streets. Do not wait for another family to lose someone.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Bike lanes appear, but real safety gains remain unclear.</p><p class=mb3>On July 7, 2023, the Department of Transportation unveiled redesign concepts for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway’s Atlantic Avenue interchange. The plans, discussed in committee, propose new highway off-ramps on Hicks Street. The matter summary states: 'DOT proposals rely on outdated approaches by building new highway ramps instead of eliminating them.' Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon criticized the plan for increasing traffic and pollution near homes, urging a new approach: 'They need to go back to the drawing board.' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes called out the reliance on old infrastructure, saying, 'The proposals should not be doubling down on the infrastructure and transportation of the past.' Former DOT Commissioner Hank Gutman said, 'They don't improve safety, they don't improve traffic, and they certainly don't improve any of the surrounding communities.' All concepts include a buffered or protected bike lane on Atlantic Avenue, but the impact on vulnerable road users remains uncertain.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Andrew Gounardes, cite the science: lower speeds mean less force, fewer deaths. Research shows 20 mph zones cut crashes by 60 percent.

The old system kept streets dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>State Bill S1234, introduced by Senator Andrew Gounardes on April 12, 2023, aims to overhaul New York’s environmental review process. The bill, now before the legislature, would replace the outdated 'level of service' metric—focused on driver delay—with a mandate to reduce total vehicle miles traveled (VMT) by 15 percent by 2050. The bill summary states: 'By eliminating the relevance of level of service as a metric and utilizing vehicle miles traveled reduction instead, we can provide a new criteria for determining the significance of transportation impacts.' Gounardes, the bill’s sponsor, argues this shift will cut emissions and promote safer, multimodal streets. Advocates like Jon Orcutt and Sara Lind back the measure, calling it a long-overdue update that could finally let safety and climate take priority over car traffic. The bill follows California’s lead and could set a national example.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>State Senator Andrew Gounardes introduced a bill on March 23, 2023, proposing a 25-cent surcharge on every online delivery package in New York City. The bill, now under review, aims to raise $226 million yearly for city infrastructure. Gounardes said, "We're proposing an infrastructure fund to help pay for some of the capital costs to mitigate some of the consequences of last-mile trucking, and freight growth." The bill responds to a surge in daily package deliveries, now at 2.3 million, and forecasts of 200,000 trucks a day by 2045. Gounardes, the bill's sponsor, wants the city—not the MTA—to control the funds. City Hall has not taken a position but said it welcomes ideas to limit emissions and advance infrastructure. The bill joins other efforts to regulate last-mile delivery and warehouse placement. No formal safety analysis for vulnerable road users was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
