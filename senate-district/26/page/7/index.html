A BMW ran the red. The car did not stop. Both men died in the crosswalk. The driver left them in the street and sped away. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/sunset-park-deadly-hit-run-driver-charged-fatal-collision-2-men-brooklyn-nyc-arraigned-court/17083850/>Police found him later</a>. He told them, &ldquo;I had a six pack of Modelos and two drinks&mldr; It&rsquo;s my fault.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/12/hit-and-run-bmw-driver-who-killed-2-in-brooklyn-had-downed-beers-body-matter-found-on-car-da/>He faces manslaughter charges</a>.</p><p><strong>This is not rare.</strong> In the last 12 months, SD 26 has seen 11 deaths and 1,961 injuries from crashes. Eighty people have been killed or seriously hurt on this two-mile stretch since 2018. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/sunset-park-residents-call-for-improvements-on-a-deadly-stretch-of-third-avenue>The city’s answer? A sign that says: &lsquo;be careful,&rsquo;**</a> <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/sunset-park-residents-call-for-improvements-on-a-deadly-stretch-of-third-avenue>said State Senator Andrew Gounardes</a>. &ldquo;This is not meant to be a highway. This is where people walk. This is where people live. This is where kids go to school.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=the-toll-of-delay>The Toll of Delay</h2><p><strong>The carnage is steady.</strong> In the past year, five more people have died in SD 26. Over 1,200 have been injured. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. Cars and trucks do most of the killing: 7 deaths and 19 serious injuries from sedans and SUVs alone. Trucks killed three more. Bikes and mopeds hurt dozens, but they do not kill. The street is not safe for anyone who walks.</p><h2 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h2><p>Senator Gounardes has spoken out. He called out the city’s inaction after the latest deaths: <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>&ldquo;We wait until someone dies. We wait until a tragedy. We wait to say, &lsquo;oh my gosh, how could this possibly have happened?&rsquo; We let this happen time and time again.&rdquo;</a> He has pushed for speed cameras and sponsored bills to force repeat speeders to install limiters. He voted yes to extend school speed zones. But the street remains the same. The city has delayed real fixes for years. The dead keep coming.</p><h2 id=what-now>What Now?</h2><p><strong>No more waiting.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph citywide speed limit. Demand the Stop Super Speeders Act. Demand real redesigns, not just signs. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice. Make them choose life.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Transportation Committee, led by Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, pressed the Department of Transportation (DOT) for a final report on the program’s effectiveness. The bill required drivers with 15 speed-camera or five red-light tickets in a year to take a safety course or risk vehicle seizure. Council Member Shahana Hanif voiced disappointment, noting, 'We need to not only reauthorize this program, but strengthen it.' Despite over 34,000 drivers meeting the threshold in the last year, only about 1,200 took the course in three years. DOT has not explained the reporting delay or provided outcome data. The lack of enforcement leaves dangerous drivers on the road and vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, introduced in the New York State Legislature, would require drivers with at least six speeding tickets in a single year, or 11 points in 18 months, to install speed limiter devices in their vehicles. The matter summary states: "We are going to literally force you to slow down by requiring you to install a speed limiter on your car." Gounardes led the announcement at the Atlantic Avenue intersection where a driver killed Katherine Harris. Gallagher, co-sponsor, said, "Cars and trucks can act as weapons when used recklessly." The bill aims to bypass bureaucratic hurdles and act automatically, modeled after ignition interlock devices for drunk drivers. Advocates and city officials joined the call, citing data that speed limiters can reduce traffic deaths by 37 percent.

The fight centers on who controls city streets and who pays the price.</p><p class=mb3>On July 21, 2023, New York officials responded to a lawsuit from New Jersey over congestion pricing. The matter, titled 'New York Doubles Down on Congestion Pricing After New Jersey Sues,' saw Governor Kathy Hochul, State Senator Andrew Gounardes, and Assemblymember Robert Carroll defend the plan. Gounardes called the suit 'a cynical attempt' by New Jersey to interfere. Carroll labeled it 'a stunt.' MTA spokesperson John McCarthy said the environmental assessment 'covered every conceivable potential traffic, air quality, social and economic effect.' The MTA also pledged mitigation for environmental justice communities. The bill’s status is active, with strong support from New York’s leadership and ongoing opposition from New Jersey.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Their letter to the Traffic Mobility Review Board states: 'No one community should disproportionately bear the burden of the cars and trucks passing through their neighborhood.' Hanif, along with Lincoln Restler, Alexa Avilés, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Crystal Hudson, joined borough, state, and federal colleagues in this push. They propose a credit system to balance costs between DOT bridges and MTA tunnels, aiming to protect neighborhoods like the Brooklyn waterfront and the BQE corridor from traffic surges. The MTA declined comment. The Board will soon set final toll rates and rules. The federal government has approved the congestion pricing plan, with tolls for cars expected between $9 and $23. Over 100 exemption requests, including from taxi and for-hire vehicle drivers, are under review.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plans, discussed in committee, propose new highway off-ramps on Hicks Street. The matter summary states: 'DOT proposals rely on outdated approaches by building new highway ramps instead of eliminating them.' Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon criticized the plan for increasing traffic and pollution near homes, urging a new approach: 'They need to go back to the drawing board.' State Sen. Andrew Gounardes called out the reliance on old infrastructure, saying, 'The proposals should not be doubling down on the infrastructure and transportation of the past.' Former DOT Commissioner Hank Gutman said, 'They don't improve safety, they don't improve traffic, and they certainly don't improve any of the surrounding communities.' All concepts include a buffered or protected bike lane on Atlantic Avenue, but the impact on vulnerable road users remains uncertain.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
