That helps. Senator <a href=/senate-district/26/>Andrew Gounardes</a> sponsored and voted yes on <strong>S 8344</strong>, the extension (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>Open States</a>).

When I first got into elected office, there was not a single accessible station anywhere in my district... Today we are celebrating the second station in Bay Ridge to have accessibility access." -- Andrew Gounardes</p><p class=mb3>On July 8, 2025, the MTA opened two ADA-compliant elevators at Bay Ridge-95th Street station, Brooklyn. The project, backed by federal funds, finished under budget. Council Member Justin Brannan, State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, and Rep. Nicole Malliotakis all praised the upgrade. Quemuel Arroyo, MTA’s chief accessibility officer, called it 'a crucial connection.' The new elevators mark the third Brooklyn station made accessible this year. Improved subway access encourages walking and cycling to transit, boosting safety for vulnerable users by increasing their numbers and visibility. The MTA must reach 95% accessibility by 2055.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, described as 'an extra boost' for automated enforcement, updates home-rule provisions first enacted in 2013. State Senator Andrew Gounardes and Assembly Member Deborah Glick sponsored the measure. Both praised the program’s record in cutting speeds and saving lives. Council member Barbara Russo-Lennon supported the renewal.
