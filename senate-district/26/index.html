A BMW ran the red light. The car did not brake. Both men, ages 59 and 80, died in the street. The driver left them behind and sped away. Police found him later. He told them, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/12/hit-and-run-bmw-driver-who-killed-2-in-brooklyn-had-downed-beers-body-matter-found-on-car-da/>&ldquo;I had a six pack of Modelos and two drinks. I was driving the car by myself last night. It&rsquo;s my fault. After I hit them, I came home.&rdquo;</a></p><p>The men may have been on their way to a food pantry. City Harvest said, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/sunset-park-deadly-hit-run-driver-charged-fatal-collision-2-men-brooklyn-nyc-arraigned-court/17083850/>&ldquo;We understand they may have been on their way to our Mobile Market simply trying to access food like so many New Yorkers in need.&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h3><p><strong>In the last twelve months, SD 26 saw 7 deaths and 1,711 injuries from 3,126 crashes.</strong> Fourteen people suffered serious injuries. Most of the dead were older. Most of the injured were young. Cars and SUVs did the most harm, but trucks, bikes, and mopeds all left bodies behind. The street is not safe for anyone.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-the-long-road-ahead>Leadership: Progress and the Long Road Ahead</h3><p>Senator Andrew Gounardes has pushed for change. He sponsored and voted for the law that keeps speed cameras running in school zones through 2030. He called it clear: <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/18/albany-reauthorizes-city-speed-camera-program-for-5-more-years>&ldquo;Speed cameras save lives and make our streets safer for everyone&mldr; At the end of the day, this is about keeping New Yorkers safe. I&rsquo;m proud to have fought for this program from the beginning, and to renew it now for five years.&rdquo;</a></p><p>He also sponsored the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed-limiting devices. The bill passed committee but has not yet become law. The carnage continues.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay means another family shattered.</strong> Call Senator Gounardes. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat offenders. Do not wait for another body in the crosswalk.</p><p><strong>Act now.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Safety analysts warn: 'Focusing on insurance rather than speed limits shifts responsibility away from prevention and system design, failing to reduce crash risk and potentially discouraging mode shift by not addressing the root causes of danger for pedestrians and cyclists.' Lawmakers back insurance, but leave the streets risky.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Over 130,000 reckless drivers dodge speed-limiter rules. Only the worst offenders face consequences. Pedestrians and cyclists stay exposed. Lawmakers chose drivers over safety. The city’s deadliest keep rolling. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On June 11, 2025, the New York State Senate amended the Super Speeder Bill, sponsored by Sen. Andrew Gounardes (D-Bay Ridge). The bill originally required drivers with six or more speed or red-light camera tickets in a year to install speed-limiting devices. The Senate raised the threshold to sixteen speed-camera tickets, and removed red-light violations from the count. Streetsblog NYC reports, 'the state Senate moved to help more than 130,000 reckless drivers avoid accountability.' Gounardes defended the change, saying it would allow the program to grow slowly. Assembly Member Michaell Novakhov (R-Midwood) argued the threshold was too low. The amendment means only 17,000 drivers, not 150,000, will face restrictions. According to safety analysts, this move undermines deterrence, increases risk to pedestrians and cyclists, and signals that dangerous driving is tolerated. Vulnerable road users remain at risk. The bill’s status now sets a weaker standard for accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, heard in the Assembly Transportation Committee, would have required drivers with six or more camera-issued speeding tickets in a year to install a device preventing them from exceeding the speed limit by more than five miles per hour. Advocates, including Amy Cohen of Families for Safe Streets, called the Assembly's move 'outrageous.' Senate sponsor Andrew Gounardes vowed to keep fighting. Assembly Transportation Chair William Magnarelli cited due process concerns. Brandy Nannini, Ben Furnas, and Frank Harris condemned the inaction. According to safety analysts, the event marks no direct change for pedestrian or cyclist safety, as the bill did not pass and no new protections were enacted.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
