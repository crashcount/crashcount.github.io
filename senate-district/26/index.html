A BMW ran the red. The car did not stop. Both men died in the crosswalk. The driver left them in the street and sped away. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/sunset-park-deadly-hit-run-driver-charged-fatal-collision-2-men-brooklyn-nyc-arraigned-court/17083850/>Police found him later</a>. He told them, &ldquo;I had a six pack of Modelos and two drinks&mldr; It&rsquo;s my fault.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/12/hit-and-run-bmw-driver-who-killed-2-in-brooklyn-had-downed-beers-body-matter-found-on-car-da/>He faces manslaughter charges</a>.</p><p><strong>This is not rare.</strong> In the last 12 months, SD 26 has seen 11 deaths and 1,961 injuries from crashes. Eighty people have been killed or seriously hurt on this two-mile stretch since 2018. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/sunset-park-residents-call-for-improvements-on-a-deadly-stretch-of-third-avenue>The city’s answer? A sign that says: &lsquo;be careful,&rsquo;**</a> <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/sunset-park-residents-call-for-improvements-on-a-deadly-stretch-of-third-avenue>said State Senator Andrew Gounardes</a>. &ldquo;This is not meant to be a highway. This is where people walk. This is where people live. This is where kids go to school.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=the-toll-of-delay>The Toll of Delay</h2><p><strong>The carnage is steady.</strong> In the past year, five more people have died in SD 26. Over 1,200 have been injured. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. Cars and trucks do most of the killing: 7 deaths and 19 serious injuries from sedans and SUVs alone. Trucks killed three more. Bikes and mopeds hurt dozens, but they do not kill. The street is not safe for anyone who walks.</p><h2 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h2><p>Senator Gounardes has spoken out. He called out the city’s inaction after the latest deaths: <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sunset-park-hit-and-run-street-redesign/>&ldquo;We wait until someone dies. We wait until a tragedy. We wait to say, &lsquo;oh my gosh, how could this possibly have happened?&rsquo; We let this happen time and time again.&rdquo;</a> He has pushed for speed cameras and sponsored bills to force repeat speeders to install limiters. He voted yes to extend school speed zones. But the street remains the same. The city has delayed real fixes for years. The dead keep coming.</p><h2 id=what-now>What Now?</h2><p><strong>No more waiting.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph citywide speed limit. Demand the Stop Super Speeders Act. Demand real redesigns, not just signs. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice. Make them choose life.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The law, with no listed bill number or committee, extends automated enforcement through 2030. Hochul declared, 'Speed cameras save lives and keep New Yorkers safe.' Senator Andrew Gounardes, the bill's sponsor, praised the renewal. City data shows a 30 percent drop in severe injuries and a 94 percent fall in speeding at camera sites. Safety analysts confirm: speed cameras cut dangerous driving and protect pedestrians and cyclists without burdening them. Lawmakers remain divided, but the program stands.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>The 2025 Albany legislative session ended June 25, with lawmakers failing to pass key street safety bills. The Streetsblog NYC report reads: "Our elected officials in Albany have failed the livable streets movement again." Despite support for measures like speed camera reauthorization, most bills to protect pedestrians and cyclists died in committee or never reached the floor. Assembly Member Amy Sohn and others criticized the lack of action. The only major win was extending the city’s speed camera program. A safety analyst notes: 'Failure to advance livable streets policies likely maintains the status quo, which typically prioritizes car-centric infrastructure and neglects the safety and needs of pedestrians and cyclists.' The session’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users at risk. No progress. No protection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Sen. Andrew Gounardes praised the program, saying, 'speed cameras save lives and make our streets safer for everyone.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez credited advocates and lawmakers for the renewal. Amy Sohn supported the move. Safety analysts note that speed cameras reduce vehicle speeds and crashes, improving safety for pedestrians and cyclists without burdening them.

The bill, sponsored by Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger, mandates up to $50,000 per person for basic economic loss, regardless of citizenship or employment status. Assembly Member Robert Carroll authored the original Assembly version, stating, 'It is time we require delivery apps to take responsibility for keeping delivery workers and pedestrians safe.' Sen. Andrew Gounardes defended a related speed-limiting bill, but it was weakened. Safety analysts warn: 'Focusing on insurance rather than speed limits shifts responsibility away from prevention and system design, failing to reduce crash risk and potentially discouraging mode shift by not addressing the root causes of danger for pedestrians and cyclists.' Lawmakers back insurance, but leave the streets risky.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
