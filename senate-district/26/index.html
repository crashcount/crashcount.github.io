It comes in the dark and in daylight, at corners and crosswalks, on bikes and on foot. Since January 2022, 31 people have died and 5,484 have been injured in crashes here. Seventy-five suffered serious injuries. The dead include children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians—neighbors who never made it home.</p><p>Just weeks ago, on June 21, a 22-year-old moped rider was killed at 67th Street and 3rd Avenue. Police said the driver who hit him was drunk and unlicensed. His passenger left with broken bones. The driver was arrested at the scene. His brother <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>described him as &ldquo;a hardworking man&rdquo; who &ldquo;had a lot of love for his family.&rdquo;</a> The loss is sharp and final.</p><p>In February, a woman stepped out of a taxi on Flatbush Avenue and was struck and killed by a passing car. Both drivers stayed. No arrests. The street swallowed another life. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/boerum-hill-fatal-crash-woman-struck-killed-car-exiting-taxi-brooklyn-nyc/15966918/>First responders transported the victim to New York-Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital, where she was pronounced dead.</a></p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p>Most victims are not behind the wheel. In these years, cars and trucks caused 656 injuries or deaths to pedestrians. Motorcycles and mopeds added 35 more. Bikes, 68. These numbers are bodies. The bodies are neighbors.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn’t</h2><p>State Senator Andrew Gounardes has pushed for change. He sponsored the bill that renewed New York City’s speed camera program through 2030. Gounardes <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/18/albany-reauthorizes-city-speed-camera-program-for-5-more-years>said, &ldquo;Speed cameras save lives and make our streets safer for everyone&mldr; At the end of the day, this is about keeping New Yorkers safe. I&rsquo;m proud to have fought for this program from the beginning, and to renew it now for five years.&rdquo;</a></p><p>But cameras alone are not enough. Unlicensed, reckless drivers keep killing. The law still lets repeat offenders back behind the wheel. The city’s default speed limit is still above what’s proven to save lives. Each delay is another risk. Each loophole is another funeral.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do-now>What You Can Do Now</h2><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Call your council member. Call Senator Gounardes. Demand a 20 mph citywide speed limit. Demand real penalties for repeat speeders and unlicensed drivers. Join groups like Transportation Alternatives and Families for Safe Streets. Do not wait for another family to lose someone.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

When I first got into elected office, there was not a single accessible station anywhere in my district... Today we are celebrating the second station in Bay Ridge to have accessibility access." -- Andrew Gounardes</p><p class=mb3>On July 8, 2025, the MTA opened two ADA-compliant elevators at Bay Ridge-95th Street station, Brooklyn. The project, backed by federal funds, finished under budget. Council Member Justin Brannan, State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, and Rep. Nicole Malliotakis all praised the upgrade. Quemuel Arroyo, MTA’s chief accessibility officer, called it 'a crucial connection.' The new elevators mark the third Brooklyn station made accessible this year. Improved subway access encourages walking and cycling to transit, boosting safety for vulnerable users by increasing their numbers and visibility. The MTA must reach 95% accessibility by 2055.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Senate raised the threshold to sixteen speed-camera tickets, and removed red-light violations from the count. Streetsblog NYC reports, 'the state Senate moved to help more than 130,000 reckless drivers avoid accountability.' Gounardes defended the change, saying it would allow the program to grow slowly. Assembly Member Michaell Novakhov (R-Midwood) argued the threshold was too low. The amendment means only 17,000 drivers, not 150,000, will face restrictions. According to safety analysts, this move undermines deterrence, increases risk to pedestrians and cyclists, and signals that dangerous driving is tolerated. Vulnerable road users remain at risk.

The bill, sponsored by Sen. Andrew Gounardes, aims to curb reckless driving. Initially, Sen.

After discussion with Gounardes, Palumbo shifted, supporting the bill if it meets its goal. The bill’s summary states it targets repeat speeders with court orders and misdemeanor charges for non-compliance. Data shows 21 percent of fatal pedestrian crashes in NYC involve vehicles with six or more camera tickets in the prior year. Speed limiters have been shown to reduce traffic deaths by 37 percent. Palumbo now signals willingness to take strong action against reckless drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lawmakers clash, then unite. Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On May 16, 2025, State Sen. Anthony Palumbo, Republican from Suffolk, changed course on the Stop Super Speeders bill (S4045/A2029). The bill, sponsored by Sen. Andrew Gounardes, would require speed-limiting devices in cars of drivers with six or more speed-camera violations in a year. Palumbo first called the measure 'government overreach,' preferring license suspensions. After debate and a detailed comparison to ignition locks for drunk drivers, Palumbo agreed to support the bill if it meets its goal. Gounardes explained, 'We mimicked the ignition lock process and procedure.' The bill gained momentum after a deadly crash. According to the safety analyst, the event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action affecting pedestrians or cyclists, so no safety impact can be determined.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Committee Chair Jeremy Cooney was compelled to place it on the agenda. Democrats may use 'Aye Without Recommendation' to let the bill advance without clear support. A watchdog coalition, including Reinvent Albany and Bike New York, called the bill 'contrary to notions of basic fairness.' The same day, activists lobbied for the Idaho Stop bill (S639/A7071), sponsored by Sen. Rachel May and Assembly Member Karen McMahon. The bill would let cyclists treat red lights as stop signs and stop signs as yield signs, a move proven to reduce injuries. Despite support, the bill remains blocked. NYPD continues harsh enforcement against cyclists, who make up a small share of city trips but receive a disproportionate number of tickets. Cyclist deaths keep rising.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Police said 44-year-old Laura Cordova was driving without a license and without a court-mandated ignition interlock device. The crash happened near Tillary Street just before 10 p.m. on May 10, when 27-year-old Sean Johnson, riding a Suzuki motorcycle, collided with Cordova’s stopped Honda Accord. Johnson was found in critical condition and later died at Brooklyn Hospital Center. The article notes, 'Police arrested 44-year-old Laura Cordova... for driving without a license and using a vehicle without ignition interlock.' The NYPD Highway Collision Investigation Squad is still investigating.

Salaam’s resolution, co-sponsored by five council members, urges Albany to act. The matter title: 'Council Member Yusef Salaam Throws Support Behind Albany Push To Rein In Speeding Drivers.' Salaam said, 'It's very simple: it's to save lives.' The hearing drew families of crash victims and advocates like Amy Cohen and Darnell Sealy-McCrorey, who lost loved ones to reckless drivers. Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine and other officials back the measure.
