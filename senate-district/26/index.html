A BMW ran the red light. It did not slow. It struck Kex Un Chen, 80, and Faqiu Lin, 59. Both died in the street. The driver fled. Police found him later. He told them, &ldquo;I had a six pack of Modelos and two drinks. I was driving the car by myself last night. It&rsquo;s my fault.

Assembly Member Amy Sohn and others criticized the lack of action. The only major win was extending the city’s speed camera program.

Over 130,000 reckless drivers dodge speed-limiter rules. Only the worst offenders face consequences. Pedestrians and cyclists stay exposed. Lawmakers chose drivers over safety. The city’s deadliest keep rolling. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On June 11, 2025, the New York State Senate amended the Super Speeder Bill, sponsored by Sen. Andrew Gounardes (D-Bay Ridge). The bill originally required drivers with six or more speed or red-light camera tickets in a year to install speed-limiting devices. The Senate raised the threshold to sixteen speed-camera tickets, and removed red-light violations from the count. Streetsblog NYC reports, 'the state Senate moved to help more than 130,000 reckless drivers avoid accountability.' Gounardes defended the change, saying it would allow the program to grow slowly. Assembly Member Michaell Novakhov (R-Midwood) argued the threshold was too low. The amendment means only 17,000 drivers, not 150,000, will face restrictions. According to safety analysts, this move undermines deterrence, increases risk to pedestrians and cyclists, and signals that dangerous driving is tolerated. Vulnerable road users remain at risk. The bill’s status now sets a weaker standard for accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, heard in the Assembly Transportation Committee, would have required drivers with six or more camera-issued speeding tickets in a year to install a device preventing them from exceeding the speed limit by more than five miles per hour. Advocates, including Amy Cohen of Families for Safe Streets, called the Assembly's move 'outrageous.' Senate sponsor Andrew Gounardes vowed to keep fighting. Assembly Transportation Chair William Magnarelli cited due process concerns. Brandy Nannini, Ben Furnas, and Frank Harris condemned the inaction. According to safety analysts, the event marks no direct change for pedestrian or cyclist safety, as the bill did not pass and no new protections were enacted.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure passed with just two 'no' votes out of 13. The bill requires speed-limiting devices in cars of drivers with six or more camera-issued speeding tickets in a year. Streetsblog NYC reports, 'A bill that would prevent the most-reckless drivers from speeding easily moved forward on Tuesday.' Senator Andrew Gounardes sponsors the bill, emphasizing it targets the most dangerous drivers. Assembly sponsor Emily Gallagher raised concerns about cost and judicial bias, but stressed that speeding endangers everyone. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins backs the bill's safety focus. According to safety analysts, restricting repeat speeders directly tackles a major threat to pedestrians and cyclists, likely reducing crashes and making streets safer citywide.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
