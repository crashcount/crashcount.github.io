The dead do not get second chances. The injured carry scars.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a man in his 50s was left unresponsive on 101st Avenue in Ozone Park. A black SUV hit him and kept going. Police found him on the pavement, fighting for his life. He was rushed to Jamaica Hospital in critical condition. The driver vanished into the night. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/ozone-park-hit-run-crash-pedestrian-struck-critically-injured-collision-queens-nyc/16780134/>Police say the victim was struck by a black SUV traveling eastbound on 101st Avenue that kept going.</a></p><p>A week before, a fire truck turned onto Juniper Boulevard and killed a cyclist in Middle Village.

The NYPD is still investigating. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bicyclist-killed-being-struck-fdny-truck-middle-village-queens/16205704/>The truck was turning onto Juniper Boulevard from 80th Street in Middle Village when the collision occurred.</a></p><p><strong>These are not accidents.

The bills are slow. The deaths are fast.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>The crisis is relentless.</strong> The bodies pile up. The policies crawl.</p><p><strong>Call Senator Addabbo. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit.

The mayor backs a park. Advocates demand transit. Poor residents lose out. Elected officials split. The city risks locking out thousands from jobs and care. The debate rages. No one asks the people.</p><p class=mb3>This op-ed, published April 4, 2024, covers the battle over the unused Rockaway Beach Branch rail line in southeastern Queens. The city, led by Mayor Adams, pushes a park-only project, funded by the U.S. Department of Transportation. Rick Horan, QueensLink’s executive director, argues the plan blocks a vital north-south rail corridor, denying disadvantaged communities access to jobs, education, and healthcare. The op-ed states: 'It is simply irresponsible to build a park on a viable transit right-of-way in the biggest city in America.' State Senators James Sanders, Jr. and Joe Addabbo, Assembly Member Stacey Amato, and Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers, JoAnn Ariola, and Bob Holden support studies and funding for the rails-and-trails QueensLink alternative. The mayor’s plan faces criticism for ignoring public input and environmental justice. No safety impact assessment for vulnerable road users was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Police cite 'View Obstructed/Limited' and 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as contributing factors, drawing attention to driver error and systemic visibility hazards at this intersection. The victim was not ejected and the airbag deployed, but the force proved fatal.

According to the police report, the crash occurred during a police pursuit. The report states the driver was 'Backing Unsafely' and did not possess a valid license. The pedestrian was not in a crosswalk at the time, but the report does not list any pedestrian behavior as a contributing factor. The narrative describes the scene: 'A fleeing Honda reversed into a man, not at a crosswalk. His leg was crushed under steel. He stayed conscious. The driver had no license. The streetlights flickered. Sirens followed.' The focus remains on the driver’s unlawful actions—operating without a license and reversing unsafely while fleeing police—which directly led to the pedestrian’s injuries.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
