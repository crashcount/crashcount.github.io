The incident began with a minor collision and escalated as both vehicles ran a red light. Helmet cam footage showed Rosen rear-ending the motorcycle, causing it to catch fire and kill McField instantly. Queens DA Melinda Katz stated, "As alleged, this defendant plowed his BMW SUV into a motorcyclist shortly after the two had a minor collision." The BMW also struck another car before stopping. Rosen had prior traffic summonses for speeding and driving the wrong way. The case highlights the lethal risk of aggressive driving and the deadly power imbalance between cars and vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The boy slammed, flew, landed hard. Crush injuries racked his body. He stayed conscious, pain burning through him. Driver inattention and an improper turn paved the way.</p><p class=mb3>A 15-year-old boy riding an e-bike was severely injured near 127th Street and 109th Avenue when he collided with the side of a car making a left turn. According to the police report, the e-bike struck the turning vehicle’s left side doors, sending the boy flying and causing crush injuries to his entire body. The report states the boy was not wearing a helmet, but emphasizes that 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Turning Improperly' were the primary contributing factors. The car was making a left turn while the e-bike was going straight ahead. The boy remained conscious after the crash, despite significant pain. The police report centers the driver’s lack of attention and improper maneuver as key causes of the crash.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
