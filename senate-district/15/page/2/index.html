The street stayed quiet, danger lingering.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a 58-year-old man riding an e-bike was traveling north on 80th Street near 67th Drive in Queens when he struck the left side doors of a parked sedan. The impact ejected the rider, who suffered crush injuries to his arm. The report states the contributing factor as 'Driver Inattention/Distraction.' The sedan was unoccupied and legally parked at the time of the crash. The e-bike rider was wearing a helmet, but the report notes that it did not prevent injury. The sequence of events underscores the persistent danger posed by inattentive operation, even in the absence of moving vehicles. The police report makes no mention of any errors or contributing behaviors by the injured e-bike rider beyond the cited inattention.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
