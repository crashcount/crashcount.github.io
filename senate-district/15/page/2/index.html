Thirteen left with injuries so grave they will never be the same.</strong> In the last year alone, there were <strong>1,202 injuries</strong> and nearly two thousand crashes. These are not just numbers. They are fathers, daughters, neighbors. A cyclist crushed by a turning fire truck in Middle Village. A motorcyclist burned alive on the expressway. Two men, ages 31 and 67, struck down on Atlantic Avenue. The street does not care how old you are.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>A witness saw the fire truck stop at the light. &ldquo;One of them seemed concerned, like shaken, like shocked,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/19/us-news/fdny-firetruck-strikes-kills-cyclist-outside-nyc-park/>said Miguel Vega</a> after the cyclist was killed.

He <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S5801>co-sponsored another bill</a> to do the same. These are steps in the right direction. But Addabbo also <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S915>co-sponsored a bill</a> to require e-scooter riders to get licenses and insurance. This puts the burden on the most vulnerable, not on the drivers or the deadly roads. It is not enough.</p><h3 id=what-next>What Next?</h3><p><strong>The disaster is not over.</strong> The streets are still killing. The city can lower speed limits. The state can keep speed cameras running. The laws can change. But only if you demand it. <strong>Call Joe Addabbo. Call your council member. Demand streets where no one has to die for crossing, riding, or walking home.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Streets may change.</p><p class=mb3>Senate Bill S 9718, titled "Enables safe access to public roads for all users by utilizing complete street design principles," advanced through the Senate with committee votes on May 28 and June 3, 2024. The bill, sponsored by Sean Ryan (District 61) and co-sponsored by Liz Krueger, Monica Martinez, Jack M. Martins, Anthony H. Palumbo, and Julia Salazar, passed both votes despite opposition. The measure calls for redesigning streets to protect all users, not just drivers. The vote was not unanimous—several senators voted no, but the majority carried it through. The bill’s focus is clear: safer streets for people on foot, on bikes, and in vehicles. No safety analyst note was provided, but the intent is to cut danger at the curb and crosswalk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city, led by Mayor Adams, pushes a park-only project, funded by the U.S. Department of Transportation. Rick Horan, QueensLink’s executive director, argues the plan blocks a vital north-south rail corridor, denying disadvantaged communities access to jobs, education, and healthcare. The op-ed states: 'It is simply irresponsible to build a park on a viable transit right-of-way in the biggest city in America.' State Senators James Sanders, Jr. and Joe Addabbo, Assembly Member Stacey Amato, and Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers, JoAnn Ariola, and Bob Holden support studies and funding for the rails-and-trails QueensLink alternative.
