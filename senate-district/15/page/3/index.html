Since 2022, <strong>28 people have died</strong> in traffic crashes. <strong>Forty-eight more suffered serious injuries.</strong> The wounds are not numbers. They are crushed bones, stopped hearts, empty chairs at dinner tables. In the last year alone, deaths nearly doubled—from 4 to 7—while crashes and injuries climbed higher. Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians all pay the price.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a man in his 50s was left fighting for his life after a hit-and-run in Ozone Park. The SUV kept going. The man did not. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/ozone-park-hit-run-crash-pedestrian-struck-critically-injured-collision-queens-nyc/16780134/>Police say the victim was struck by a black SUV traveling eastbound on 101st Avenue that kept going.</a></p><p>A cyclist was killed by an FDNY truck turning onto Juniper Boulevard. The driver turned. The cyclist did not get up. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bicyclist-killed-being-struck-fdny-truck-middle-village-queens/16205704/>The truck was turning onto Juniper Boulevard from 80th Street in Middle Village when the collision occurred.</a></p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage.</strong> They killed 7, injured 538, and left 11 with serious wounds. Trucks and buses killed 4. Motorcycles and mopeds killed 3. Bikes killed none. The numbers are clear. The danger is not spread evenly. The bigger the machine, the more it takes.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>State Senator Joe Addabbo has voted for bills to curb repeat speeders and create safety zones. He backed the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, which would force the worst offenders to slow down. He co-sponsored bills to protect highway workers and first responders. These are steps. They are not enough.</p><p>The carnage continues. The streets do not wait for laws to catch up. Every delay is another body.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-demand-now>Call to Action: Demand More, Demand Now</h3><p><strong>Call Senator Addabbo. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat offenders. Demand streets where children can cross without fear.</strong></p><p>The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice. Make them choose life.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

According to the police report, the crash occurred during a police pursuit. The report states the driver was 'Backing Unsafely' and did not possess a valid license. The pedestrian was not in a crosswalk at the time, but the report does not list any pedestrian behavior as a contributing factor. The narrative describes the scene: 'A fleeing Honda reversed into a man, not at a crosswalk. His leg was crushed under steel. He stayed conscious. The driver had no license. The streetlights flickered. Sirens followed.' The focus remains on the driver’s unlawful actions—operating without a license and reversing unsafely while fleeing police—which directly led to the pedestrian’s injuries.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
