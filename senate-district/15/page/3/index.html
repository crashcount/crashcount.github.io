Thirteen left with injuries so grave they will never be the same.</strong> In the last year alone, there were <strong>1,202 injuries</strong> and nearly two thousand crashes. These are not just numbers. They are fathers, daughters, neighbors. A cyclist crushed by a turning fire truck in Middle Village. A motorcyclist burned alive on the expressway. Two men, ages 31 and 67, struck down on Atlantic Avenue. The street does not care how old you are.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>A witness saw the fire truck stop at the light. &ldquo;One of them seemed concerned, like shaken, like shocked,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/19/us-news/fdny-firetruck-strikes-kills-cyclist-outside-nyc-park/>said Miguel Vega</a> after the cyclist was killed. There is no comfort for the families. &ldquo;Our roadways are not the place to settle disputes,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/25/bmw-driver-charged-with-murder-of-queens-motorcyclist-in-road-rage-crash-nypd/>said Queens DA Melinda Katz</a> after a BMW driver killed a motorcyclist in a burst of rage. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><h3 id=what-has-joe-addabbo-done>What Has Joe Addabbo Done?</h3><p><strong>Senator Joe Addabbo has voted for safer street design</strong>—he <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>backed a bill</a> to require complete streets for all users, not just drivers. He <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S5801>co-sponsored another bill</a> to do the same. These are steps in the right direction. But Addabbo also <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S915>co-sponsored a bill</a> to require e-scooter riders to get licenses and insurance. This puts the burden on the most vulnerable, not on the drivers or the deadly roads. It is not enough.</p><h3 id=what-next>What Next?</h3><p><strong>The disaster is not over.</strong> The streets are still killing. The city can lower speed limits. The state can keep speed cameras running. The laws can change. But only if you demand it. <strong>Call Joe Addabbo. Call your council member. Demand streets where no one has to die for crossing, riding, or walking home.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
