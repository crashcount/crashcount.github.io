The report states: 'A sedan pulled from parking. A woman rode east on her bike. Metal struck flesh. Her body broke open, bleeding.' The cyclist, a 38-year-old woman, suffered severe bleeding and injuries to her entire body. She was conscious at the scene. The police report lists 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' and 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' as contributing factors. The sedan, driven by a man with a permit, showed no visible damage. The report notes the cyclist wore no helmet, but this is mentioned after the driver actions and only because it appears in the official record. The crash underscores the danger when vehicles enter traffic from parking, putting vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

No one asks the people.</p><p class=mb3>This op-ed, published April 4, 2024, covers the battle over the unused Rockaway Beach Branch rail line in southeastern Queens. The city, led by Mayor Adams, pushes a park-only project, funded by the U.S. Department of Transportation. Rick Horan, QueensLink’s executive director, argues the plan blocks a vital north-south rail corridor, denying disadvantaged communities access to jobs, education, and healthcare. The op-ed states: 'It is simply irresponsible to build a park on a viable transit right-of-way in the biggest city in America.' State Senators James Sanders, Jr. and Joe Addabbo, Assembly Member Stacey Amato, and Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers, JoAnn Ariola, and Bob Holden support studies and funding for the rails-and-trails QueensLink alternative. The mayor’s plan faces criticism for ignoring public input and environmental justice.
