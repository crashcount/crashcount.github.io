Since 2022, <strong>28 people have died</strong> and <strong>48 have been left with serious injuries</strong> in crashes. The numbers do not flinch. In the last year alone, nine more lives ended. <strong>Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians—none are spared.</strong></p><p>On April 19, a fire truck turned onto Juniper Boulevard and killed a cyclist in Middle Village. The man died at the scene. Police said, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bicyclist-killed-being-struck-fdny-truck-middle-village-queens/16205704/>&ldquo;the truck was turning onto Juniper Boulevard from 80th Street in Middle Village when the collision occurred.&rdquo;</a> The NYPD is still investigating. A witness saw firefighters, <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/19/us-news/fdny-firetruck-strikes-kills-cyclist-outside-nyc-park/>&ldquo;shaken, like shocked,&rdquo; standing in the road after the crash. &ldquo;I just feel so bad for everyone. For the people in the fire truck, the families involved, everyone,&rdquo;</a> he said.</p><p>Days later, a BMW driver killed a motorcyclist in a burst of rage. The Queens DA said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/25/bmw-driver-charged-with-murder-of-queens-motorcyclist-in-road-rage-crash-nypd/>&ldquo;As alleged, this defendant plowed his BMW SUV into a motorcyclist shortly after the two had a minor collision.&rdquo;</a> The bike caught fire. The rider died on the street.</p><h3 id=the-vehicles-that-kill>The Vehicles That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the harm:</strong> 7 deaths, 11 serious injuries. <strong>Trucks and buses</strong>: 4 deaths, 4 serious injuries. <strong>Motorcycles and mopeds</strong>: 3 deaths, 2 serious injuries. <strong>Bikes</strong>: no deaths, no serious injuries. The weight of steel and speed decides who lives and who dies.</p><h3 id=what-has-senator-addabbo-done>What Has Senator Addabbo Done?</h3><p>Senator Joe Addabbo has voted yes on bills to curb repeat speeders, extend school speed zones, and create safety zones for first responders. He co-sponsored bills to raise penalties for endangering highway workers and to lower speed limits in safety zones. These votes matter. But the deaths keep coming. The policies are not enough. The streets are still not safe for the most vulnerable.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This crisis is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Senator Addabbo. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people outside cars. <strong>Every day of delay is another name on a slab.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
