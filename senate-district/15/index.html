A black SUV hit him and kept going. He was left fighting for his life. The driver did not stop. Police are still looking for answers. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/ozone-park-hit-run-crash-pedestrian-struck-critically-injured-collision-queens-nyc/16780134/>&ldquo;A man is fighting for his life after he was struck in a hit-and-run in Queens late Tuesday night.&rdquo;</a></p><p>In April, a cyclist was killed in Middle Village. The FDNY truck turned onto Juniper Boulevard. The man never made it home. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bicyclist-killed-being-struck-fdny-truck-middle-village-queens/16205704/>&ldquo;The driver of an FDNY truck struck and killed a bicyclist in Queens on Saturday afternoon.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>In the last 12 months, SD 15 saw 10 deaths and 1,391 injuries from crashes. Fourteen were serious injuries.</strong> Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians—no one is spared. The numbers do not stop. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p>The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors. A 23-year-old cyclist killed on Queens Boulevard. A pedestrian, age 67, struck down on Atlantic Avenue. A motorcyclist, ejected and killed on Eliot Avenue. Each loss is a hole in a family, a gap in a block, a silence at a dinner table.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs are the main killers.</strong> In this district, they caused 8 deaths and 729 injuries to pedestrians and cyclists. Trucks and buses killed 4. Motorcycles and mopeds killed 3. Bikes killed none. The street is not safe for the unprotected.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>State Senator Joe Addabbo has taken some steps. He voted yes to extend school speed zones, a move that protects children near schools. He backed the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. He co-sponsored bills to lower speed limits in safety zones and raise penalties for endangering highway workers. These are steps in the right direction, but the blood on the street says it is not enough.</p><p>The streets are still fast. The drivers are still reckless. The dead still pile up. <strong>Every delay is another name on a slab.</strong></p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-demand-now>Call to Action: Demand More, Demand Now</h3><p><strong>Call your leaders. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for every person on foot or bike.</strong> Do not wait for another body in the road. The time for half-measures is over. The time for action is now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
