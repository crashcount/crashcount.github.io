It is late. The black SUV that hit him keeps going. He is in critical condition. Police say the driver did not stop. Another hit-and-run, another family waiting by a hospital bed. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/ozone-park-hit-run-crash-pedestrian-struck-critically-injured-collision-queens-nyc/16780134/>Police say the victim was struck by a black SUV traveling eastbound on 101st Avenue that kept going.</a></p><p>Just weeks before, a cyclist is killed in Middle Village. An FDNY truck turns onto Juniper Boulevard. The man on the bike dies at the scene. No arrest. No answers. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bicyclist-killed-being-struck-fdny-truck-middle-village-queens/16205704/>&ldquo;The bicyclist was an adult male who was pronounced dead at the scene.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>In the last 12 months, nine people have died on SD 15 streets.</strong> Over 1,200 have been hurt. Thirteen suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. The dead are not numbers. They are fathers, sons, neighbors. They are gone.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p>The violence does not fall evenly. <strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> Cars and trucks are the main killers—<strong>seven deaths, 698 injuries</strong>. Motorcycles and mopeds add three more deaths and 14 injuries. Even bikes are not spared: 15 injuries, one death. The streets are not safe for the unprotected.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>State Senator Joe Addabbo has voted for bills to curb repeat speeders and extend school speed zones. He backed measures to create safety zones and raise penalties for endangering highway workers. These are steps. But the blood keeps flowing. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so. The most dangerous drivers still roam free.</p><h2 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day without change is another day of loss. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph limit. Demand action against repeat speeders. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
