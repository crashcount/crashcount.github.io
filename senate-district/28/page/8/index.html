Since January 2022, 26 people have died and 4,176 have been injured in 8,183 crashes. Among them: children, elders, cyclists, pedestrians. One hundred six suffered serious injuries. Each number is a body. Each body is a life changed or ended.</p><p>Just this year, deaths have more than tripled compared to last year. Ten people are already gone. Serious injuries are down, but the dead do not heal.</p><h3 id=the-recent-blood-on-the-streets>The Recent Blood on the Streets</h3><p>On February 5, a 90-year-old woman was killed crossing York Avenue. She was struck by an SUV and a taxi. The crash report lists &ldquo;driver inattention/distraction&rdquo; as a cause. She died in the street, crushed. See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash records</a>.</p><p>On February 11, an 83-year-old woman was killed at the intersection of Avenue of the Americas and 58th.

See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash records</a>.</p><p>On February 4, a woman was ejected and killed on the FDR Drive.

She co-sponsored and voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed limiters. The bill targets those who rack up violations and points, aiming to keep killers off the road. As the bill summary states, the legislation <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>targets drivers with a pattern of violations, seeking to cut risk for pedestrians and cyclists by limiting repeat speeding</a>.</p><p>Krueger also backed the extension of school speed zones, a move to protect children walking to class. She <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted yes to extend school speed zones, improving child pedestrian safety</a>.</p><p>But the carnage continues. Bills move slow. Streets change slower. The dead do not wait.</p><h3 id=the-fight-ahead>The Fight Ahead</h3><p>The bodies pile up. The numbers grow. The only thing that stops this is action. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph citywide speed limit. Demand the city use the power it has. Demand the state pass the Stop Super Speeders Act.</p><p>Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
