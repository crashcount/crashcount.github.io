On February 5, a 90‑year‑old woman was hit and killed at E 72nd Street. Police coded the cause as driver distraction. Two southbound vehicles, an SUV and a taxi, kept going straight. She did not. The state calls this <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4790720</a>. The record says “crush injuries.”</p><p>On February 11, at Sixth Avenue and West 58th, an 83‑year‑old woman crossing with the signal was struck by a left‑turning SUV. She died there. The city database marks it as <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>a fatal pedestrian strike at W 58th and Sixth</a>. No citation text.

She also backed extending the 24/7 school‑zone camera program, voting yes on <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>S 8344</a>. Those are votes. The bodies are here.</p><p>On Third Avenue, advocates begged for space to live. “I don&rsquo;t like riding on this avenue. It&rsquo;s terrifying, it&rsquo;s bad,” one said at a <strong>2022</strong> town hall held by Sen.

The event, hosted by State Senator Liz Krueger, featured DOT Manhattan Borough Commissioner Ed Pincar, who said, “We are looking very closely… we may be able to present a proposal maybe even later this year.” The redesign aims to transform Third Avenue into a safer boulevard with fewer car lanes, more bus lanes, a separated bike path, and wider sidewalks. Council Member Gale Brewer and advocates like Paul Krikler have long demanded these changes. Krueger and the NYPD, however, focused on enforcement against cyclists and e-bike riders, citing constituent concerns. Krueger has previously pushed for harsher penalties for electric-vehicle riders. NYPD data shows more enforcement against cyclists than drivers, even though drivers cause most injuries. No formal safety analysis was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
