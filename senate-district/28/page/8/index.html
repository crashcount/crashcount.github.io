Over 1,500 injured.</strong> That’s just the last twelve months in Senate District 28. The numbers do not bleed, but the streets do. On July 31, eight people were hurt when a car and SUV slammed into scaffolding on Madison Avenue. The news said, &ldquo;All of the injuries are believed to be non-life-threatening.&rdquo; But the scaffolding stood where people walk. The cars did not stop. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/2-vehicle-crash-upper-east-side-scaffolding-injures-8-people-manhattan/17376667/>ABC7 reported the crash</a>.</p><p>Just weeks before, a stolen box truck crashed into a Midtown building. No one died that time. Police said, &ldquo;no one was hurt and a person of interest was taken into custody.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/stolen-box-truck-hits-midtown-building/>CBS New York covered the incident</a>. But the risk was there. The risk is always there.</p><p><strong>The old and the young are not spared.</strong> In the last year, six people over 75 died. Three more between 65 and 74. Forty-nine children were injured. The city keeps counting. The bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> In three years, they killed 12, injured 591, and left 24 with serious wounds. Trucks and buses killed three. Bikes and mopeds hurt many, but they did not kill. The street is a battlefield, and the weapons are heavy.</p><h3 id=what-has-senator-krueger-done>What Has Senator Krueger Done?</h3><p>Senator Liz Krueger has voted for change. In June, she voted yes on a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting devices. The bill aims to stop the worst offenders. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Krueger voted yes in committee, boosting street safety by curbing repeat speeders</a>.</p><p>She co-sponsored a bill to keep bike lanes clear with cameras. She pushed for bus lane enforcement and supported complete streets. When the governor delayed congestion pricing, Krueger called it &ldquo;a staggering error&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/06/two-huge-questions-about-gridlock-gov-hochuls-congestion-pricing-delay>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The bills are not yet law. The streets are not yet safe.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by those in power. Call Senator Krueger. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action, not words. The next body could be yours.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The event, hosted by State Senator Liz Krueger, featured DOT Manhattan Borough Commissioner Ed Pincar, who said, “We are looking very closely… we may be able to present a proposal maybe even later this year.” The redesign aims to transform Third Avenue into a safer boulevard with fewer car lanes, more bus lanes, a separated bike path, and wider sidewalks. Council Member Gale Brewer and advocates like Paul Krikler have long demanded these changes. Krueger and the NYPD, however, focused on enforcement against cyclists and e-bike riders, citing constituent concerns. Krueger has previously pushed for harsher penalties for electric-vehicle riders. NYPD data shows more enforcement against cyclists than drivers, even though drivers cause most injuries. No formal safety analysis was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
