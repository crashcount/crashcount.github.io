These are not just numbers—they are mothers, sons, neighbors. In the last year alone, 11 people were killed and 29 suffered life-changing wounds. The old and the young fall alike. Five people over 75 are dead. No child under 18 has died, but 43 have been hurt.</p><p>The carnage does not slow. On February 5, a 90-year-old woman was struck and killed by an SUV and a taxi on York Avenue. She was crossing the street. She did not make it to the other side. On February 11, an 83-year-old woman was killed by a left-turning SUV at Sixth Avenue and 58th Street. She was crossing with the signal. The driver turned left. She never finished her walk.</p><h2 id=the-policy-response-votes-and-voices>The Policy Response: Votes and Voices</h2><p><strong>Senator Liz Krueger has taken steps.</strong> She voted yes on the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting devices. She co-sponsored a bill to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S3304>enforce bike lane safety with cameras</a>. She backed <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/13/senate-requires-delivery-apps-to-provide-insurance-for-workers>insurance for delivery workers and pedestrians</a>, but critics warn that insurance is not prevention. &ldquo;Focusing on insurance rather than speed limits shifts responsibility away from prevention and system design,&rdquo; safety analysts <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/13/senate-requires-delivery-apps-to-provide-insurance-for-workers>said</a>. &ldquo;It fails to reduce crash risk and potentially discourages mode shift by not addressing the root causes of danger for pedestrians and cyclists.&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/13/senate-requires-delivery-apps-to-provide-insurance-for-workers>Read the full critique</a>.</p><p>Krueger has also spoken out against delays to congestion pricing, calling Governor Hochul&rsquo;s move &ldquo;a staggering error&rdquo; that leaves streets clogged and dangerous. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/06/two-huge-questions-about-gridlock-gov-hochuls-congestion-pricing-delay>See her stance</a>.</p><h2 id=the-road-ahead-who-pays-the-price>The Road Ahead: Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>Cars and trucks do most of the killing.</strong> In this district, SUVs and cars caused 11 deaths and 23 serious injuries. Trucks and buses killed 3 and seriously injured 9. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes together caused no deaths, but bikes left 8 people with serious injuries. The street is not safe for anyone outside a car.</p><p>The city and state have tools. They can lower speed limits. They can redesign streets. They can take away the keys from repeat offenders. But every day they wait, another family pays the price.</p><p><strong>Call your lawmakers. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against reckless drivers. Demand streets where the most vulnerable can cross and live.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for the next name to be carved into stone.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, debated in the Senate Finance and Transportation Committees, included $6 billion for MTA capital improvements and supported congestion pricing. Sen. Dean Murray (R-Suffolk) and Sen. Bill Weber (R-Rockland) opposed the measure, citing toll burdens and limited transit options. Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger (D-Manhattan) and Transportation Chair Jeremy Cooney (D-Rochester) defended the plan, highlighting increased MTA revenue and minimal impact on local businesses. The matter summary reads: 'State legislators from the suburbs, particularly Republican lawmakers, voiced strong opposition to congestion pricing during the passage of Gov.

Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On April 9, 2025, seven elected officials—including Council Members Julie Won and Julie Menin—sent a public letter demanding Mayor Adams open the long-promised Queensboro Bridge pedestrian path. The Department of Transportation had planned to open the dedicated walkway on March 16, but the mayor's office intervened, citing the need for a briefing. The lawmakers wrote, 'The reasons given for this delay are not satisfactory, as all communications from the DOT have indicated that the project is complete and ready to open to the public.' They warned, 'Any further delays to this project that is otherwise ready to open will unnecessarily put at risk the thousands of New Yorkers who cycle and walk the current shared path every day.' The project, in the works since at least 2017, remains stalled. Cyclists and pedestrians are forced to share a cramped, hazardous lane. City Hall insists on more review, while advocates plan a protest ribbon-cutting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
