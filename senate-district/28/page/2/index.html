Since January 2022, 26 people have died and 4,176 have been injured in 8,183 crashes. Among them: children, elders, cyclists, pedestrians. One hundred six suffered serious injuries. Each number is a body. Each body is a life changed or ended.</p><p>Just this year, deaths have more than tripled compared to last year. Ten people are already gone. Serious injuries are down, but the dead do not heal.</p><h3 id=the-recent-blood-on-the-streets>The Recent Blood on the Streets</h3><p>On February 5, a 90-year-old woman was killed crossing York Avenue. She was struck by an SUV and a taxi. The crash report lists &ldquo;driver inattention/distraction&rdquo; as a cause. She died in the street, crushed. See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash records</a>.</p><p>On February 11, an 83-year-old woman was killed at the intersection of Avenue of the Americas and 58th.

See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash records</a>.</p><p>On February 4, a woman was ejected and killed on the FDR Drive.

She co-sponsored and voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed limiters. The bill targets those who rack up violations and points, aiming to keep killers off the road. As the bill summary states, the legislation <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>targets drivers with a pattern of violations, seeking to cut risk for pedestrians and cyclists by limiting repeat speeding</a>.</p><p>Krueger also backed the extension of school speed zones, a move to protect children walking to class. She <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted yes to extend school speed zones, improving child pedestrian safety</a>.</p><p>But the carnage continues. Bills move slow. Streets change slower. The dead do not wait.</p><h3 id=the-fight-ahead>The Fight Ahead</h3><p>The bodies pile up. The numbers grow. The only thing that stops this is action. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph citywide speed limit. Demand the city use the power it has. Demand the state pass the Stop Super Speeders Act.</p><p>Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, debated in the Senate Finance and Transportation Committees, included $6 billion for MTA capital improvements and supported congestion pricing. Sen. Dean Murray (R-Suffolk) and Sen. Bill Weber (R-Rockland) opposed the measure, citing toll burdens and limited transit options. Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger (D-Manhattan) and Transportation Chair Jeremy Cooney (D-Rochester) defended the plan, highlighting increased MTA revenue and minimal impact on local businesses. The matter summary reads: 'State legislators from the suburbs, particularly Republican lawmakers, voiced strong opposition to congestion pricing during the passage of Gov.

Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On April 9, 2025, seven elected officials—including Council Members Julie Won and Julie Menin—sent a public letter demanding Mayor Adams open the long-promised Queensboro Bridge pedestrian path. The Department of Transportation had planned to open the dedicated walkway on March 16, but the mayor's office intervened, citing the need for a briefing. The lawmakers wrote, 'The reasons given for this delay are not satisfactory, as all communications from the DOT have indicated that the project is complete and ready to open to the public.' They warned, 'Any further delays to this project that is otherwise ready to open will unnecessarily put at risk the thousands of New Yorkers who cycle and walk the current shared path every day.' The project, in the works since at least 2017, remains stalled. Cyclists and pedestrians are forced to share a cramped, hazardous lane. City Hall insists on more review, while advocates plan a protest ribbon-cutting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
