Over 1,500 injured.</strong> That’s just the last twelve months in Senate District 28. The numbers do not bleed, but the streets do. On July 31, eight people were hurt when a car and SUV slammed into scaffolding on Madison Avenue. The news said, &ldquo;All of the injuries are believed to be non-life-threatening.&rdquo; But the scaffolding stood where people walk. The cars did not stop. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/2-vehicle-crash-upper-east-side-scaffolding-injures-8-people-manhattan/17376667/>ABC7 reported the crash</a>.</p><p>Just weeks before, a stolen box truck crashed into a Midtown building. No one died that time. Police said, &ldquo;no one was hurt and a person of interest was taken into custody.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/stolen-box-truck-hits-midtown-building/>CBS New York covered the incident</a>. But the risk was there. The risk is always there.</p><p><strong>The old and the young are not spared.</strong> In the last year, six people over 75 died. Three more between 65 and 74. Forty-nine children were injured. The city keeps counting. The bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> In three years, they killed 12, injured 591, and left 24 with serious wounds. Trucks and buses killed three. Bikes and mopeds hurt many, but they did not kill. The street is a battlefield, and the weapons are heavy.</p><h3 id=what-has-senator-krueger-done>What Has Senator Krueger Done?</h3><p>Senator Liz Krueger has voted for change. In June, she voted yes on a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting devices. The bill aims to stop the worst offenders. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Krueger voted yes in committee, boosting street safety by curbing repeat speeders</a>.</p><p>She co-sponsored a bill to keep bike lanes clear with cameras. She pushed for bus lane enforcement and supported complete streets. When the governor delayed congestion pricing, Krueger called it &ldquo;a staggering error&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/06/two-huge-questions-about-gridlock-gov-hochuls-congestion-pricing-delay>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The bills are not yet law. The streets are not yet safe.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by those in power. Call Senator Krueger. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action, not words. The next body could be yours.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Riders wait for relief.</p><p class=mb3>amNY reported on May 20, 2025, that New York City’s Department of Transportation proposed a dedicated busway for 34th Street between 3rd and 9th Avenues. The plan aims to boost bus speeds by 15% for tens of thousands of daily riders. Private cars and taxis could enter but must turn off at the first legal opportunity. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'After seeing tremendous success on 14th Street where buses have sped up, traffic has virtually disappeared, and far fewer New Yorkers are getting hurt in crashes we are excited to propose a similar design on 34th Street.' The 14th Street busway, launched in 2019, increased bus speeds by up to 24% and reduced crashes. The 34th Street plan seeks similar safety and efficiency gains, with community input shaping the final design.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Bill Weber (R-Rockland) opposed the measure, citing toll burdens and limited transit options. Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger (D-Manhattan) and Transportation Chair Jeremy Cooney (D-Rochester) defended the plan, highlighting increased MTA revenue and minimal impact on local businesses. The matter summary reads: 'State legislators from the suburbs, particularly Republican lawmakers, voiced strong opposition to congestion pricing during the passage of Gov.

The Department of Transportation had planned to open the dedicated walkway on March 16, but the mayor's office intervened, citing the need for a briefing. The lawmakers wrote, 'The reasons given for this delay are not satisfactory, as all communications from the DOT have indicated that the project is complete and ready to open to the public.' They warned, 'Any further delays to this project that is otherwise ready to open will unnecessarily put at risk the thousands of New Yorkers who cycle and walk the current shared path every day.' The project, in the works since at least 2017, remains stalled. Cyclists and pedestrians are forced to share a cramped, hazardous lane. City Hall insists on more review, while advocates plan a protest ribbon-cutting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
