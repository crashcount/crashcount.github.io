Thirty-six left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 1,200 hurt in crashes in the last year alone, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. The dead are old and young. A 90-year-old woman crushed on York Avenue. An 83-year-old struck crossing with the signal on Sixth. Two cyclists, both 67, killed at once on Fifth Avenue. The street does not forgive. The city keeps moving.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>SUVs killed more pedestrians here than any other vehicle.</strong> Cars, trucks, taxis, bikes—they all draw blood. But the pattern is clear: the bigger the vehicle, the deeper the wound, as shown by <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. Delivery workers ride fast to survive. They get tickets, not protection. Cyclists are arrested for minor slips, while drivers who kill walk away. As one protester <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/it-seems-unfair-e-bike-riders-protest-nypd-crackdown-and-criminal-summonses>put it</a>, <em>&ldquo;It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.&rdquo;</em> The system punishes the vulnerable and lets the powerful pass.</p><h3 id=what-has-liz-krueger-done>What Has Liz Krueger Done?</h3><p>Senator Liz Krueger has moved on paper. She <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S5008>co-sponsored a bill to enforce bike lane safety with cameras</a>—targeting drivers who block lanes and endanger cyclists. She also <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S1675>backed a bill to create a public safety rating for cars</a>, shining a light on which vehicles are most deadly to pedestrians. She <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>voted yes on a law to force safer street designs</a>. She <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/06/two-huge-questions-about-gridlock-gov-hochuls-congestion-pricing-delay>called out the governor’s delay of congestion pricing</a> as &ldquo;a staggering error,&rdquo; warning it would leave streets clogged and dangerous. But the deaths keep coming. The bills are not yet law. The lanes are not yet safe.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that work, not just warnings. Demand streets built for people, not just cars. <strong>Every day you wait, another family waits for a call that never should come.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The crash occurred at 17:41 in Manhattan. The report states, 'she stepped off the curb, alone, no signal. A taxi hit her head-on. An SUV rolled over her. Her skull crushed.' The pedestrian was not at an intersection and was crossing without a signal or crosswalk. Both vehicles, a taxi and an SUV, were traveling straight ahead.
