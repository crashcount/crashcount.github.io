Twenty-nine left with injuries that change a life.</strong> In the last year alone, Senate District 28 saw 1,220 people hurt in 2,250 crashes. The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross the street. Five people over 75 did not make it home. Three more between 65 and 74. A 90-year-old woman was killed crossing York Avenue. She was struck by an SUV and a taxi. She never stood a chance. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p>On February 11, an 83-year-old woman was hit by an SUV while crossing with the signal at West 58th and Sixth. She died. The driver was making a left turn. No one called it a crime. No one called it anything at all.</p><p>In Central Park, a man on an e-bike hit a pedestrian in a crosswalk. He flew from his bike, struck his head on the curb, and died. The pedestrian walked away with a cut. The city keeps count. The dead do not. As <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/biker-dies-in-central-park-accident-with-pedestrian-YA4736414>reported by West Side Spirit</a>, &ldquo;A 43 year-old Bronx resident&mldr;died on June 18 after flying from an e-bike and striking his head on the curb.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-weight>Who Bears the Weight</h3><p><strong>Most deaths come from cars and trucks.</strong> SUVs killed eleven. Trucks killed two. Taxis, sedans, and vans add to the toll. Bikes and mopeds hurt, but they do not kill like steel and speed do. The numbers do not lie. The street does not forgive.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>State Senator Liz Krueger has moved on some fronts. She co-sponsored a bill for automated bike lane enforcement, aiming to keep cars out of lanes meant for cyclists. She backed a measure to post pedestrian safety ratings for vehicles. She voted yes on a bill to force safer street designs. She called Governor Hochul’s congestion pricing delay <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/06/two-huge-questions-about-gridlock-gov-hochuls-congestion-pricing-delay>&ldquo;a staggering error&rdquo;</a>, warning it would keep streets clogged and dangerous.</p><p>But the blood keeps coming. The bills are not enough. The dead do not care about press releases.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call Senator Krueger. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against reckless drivers. Demand streets built for people, not for speed.</strong></p><p>Every day you wait, someone else does not come home.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report states the man suffered severe bleeding from the head and sat in shock beneath the lights of Times Square.
