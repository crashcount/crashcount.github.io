An 83-year-old, killed by an SUV turning left as she crossed with the signal at Sixth Avenue. Two cyclists, both 67, ejected and killed in a crash with an SUV on Fifth Avenue. In the last year alone, <strong>11 people died</strong> and <strong>34 suffered serious injuries</strong> on the streets of Senate District 28. The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross the street. The numbers do not flinch: <strong>1,255 injured, 2,279 crashes</strong> in twelve months. The city calls them accidents. The families know better.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p>The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors. They are the ones who walk, ride, and wait for the light to change. Most killed are over 65. Some are children. The streets do not forgive. Cars and SUVs are the main killers—<strong>11 deaths, 21 serious injuries</strong>—but trucks, bikes, and mopeds all leave bodies behind. The city records the wounds. The pavement remembers the rest.</p><h3 id=what-has-liz-krueger-done>What Has Liz Krueger Done?</h3><p>Senator Liz Krueger has moved on some fronts. She voted yes on a bill to force safer street designs, aiming to protect everyone, not just drivers. The bill calls for &ldquo;redesigning streets to protect all users, not just drivers&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>in the legislation</a>. She co-sponsored a bill to put cameras in bike lanes, targeting drivers who block and endanger cyclists <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S5008>with enforcement</a>. She backed a measure to rate cars for pedestrian safety, to show who is most at risk <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S1675>with a new rating system</a>. When Governor Hochul delayed congestion pricing, Krueger called it &ldquo;a staggering error&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/06/two-huge-questions-about-gridlock-gov-hochuls-congestion-pricing-delay>in her statement</a>. She joined others to demand the Queensboro Bridge pedestrian path open now, warning, &ldquo;Any further delays&mldr;will unnecessarily put at risk the thousands of New Yorkers who cycle and walk the current shared path every day&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/09/pols-demand-adams-open-queensboro-bridge-pedestrian-path>in a public letter</a>.</p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The bills move slow. The streets do not wait.</p><h3 id=what-next-the-streets-demand-more>What Next? The Streets Demand More</h3><p><strong>The crisis is not over.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It can redesign every deadly intersection. It can fund protected bike lanes and open the bridges. It can act now. Or it can wait for the next name, the next number, the next family left with nothing but a memory and a patch of blood on the curb.</p><p><strong>Call your leaders. Demand action.</strong> The dead cannot speak. You can. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
