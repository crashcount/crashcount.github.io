She backed bills for safer bike lanes and bus enforcement. She <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/06/two-huge-questions-about-gridlock-gov-hochuls-congestion-pricing-delay>called Governor Hochul’s delay of congestion pricing &ldquo;a staggering error&rdquo;</a>.</p><p>But the blood keeps coming.

The bill, debated in the Senate Finance and Transportation Committees, included $6 billion for MTA capital improvements and supported congestion pricing. Sen. Dean Murray (R-Suffolk) and Sen. Bill Weber (R-Rockland) opposed the measure, citing toll burdens and limited transit options. Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger (D-Manhattan) and Transportation Chair Jeremy Cooney (D-Rochester) defended the plan, highlighting increased MTA revenue and minimal impact on local businesses. The matter summary reads: 'State legislators from the suburbs, particularly Republican lawmakers, voiced strong opposition to congestion pricing during the passage of Gov. Hochul's $254-billion budget in Albany.' The budget passed 40-22, mostly along party lines.

Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On April 9, 2025, seven elected officials—including Council Members Julie Won and Julie Menin—sent a public letter demanding Mayor Adams open the long-promised Queensboro Bridge pedestrian path. The Department of Transportation had planned to open the dedicated walkway on March 16, but the mayor's office intervened, citing the need for a briefing. The lawmakers wrote, 'The reasons given for this delay are not satisfactory, as all communications from the DOT have indicated that the project is complete and ready to open to the public.' They warned, 'Any further delays to this project that is otherwise ready to open will unnecessarily put at risk the thousands of New Yorkers who cycle and walk the current shared path every day.' The project, in the works since at least 2017, remains stalled. Cyclists and pedestrians are forced to share a cramped, hazardous lane. City Hall insists on more review, while advocates plan a protest ribbon-cutting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
