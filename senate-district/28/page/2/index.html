Thirty seriously hurt.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, 1,356 injured, 2,486 crashes. The old and the young, all at risk. Five people over 75 lost their lives. Three more between 65 and 74. A woman, 90, struck crossing York Avenue, did not make it home.</p><p><strong>SUVs and trucks do the most damage.</strong> In this district, SUVs killed eleven, trucks killed two, buses killed one. Bikes and mopeds hurt, but the deadliest machines are always bigger, heavier, faster. The street is not safe for anyone on foot or on two wheels.</p><h3 id=the-policy-response-promises-and-pressure>The Policy Response: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>Senator Liz Krueger has moved on some fronts. She voted yes on a bill to force safer street designs, aiming to protect all users, not just drivers (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>S 9718</a>). She co-sponsored a bill for automated bike lane enforcement, to keep cars out of the lanes meant for cyclists (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S5008>S 5008</a>). She backed a bill for public pedestrian safety ratings for vehicles (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S1675>S 1675</a>). These are steps, not leaps.</p><p>Krueger called Governor Hochul’s delay of congestion pricing &ldquo;a staggering error&rdquo;—a move that keeps streets clogged and dangerous, and leaves transit underfunded. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/06/two-huge-questions-about-gridlock-gov-hochuls-congestion-pricing-delay>&ldquo;A staggering error,&rdquo; she said</a>. She joined others demanding the Queensboro Bridge pedestrian path open now, warning that delay &ldquo;will unnecessarily put at risk the thousands of New Yorkers who cycle and walk the current shared path every day&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/09/pols-demand-adams-open-queensboro-bridge-pedestrian-path>warned Krueger and others</a>.</p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The bills move slow. The streets stay dangerous.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a failure of policy, not fate. The city and state have the tools. They must use them. Lower the speed limit. Build real protection for people outside cars. Enforce the laws that matter—against the drivers who kill, not the people who walk or ride.</p><p><strong>Call your leaders. Demand action.</strong> Do not let another name become a number.
