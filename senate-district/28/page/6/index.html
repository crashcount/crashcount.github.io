Twenty-nine left with injuries that change a life.</strong> In the last year alone, Senate District 28 saw 1,220 people hurt in 2,250 crashes. The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross the street. Five people over 75 did not make it home. Three more between 65 and 74. A 90-year-old woman was killed crossing York Avenue. She was struck by an SUV and a taxi. She never stood a chance. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><p>On February 11, an 83-year-old woman was hit by an SUV while crossing with the signal at West 58th and Sixth. She died. The driver was making a left turn. No one called it a crime. No one called it anything at all.</p><p>In Central Park, a man on an e-bike hit a pedestrian in a crosswalk. He flew from his bike, struck his head on the curb, and died. The pedestrian walked away with a cut. The city keeps count. The dead do not. As <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/biker-dies-in-central-park-accident-with-pedestrian-YA4736414>reported by West Side Spirit</a>, &ldquo;A 43 year-old Bronx resident&mldr;died on June 18 after flying from an e-bike and striking his head on the curb.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-weight>Who Bears the Weight</h3><p><strong>Most deaths come from cars and trucks.</strong> SUVs killed eleven. Trucks killed two. Taxis, sedans, and vans add to the toll. Bikes and mopeds hurt, but they do not kill like steel and speed do. The numbers do not lie. The street does not forgive.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>State Senator Liz Krueger has moved on some fronts. She co-sponsored a bill for automated bike lane enforcement, aiming to keep cars out of lanes meant for cyclists. She backed a measure to post pedestrian safety ratings for vehicles. She voted yes on a bill to force safer street designs. She called Governor Hochul’s congestion pricing delay <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/06/two-huge-questions-about-gridlock-gov-hochuls-congestion-pricing-delay>&ldquo;a staggering error&rdquo;</a>, warning it would keep streets clogged and dangerous.</p><p>But the blood keeps coming. The bills are not enough. The dead do not care about press releases.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Call Senator Krueger. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against reckless drivers. Demand streets built for people, not for speed.</strong></p><p>Every day you wait, someone else does not come home.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Jessica Ramos and colleagues sent a letter to city and state DOTs urging action against the 'demonization' of e-bikes and e-scooters. The letter, signed by Ramos and State Sen. Liz Krueger, demanded more education on safe riding and battery use, warning, 'We cannot allow a narrative to build against a vital, green, and growing mode of transportation.' Ramos criticized City Hall for failing to post speed limits and design streets for e-mobility. Krueger backed battery safety bills, while Councilman Bob Holden pushed for outright bans, citing deaths and injuries. The senators warned that inaction could lead to blanket bans, hitting delivery workers hardest. The city’s plan for safe charging hubs faces local opposition.

"We deserve much wider sidewalks so we can get around, not just comfortably, but safely."" -- Liz Krueger</p><p class=mb3>On October 12, 2022, the Department of Transportation (DOT) will unveil its Third Avenue redesign proposal to a Manhattan panel. The plan marks the Adams administration's first major street project. The current avenue, with seven northbound car lanes, has seen 703 crashes, one pedestrian death, and 198 injuries since 2019. The matter summary calls for 'reallocation of street space, prioritizing cycling, walking, and public transit over cars.' Advocates like Kate Fillin-Yeh (NACTO) and Paul Krikler (Community Board 8) urge protected bike lanes, busways, and wider sidewalks. Krikler says, 'We deserve much wider sidewalks so we can get around, not just comfortably, but safely.' Transportation Alternatives and Community Board 6 echo these demands. The redesign aims to shift space from cars to people, following models like Paris's Rue de Rivoli. The panel's response will shape the future of vulnerable road user safety on Third Avenue.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No reliable test exists for marijuana-impaired drivers. The state scrambles to train officers and find solutions. Crashes rise in states with legal weed. Senator Liz Krueger says tax revenue will fund enforcement. Vulnerable road users face new risks.</p><p class=mb3>On October 9, 2022, New York State, under Governor Hochul, accelerated cannabis legalization and opened retail shops. The Marijuana Regulation & Taxation Act passed in March 2021. The state now faces a gap: 'there are concerns of increased incidences of driving while impaired after cannabis use,' the Department of Health said. Senator Liz Krueger, a key architect, stated, 'Revenue from our legalized system will be used to pay these ongoing costs.' The Department of Health seeks new technology to detect cannabis impairment, as no standard test exists. Nearly 400 officers are trained as drug recognition experts, with thousands more in training. Critics warn DWI issues should have been solved before legalization. As enforcement lags, vulnerable road users face greater danger from impaired drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
