She backed bills for safer bike lanes and bus enforcement. She <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/06/two-huge-questions-about-gridlock-gov-hochuls-congestion-pricing-delay>called Governor Hochul’s delay of congestion pricing &ldquo;a staggering error&rdquo;</a>.</p><p>But the blood keeps coming.
