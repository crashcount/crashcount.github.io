Over four thousand injured.</strong> More than a hundred suffered wounds so grave they will never be the same. These are not numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors. They are the price of inaction.</p><p><strong>Just weeks ago, a cyclist in Central Park hit a pedestrian and died after striking his head on the curb.</strong> The pedestrian walked away with a cut hand. The cyclist did not walk away at all. The <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/biker-dies-in-central-park-accident-with-pedestrian-YA4736414>43-year-old Bronx resident died on June 18 after flying from an e-bike and striking his head on the curb</a>. The NYPD is still investigating. No arrests. No answers. Only another family left with a hole that will not close.</p><p><strong>On York Avenue, a 90-year-old woman was killed crossing the street.</strong> The crash report lists driver inattention and distraction. She was struck by an SUV and a taxi. She did not make it to the other side. No law protected her. No street design slowed the cars.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-risk>Who Bears the Risk</h3><p><strong>The old and the young pay the highest price.</strong> In the last twelve months, five people over 75 died. Three more between 65 and 74. Children are not spared. Forty-three injured, one seriously. The city calls these accidents. But the pattern is clear. <strong>SUVs and cars are the main killers—eleven deaths, hundreds injured.</strong> Trucks and buses killed three. Bikes and mopeds injured, but did not kill, in this period. The street is a gauntlet. The most vulnerable are left to fend for themselves.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-and-stalls>Leadership: Steps and Stalls</h3><p>State Senator Liz Krueger has backed some measures for safer streets. She voted yes on a bill to require speed-limiting devices for repeat dangerous drivers, a move meant to stop the worst offenders. The bill <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>requires the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices if a driver accumulates eleven or more points or receives six speed camera or red light camera tickets during a twelve month period</a>. She co-sponsored bills for automated bike lane enforcement and bus lane cameras. She called the governor’s congestion pricing delay &ldquo;a staggering error,&rdquo; warning it would keep streets clogged and dangerous (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/06/two-huge-questions-about-gridlock-gov-hochuls-congestion-pricing-delay>congestion pricing delay</a>). But the blood on the street says more is needed. <strong>Every delay, every watered-down law, means another family grieves.</strong></p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Call Senator Krueger. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against reckless drivers. Demand streets built for people, not cars.</strong> The toll will not stop until the policies change. The dead cannot speak. You must.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Jessica Ramos and colleagues sent a letter to city and state DOTs urging action against the 'demonization' of e-bikes and e-scooters. The letter, signed by Ramos and State Sen. Liz Krueger, demanded more education on safe riding and battery use, warning, 'We cannot allow a narrative to build against a vital, green, and growing mode of transportation.' Ramos criticized City Hall for failing to post speed limits and design streets for e-mobility. Krueger backed battery safety bills, while Councilman Bob Holden pushed for outright bans, citing deaths and injuries. The senators warned that inaction could lead to blanket bans, hitting delivery workers hardest. The city’s plan for safe charging hubs faces local opposition. DOT claims a 'holistic approach,' but vulnerable riders remain at risk as agencies drag their feet.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
