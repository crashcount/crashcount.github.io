Thirty-six left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 1,200 hurt in crashes in the last year alone, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. The dead are old and young. A 90-year-old woman crushed on York Avenue. An 83-year-old struck crossing with the signal on Sixth. Two cyclists, both 67, killed at once on Fifth Avenue. The street does not forgive. The city keeps moving.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>SUVs killed more pedestrians here than any other vehicle.</strong> Cars, trucks, taxis, bikes—they all draw blood. But the pattern is clear: the bigger the vehicle, the deeper the wound, as shown by <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. Delivery workers ride fast to survive. They get tickets, not protection. Cyclists are arrested for minor slips, while drivers who kill walk away. As one protester <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/it-seems-unfair-e-bike-riders-protest-nypd-crackdown-and-criminal-summonses>put it</a>, <em>&ldquo;It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.&rdquo;</em> The system punishes the vulnerable and lets the powerful pass.</p><h3 id=what-has-liz-krueger-done>What Has Liz Krueger Done?</h3><p>Senator Liz Krueger has moved on paper. She <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S5008>co-sponsored a bill to enforce bike lane safety with cameras</a>—targeting drivers who block lanes and endanger cyclists. She also <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S1675>backed a bill to create a public safety rating for cars</a>, shining a light on which vehicles are most deadly to pedestrians. She <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>voted yes on a law to force safer street designs</a>. She <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/06/two-huge-questions-about-gridlock-gov-hochuls-congestion-pricing-delay>called out the governor’s delay of congestion pricing</a> as &ldquo;a staggering error,&rdquo; warning it would leave streets clogged and dangerous. But the deaths keep coming. The bills are not yet law. The lanes are not yet safe.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that work, not just warnings. Demand streets built for people, not just cars. <strong>Every day you wait, another family waits for a call that never should come.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Vulnerable riders pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On March 2, 2023, State Sen. Jessica Ramos and colleagues sent a letter to city and state DOTs urging action against the 'demonization' of e-bikes and e-scooters. The letter, signed by Ramos and State Sen. Liz Krueger, demanded more education on safe riding and battery use, warning, 'We cannot allow a narrative to build against a vital, green, and growing mode of transportation.' Ramos criticized City Hall for failing to post speed limits and design streets for e-mobility. Krueger backed battery safety bills, while Councilman Bob Holden pushed for outright bans, citing deaths and injuries. The senators warned that inaction could lead to blanket bans, hitting delivery workers hardest. The city’s plan for safe charging hubs faces local opposition. DOT claims a 'holistic approach,' but vulnerable riders remain at risk as agencies drag their feet.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary calls for 'reallocation of street space, prioritizing cycling, walking, and public transit over cars.' Advocates like Kate Fillin-Yeh (NACTO) and Paul Krikler (Community Board 8) urge protected bike lanes, busways, and wider sidewalks. Krikler says, 'We deserve much wider sidewalks so we can get around, not just comfortably, but safely.' Transportation Alternatives and Community Board 6 echo these demands.

The event, hosted by State Senator Liz Krueger, featured DOT Manhattan Borough Commissioner Ed Pincar, who said, “We are looking very closely… we may be able to present a proposal maybe even later this year.” The redesign aims to transform Third Avenue into a safer boulevard with fewer car lanes, more bus lanes, a separated bike path, and wider sidewalks. Council Member Gale Brewer and advocates like Paul Krikler have long demanded these changes. Krueger and the NYPD, however, focused on enforcement against cyclists and e-bike riders, citing constituent concerns. Krueger has previously pushed for harsher penalties for electric-vehicle riders. NYPD data shows more enforcement against cyclists than drivers, even though drivers cause most injuries. No formal safety analysis was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
