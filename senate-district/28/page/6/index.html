Over twelve hundred injured.</strong> That’s the cost of traffic violence in Senate District 28 in the last year alone. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors. An 83-year-old woman, crossing with the signal at West 58th and Sixth, struck and killed by an SUV making a left turn. A 90-year-old woman, crushed by a taxi and an SUV on York Avenue. Two cyclists, both 67, ejected and killed on Fifth Avenue. The street does not forgive.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-no-one-is-safe>Recent Crashes: No One Is Safe</h3><p>The carnage does not slow. In February, a Tesla sedan on the FDR Drive crashed at speed. The driver, a woman, was ejected and killed. On East 72nd, a pedestrian was killed by a taxi and SUV, her body broken in the crosswalk. The city’s own data shows the pattern: <strong>SUVs and cars are the main killers, with 11 deaths and hundreds of injuries</strong>. Trucks and buses follow. Bikes and mopeds injure, but they do not kill like steel and glass do. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h3><p>State Senator Liz Krueger has moved on safety. She voted yes on a bill to force safer street design for all users, not just drivers. The bill’s aim is clear: <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>&ldquo;safer streets for people on foot, on bikes, and in vehicles.&rdquo;</a> Krueger also co-sponsored <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S5008>a bill for automated bike lane enforcement</a>, targeting drivers who block the only safe space for cyclists. She backed <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S1675>a law to rate cars for pedestrian safety</a>, to shine a light on the danger at the curb. But the work is not done. The deaths keep coming.</p><p>Krueger has not been silent on the failures of leadership above her. When Governor Hochul delayed congestion pricing, Krueger <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/06/two-huge-questions-about-gridlock-gov-hochuls-congestion-pricing-delay>called it &ldquo;a staggering error&rdquo;</a> and warned it would leave the streets clogged and dangerous. But bills and words are not enough. The blood on the street is not washed away by votes.</p><h3 id=the-call-demand-more-demand-it-now>The Call: Demand More, Demand It Now</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a failure. Call Senator Krueger. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand automated enforcement for bike lanes. Demand that every street is built for the child crossing, not the car speeding. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
