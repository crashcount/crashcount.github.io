The news said, <strong>&ldquo;There is no word on the cause of the crash. So far, no charges have been filed&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/2-vehicle-crash-upper-east-side-scaffolding-injures-8-people-manhattan/17376667/>ABC7</a>). No one died that morning, but the street was left broken, and so were the people who walked it.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>12 people died</strong> and <strong>1,562 were injured</strong> in crashes across Senate District 28. <strong>Thirty-five suffered serious injuries</strong>—the kind that do not heal. The dead are old and young. A 90-year-old woman was killed crossing York Avenue (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Two cyclists, both 67, died together on Fifth Avenue. The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie.</p><h3 id=the-system-grinds-on>The System Grinds On</h3><p>The violence is not random. Cars, SUVs, trucks, taxis—they do the most harm. In this district, <strong>cars and trucks injured or killed over 900 people</strong>. Bikes and mopeds hurt fewer, but the street is not safe for anyone. The city adds more lanes, more speed, more risk. The sidewalk is no refuge. The crosswalk is no shield.</p><h3 id=senator-krueger-votes-and-silence>Senator Krueger: Votes and Silence</h3><p>State Senator Liz Krueger has voted for some measures that matter. She <strong>co-sponsored the Stop Super Speeders Act</strong>, which would force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). She voted to extend school speed zones, trying to keep children safe. She called the governor’s delay of congestion pricing <strong>&ldquo;a staggering error&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/06/two-huge-questions-about-gridlock-gov-hochuls-congestion-pricing-delay>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>But the blood keeps flowing. The bills move slow. The streets do not wait.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Call Senator Krueger. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat offenders. Demand streets built for people, not cars.</strong></p><p>Every day of delay is another name on the list. The street does not forgive. Neither should you.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The debate, reported by Gothamist, centers on whether a lower toll could unfreeze the program while still funding the MTA. Hoylman-Sigal said, "Nobody's wedded to $15. We are wedded to the improvements that congestion pricing will provide for mass transit or safety on our streets for cleaner air." Sen. Liz Krueger is open to a new fee if it raises $1 billion yearly. Sen. Jabari Brisport criticized the lack of study and feedback in the process, calling it "irresponsible." Any change needs legislative, MTA, and federal approval. Trump has promised to end congestion pricing if elected.

The plan, designed to charge most drivers $15 to enter Manhattan below 60th Street, would have funded $15 billion in MTA capital improvements. The bill’s summary warns: 'No plan B for transit investments should congestion pricing not go through.' Senator Liz Krueger, mentioned in the debate, criticized the lack of alternative funding, saying, 'She is not aware of what she is referring to or where she believes that money will come from.' The delay leaves critical projects—like subway accessibility, new signals, and electric buses—unfunded. Without this money, vulnerable riders face more delays, breakdowns, and unsafe conditions. The City Council and transit advocates express deep disappointment and concern for New York’s future.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The state-level response included a rejected proposal to raise the payroll mobility tax (PMT) on NYC businesses to fill the $15 billion gap in the MTA’s capital plan. State Sen. Liz Krueger said, 'Payroll mobility taxes are actually taxes on workers... I do not think we have an appetite for that in the Senate.' Assembly Member Stacey Pheffer Amato, who once voted for congestion pricing, now supports the pause, calling the original vote 'political blackmail.' The MTA’s future projects, including the Second Avenue Subway, are threatened, as federal matching funds require local dollars. Lawmakers remain divided. No clear alternative has emerged.

Liz Krueger (District 28) and other lawmakers responded to a proposed New York City tax hike meant to replace the indefinitely postponed $15 congestion pricing tolls. The measure, debated as Bill 28, has not advanced in committee and faces strong opposition. The matter, described as 'a last-minute funding move that drew fierce opposition,' has Krueger stating, 'I think it does not have support.' Assemblyman Brian Cunningham echoed, 'No new taxes.' The proposal would raise the payroll mobility tax, already increased last year, to fund the MTA. Rep. Jerry Nadler and business groups argue the tax unfairly targets NYC, while congestion pricing would have spread costs regionally. With the legislative session ending, MTA projects remain at risk.
