Projects for safer, more accessible transit hang in the balance. Albany leaders mostly stay silent.</p><p class=mb3>On July 24, 2024, State Sen. Jeremy Cooney, new chair of the Senate Transportation Committee, issued a public demand for Governor Hochul to deliver a '100-day plan' to replace the $16.5 billion MTA funding shortfall caused by her cancellation of congestion pricing. In his op-ed, Cooney wrote, 'the time for debating the merits of congestion pricing has passed,' urging the governor to convene finance, labor, and passenger representatives to find a solution. Cooney’s push comes as the MTA faces threats to station accessibility, signal upgrades, and new trains and buses. Other Albany leaders, including Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and Senate President Andrea Stewart-Cousins, have offered little response. Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger called Hochul’s move illegal. The bill or action is not numbered, but the committee involved is the Senate Transportation Committee. No direct safety analyst note was provided, but the loss of funding jeopardizes projects vital to vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Liz Krueger is open to a new fee if it raises $1 billion yearly. Sen. Jabari Brisport criticized the lack of study and feedback in the process, calling it "irresponsible."

The report states the cyclist was ejected, landed headfirst, and suffered severe bleeding. Police describe the victim as conscious at the scene, with blood pooling on the pavement. According to the police report, the SUV driver was distracted and failed to maintain proper lane usage. 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' are listed as contributing factors. The report notes the cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this is mentioned only after the driver’s errors. The crash underscores the danger posed by inattentive driving and improper lane use on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The plan, designed to charge most drivers $15 to enter Manhattan below 60th Street, would have funded $15 billion in MTA capital improvements. The bill’s summary warns: 'No plan B for transit investments should congestion pricing not go through.' Senator Liz Krueger, mentioned in the debate, criticized the lack of alternative funding, saying, 'She is not aware of what she is referring to or where she believes that money will come from.' The delay leaves critical projects—like subway accessibility, new signals, and electric buses—unfunded. Without this money, vulnerable riders face more delays, breakdowns, and unsafe conditions.

Assembly Member Stacey Pheffer Amato, who once voted for congestion pricing, now supports the pause, calling the original vote 'political blackmail.'

Liz Krueger (District 28) and other lawmakers responded to a proposed New York City tax hike meant to replace the indefinitely postponed $15 congestion pricing tolls. The measure, debated as Bill 28, has not advanced in committee and faces strong opposition. The matter, described as 'a last-minute funding move that drew fierce opposition,' has Krueger stating, 'I think it does not have support.' Assemblyman Brian Cunningham echoed, 'No new taxes.' The proposal would raise the payroll mobility tax, already increased last year, to fund the MTA. Rep. Jerry Nadler and business groups argue the tax unfairly targets NYC, while congestion pricing would have spread costs regionally. With the legislative session ending, MTA projects remain at risk.
