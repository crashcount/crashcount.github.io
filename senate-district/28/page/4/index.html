Thirty-six left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 1,200 hurt in crashes in the last year alone, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. The dead are old and young. A 90-year-old woman crushed on York Avenue. An 83-year-old struck crossing with the signal on Sixth. Two cyclists, both 67, killed at once on Fifth Avenue. The street does not forgive. The city keeps moving.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>SUVs killed more pedestrians here than any other vehicle.</strong> Cars, trucks, taxis, bikes—they all draw blood. But the pattern is clear: the bigger the vehicle, the deeper the wound, as shown by <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. Delivery workers ride fast to survive. They get tickets, not protection. Cyclists are arrested for minor slips, while drivers who kill walk away. As one protester <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/it-seems-unfair-e-bike-riders-protest-nypd-crackdown-and-criminal-summonses>put it</a>, <em>&ldquo;It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.&rdquo;</em> The system punishes the vulnerable and lets the powerful pass.</p><h3 id=what-has-liz-krueger-done>What Has Liz Krueger Done?</h3><p>Senator Liz Krueger has moved on paper. She <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S5008>co-sponsored a bill to enforce bike lane safety with cameras</a>—targeting drivers who block lanes and endanger cyclists. She also <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S1675>backed a bill to create a public safety rating for cars</a>, shining a light on which vehicles are most deadly to pedestrians. She <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>voted yes on a law to force safer street designs</a>. She <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/06/two-huge-questions-about-gridlock-gov-hochuls-congestion-pricing-delay>called out the governor’s delay of congestion pricing</a> as &ldquo;a staggering error,&rdquo; warning it would leave streets clogged and dangerous. But the deaths keep coming. The bills are not yet law. The lanes are not yet safe.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that work, not just warnings. Demand streets built for people, not just cars. <strong>Every day you wait, another family waits for a call that never should come.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Gridlock wins.</p><p class=mb3>On June 6, 2024, Senator Liz Krueger (District 28) condemned Governor Hochul’s last-minute reversal on congestion pricing. The policy, approved by the MTA Board and set for June 30, now faces indefinite delay. Krueger called the decision 'a staggering error' that creates a financial crisis for the MTA. The matter at hand: 'Gov. Hochul revoked her support for congestion pricing less than a month before it was supposed to start.' Assembly Member Robert Carroll also criticized the governor, rejecting her proposal to hike the payroll mobility tax on city businesses. The MTA’s capital plan now faces a $15 billion shortfall, with no replacement funding in sight. The delay leaves vulnerable road users exposed, as congestion pricing aimed to cut traffic and fund safer transit. The council’s response is clear: the city needs congestion pricing, now.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, set to start June 30, would have charged drivers $15 to enter below 60th Street, raising $1 billion yearly for transit. Hochul proposed a payroll tax hike instead, but State Senator Liz Krueger opposed it, saying, "I do not think we have an appetite for that in the Senate." The bill’s fate is uncertain as the legislative session ends. The MTA board, city officials, and business groups all voiced concern. Projects like the Second Avenue Subway, subway accessibility, and zero-emission buses now face cancellation. No alternative funding plan exists. Vulnerable riders—those who rely on transit—stand to lose the most.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
