Over twelve hundred injured.</strong> That’s the cost of traffic violence in Senate District 28 in the last year alone. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors. An 83-year-old woman, crossing with the signal at West 58th and Sixth, struck and killed by an SUV making a left turn. A 90-year-old woman, crushed by a taxi and an SUV on York Avenue. Two cyclists, both 67, ejected and killed on Fifth Avenue. The street does not forgive.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-no-one-is-safe>Recent Crashes: No One Is Safe</h3><p>The carnage does not slow. In February, a Tesla sedan on the FDR Drive crashed at speed. The driver, a woman, was ejected and killed. On East 72nd, a pedestrian was killed by a taxi and SUV, her body broken in the crosswalk. The city’s own data shows the pattern: <strong>SUVs and cars are the main killers, with 11 deaths and hundreds of injuries</strong>. Trucks and buses follow. Bikes and mopeds injure, but they do not kill like steel and glass do. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h3><p>State Senator Liz Krueger has moved on safety. She voted yes on a bill to force safer street design for all users, not just drivers. The bill’s aim is clear: <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>&ldquo;safer streets for people on foot, on bikes, and in vehicles.&rdquo;</a> Krueger also co-sponsored <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S5008>a bill for automated bike lane enforcement</a>, targeting drivers who block the only safe space for cyclists. She backed <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S1675>a law to rate cars for pedestrian safety</a>, to shine a light on the danger at the curb. But the work is not done. The deaths keep coming.</p><p>Krueger has not been silent on the failures of leadership above her. When Governor Hochul delayed congestion pricing, Krueger <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/06/two-huge-questions-about-gridlock-gov-hochuls-congestion-pricing-delay>called it &ldquo;a staggering error&rdquo;</a> and warned it would leave the streets clogged and dangerous. But bills and words are not enough. The blood on the street is not washed away by votes.</p><h3 id=the-call-demand-more-demand-it-now>The Call: Demand More, Demand It Now</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a failure. Call Senator Krueger. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand automated enforcement for bike lanes. Demand that every street is built for the child crossing, not the car speeding. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' are listed as contributing factors. The report notes the cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this is mentioned only after the driver’s errors.

The plan, designed to charge most drivers $15 to enter Manhattan below 60th Street, would have funded $15 billion in MTA capital improvements. The bill’s summary warns: 'No plan B for transit investments should congestion pricing not go through.' Senator Liz Krueger, mentioned in the debate, criticized the lack of alternative funding, saying, 'She is not aware of what she is referring to or where she believes that money will come from.' The delay leaves critical projects—like subway accessibility, new signals, and electric buses—unfunded. Without this money, vulnerable riders face more delays, breakdowns, and unsafe conditions.

Liz Krueger (District 28) and other lawmakers responded to a proposed New York City tax hike meant to replace the indefinitely postponed $15 congestion pricing tolls. The measure, debated as Bill 28, has not advanced in committee and faces strong opposition. The matter, described as 'a last-minute funding move that drew fierce opposition,' has Krueger stating, 'I think it does not have support.' Assemblyman Brian Cunningham echoed, 'No new taxes.' The proposal would raise the payroll mobility tax, already increased last year, to fund the MTA. Rep. Jerry Nadler and business groups argue the tax unfairly targets NYC, while congestion pricing would have spread costs regionally. With the legislative session ending, MTA projects remain at risk. No safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Liz Krueger said, 'Payroll mobility taxes are actually taxes on workers... I do not think we have an appetite for that in the Senate.' Assembly Member Stacey Pheffer Amato, who once voted for congestion pricing, now supports the pause, calling the original vote 'political blackmail.'

The policy, approved by the MTA Board and set for June 30, now faces indefinite delay. Krueger called the decision 'a staggering error' that creates a financial crisis for the MTA. The matter at hand: 'Gov. Hochul revoked her support for congestion pricing less than a month before it was supposed to start.' Assembly Member Robert Carroll also criticized the governor, rejecting her proposal to hike the payroll mobility tax on city businesses. The MTA’s capital plan now faces a $15 billion shortfall, with no replacement funding in sight. The delay leaves vulnerable road users exposed, as congestion pricing aimed to cut traffic and fund safer transit. The council’s response is clear: the city needs congestion pricing, now.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, set to start June 30, would have charged drivers $15 to enter below 60th Street, raising $1 billion yearly for transit. Hochul proposed a payroll tax hike instead, but State Senator Liz Krueger opposed it, saying, "I do not think we have an appetite for that in the Senate." The bill’s fate is uncertain as the legislative session ends. The MTA board, city officials, and business groups all voiced concern. Projects like the Second Avenue Subway, subway accessibility, and zero-emission buses now face cancellation. No alternative funding plan exists.
