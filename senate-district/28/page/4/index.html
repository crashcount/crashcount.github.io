Since January 2022, 26 people have died and 4,176 have been injured in 8,183 crashes. Among them: children, elders, cyclists, pedestrians. One hundred six suffered serious injuries. Each number is a body. Each body is a life changed or ended.</p><p>Just this year, deaths have more than tripled compared to last year. Ten people are already gone. Serious injuries are down, but the dead do not heal.</p><h3 id=the-recent-blood-on-the-streets>The Recent Blood on the Streets</h3><p>On February 5, a 90-year-old woman was killed crossing York Avenue. She was struck by an SUV and a taxi. The crash report lists &ldquo;driver inattention/distraction&rdquo; as a cause. She died in the street, crushed. See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash records</a>.</p><p>On February 11, an 83-year-old woman was killed at the intersection of Avenue of the Americas and 58th. She was crossing with the signal. The SUV turned left. She did not make it to the other side. See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash records</a>.</p><p>On February 4, a woman was ejected and killed on the FDR Drive.

She co-sponsored and voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed limiters. The bill targets those who rack up violations and points, aiming to keep killers off the road. As the bill summary states, the legislation <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>targets drivers with a pattern of violations, seeking to cut risk for pedestrians and cyclists by limiting repeat speeding</a>.</p><p>Krueger also backed the extension of school speed zones, a move to protect children walking to class. She <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted yes to extend school speed zones, improving child pedestrian safety</a>.</p><p>But the carnage continues. Bills move slow. Streets change slower. The dead do not wait.</p><h3 id=the-fight-ahead>The Fight Ahead</h3><p>The bodies pile up. The numbers grow. The only thing that stops this is action. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph citywide speed limit. Demand the city use the power it has. Demand the state pass the Stop Super Speeders Act.</p><p>Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The debate, reported by Gothamist, centers on whether a lower toll could unfreeze the program while still funding the MTA. Hoylman-Sigal said, "Nobody's wedded to $15. We are wedded to the improvements that congestion pricing will provide for mass transit or safety on our streets for cleaner air." Sen. Liz Krueger is open to a new fee if it raises $1 billion yearly. Sen. Jabari Brisport criticized the lack of study and feedback in the process, calling it "irresponsible." Any change needs legislative, MTA, and federal approval. Trump has promised to end congestion pricing if elected.

The bill’s summary warns: 'No plan B for transit investments should congestion pricing not go through.' Senator Liz Krueger, mentioned in the debate, criticized the lack of alternative funding, saying, 'She is not aware of what she is referring to or where she believes that money will come from.' The delay leaves critical projects—like subway accessibility, new signals, and electric buses—unfunded. Without this money, vulnerable riders face more delays, breakdowns, and unsafe conditions.

The state-level response included a rejected proposal to raise the payroll mobility tax (PMT) on NYC businesses to fill the $15 billion gap in the MTA’s capital plan. State Sen. Liz Krueger said, 'Payroll mobility taxes are actually taxes on workers... I do not think we have an appetite for that in the Senate.' Assembly Member Stacey Pheffer Amato, who once voted for congestion pricing, now supports the pause, calling the original vote 'political blackmail.' The MTA’s future projects, including the Second Avenue Subway, are threatened, as federal matching funds require local dollars. Lawmakers remain divided. No clear alternative has emerged. Vulnerable road users are left exposed as transit funding falters.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The policy, approved by the MTA Board and set for June 30, now faces indefinite delay. Krueger called the decision 'a staggering error' that creates a financial crisis for the MTA. The matter at hand: 'Gov. Hochul revoked her support for congestion pricing less than a month before it was supposed to start.' Assembly Member Robert Carroll also criticized the governor, rejecting her proposal to hike the payroll mobility tax on city businesses. The MTA’s capital plan now faces a $15 billion shortfall, with no replacement funding in sight. The delay leaves vulnerable road users exposed, as congestion pricing aimed to cut traffic and fund safer transit. The council’s response is clear: the city needs congestion pricing, now.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Liz Krueger (District 28) and other lawmakers responded to a proposed New York City tax hike meant to replace the indefinitely postponed $15 congestion pricing tolls. The measure, debated as Bill 28, has not advanced in committee and faces strong opposition. The matter, described as 'a last-minute funding move that drew fierce opposition,' has Krueger stating, 'I think it does not have support.' Assemblyman Brian Cunningham echoed, 'No new taxes.' The proposal would raise the payroll mobility tax, already increased last year, to fund the MTA. Rep. Jerry Nadler and business groups argue the tax unfairly targets NYC, while congestion pricing would have spread costs regionally. With the legislative session ending, MTA projects remain at risk. No safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Hochul proposed a payroll tax hike instead, but State Senator Liz Krueger opposed it, saying, "I do not think we have an appetite for that in the Senate." The bill’s fate is uncertain as the legislative session ends. The MTA board, city officials, and business groups all voiced concern.
