Thirty seriously hurt.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, 1,356 injured, 2,486 crashes. The old and the young, all at risk. Five people over 75 lost their lives. Three more between 65 and 74. A woman, 90, struck crossing York Avenue, did not make it home.</p><p><strong>SUVs and trucks do the most damage.</strong> In this district, SUVs killed eleven, trucks killed two, buses killed one. Bikes and mopeds hurt, but the deadliest machines are always bigger, heavier, faster. The street is not safe for anyone on foot or on two wheels.</p><h3 id=the-policy-response-promises-and-pressure>The Policy Response: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>Senator Liz Krueger has moved on some fronts. She voted yes on a bill to force safer street designs, aiming to protect all users, not just drivers (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>S 9718</a>). She co-sponsored a bill for automated bike lane enforcement, to keep cars out of the lanes meant for cyclists (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S5008>S 5008</a>). She backed a bill for public pedestrian safety ratings for vehicles (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S1675>S 1675</a>). These are steps, not leaps.</p><p>Krueger called Governor Hochul’s delay of congestion pricing &ldquo;a staggering error&rdquo;—a move that keeps streets clogged and dangerous, and leaves transit underfunded. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/06/two-huge-questions-about-gridlock-gov-hochuls-congestion-pricing-delay>&ldquo;A staggering error,&rdquo; she said</a>. She joined others demanding the Queensboro Bridge pedestrian path open now, warning that delay &ldquo;will unnecessarily put at risk the thousands of New Yorkers who cycle and walk the current shared path every day&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/09/pols-demand-adams-open-queensboro-bridge-pedestrian-path>warned Krueger and others</a>.</p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The bills move slow. The streets stay dangerous.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a failure of policy, not fate. The city and state have the tools. They must use them. Lower the speed limit. Build real protection for people outside cars. Enforce the laws that matter—against the drivers who kill, not the people who walk or ride.</p><p><strong>Call your leaders. Demand action.</strong> Do not let another name become a number.

The plan, designed to charge most drivers $15 to enter Manhattan below 60th Street, would have funded $15 billion in MTA capital improvements. The bill’s summary warns: 'No plan B for transit investments should congestion pricing not go through.' Senator Liz Krueger, mentioned in the debate, criticized the lack of alternative funding, saying, 'She is not aware of what she is referring to or where she believes that money will come from.' The delay leaves critical projects—like subway accessibility, new signals, and electric buses—unfunded. Without this money, vulnerable riders face more delays, breakdowns, and unsafe conditions. The City Council and transit advocates express deep disappointment and concern for New York’s future.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The state-level response included a rejected proposal to raise the payroll mobility tax (PMT) on NYC businesses to fill the $15 billion gap in the MTA’s capital plan. State Sen. Liz Krueger said, 'Payroll mobility taxes are actually taxes on workers... I do not think we have an appetite for that in the Senate.' Assembly Member Stacey Pheffer Amato, who once voted for congestion pricing, now supports the pause, calling the original vote 'political blackmail.'

The matter at hand: 'Gov. Hochul revoked her support for congestion pricing less than a month before it was supposed to start.' Assembly Member Robert Carroll also criticized the governor, rejecting her proposal to hike the payroll mobility tax on city businesses. The MTA’s capital plan now faces a $15 billion shortfall, with no replacement funding in sight.

Liz Krueger (District 28) and other lawmakers responded to a proposed New York City tax hike meant to replace the indefinitely postponed $15 congestion pricing tolls. The measure, debated as Bill 28, has not advanced in committee and faces strong opposition. The matter, described as 'a last-minute funding move that drew fierce opposition,' has Krueger stating, 'I think it does not have support.' Assemblyman Brian Cunningham echoed, 'No new taxes.' The proposal would raise the payroll mobility tax, already increased last year, to fund the MTA. Rep. Jerry Nadler and business groups argue the tax unfairly targets NYC, while congestion pricing would have spread costs regionally. With the legislative session ending, MTA projects remain at risk.
