Twenty-nine were left with injuries so grave they may never walk the same. The dead are old and young. Five were over 75. Three were between 65 and 74. One was a child. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are careful or quick.</p><p>Just this June, a cyclist was thrown from his e-bike in Central Park. He struck his head on the curb and died. The city called it an accident. The <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/biker-dies-in-central-park-accident-with-pedestrian-YA4736414>West Side Spirit wrote</a>, &ldquo;A 43 year-old Bronx resident&mldr; died on June 18 after flying from an e-bike and striking his head on the curb.&rdquo; The pedestrian he hit walked away with a scraped hand. The cyclist did not walk away at all.</p><p>On York Avenue, a 90-year-old woman was killed crossing the street. She was hit by an SUV and a taxi. She never made it to the other side. The data says she was crossing without a signal. The data does not say if she was in a hurry, or if she was tired, or if she was thinking about dinner.</p><h2 id=who-bears-the-weight>Who Bears the Weight</h2><p><strong>Cars and trucks do most of the killing.</strong> In three years, SUVs and sedans took eleven lives and left hundreds battered. Trucks and buses killed three. Bikes and mopeds hurt many, but killed none. The numbers are clear. The danger is not shared equally.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>State Senator Liz Krueger has voted for bills to slow repeat speeders and fund safer streets. She backed the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, which would force the worst drivers to install speed-limiting tech. She co-sponsored bills for <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S3304>bike lane enforcement</a> and <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S153>bus lane cameras</a>. She called Governor Hochul’s congestion pricing delay <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/06/two-huge-questions-about-gridlock-gov-hochuls-congestion-pricing-delay>&ldquo;a staggering error&rdquo;</a>.</p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not. The most dangerous drivers still roam free. The bridge path stays closed. The sidewalk is still too narrow. The curb is still too high.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>Call your council member. Call Senator Krueger. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand the city open safe paths and redesign deadly streets.</strong> The numbers will not change until the streets do. The dead will not come back. The living can still be saved.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Senator Liz Krueger called it reckless. The move leaves a $15 billion hole in MTA funding. No clear replacement plan. Riders and streets hang in the balance. Gridlock wins.</p><p class=mb3>On June 6, 2024, Senator Liz Krueger (District 28) condemned Governor Hochul’s last-minute reversal on congestion pricing. The policy, approved by the MTA Board and set for June 30, now faces indefinite delay. Krueger called the decision 'a staggering error' that creates a financial crisis for the MTA. The matter at hand: 'Gov. Hochul revoked her support for congestion pricing less than a month before it was supposed to start.' Assembly Member Robert Carroll also criticized the governor, rejecting her proposal to hike the payroll mobility tax on city businesses. The MTA’s capital plan now faces a $15 billion shortfall, with no replacement funding in sight. The delay leaves vulnerable road users exposed, as congestion pricing aimed to cut traffic and fund safer transit. The council’s response is clear: the city needs congestion pricing, now.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Transit funding hangs in limbo. Liz Krueger says the tax lacks support. Riders and workers face uncertainty as lawmakers reject new burdens and demand fairer solutions.</p><p class=mb3>On June 6, 2024, State Sen. Liz Krueger (District 28) and other lawmakers responded to a proposed New York City tax hike meant to replace the indefinitely postponed $15 congestion pricing tolls. The measure, debated as Bill 28, has not advanced in committee and faces strong opposition. The matter, described as 'a last-minute funding move that drew fierce opposition,' has Krueger stating, 'I think it does not have support.' Assemblyman Brian Cunningham echoed, 'No new taxes.' The proposal would raise the payroll mobility tax, already increased last year, to fund the MTA. Rep. Jerry Nadler and business groups argue the tax unfairly targets NYC, while congestion pricing would have spread costs regionally. With the legislative session ending, MTA projects remain at risk. No safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, set to start June 30, would have charged drivers $15 to enter below 60th Street, raising $1 billion yearly for transit. Hochul proposed a payroll tax hike instead, but State Senator Liz Krueger opposed it, saying, "I do not think we have an appetite for that in the Senate." The bill’s fate is uncertain as the legislative session ends. The MTA board, city officials, and business groups all voiced concern. Projects like the Second Avenue Subway, subway accessibility, and zero-emission buses now face cancellation. No alternative funding plan exists.

The impact left her with severe lacerations to her lower leg, and blood pooled at the scene. The report states the e-scooter’s front end was damaged and the rider did not stop. Police cite 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Driver Inexperience' as contributing factors. The pedestrian’s actions—crossing with the light in the marked crosswalk—are noted in the report, but only after the driver’s failures. The collision underscores the consequences of inattentive and unskilled operation of motorized vehicles in city crosswalks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
