Over four thousand injured.</strong> More than a hundred suffered wounds so grave they will never be the same. These are not numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors. They are the price of inaction.</p><p><strong>Just weeks ago, a cyclist in Central Park hit a pedestrian and died after striking his head on the curb.</strong> The pedestrian walked away with a cut hand. The cyclist did not walk away at all. The <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/biker-dies-in-central-park-accident-with-pedestrian-YA4736414>43-year-old Bronx resident died on June 18 after flying from an e-bike and striking his head on the curb</a>. The NYPD is still investigating. No arrests. No answers. Only another family left with a hole that will not close.</p><p><strong>On York Avenue, a 90-year-old woman was killed crossing the street.</strong> The crash report lists driver inattention and distraction. She was struck by an SUV and a taxi. She did not make it to the other side. No law protected her. No street design slowed the cars.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-risk>Who Bears the Risk</h3><p><strong>The old and the young pay the highest price.</strong> In the last twelve months, five people over 75 died. Three more between 65 and 74. Children are not spared. Forty-three injured, one seriously. The city calls these accidents. But the pattern is clear. <strong>SUVs and cars are the main killers—eleven deaths, hundreds injured.</strong> Trucks and buses killed three. Bikes and mopeds injured, but did not kill, in this period. The street is a gauntlet. The most vulnerable are left to fend for themselves.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-and-stalls>Leadership: Steps and Stalls</h3><p>State Senator Liz Krueger has backed some measures for safer streets. She voted yes on a bill to require speed-limiting devices for repeat dangerous drivers, a move meant to stop the worst offenders. The bill <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>requires the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices if a driver accumulates eleven or more points or receives six speed camera or red light camera tickets during a twelve month period</a>. She co-sponsored bills for automated bike lane enforcement and bus lane cameras. She called the governor’s congestion pricing delay &ldquo;a staggering error,&rdquo; warning it would keep streets clogged and dangerous (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/06/two-huge-questions-about-gridlock-gov-hochuls-congestion-pricing-delay>congestion pricing delay</a>). But the blood on the street says more is needed. <strong>Every delay, every watered-down law, means another family grieves.</strong></p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Call Senator Krueger. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against reckless drivers. Demand streets built for people, not cars.</strong> The toll will not stop until the policies change. The dead cannot speak. You must.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
