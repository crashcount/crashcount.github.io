Thirty-six left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 1,200 hurt in crashes in the last year alone, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. The dead are old and young. A 90-year-old woman crushed on York Avenue. An 83-year-old struck crossing with the signal on Sixth. Two cyclists, both 67, killed at once on Fifth Avenue. The street does not forgive. The city keeps moving.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>SUVs killed more pedestrians here than any other vehicle.</strong> Cars, trucks, taxis, bikes—they all draw blood. But the pattern is clear: the bigger the vehicle, the deeper the wound, as shown by <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. Delivery workers ride fast to survive. They get tickets, not protection. Cyclists are arrested for minor slips, while drivers who kill walk away. As one protester <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/it-seems-unfair-e-bike-riders-protest-nypd-crackdown-and-criminal-summonses>put it</a>, <em>&ldquo;It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.&rdquo;</em> The system punishes the vulnerable and lets the powerful pass.</p><h3 id=what-has-liz-krueger-done>What Has Liz Krueger Done?</h3><p>Senator Liz Krueger has moved on paper. She <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S5008>co-sponsored a bill to enforce bike lane safety with cameras</a>—targeting drivers who block lanes and endanger cyclists. She also <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S1675>backed a bill to create a public safety rating for cars</a>, shining a light on which vehicles are most deadly to pedestrians. She <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>voted yes on a law to force safer street designs</a>. She <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/06/two-huge-questions-about-gridlock-gov-hochuls-congestion-pricing-delay>called out the governor’s delay of congestion pricing</a> as &ldquo;a staggering error,&rdquo; warning it would leave streets clogged and dangerous. But the deaths keep coming. The bills are not yet law. The lanes are not yet safe.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that work, not just warnings. Demand streets built for people, not just cars. <strong>Every day you wait, another family waits for a call that never should come.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Liz Krueger is open to a new fee if it raises $1 billion yearly. Sen. Jabari Brisport criticized the lack of study and feedback in the process, calling it "irresponsible."

The bill’s summary warns: 'No plan B for transit investments should congestion pricing not go through.' Senator Liz Krueger, mentioned in the debate, criticized the lack of alternative funding, saying, 'She is not aware of what she is referring to or where she believes that money will come from.' The delay leaves critical projects—like subway accessibility, new signals, and electric buses—unfunded. Without this money, vulnerable riders face more delays, breakdowns, and unsafe conditions.

Riders and workers face uncertainty as lawmakers reject new burdens and demand fairer solutions.</p><p class=mb3>On June 6, 2024, State Sen. Liz Krueger (District 28) and other lawmakers responded to a proposed New York City tax hike meant to replace the indefinitely postponed $15 congestion pricing tolls. The measure, debated as Bill 28, has not advanced in committee and faces strong opposition. The matter, described as 'a last-minute funding move that drew fierce opposition,' has Krueger stating, 'I think it does not have support.' Assemblyman Brian Cunningham echoed, 'No new taxes.' The proposal would raise the payroll mobility tax, already increased last year, to fund the MTA. Rep. Jerry Nadler and business groups argue the tax unfairly targets NYC, while congestion pricing would have spread costs regionally. With the legislative session ending, MTA projects remain at risk. No safety analyst has assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The state-level response included a rejected proposal to raise the payroll mobility tax (PMT) on NYC businesses to fill the $15 billion gap in the MTA’s capital plan. State Sen. Liz Krueger said, 'Payroll mobility taxes are actually taxes on workers... I do not think we have an appetite for that in the Senate.' Assembly Member Stacey Pheffer Amato, who once voted for congestion pricing, now supports the pause, calling the original vote 'political blackmail.' The MTA’s future projects, including the Second Avenue Subway, are threatened, as federal matching funds require local dollars. Lawmakers remain divided. No clear alternative has emerged. Vulnerable road users are left exposed as transit funding falters.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The policy, approved by the MTA Board and set for June 30, now faces indefinite delay. Krueger called the decision 'a staggering error' that creates a financial crisis for the MTA. The matter at hand: 'Gov. Hochul revoked her support for congestion pricing less than a month before it was supposed to start.' Assembly Member Robert Carroll also criticized the governor, rejecting her proposal to hike the payroll mobility tax on city businesses. The MTA’s capital plan now faces a $15 billion shortfall, with no replacement funding in sight. The delay leaves vulnerable road users exposed, as congestion pricing aimed to cut traffic and fund safer transit. The council’s response is clear: the city needs congestion pricing, now.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, set to start June 30, would have charged drivers $15 to enter below 60th Street, raising $1 billion yearly for transit. Hochul proposed a payroll tax hike instead, but State Senator Liz Krueger opposed it, saying, "I do not think we have an appetite for that in the Senate." The bill’s fate is uncertain as the legislative session ends. The MTA board, city officials, and business groups all voiced concern.

The Citi Bike rider failed to yield the right-of-way and disregarded traffic control, as cited in both the narrative and the contributing factors. The report notes the bike bore no damage after the collision. The pedestrian’s action—crossing with the signal—is listed in the report, but only after the rider’s failure to yield and disregard for traffic controls. The crash underscores the danger posed when drivers or riders ignore basic right-of-way rules on New York City streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
