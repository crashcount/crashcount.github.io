Over twelve hundred injured.</strong> That’s the cost of traffic violence in Senate District 28 in the last year alone. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors. An 83-year-old woman, crossing with the signal at West 58th and Sixth, struck and killed by an SUV making a left turn. A 90-year-old woman, crushed by a taxi and an SUV on York Avenue. Two cyclists, both 67, ejected and killed on Fifth Avenue. The street does not forgive.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-no-one-is-safe>Recent Crashes: No One Is Safe</h3><p>The carnage does not slow. In February, a Tesla sedan on the FDR Drive crashed at speed. The driver, a woman, was ejected and killed. On East 72nd, a pedestrian was killed by a taxi and SUV, her body broken in the crosswalk. The city’s own data shows the pattern: <strong>SUVs and cars are the main killers, with 11 deaths and hundreds of injuries</strong>. Trucks and buses follow. Bikes and mopeds injure, but they do not kill like steel and glass do. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h3><p>State Senator Liz Krueger has moved on safety. She voted yes on a bill to force safer street design for all users, not just drivers. The bill’s aim is clear: <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>&ldquo;safer streets for people on foot, on bikes, and in vehicles.&rdquo;</a> Krueger also co-sponsored <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S5008>a bill for automated bike lane enforcement</a>, targeting drivers who block the only safe space for cyclists. She backed <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S1675>a law to rate cars for pedestrian safety</a>, to shine a light on the danger at the curb. But the work is not done. The deaths keep coming.</p><p>Krueger has not been silent on the failures of leadership above her. When Governor Hochul delayed congestion pricing, Krueger <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/06/two-huge-questions-about-gridlock-gov-hochuls-congestion-pricing-delay>called it &ldquo;a staggering error&rdquo;</a> and warned it would leave the streets clogged and dangerous. But bills and words are not enough. The blood on the street is not washed away by votes.</p><h3 id=the-call-demand-more-demand-it-now>The Call: Demand More, Demand It Now</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a failure. Call Senator Krueger. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand automated enforcement for bike lanes. Demand that every street is built for the child crossing, not the car speeding. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Jeremy Cooney, new chair of the Senate Transportation Committee, issued a public demand for Governor Hochul to deliver a '100-day plan' to replace the $16.5 billion MTA funding shortfall caused by her cancellation of congestion pricing. In his op-ed, Cooney wrote, 'the time for debating the merits of congestion pricing has passed,' urging the governor to convene finance, labor, and passenger representatives to find a solution. Cooney’s push comes as the MTA faces threats to station accessibility, signal upgrades, and new trains and buses. Other Albany leaders, including Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and Senate President Andrea Stewart-Cousins, have offered little response. Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger called Hochul’s move illegal. The bill or action is not numbered, but the committee involved is the Senate Transportation Committee. No direct safety analyst note was provided, but the loss of funding jeopardizes projects vital to vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The debate, reported by Gothamist, centers on whether a lower toll could unfreeze the program while still funding the MTA. Hoylman-Sigal said, "Nobody's wedded to $15. We are wedded to the improvements that congestion pricing will provide for mass transit or safety on our streets for cleaner air." Sen. Liz Krueger is open to a new fee if it raises $1 billion yearly. Sen. Jabari Brisport criticized the lack of study and feedback in the process, calling it "irresponsible." Any change needs legislative, MTA, and federal approval. Trump has promised to end congestion pricing if elected.

The bill’s summary warns: 'No plan B for transit investments should congestion pricing not go through.' Senator Liz Krueger, mentioned in the debate, criticized the lack of alternative funding, saying, 'She is not aware of what she is referring to or where she believes that money will come from.' The delay leaves critical projects—like subway accessibility, new signals, and electric buses—unfunded. Without this money, vulnerable riders face more delays, breakdowns, and unsafe conditions.
