How Many More Will You Let Them Kill?</h1><p class="byline f6 silver">Written July 7, 2025</p></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>SD 28: Jan 1, 2022 - Jul 7, 2025</h2><h3 id=the-death-count-grows>The Death Count Grows</h3><p>In Senate District 28, the numbers do not lie. <strong>Since January 2022, 26 people have died and 105 have been seriously injured in crashes.</strong> Over 4,000 have been hurt. The dead include the old and the young. In the last year alone, deaths more than tripled—<strong>from 3 to 10</strong>. The pace is relentless. The wounds do not heal.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the highest price.</strong> In February, an 83-year-old woman was killed crossing with the signal at Avenue of the Americas and West 58th. She was struck by an SUV making a left turn. She died at the intersection, her right of way ignored. A week later, a 90-year-old woman was killed on York Avenue, hit by a southbound SUV and taxi. The crash report lists &ldquo;driver inattention/distraction&rdquo; as a cause. There are no second chances for the dead.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the harm.</strong> In this district, SUVs and sedans have killed 11, causing 22 serious injuries and over 500 minor injuries. Trucks and buses killed 3. Bikes, mopeds, and motorcycles injured dozens, but did not kill. The numbers are cold. The impact is not.</p><h3 id=what-has-senator-krueger-done>What Has Senator Krueger Done?</h3><p>Senator Liz Krueger has taken some steps. She voted yes on a bill to require <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>complete street design</a> and co-sponsored measures for <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S5008>bike lane enforcement</a> and <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S1675>pedestrian safety ratings</a>. She called Governor Hochul’s congestion pricing delay <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/06/two-huge-questions-about-gridlock-gov-hochuls-congestion-pricing-delay>&ldquo;a staggering error&rdquo;</a>, warning it leaves streets clogged and dangerous. But bills and words do not bring back the dead. The city still waits for a default 20 mph speed limit. The most dangerous drivers still roam free.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call Senator Krueger. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand enforcement against repeat offenders. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Jeremy Cooney, new chair of the Senate Transportation Committee, issued a public demand for Governor Hochul to deliver a '100-day plan' to replace the $16.5 billion MTA funding shortfall caused by her cancellation of congestion pricing. In his op-ed, Cooney wrote, 'the time for debating the merits of congestion pricing has passed,' urging the governor to convene finance, labor, and passenger representatives to find a solution. Cooney’s push comes as the MTA faces threats to station accessibility, signal upgrades, and new trains and buses. Other Albany leaders, including Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and Senate President Andrea Stewart-Cousins, have offered little response. Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger called Hochul’s move illegal. The bill or action is not numbered, but the committee involved is the Senate Transportation Committee.

The debate, reported by Gothamist, centers on whether a lower toll could unfreeze the program while still funding the MTA. Hoylman-Sigal said, "Nobody's wedded to $15. We are wedded to the improvements that congestion pricing will provide for mass transit or safety on our streets for cleaner air." Sen. Liz Krueger is open to a new fee if it raises $1 billion yearly. Sen. Jabari Brisport criticized the lack of study and feedback in the process, calling it "irresponsible." Any change needs legislative, MTA, and federal approval. Trump has promised to end congestion pricing if elected. No formal safety analysis was provided for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, reported as 'MTA in dark over Gov. Hochul’s talks to revive congestion pricing with lower tolls,' highlights confusion and division. Hoylman-Sigal supports lowering the toll, saying, 'The goal should be mend it don’t end it.' He urges keeping the program alive to save mass transit. Sen. Liz Krueger is open to tweaks if goals are met. Assemblyman Gary Pretlow opposes any revival. The MTA faces a $15 billion shortfall after the program’s pause. Policy experts warn that lowering the toll could weaken congestion relief and transit funding. No clear plan exists. Vulnerable road users remain at risk as gridlock and uncertainty persist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
