These are not just numbers—they are mothers, sons, neighbors. In the last year alone, 11 people were killed and 29 suffered life-changing wounds. The old and the young fall alike. Five people over 75 are dead. No child under 18 has died, but 43 have been hurt.</p><p>The carnage does not slow. On February 5, a 90-year-old woman was struck and killed by an SUV and a taxi on York Avenue. She was crossing the street. She did not make it to the other side. On February 11, an 83-year-old woman was killed by a left-turning SUV at Sixth Avenue and 58th Street. She was crossing with the signal. The driver turned left. She never finished her walk.</p><h2 id=the-policy-response-votes-and-voices>The Policy Response: Votes and Voices</h2><p><strong>Senator Liz Krueger has taken steps.</strong> She voted yes on the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting devices. She co-sponsored a bill to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S3304>enforce bike lane safety with cameras</a>. She backed <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/13/senate-requires-delivery-apps-to-provide-insurance-for-workers>insurance for delivery workers and pedestrians</a>, but critics warn that insurance is not prevention. &ldquo;Focusing on insurance rather than speed limits shifts responsibility away from prevention and system design,&rdquo; safety analysts <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/13/senate-requires-delivery-apps-to-provide-insurance-for-workers>said</a>. &ldquo;It fails to reduce crash risk and potentially discourages mode shift by not addressing the root causes of danger for pedestrians and cyclists.&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/13/senate-requires-delivery-apps-to-provide-insurance-for-workers>Read the full critique</a>.</p><p>Krueger has also spoken out against delays to congestion pricing, calling Governor Hochul&rsquo;s move &ldquo;a staggering error&rdquo; that leaves streets clogged and dangerous. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/06/two-huge-questions-about-gridlock-gov-hochuls-congestion-pricing-delay>See her stance</a>.</p><h2 id=the-road-ahead-who-pays-the-price>The Road Ahead: Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>Cars and trucks do most of the killing.</strong> In this district, SUVs and cars caused 11 deaths and 23 serious injuries. Trucks and buses killed 3 and seriously injured 9. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes together caused no deaths, but bikes left 8 people with serious injuries. The street is not safe for anyone outside a car.</p><p>The city and state have tools. They can lower speed limits. They can redesign streets. They can take away the keys from repeat offenders. But every day they wait, another family pays the price.</p><p><strong>Call your lawmakers. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against reckless drivers. Demand streets where the most vulnerable can cross and live.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for the next name to be carved into stone.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The plan marks the Adams administration's first major street project. The current avenue, with seven northbound car lanes, has seen 703 crashes, one pedestrian death, and 198 injuries since 2019. The matter summary calls for 'reallocation of street space, prioritizing cycling, walking, and public transit over cars.' Advocates like Kate Fillin-Yeh (NACTO) and Paul Krikler (Community Board 8) urge protected bike lanes, busways, and wider sidewalks. Krikler says, 'We deserve much wider sidewalks so we can get around, not just comfortably, but safely.' Transportation Alternatives and Community Board 6 echo these demands. The redesign aims to shift space from cars to people, following models like Paris's Rue de Rivoli.

The Marijuana Regulation & Taxation Act passed in March 2021. The state now faces a gap: 'there are concerns of increased incidences of driving while impaired after cannabis use,' the Department of Health said. Senator Liz Krueger, a key architect, stated, 'Revenue from our legalized system will be used to pay these ongoing costs.' The Department of Health seeks new technology to detect cannabis impairment, as no standard test exists. Nearly 400 officers are trained as drug recognition experts, with thousands more in training. Critics warn DWI issues should have been solved before legalization.

The event, hosted by State Senator Liz Krueger, featured DOT Manhattan Borough Commissioner Ed Pincar, who said, “We are looking very closely… we may be able to present a proposal maybe even later this year.” The redesign aims to transform Third Avenue into a safer boulevard with fewer car lanes, more bus lanes, a separated bike path, and wider sidewalks. Council Member Gale Brewer and advocates like Paul Krikler have long demanded these changes. Krueger and the NYPD, however, focused on enforcement against cyclists and e-bike riders, citing constituent concerns. Krueger has previously pushed for harsher penalties for electric-vehicle riders. NYPD data shows more enforcement against cyclists than drivers, even though drivers cause most injuries. No formal safety analysis was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
