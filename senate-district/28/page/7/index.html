Since January 2022, 26 people have died and 4,176 have been injured in 8,183 crashes. Among them: children, elders, cyclists, pedestrians. One hundred six suffered serious injuries. Each number is a body. Each body is a life changed or ended.</p><p>Just this year, deaths have more than tripled compared to last year. Ten people are already gone. Serious injuries are down, but the dead do not heal.</p><h3 id=the-recent-blood-on-the-streets>The Recent Blood on the Streets</h3><p>On February 5, a 90-year-old woman was killed crossing York Avenue. She was struck by an SUV and a taxi. The crash report lists &ldquo;driver inattention/distraction&rdquo; as a cause. She died in the street, crushed. See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash records</a>.</p><p>On February 11, an 83-year-old woman was killed at the intersection of Avenue of the Americas and 58th.

See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash records</a>.</p><p>On February 4, a woman was ejected and killed on the FDR Drive.

She co-sponsored and voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed limiters. The bill targets those who rack up violations and points, aiming to keep killers off the road. As the bill summary states, the legislation <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>targets drivers with a pattern of violations, seeking to cut risk for pedestrians and cyclists by limiting repeat speeding</a>.</p><p>Krueger also backed the extension of school speed zones, a move to protect children walking to class. She <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8344>voted yes to extend school speed zones, improving child pedestrian safety</a>.</p><p>But the carnage continues. Bills move slow. Streets change slower. The dead do not wait.</p><h3 id=the-fight-ahead>The Fight Ahead</h3><p>The bodies pile up. The numbers grow. The only thing that stops this is action. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph citywide speed limit. Demand the city use the power it has. Demand the state pass the Stop Super Speeders Act.</p><p>Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Jessica Ramos and colleagues sent a letter to city and state DOTs urging action against the 'demonization' of e-bikes and e-scooters. The letter, signed by Ramos and State Sen. Liz Krueger, demanded more education on safe riding and battery use, warning, 'We cannot allow a narrative to build against a vital, green, and growing mode of transportation.' Ramos criticized City Hall for failing to post speed limits and design streets for e-mobility. Krueger backed battery safety bills, while Councilman Bob Holden pushed for outright bans, citing deaths and injuries. The senators warned that inaction could lead to blanket bans, hitting delivery workers hardest. The city’s plan for safe charging hubs faces local opposition.

"We deserve much wider sidewalks so we can get around, not just comfortably, but safely."" -- Liz Krueger</p><p class=mb3>On October 12, 2022, the Department of Transportation (DOT) will unveil its Third Avenue redesign proposal to a Manhattan panel. The plan marks the Adams administration's first major street project. The current avenue, with seven northbound car lanes, has seen 703 crashes, one pedestrian death, and 198 injuries since 2019. The matter summary calls for 'reallocation of street space, prioritizing cycling, walking, and public transit over cars.' Advocates like Kate Fillin-Yeh (NACTO) and Paul Krikler (Community Board 8) urge protected bike lanes, busways, and wider sidewalks. Krikler says, 'We deserve much wider sidewalks so we can get around, not just comfortably, but safely.' Transportation Alternatives and Community Board 6 echo these demands. The redesign aims to shift space from cars to people, following models like Paris's Rue de Rivoli. The panel's response will shape the future of vulnerable road user safety on Third Avenue.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Senator Liz Krueger says tax revenue will fund enforcement. Vulnerable road users face new risks.</p><p class=mb3>On October 9, 2022, New York State, under Governor Hochul, accelerated cannabis legalization and opened retail shops. The Marijuana Regulation & Taxation Act passed in March 2021. The state now faces a gap: 'there are concerns of increased incidences of driving while impaired after cannabis use,' the Department of Health said. Senator Liz Krueger, a key architect, stated, 'Revenue from our legalized system will be used to pay these ongoing costs.' The Department of Health seeks new technology to detect cannabis impairment, as no standard test exists. Nearly 400 officers are trained as drug recognition experts, with thousands more in training. Critics warn DWI issues should have been solved before legalization. As enforcement lags, vulnerable road users face greater danger from impaired drivers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
