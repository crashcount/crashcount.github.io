These are not just numbers—they are mothers, sons, neighbors. In the last year alone, 11 people were killed and 29 suffered life-changing wounds. The old and the young fall alike. Five people over 75 are dead. No child under 18 has died, but 43 have been hurt.</p><p>The carnage does not slow. On February 5, a 90-year-old woman was struck and killed by an SUV and a taxi on York Avenue. She was crossing the street. She did not make it to the other side. On February 11, an 83-year-old woman was killed by a left-turning SUV at Sixth Avenue and 58th Street. She was crossing with the signal. The driver turned left. She never finished her walk.</p><h2 id=the-policy-response-votes-and-voices>The Policy Response: Votes and Voices</h2><p><strong>Senator Liz Krueger has taken steps.</strong> She voted yes on the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting devices. She co-sponsored a bill to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S3304>enforce bike lane safety with cameras</a>. She backed <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/13/senate-requires-delivery-apps-to-provide-insurance-for-workers>insurance for delivery workers and pedestrians</a>, but critics warn that insurance is not prevention. &ldquo;Focusing on insurance rather than speed limits shifts responsibility away from prevention and system design,&rdquo; safety analysts <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/13/senate-requires-delivery-apps-to-provide-insurance-for-workers>said</a>. &ldquo;It fails to reduce crash risk and potentially discourages mode shift by not addressing the root causes of danger for pedestrians and cyclists.&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/13/senate-requires-delivery-apps-to-provide-insurance-for-workers>Read the full critique</a>.</p><p>Krueger has also spoken out against delays to congestion pricing, calling Governor Hochul&rsquo;s move &ldquo;a staggering error&rdquo; that leaves streets clogged and dangerous. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/06/two-huge-questions-about-gridlock-gov-hochuls-congestion-pricing-delay>See her stance</a>.</p><h2 id=the-road-ahead-who-pays-the-price>The Road Ahead: Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>Cars and trucks do most of the killing.</strong> In this district, SUVs and cars caused 11 deaths and 23 serious injuries. Trucks and buses killed 3 and seriously injured 9. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes together caused no deaths, but bikes left 8 people with serious injuries. The street is not safe for anyone outside a car.</p><p>The city and state have tools. They can lower speed limits. They can redesign streets. They can take away the keys from repeat offenders. But every day they wait, another family pays the price.</p><p><strong>Call your lawmakers. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against reckless drivers. Demand streets where the most vulnerable can cross and live.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for the next name to be carved into stone.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Manhattan Community Board 5 called this move not a "real solution" to safety, urging a return to the 2021 plan with protected bike lanes and faster bus service. "We want a real solution to the bike and pedestrian safety issue," said CB 5 Vice Chair Samir Lavingia. The board warns that without bike lanes, cyclists will ride sidewalks, risking conflict. The plan, shaped with business interests, leaves vulnerable road users exposed and delays safer changes until at least 2028.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Critics worried about diverted car traffic clogging residential streets, with one resident calling for a 'traffic study' and 'action plan.' The DOT says the busway could boost bus speeds by 15 percent. The proposal would force cars to exit 34th Street quickly or face tickets, echoing rules on 14th Street.

The bill, sponsored by Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger, mandates up to $50,000 per person for basic economic loss, regardless of citizenship or employment status. Assembly Member Robert Carroll authored the original Assembly version, stating, 'It is time we require delivery apps to take responsibility for keeping delivery workers and pedestrians safe.' Sen. Andrew Gounardes defended a related speed-limiting bill, but it was weakened. Safety analysts warn: 'Focusing on insurance rather than speed limits shifts responsibility away from prevention and system design, failing to reduce crash risk and potentially discouraging mode shift by not addressing the root causes of danger for pedestrians and cyclists.'

Tension rises between speed, safety, and neighborhood calm.</p><p class=mb3>The New York Post (2025-06-08) reports that the city proposes restricting cars on 34th Street to create a busway between 3rd and 9th Avenues. Residents worry rerouted vehicles will jam local streets and worsen safety. Jessica Lavoie of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association warns, "diverting traffic from this critical corridor onto narrow residential streets would lead to increased congestion, safety hazards, and diminished quality of life." The Department of Transportation aims to replicate the 14th Street busway, which "reduced congestion, sped up bus travel and curbed accidents." The article highlights the ongoing struggle to balance efficient transit, tunnel access, and neighborhood safety. No specific driver errors are cited, but the plan underscores the systemic risks of shifting car traffic onto residential blocks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The demonstration, which began at Union Square, challenged new policies issuing criminal summonses for minor cycling offenses. Riders followed traffic laws, highlighting the crackdown’s contradictions. One cyclist, Erin Poland, said the policy 'is not actually protecting cyclists [but] putting them in more danger.' Another, Tara Pham, noted, 'I’ve been hit by vehicles twice... those drivers face no criminal charges.'

Cyclists and advocates argue the penalties are harsher than those faced by drivers for similar actions. As one protester said, “It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.” Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the crackdown, citing the lack of licensing for e-bikes as a challenge for enforcement, but acknowledged the need for legislative reform.

The cyclist, a 55-year-old man, was ejected and suffered a head injury with severe bleeding. According to the police report, 'Unsafe Lane Changing' was a contributing factor in the collision. The pickup truck, registered in New Jersey, was traveling west and going straight ahead, while the cyclist was making a U-turn. The police report also lists 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a factor, but the primary systemic danger cited is unsafe lane changing.

The MTA and state officials dismissed Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy’s threats to withdraw funding as a 'sham,' arguing that the dispute is already in court. Attorney Roberta Kaplan wrote, 'Secretary Duffy did not afford the Project Sponsors any notice or due process before that alleged termination.' The state’s response called the deadlines 'procedurally improper.'

The plan nearly doubles sidewalk widths and expands pedestrian zones, cutting space for vehicles. The redesign adds tree buffers, benches, and stormwater upgrades.

Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'The vast majority of commuters in Midtown are traveling by transit and they deserve world-class, fast, and reliable buses.'
