How Many More Will You Let Them Kill?</h1><p class="byline f6 silver">Written July 7, 2025 <em>(Revised July 10, 2025 – Removed duplicate headline from body and deduped citations.)</em></p></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>SD 28: Jan 1, 2022 - Jul 7, 2025</h2><h3 id=the-death-count-grows>The Death Count Grows</h3><p>In Senate District 28, the numbers do not lie. <strong>Since January 2022, 26 people have died and 105 have been seriously injured in crashes.</strong> Over 4,000 have been hurt. The dead include the old and the young. In the last year alone, deaths more than tripled—<strong>from 3 to 10</strong>. The pace is relentless. The wounds do not heal.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the highest price.</strong> In February, an 83-year-old woman was killed crossing with the signal at Avenue of the Americas and West 58th. She was struck by an SUV making a left turn. She died at the intersection, her right of way ignored. A week later, a 90-year-old woman was killed on York Avenue, hit by a southbound SUV and taxi. The crash report lists &ldquo;driver inattention/distraction&rdquo; as a cause. There are no second chances for the dead.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the harm.</strong> In this district, SUVs and sedans have killed 11, causing 22 serious injuries and over 500 minor injuries. Trucks and buses killed 3. Bikes, mopeds, and motorcycles injured dozens, but did not kill. The numbers are cold. The impact is not.</p><h3 id=what-has-senator-krueger-done>What Has Senator Krueger Done?</h3><p>Senator Liz Krueger has taken some steps. She voted yes on a bill to require <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>complete street design</a> and co-sponsored measures for <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S5008>bike lane enforcement</a> and <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S1675>pedestrian safety ratings</a>. She called Governor Hochul’s congestion pricing delay <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/06/two-huge-questions-about-gridlock-gov-hochuls-congestion-pricing-delay>&ldquo;a staggering error&rdquo;</a>, warning it leaves streets clogged and dangerous. But bills and words do not bring back the dead. The city still waits for a default 20 mph speed limit. The most dangerous drivers still roam free.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call Senator Krueger. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand enforcement against repeat offenders. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The article details heated opposition from local residents and bus riders, who argued the plan was rushed and lacked proper traffic analysis.

Prevention takes a back seat.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13, 2025, the New York State Senate passed a bill requiring food delivery apps to provide insurance for delivery workers, pedestrians, and cyclists. The bill, sponsored by Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger, mandates up to $50,000 per person for basic economic loss, regardless of citizenship or employment status. Assembly Member Robert Carroll authored the original Assembly version, stating, 'It is time we require delivery apps to take responsibility for keeping delivery workers and pedestrians safe.' Sen. Andrew Gounardes defended a related speed-limiting bill, but it was weakened. Safety analysts warn: 'Focusing on insurance rather than speed limits shifts responsibility away from prevention and system design, failing to reduce crash risk and potentially discouraging mode shift by not addressing the root causes of danger for pedestrians and cyclists.' Lawmakers back insurance, but leave the streets risky.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Residents worry rerouted vehicles will jam local streets and worsen safety. Jessica Lavoie of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association warns, "diverting traffic from this critical corridor onto narrow residential streets would lead to increased congestion, safety hazards, and diminished quality of life." The Department of Transportation aims to replicate the 14th Street busway, which "reduced congestion, sped up bus travel and curbed accidents."

As one protester said, “It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.” Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the crackdown, citing the lack of licensing for e-bikes as a challenge for enforcement, but acknowledged the need for legislative reform.

The report states, 'an SUV slammed into a parked car. A man lay bleeding from the head. A baby was hurt. Two others shaken.' The driver wore his seatbelt and was conscious at the scene. The road was straight and clear. Police explicitly list 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor. The pedestrian, a 49-year-old man, suffered head injuries and crush injuries. The report does not cite any pedestrian behavior as a contributing factor. The crash underscores the lethal consequences of driver distraction, with multiple people—including a baby—injured when a moving vehicle collided with a stationary car.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The project sits finished. Cyclists and walkers still cram into a narrow, crash-prone lane. Delays keep thousands at risk. City Hall stalls. Advocates plan protest. Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On April 9, 2025, seven elected officials—including Council Members Julie Won and Julie Menin—sent a public letter demanding Mayor Adams open the long-promised Queensboro Bridge pedestrian path. The Department of Transportation had planned to open the dedicated walkway on March 16, but the mayor's office intervened, citing the need for a briefing. The lawmakers wrote, 'The reasons given for this delay are not satisfactory, as all communications from the DOT have indicated that the project is complete and ready to open to the public.' They warned, 'Any further delays to this project that is otherwise ready to open will unnecessarily put at risk the thousands of New Yorkers who cycle and walk the current shared path every day.' The project, in the works since at least 2017, remains stalled. Cyclists and pedestrians are forced to share a cramped, hazardous lane. City Hall insists on more review, while advocates plan a protest ribbon-cutting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states the taxi driver was distracted and inattentive at the time of the incident. As the woman stepped out, she was struck, resulting in severe lacerations to her knee and lower leg.

There is no indication in the report that any actions by the pedestrian contributed to the crash. The focus remains on the driver’s failure to pay attention, which led to a vulnerable road user suffering serious injuries.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
