Over twelve hundred injured.</strong> That’s the cost of traffic violence in Senate District 28 in the last year alone. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors. An 83-year-old woman, crossing with the signal at West 58th and Sixth, struck and killed by an SUV making a left turn. A 90-year-old woman, crushed by a taxi and an SUV on York Avenue. Two cyclists, both 67, ejected and killed on Fifth Avenue. The street does not forgive.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-no-one-is-safe>Recent Crashes: No One Is Safe</h3><p>The carnage does not slow. In February, a Tesla sedan on the FDR Drive crashed at speed. The driver, a woman, was ejected and killed. On East 72nd, a pedestrian was killed by a taxi and SUV, her body broken in the crosswalk. The city’s own data shows the pattern: <strong>SUVs and cars are the main killers, with 11 deaths and hundreds of injuries</strong>. Trucks and buses follow. Bikes and mopeds injure, but they do not kill like steel and glass do. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h3><p>State Senator Liz Krueger has moved on safety. She voted yes on a bill to force safer street design for all users, not just drivers. The bill’s aim is clear: <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>&ldquo;safer streets for people on foot, on bikes, and in vehicles.&rdquo;</a> Krueger also co-sponsored <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S5008>a bill for automated bike lane enforcement</a>, targeting drivers who block the only safe space for cyclists. She backed <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S1675>a law to rate cars for pedestrian safety</a>, to shine a light on the danger at the curb. But the work is not done. The deaths keep coming.</p><p>Krueger has not been silent on the failures of leadership above her. When Governor Hochul delayed congestion pricing, Krueger <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/06/two-huge-questions-about-gridlock-gov-hochuls-congestion-pricing-delay>called it &ldquo;a staggering error&rdquo;</a> and warned it would leave the streets clogged and dangerous. But bills and words are not enough. The blood on the street is not washed away by votes.</p><h3 id=the-call-demand-more-demand-it-now>The Call: Demand More, Demand It Now</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a failure. Call Senator Krueger. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand automated enforcement for bike lanes. Demand that every street is built for the child crossing, not the car speeding. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Critics worried about diverted car traffic clogging residential streets, with one resident calling for a 'traffic study' and 'action plan.'

The state’s response called the deadlines 'procedurally improper.' The federal government’s push to end the tolls, and the MTA’s resistance, highlight a clash over control of city streets and transit funding. No mention of driver actions, but the policy fight leaves vulnerable road users exposed as the legal battle drags on.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, debated in the Senate Finance and Transportation Committees, included $6 billion for MTA capital improvements and supported congestion pricing. Sen. Dean Murray (R-Suffolk) and Sen. Bill Weber (R-Rockland) opposed the measure, citing toll burdens and limited transit options. Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger (D-Manhattan) and Transportation Chair Jeremy Cooney (D-Rochester) defended the plan, highlighting increased MTA revenue and minimal impact on local businesses. The matter summary reads: 'State legislators from the suburbs, particularly Republican lawmakers, voiced strong opposition to congestion pricing during the passage of Gov. Hochul's $254-billion budget in Albany.' The budget passed 40-22, mostly along party lines.

The Department of Transportation had planned to open the dedicated walkway on March 16, but the mayor's office intervened, citing the need for a briefing. The lawmakers wrote, 'The reasons given for this delay are not satisfactory, as all communications from the DOT have indicated that the project is complete and ready to open to the public.' They warned, 'Any further delays to this project that is otherwise ready to open will unnecessarily put at risk the thousands of New Yorkers who cycle and walk the current shared path every day.' The project, in the works since at least 2017, remains stalled. Cyclists and pedestrians are forced to share a cramped, hazardous lane.
