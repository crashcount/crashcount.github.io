Thirty-six left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 1,200 hurt in crashes in the last year alone, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. The dead are old and young. A 90-year-old woman crushed on York Avenue. An 83-year-old struck crossing with the signal on Sixth. Two cyclists, both 67, killed at once on Fifth Avenue. The street does not forgive. The city keeps moving.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>SUVs killed more pedestrians here than any other vehicle.</strong> Cars, trucks, taxis, bikes—they all draw blood. But the pattern is clear: the bigger the vehicle, the deeper the wound, as shown by <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. Delivery workers ride fast to survive. They get tickets, not protection. Cyclists are arrested for minor slips, while drivers who kill walk away. As one protester <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/it-seems-unfair-e-bike-riders-protest-nypd-crackdown-and-criminal-summonses>put it</a>, <em>&ldquo;It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.&rdquo;</em> The system punishes the vulnerable and lets the powerful pass.</p><h3 id=what-has-liz-krueger-done>What Has Liz Krueger Done?</h3><p>Senator Liz Krueger has moved on paper. She <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S5008>co-sponsored a bill to enforce bike lane safety with cameras</a>—targeting drivers who block lanes and endanger cyclists. She also <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S1675>backed a bill to create a public safety rating for cars</a>, shining a light on which vehicles are most deadly to pedestrians. She <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>voted yes on a law to force safer street designs</a>. She <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/06/two-huge-questions-about-gridlock-gov-hochuls-congestion-pricing-delay>called out the governor’s delay of congestion pricing</a> as &ldquo;a staggering error,&rdquo; warning it would leave streets clogged and dangerous. But the deaths keep coming. The bills are not yet law. The lanes are not yet safe.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that work, not just warnings. Demand streets built for people, not just cars. <strong>Every day you wait, another family waits for a call that never should come.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Lawmakers tout support for the injured. But insurance comes after the hit. Speeders keep driving. Danger stays on the street. Prevention takes a back seat.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13, 2025, the New York State Senate passed a bill requiring food delivery apps to provide insurance for delivery workers, pedestrians, and cyclists. The bill, sponsored by Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger, mandates up to $50,000 per person for basic economic loss, regardless of citizenship or employment status. Assembly Member Robert Carroll authored the original Assembly version, stating, 'It is time we require delivery apps to take responsibility for keeping delivery workers and pedestrians safe.' Sen. Andrew Gounardes defended a related speed-limiting bill, but it was weakened. Safety analysts warn: 'Focusing on insurance rather than speed limits shifts responsibility away from prevention and system design, failing to reduce crash risk and potentially discouraging mode shift by not addressing the root causes of danger for pedestrians and cyclists.' Lawmakers back insurance, but leave the streets risky.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Residents worry rerouted vehicles will jam local streets and worsen safety. Jessica Lavoie of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association warns, "diverting traffic from this critical corridor onto narrow residential streets would lead to increased congestion, safety hazards, and diminished quality of life." The Department of Transportation aims to replicate the 14th Street busway, which "reduced congestion, sped up bus travel and curbed accidents." The article highlights the ongoing struggle to balance efficient transit, tunnel access, and neighborhood safety. No specific driver errors are cited, but the plan underscores the systemic risks of shifting car traffic onto residential blocks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crackdown targets delivery workers, especially undocumented riders, for offenses like sidewalk riding and nonstandard bike setups. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the move, stating, 'When it comes to traffic safety, compliance is not optional.' Protesters and advocates argue the policy is discriminatory and escalates minor violations, risking severe consequences for vulnerable workers.
