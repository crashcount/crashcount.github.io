An 83-year-old, killed by an SUV turning left as she crossed with the signal at Sixth Avenue. Two cyclists, both 67, ejected and killed in a crash with an SUV on Fifth Avenue. In the last year alone, <strong>11 people died</strong> and <strong>34 suffered serious injuries</strong> on the streets of Senate District 28. The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross the street. The numbers do not flinch: <strong>1,255 injured, 2,279 crashes</strong> in twelve months. The city calls them accidents. The families know better.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p>The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors. They are the ones who walk, ride, and wait for the light to change. Most killed are over 65. Some are children. The streets do not forgive. Cars and SUVs are the main killers—<strong>11 deaths, 21 serious injuries</strong>—but trucks, bikes, and mopeds all leave bodies behind. The city records the wounds. The pavement remembers the rest.</p><h3 id=what-has-liz-krueger-done>What Has Liz Krueger Done?</h3><p>Senator Liz Krueger has moved on some fronts. She voted yes on a bill to force safer street designs, aiming to protect everyone, not just drivers. The bill calls for &ldquo;redesigning streets to protect all users, not just drivers&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>in the legislation</a>. She co-sponsored a bill to put cameras in bike lanes, targeting drivers who block and endanger cyclists <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S5008>with enforcement</a>. She backed a measure to rate cars for pedestrian safety, to show who is most at risk <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S1675>with a new rating system</a>. When Governor Hochul delayed congestion pricing, Krueger called it &ldquo;a staggering error&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/06/two-huge-questions-about-gridlock-gov-hochuls-congestion-pricing-delay>in her statement</a>. She joined others to demand the Queensboro Bridge pedestrian path open now, warning, &ldquo;Any further delays&mldr;will unnecessarily put at risk the thousands of New Yorkers who cycle and walk the current shared path every day&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/09/pols-demand-adams-open-queensboro-bridge-pedestrian-path>in a public letter</a>.</p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The bills move slow. The streets do not wait.</p><h3 id=what-next-the-streets-demand-more>What Next? The Streets Demand More</h3><p><strong>The crisis is not over.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It can redesign every deadly intersection. It can fund protected bike lanes and open the bridges. It can act now. Or it can wait for the next name, the next number, the next family left with nothing but a memory and a patch of blood on the curb.</p><p><strong>Call your leaders. Demand action.</strong> The dead cannot speak. You can. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Assembly Member Robert Carroll authored the original Assembly version, stating, 'It is time we require delivery apps to take responsibility for keeping delivery workers and pedestrians safe.' Sen. Andrew Gounardes defended a related speed-limiting bill, but it was weakened.

As one protester said, “It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.” Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the crackdown, citing the lack of licensing for e-bikes as a challenge for enforcement, but acknowledged the need for legislative reform.

Eyewitness Hayley said, "I was there with my friend walking on the sidewalk and almost got trampled by the poor horse. It was so terrifying." Parkgoers scrambled for safety, some jumping fences. Cyclists chased the horse, warning others. The horse was not tethered to a hitching post, as none was nearby. Christina Hansen, union rep for carriage horses, stated, "There were no injuries or property damage reported, and there's currently no indication the horse's driver was negligent." The incident highlights gaps in securing procedures and the absence of hitching posts, raising questions about safety for pedestrians and park users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, debated in the Senate Finance and Transportation Committees, included $6 billion for MTA capital improvements and supported congestion pricing. Sen. Dean Murray (R-Suffolk) and Sen. Bill Weber (R-Rockland) opposed the measure, citing toll burdens and limited transit options. Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger (D-Manhattan) and Transportation Chair Jeremy Cooney (D-Rochester) defended the plan, highlighting increased MTA revenue and minimal impact on local businesses. The matter summary reads: 'State legislators from the suburbs, particularly Republican lawmakers, voiced strong opposition to congestion pricing during the passage of Gov. Hochul's $254-billion budget in Albany.' The budget passed 40-22, mostly along party lines.

The Department of Transportation had planned to open the dedicated walkway on March 16, but the mayor's office intervened, citing the need for a briefing. The lawmakers wrote, 'The reasons given for this delay are not satisfactory, as all communications from the DOT have indicated that the project is complete and ready to open to the public.' They warned, 'Any further delays to this project that is otherwise ready to open will unnecessarily put at risk the thousands of New Yorkers who cycle and walk the current shared path every day.' The project, in the works since at least 2017, remains stalled. Cyclists and pedestrians are forced to share a cramped, hazardous lane.
