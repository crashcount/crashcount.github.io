Forty-three seriously hurt. Over 3,000 injured.</strong> These are not just numbers. They are mothers, fathers, children—neighbors who never made it home. In the last year alone, five people died and ten suffered life-changing wounds. Most were walking or riding. Most never stood a chance.</p><p>A 78-year-old woman tried to cross White Plains Road. She never made it. The SUV hit her at night. She died at Jacobi. The driver stayed. No charges. The street stayed the same. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/25/woman-78-fatally-struck-by-bronx-suv-driver/>The victim was crossing White Plains Road at E. 216th St. in Williamsbridge when a 56-year-old woman driving north in a 2024 Toyota RAV4 hit her at about 10:20 p.m. Saturday, cops said.</a></p><p>A coach stood outside his home. A BMW slammed into a pickup, then into parked cars, then into him. He died in the street. His mother <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/08/bronx-bmw-driver-arrested-for-manslaughter-in-crash-that-killed-beloved-coach/>said, &ldquo;These arrests cannot bring back my child. Still, something has to be done.&rdquo;</a></p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars kill and maim most often.</strong> Five deaths and 100 moderate or serious injuries came from cars and SUVs. Trucks and buses killed one, left others broken. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll, but the deadliest threat rolls on four wheels.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-done--and-what-has-not>What Has Been Done — And What Has Not</h2><p>Senator Jamaal Bailey voted for safer street design. He backed <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>S 9718</a>, a bill to force new projects to protect everyone, not just drivers. He co-sponsored <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S131>S 131</a>, pushing for complete streets. But he also sponsored <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S7785>S 7785</a>, a bill that would let bus drivers in giant housing complexes dodge traffic rules. That means less protection for people walking and biking where they live.</p><p><strong>Every delay, every loophole, every carve-out costs lives.</strong></p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Streets can be made safe. Lower the speed limit. Build real protection for people walking and riding. End carve-outs that let drivers off the hook. Call Senator Bailey. Call your council member. Demand action. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
