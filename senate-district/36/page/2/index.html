The report details that 'Unsafe Speed' was a contributing factor, with one driver also flagged for 'Alcohol Involvement.' The narrative describes airbags bursting and metal folding, leaving four occupants—two drivers and two passengers—injured. Victims suffered crush injuries, with one semiconscious, two incoherent, and one in shock. The force of the collision sent vehicles into parked cars, compounding the destruction. The police report makes clear: unsafe speed and driver recklessness shattered the quiet, leaving bodies broken and a street scarred.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The collision occurred as the taxi was traveling straight ahead and hit the pedestrian head-on, causing severe bleeding from her head. The report notes the cab’s front end was crumpled and its tinted windows obscured the driver’s face. According to the police report, 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' and 'Tinted Windows' were listed as contributing factors. The pedestrian was crossing against the signal and was not at an intersection, as documented in the report, but the presence of tinted windows is also cited as a factor. The focus remains on the driver’s visibility and the systemic risks posed by vehicle design and street conditions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
