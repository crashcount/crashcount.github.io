In the last twelve months, six people have died and 942 have been injured in crashes across Senate District 36. Nine of those injuries were serious—lives changed in a heartbeat. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, parents, children.</p><p>Just days ago, a 71-year-old woman died in Co-op City. A 79-year-old driver crashed into two cars and a pole. &ldquo;I saw one lady was out on the ground. They was giving her medical attention, checking her body. She was laid out,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/op-city-crash-multiple-people-injured-including-1-critically-bronx/17075710/>said Samuel Cherry</a>. Seven others were hurt. The street was quiet, except for the sirens.</p><h2 id=patterns-that-kill-who-pays-the-price>Patterns That Kill: Who Pays the Price?</h2><p>SUVs and cars do most of the harm. In three years, they killed six people and injured over 465 more on foot or bike. Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds, four injuries. Bikes, four. The numbers do not lie. The weight of steel falls hardest on the unprotected.</p><p>Pedestrians die crossing with the light, waiting at the curb, or just walking home. Cyclists are crushed by sedans and SUVs. The cause is always the same: a system that lets it happen again and again.</p><h2 id=senator-bailey-action-and-the-road-ahead>Senator Bailey: Action and the Road Ahead</h2><p>Senator Jamaal Bailey has voted for safety. He backed the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. He voted yes to extend school speed zones. He co-sponsored bills to create safety zones and expand ignition interlock monitoring. But the deaths keep coming. The work is not done.</p><p>&ldquo;The cause of the crash was not immediately known,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/13/multi-car-crash-in-the-bronx-kills-71-year-old-woman-injures-seven-others/>police said</a>. But the cause is always known. Streets built for speed. Laws that let the reckless drive again. Enforcement that falls hardest on the least protected.</p><p>Call your leaders. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real action against repeat offenders. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
