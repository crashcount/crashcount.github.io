Twelve people are dead. Forty-three suffered serious injuries. In three and a half years, there have been nearly 5,000 crashes. The wounds are not just numbers. They are heads split on concrete, bodies crushed at crosswalks, lives ended mid-step. A 76-year-old woman, struck by an SUV on White Plains Road, did not make it home. A 24-year-old cyclist, crushed on E 233rd Street, left a bike mangled and a family waiting for a call that never came.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p>Pedestrians and cyclists pay first. Cars and SUVs killed five. Trucks and buses took one more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left others broken. The old, the young, the ones just crossing the street. In the last year alone, five people died and 864 were hurt. The pain is not spread evenly. It falls hardest on those with the least steel around them.</p><h2 id=what-leadership-has-doneand-not-done>What Leadership Has Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Senator Jamaal Bailey has moved on street safety. He voted yes on a bill to force safer street design for all users, not just drivers. The bill&rsquo;s aim is clear: &ldquo;Enables safe access to public roads for all users by utilizing complete street design principles&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>bill text</a>). Bailey also co-sponsored a bill to require complete street design on projects using public money (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S131>co-sponsored legislation</a>). But not every move protects the vulnerable. Bailey sponsored a bill to carve out traffic law exemptions for bus drivers in large co-ops, a step that could leave pedestrians and cyclists at risk (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S7785>traffic law exemptions</a>).</p><p>The work is not done. The blood on the street says so. &ldquo;An accomplice handed Aracena the gun used to shoot Campbell in the chest as the victim sat behind the wheel&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/17/accused-road-rage-killer-michael-aracena-bronx-navy-veteran-tried-to-flee-country-keino-campbell/>NY Daily News report</a>). The violence does not end with the crash.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Every day without safer streets is a choice. Call Senator Bailey. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real street redesign. Demand that every carve-out for drivers is struck from the law. The dead cannot speak. The living must.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
