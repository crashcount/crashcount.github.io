Since 2022, <strong>13 people have died</strong> and <strong>43 have been seriously injured</strong> in crashes. These are not just numbers—they are mothers, sons, neighbors. In the last twelve months alone, six more lives were lost. <strong>Pedestrians and cyclists bear the brunt.</strong></p><p>Just days ago, a 71-year-old woman died in Co-op City. A 79-year-old driver crashed into two cars and a pole. &ldquo;I saw one lady was out on the ground. They was giving her medical attention, checking her body. She was laid out,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/op-city-crash-multiple-people-injured-including-1-critically-bronx/17075710/>said Samuel Cherry</a>. Seven others were hurt. The street was quiet, except for the sound of sirens and grief. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/13/multi-car-crash-in-the-bronx-kills-71-year-old-woman-injures-seven-others/>Police said</a> the cause is still under investigation. No arrests. No answers.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-who-pays-the-price>The Pattern: Who Pays the Price</h2><p>The violence is not random. <strong>SUVs and cars killed six. Trucks killed one.</strong> In the last year, children and elders were struck down. A 76-year-old pedestrian died on White Plains Road. A 24-year-old cyclist was crushed on E 233rd Street. The pattern is clear: the most vulnerable are the first to bleed. &ldquo;It was a terrible sound &ndash; it was a terrible incident that happened,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/op-city-crash-multiple-people-injured-including-1-critically-bronx/17075710/>said Jennifer</a>.</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-and-the-road-ahead>Leadership: Votes and the Road Ahead</h2><p>State Senator Jamaal Bailey has voted yes on bills to curb repeat speeders and expand school speed zones. He backed the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, which would force the worst offenders to install speed limiters. He voted to extend speed cameras near schools. These are steps. But the crisis is not over. <strong>Every day without stronger action is another day someone does not come home.</strong></p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Senator Bailey. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph citywide speed limit. Demand action against repeat offenders. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Four new elevators will rise. Three Harlem Line stops in the Bronx will open to all. The city’s transit spine grows stronger for those left waiting longest.</p><p class=mb3>On June 18, 2025, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced a sweeping accessibility project for three Metro-North Harlem Line stations in the Bronx: Williams Bridge, Woodlawn, and Botanical Garden. According to the MTA, crews will completely rebuild Williams Bridge and Woodlawn, installing four new elevators—two at each station—to ensure full accessibility. The matter summary states: 'comprehensive renovation and accessibility project at three Metro-North Railroad Harlem Line stations in the Bronx.' Christian Murray reported the announcement. No council bill number or committee applies, as this is an agency initiative, not legislation. The upgrades promise to open transit to riders long shut out by stairs and barriers. Improving station accessibility encourages more walking and cycling to transit, supports mode shift away from driving, and benefits vulnerable users by making the built environment more inclusive and safer.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the crash occurred at 1:09 a.m. and involved a 2008 Acura sedan and a 2013 Nissan sedan, both traveling straight ahead. The report details that 'Unsafe Speed' was a contributing factor, with one driver also flagged for 'Alcohol Involvement.' The narrative describes airbags bursting and metal folding, leaving four occupants—two drivers and two passengers—injured. Victims suffered crush injuries, with one semiconscious, two incoherent, and one in shock. The force of the collision sent vehicles into parked cars, compounding the destruction. The police report makes clear: unsafe speed and driver recklessness shattered the quiet, leaving bodies broken and a street scarred.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
