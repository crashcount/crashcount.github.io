Four new elevators will rise. Three Harlem Line stops in the Bronx will open to all. The city’s transit spine grows stronger for those left waiting longest.</p><p class=mb3>On June 18, 2025, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced a sweeping accessibility project for three Metro-North Harlem Line stations in the Bronx: Williams Bridge, Woodlawn, and Botanical Garden. According to the MTA, crews will completely rebuild Williams Bridge and Woodlawn, installing four new elevators—two at each station—to ensure full accessibility. The matter summary states: 'comprehensive renovation and accessibility project at three Metro-North Railroad Harlem Line stations in the Bronx.' Christian Murray reported the announcement. No council bill number or committee applies, as this is an agency initiative, not legislation. The upgrades promise to open transit to riders long shut out by stairs and barriers. Improving station accessibility encourages more walking and cycling to transit, supports mode shift away from driving, and benefits vulnerable users by making the built environment more inclusive and safer.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Police charged the driver with manslaughter. Speeding violations followed the crash. Downer’s family mourns. The street remains unchanged. The danger persists.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News reported on May 8, 2025, that Sheydon McClean, an unlicensed BMW driver, was charged with manslaughter after a November 30 crash killed Dwight Downer, a retired correction officer and football coach, in Baychester. McClean remained at the scene, but police only charged him after further investigation. The article notes McClean’s BMW received at least three speeding violations from city cameras after the fatal crash. Downer’s mother said, 'These arrests cannot bring back my child. Still, something has to be done.' The case highlights the ongoing risks posed by unlicensed and repeat speeding drivers, and the limits of enforcement in preventing deadly crashes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the crash occurred at 1:09 a.m. and involved a 2008 Acura sedan and a 2013 Nissan sedan, both traveling straight ahead.

The narrative describes airbags bursting and metal folding, leaving four occupants—two drivers and two passengers—injured. Victims suffered crush injuries, with one semiconscious, two incoherent, and one in shock. The force of the collision sent vehicles into parked cars, compounding the destruction.
