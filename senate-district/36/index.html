Four new elevators will rise. Three Harlem Line stops in the Bronx will open to all.

According to the MTA, crews will completely rebuild Williams Bridge and Woodlawn, installing four new elevators—two at each station—to ensure full accessibility. The matter summary states: 'comprehensive renovation and accessibility project at three Metro-North Railroad Harlem Line stations in the Bronx.' Christian Murray reported the announcement. No council bill number or committee applies, as this is an agency initiative, not legislation. The upgrades promise to open transit to riders long shut out by stairs and barriers. Improving station accessibility encourages more walking and cycling to transit, supports mode shift away from driving, and benefits vulnerable users by making the built environment more inclusive and safer.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article describes the incident as an 'alleged road rage' shooting but does not detail the events leading up to the violence. Campbell was shot three times in the chest while sitting in his gray 2012 Infiniti sedan. His mother, Suzette Thomas, said, 'I want people to remember my son as a humble person, one to do the best for the world.'
