Twelve people are dead. Forty-three suffered serious injuries. In three and a half years, there have been nearly 5,000 crashes. The wounds are not just numbers. They are heads split on concrete, bodies crushed at crosswalks, lives ended mid-step. A 76-year-old woman, struck by an SUV on White Plains Road, did not make it home. A 24-year-old cyclist, crushed on E 233rd Street, left a bike mangled and a family waiting for a call that never came.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p>Pedestrians and cyclists pay first. Cars and SUVs killed five. Trucks and buses took one more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left others broken. The old, the young, the ones just crossing the street. In the last year alone, five people died and 864 were hurt. The pain is not spread evenly. It falls hardest on those with the least steel around them.</p><h2 id=what-leadership-has-doneand-not-done>What Leadership Has Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Senator Jamaal Bailey has moved on street safety. He voted yes on a bill to force safer street design for all users, not just drivers. The bill&rsquo;s aim is clear: &ldquo;Enables safe access to public roads for all users by utilizing complete street design principles&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>bill text</a>). Bailey also co-sponsored a bill to require complete street design on projects using public money (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S131>co-sponsored legislation</a>). But not every move protects the vulnerable. Bailey sponsored a bill to carve out traffic law exemptions for bus drivers in large co-ops, a step that could leave pedestrians and cyclists at risk (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S7785>traffic law exemptions</a>).</p><p>The work is not done. The blood on the street says so. &ldquo;An accomplice handed Aracena the gun used to shoot Campbell in the chest as the victim sat behind the wheel&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/17/accused-road-rage-killer-michael-aracena-bronx-navy-veteran-tried-to-flee-country-keino-campbell/>NY Daily News report</a>). The violence does not end with the crash.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Every day without safer streets is a choice. Call Senator Bailey. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real street redesign. Demand that every carve-out for drivers is struck from the law. The dead cannot speak. The living must.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

According to the MTA, crews will completely rebuild Williams Bridge and Woodlawn, installing four new elevators—two at each station—to ensure full accessibility. The matter summary states: 'comprehensive renovation and accessibility project at three Metro-North Railroad Harlem Line stations in the Bronx.' Christian Murray reported the announcement. No council bill number or committee applies, as this is an agency initiative, not legislation. The upgrades promise to open transit to riders long shut out by stairs and barriers. Improving station accessibility encourages more walking and cycling to transit, supports mode shift away from driving, and benefits vulnerable users by making the built environment more inclusive and safer.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The collision occurred as the taxi was traveling straight ahead and hit the pedestrian head-on, causing severe bleeding from her head. The report notes the cab’s front end was crumpled and its tinted windows obscured the driver’s face. According to the police report, 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' and 'Tinted Windows' were listed as contributing factors. The pedestrian was crossing against the signal and was not at an intersection, as documented in the report, but the presence of tinted windows is also cited as a factor. The focus remains on the driver’s visibility and the systemic risks posed by vehicle design and street conditions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
