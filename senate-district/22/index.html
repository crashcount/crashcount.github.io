Just last week, a 90-year-old man was crossing Avenue U at East 14th Street. A blue moped came fast. The rider wore a mask. He hit the man and left him dying in the road. “He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open,” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/brooklyn-90-year-old-man-hit-run-rider/>said an eyewitness</a>. The police are still searching for the driver. The family waits for answers that may never come.</p><p>The next night, a 70-year-old man tried to cross Avenue I. A Smart Car plowed into him. He died at the hospital. The driver stayed. No charges were filed. The street stayed the same.</p><h2 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h2><p>In the last 12 months, <strong>11 people have died</strong> on these streets. <strong>1,357 have been injured</strong>. <strong>22 suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same</strong>. Children, elders, men and women—none are spared. Cars and SUVs do most of the killing: <strong>18 deaths</strong>. Trucks and buses: <strong>4 deaths</strong>. Motorcycles and mopeds: <strong>no deaths, but 2 serious injuries</strong>. Bikes: <strong>no deaths, but 22 injured</strong>. The bodies pile up. The numbers grow.

The driver, Miriam Yarimi, rear-ended a Toyota, then continued into the crosswalk, striking the family. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said, 'the Audi continued forward, striking the mother and her kids in the crosswalk.' Yarimi's car had 99 violations since 2023, including 21 speed camera and five red light tickets. Lawmakers are calling for new legislation requiring speed limiters for drivers with repeated violations.

The article states, "A driver has been charged after a multi-vehicle crash in Brooklyn killed a mother and her two young daughters and critically injured her son." Police say Miriam Yarimi, driving an Audi with a suspended license, rear-ended a Toyota Camry and then struck the family in the crosswalk. Yarimi faces charges including manslaughter, reckless driving, and failing to yield. The Camry was an Uber with children inside, who were also hurt. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch called it "a horrific tragedy caused by someone who shouldn't have been on the road." The crash highlights the lethal risk posed by unlicensed, reckless drivers and the vulnerability of families crossing city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The collision occurred at 7:35 p.m. and left the boy with crush injuries to his legs. The report states, 'A 14-year-old boy on an e-scooter, no helmet, struck by a speeding sedan. The car’s right bumper crushed his legs. He stayed awake. Blood pooled on the street where his ride ended.' The police report explicitly cites 'Unsafe Speed' as the contributing factor in the crash. The sedan’s right front bumper was the point of impact, matching the boy’s lower leg injuries. The report notes the boy was not wearing a helmet, but this is listed after the driver’s error of unsafe speed. The focus remains on the driver’s excessive speed, which led directly to the severe injuries suffered by the vulnerable e-scooter rider.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
