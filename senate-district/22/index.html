The boy and his passenger were thrown. &ldquo;A 17-year-old boy died and an elderly man was in critical condition after a moped collision Monday in Brooklyn,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/teen-boy-dead-man-critically-injured-in-moped-crash-in-brooklyn/>reported the NY Daily News</a>. No arrests. The street stays the same.</p><p>Days before, a drunk driver in a Chevy Suburban tore through Coney Island Avenue. He hit a Volvo, then a police car. Two officers and a passenger were hospitalized. &ldquo;One police officer suffered a broken pelvis and arm, as well as head trauma, while another suffered a broken hip,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/15/brooklyn-drunk-driver-hurts-2-passengers-2-nypd-cops-in-chain-reaction-crash/>said police</a>. The driver was charged with DWI. The intersection is unchanged.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p>The dead are not numbers. They are children, elders, neighbors. In the last year, three children died. The oldest was 17. The youngest was five. Most were crossing with the light. Some were walking home. The cars that killed them were mostly SUVs and sedans. Trucks and taxis did their share. No helmet or crosswalk could save them.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-silence>Leadership: Words and Silence</h3><p>State Senator Sam Sutton represents this district. The record shows no recent public action, bill, or statement from Sutton on traffic violence. The silence is loud. The deaths continue. The law now allows New York City to lower speed limits. The city can act. The Senator can push. But the streets stay fast, and the bodies pile up.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by leaders who look away. Call Senator Sutton. Demand action. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real penalties for repeat offenders. Demand streets built for people, not for speed. <strong>Do not wait for another child to die.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

One driver collected 563 speed-camera tickets in Sheepshead Bay; another, 474 in Manhattan. The article notes, 'A few weeks ago, one of those [recidivist] drivers sped through a red light and killed a mother and her two young daughters.' Most fines go unpaid. Advocates urge Albany to pass the 'Stop Super Speeders Bill,' which would require speed limiters for drivers with six or more automated tickets in a year. Data show vehicles with over 20 violations are five times likelier to cause deadly or severe crashes. Some legislators resist, arguing ticket thresholds are too low.
