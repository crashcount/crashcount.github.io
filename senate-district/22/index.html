In the last twelve months, 10 people died and 1,300 were injured in crashes here. Three children never made it home.</p><p>On March 29, a mother and her two daughters, ages 8 and 5, were killed crossing Ocean Parkway with the light. A four-year-old boy was left broken but alive. The driver had 29 prior speed camera tickets. The city called it a tragedy. The numbers call it a pattern. See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Just last week, a 17-year-old boy died on a moped in Midwood. His passenger, 14, was thrown and left unconscious. Police said the moped <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/teen-boy-dead-man-critically-injured-in-moped-crash-in-brooklyn/>&ldquo;slammed into&rdquo; a car turning left</a>. The boy died at Maimonides. The driver stayed. No arrests.</p><p>On June 15, a drunk driver in a Chevy Suburban tore through Coney Island Avenue, smashing into a Volvo and then a marked NYPD car. Two officers were hospitalized with broken bones and head trauma. A passenger was ejected and nearly died. Police reported that <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/15/brooklyn-drunk-driver-hurts-2-passengers-2-nypd-cops-in-chain-reaction-crash/>&ldquo;one police officer suffered a broken pelvis and arm, as well as head trauma, while another suffered a broken hip&rdquo;</a>.</p><h3 id=patterns-who-pays-the-price>Patterns: Who Pays the Price</h3><p>Children, elders, and people on foot or bike pay most. In the last year, three children and three people over 65 died. SUVs and sedans do most of the killing. The numbers do not lie: 35 deaths, 41 serious injuries, 4,065 hurt since 2022. The dead do not speak. The living limp on.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-silence>Leadership: Action or Silence?</h3><p>State Senator Sam Sutton represents these streets. The record shows no recent public action, no new bills, no press quotes on traffic violence. The silence is loud. The deaths keep coming.</p><h3 id=what-next-demand-more-than-thoughts-and-prayers>What Next: Demand More Than Thoughts and Prayers</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every crash is a choice made upstream. Call Senator Sutton. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand the Stop Super Speeders Act. Demand streets where children can cross and live.</p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
