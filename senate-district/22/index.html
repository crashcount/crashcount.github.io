He survived. Many do not. In the last year alone, five children have died on these streets. Elders fare no better. On July 8, a 90-year-old man, Zhuo Xie, was killed crossing East 14th Street. The moped rider stopped, looked, and left him dying in the crosswalk. “He hit the guy and he left,” a witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/brooklyn-man-90-struck-by-hit-and-run-moped-rider-dies/>told the press</a>.</p><p>Last week, Dov Broyde, 70, was struck and killed by a Smart Car while crossing Avenue I. The driver stayed. No charges. The street stayed the same <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/man-70-fatally-struck-by-brooklyn-smart-car-driver/>NY Daily News</a>.</p><p>In the past 12 months, 14 people have died and 1,508 have been injured in SD 22. Seven of the dead were children or elders. The numbers do not flinch.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the harm. In three years, they killed 21 people and injured over 650 more on foot or bike. Trucks and buses killed four. Motorcycles and mopeds killed none, but left dozens hurt. The street is a gauntlet. The most vulnerable—children, elders, people on foot—pay the price.</p><h3 id=leadership-present-or-absent>Leadership: Present or Absent?</h3><p>State Senator Sam Sutton missed the vote on the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill that would force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed-limiting devices <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>. He missed votes on bills to protect school zones and bus lanes. He was present for a bill to boost street safety and access, and voted yes. But when the hardest votes came, he was not there.</p><p>“We want to make sure what happened doesn’t happen again,” <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/90-year-old-killed-brooklyn-moped-nypd/>said a neighbor</a> after the latest death. The streets do not change themselves. The dead do not vote.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p>Call Senator Sutton. Demand action. Demand he show up for every vote that protects the people who walk, bike, and play in SD 22. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real consequences for repeat offenders. The silence of power is not safety. The next name could be someone you love.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, titled 'Relates to requiring the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices for repeated violation of maximum speed limits,' mandates these devices for drivers who rack up eleven or more points in 24 months, or six speed or red light camera tickets in a year. The measure aims to curb repeat dangerous driving. Senators including Jamaal Bailey, Jabari Brisport, and others voted yes. The bill targets drivers with a pattern of violations, seeking to cut risk for pedestrians and cyclists by limiting repeat speeding.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
