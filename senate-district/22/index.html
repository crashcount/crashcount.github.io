Twenty-two left with injuries so grave they may never walk the same.</strong> The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross the street. In March, a mother and her two daughters were killed in the crosswalk on Ocean Parkway. In July, a 90-year-old man was struck by a masked moped rider who fled the scene. A witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/brooklyn-90-year-old-man-hit-run-rider/>said the rider hit the man and left</a>. The man died in the hospital. The street remembers. The families do not forget.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h3><p><strong>In the last twelve months, 1,358 people have been injured in crashes here.</strong> Three of the dead were children. The old are not spared. Cars and SUVs do most of the killing—<strong>18 deaths, 633 minor injuries, 227 moderate injuries, 12 serious injuries</strong>—but mopeds, motorcycles, trucks, and even taxis leave their own scars. The numbers are not just numbers. They are the cost of inaction, paid in flesh and bone. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><h3 id=leadership-present-or-absent>Leadership: Present or Absent?</h3><p>State Senator Sam Sutton missed key votes on bills that would have made streets safer. On June 12, Sutton was absent for the committee vote on the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, a bill to force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the law. The bill passed committee, but Sutton&rsquo;s absence is a silence that echoes. The families of the dead do not get to be absent. They show up at the hospital, at the morgue, at the empty chair at dinner.</p><h3 id=the-call-no-more-waiting>The Call: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Senator Sutton. Demand he show up for the living. Demand he fight for the dead. Tell him: every missed vote is another name on a stone. Every delay is a child who does not come home. The time for silence is over. The time for action is now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Audi had over 93 traffic violations, including 20 speeding tickets. Brooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez called it 'one of the worst collisions he has seen on a New York City street.' Yarimi reportedly refused a breathalyzer and berated first responders.
