In the last twelve months, <strong>11 people died</strong> and <strong>22 suffered serious injuries</strong> in crashes. <strong>Three children never made it home.</strong> These are not just numbers. They are families torn open, lives ended in the crosswalk, on the curb, at the corner store.</p><p>Last week, a 90-year-old man was crossing Avenue U at East 14th Street. A blue moped came fast. The rider wore a mask. He hit the old man and left him bleeding in the street. &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/brooklyn-90-year-old-man-hit-run-rider/>said a witness</a>. The killer did not stop. Police are still looking.</p><p>The day before, a 70-year-old man was crossing Avenue I. A Smart Car driver plowed into him. The man died at Maimonides. The driver stayed. No charges were filed. The street was quiet again by morning. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/man-70-fatally-struck-by-brooklyn-smart-car-driver/>Source</a></p><h2 id=the-patterns-that-kill>The Patterns That Kill</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the killing.</strong> In this district since 2022, they have taken <strong>18 lives</strong> and left hundreds more broken. Trucks and buses killed four. Motorcycles and mopeds killed none, but left many hurt. Bikes have not killed anyone, but have caused injuries. The pattern is clear. The danger comes on four wheels, heavy and fast.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-or-absence>Leadership: Action or Absence?</h2><p>State Senator Sam Sutton missed two key votes this June. One bill would have forced repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S4045</a>). Another would have expanded speed cameras near schools (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8117>S8117</a>). Both passed without his support. The silence is loud. The streets stay deadly.</p><h2 id=what-now>What Now?</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day without action is another day someone does not come home. Call Senator Sutton. Demand he show up for the living and the dead. Demand real change. The blood on the street is not washed away by words.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Three died. The law shields repeat offenders. The system failed to stop her. Survivors and advocates demand change. The street remains dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC reported on April 16, 2025, that Miriam Yarimi, a repeat traffic offender, was indicted for killing Natasha Saada and her two daughters after running red lights on Ocean Parkway and Quentin Road. Brooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez said, "Yarimi's dangerous driving killed three members of a Brooklyn family." Yarimi had 21 speeding and five red-light tickets but faced no license or insurance consequences due to gaps in current law. Gonzalez noted, "Current laws limit the DA's ability to pursue murder charges in such cases and called for legislative review." State Sen. Andrew Gounardes introduced a bill for speed limiter technology targeting drivers with multiple violations. The crash exposed systemic failures in enforcement and accountability for dangerous driving.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
