On July 8, a 90-year-old man tried to cross Avenue U at East 14th. A blue moped hit him. The rider stopped, looked, then fled. The man died in the hospital. His grandson pleaded, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/90-year-old-killed-brooklyn-moped-nypd/>&ldquo;We hope the authorities can find the person who did this. We are also concerned about the motorcycles running rampant in crowded residential areas.&rdquo;</a></p><p>The day before, a 70-year-old man was struck by a Smart Car while crossing Avenue I.

Forty-four people suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Cars and SUVs did most of the killing—<strong>18 deaths</strong>—but mopeds, motorcycles, and trucks all left bodies and broken lives behind. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-silence>Leadership: Action or Silence?</h3><p>State Senator Sam Sutton represents this district. Albany passed new laws: speed cameras renewed, the city allowed to lower speed limits. But the carnage continues. Assemblyman Michael Novakhov, after the moped killing, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/90-year-old-killed-brooklyn-moped-nypd/>said</a>, &ldquo;This can be avoided because if we would require any vehicles, any motorized vehicles, moving over a speed of 25 mph to be registered, to be insured, it would be much easier to find.&rdquo; Sutton’s record on these measures is not in the news. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every delay is a choice. Call Senator Sutton. Demand he back laws that slow cars, stop repeat offenders, and hold reckless drivers to account. Tell him: you want action, not condolences. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is the cost of waiting.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

A speeding Audi, driven by Miriam Yarimi with a suspended license, ran a red light at double the speed limit and struck an Uber before hitting Natasha Saada and her three children in a crosswalk. Saada and her daughters, ages 5 and 8, died at the hospital. Her son remains in critical condition. The article quotes survivor Shakhzod Ahmedova: 'After the car crash, we just saw the car flipped over and two kids on the ground. We were scared.' Police charged Yarimi with manslaughter, reckless driving, and other offenses. The incident exposes systemic risks: unlicensed driving, speeding, and failure to yield at busy intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The impact pushed the Camry aside and sent the Audi into four pedestrians—a mother and her three young children—crossing in the crosswalk. Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch stated, "This was a horrific tragedy caused by someone who shouldn't have been on the road." The mother and two daughters died; a four-year-old boy remains in critical condition. The Audi overturned. Speed cameras are present at the intersection, but the investigation continues. No criminal charges have been filed. The crash highlights the lethal risk posed by unlicensed drivers and the vulnerability of people on foot, even in marked crosswalks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
