Forty-one seriously injured. Over 4,000 hurt.</strong> These are not just numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. In the last year alone, ten people died and eighteen suffered life-changing wounds. Three of the dead were under eighteen. The youngest was eight. A mother and her two daughters were killed crossing with the light on Ocean Parkway. Their names are gone from the headlines, but the loss remains.</p><h2 id=recent-crashes-no-end-in-sight>Recent Crashes: No End in Sight</h2><p>The carnage does not stop. On June 23, a 17-year-old boy died after his moped collided with a car in Midwood. His passenger, just fourteen, was left with broken bones and a fractured life. Police said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/teen-boy-dead-man-critically-injured-in-moped-crash-in-brooklyn/>&ldquo;Jhoan later died at the hospital.&rdquo;</a> Days before, a three-car crash at Avenue U and Coney Island Avenue sent four people to the hospital, including two NYPD officers. Police said, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-crash-driver-arrested-3-car-collision-injures-4-people-including-nypd-officers-nyc/16756702/>&ldquo;a 25-year-old man was traveling north on Coney Island Avenue in a Chevrolet Suburban when he collided with the driver of a Volvo traveling west on Avenue U.&rdquo;</a></p><h2 id=who-bears-the-brunt>Who Bears the Brunt?</h2><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the highest price.</strong> In this district, SUVs and sedans killed seventeen people and injured hundreds more. Trucks and buses took four more lives. Motorcycles and mopeds left families shattered. The old and the young are not spared. The street does not forgive.</p><h2 id=leadership-words-action-and-silence>Leadership: Words, Action, and Silence</h2><p>State Senator Sam Sutton represents this district. The record shows no public statement, no bill, no vote on the latest carnage. The silence is loud.

Every crash is a policy failure. <strong>Call Senator Sutton. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action on repeat dangerous drivers.

The car’s right bumper crushed his legs. He stayed awake. Blood pooled on the street where his ride ended.' The police report explicitly cites 'Unsafe Speed' as the contributing factor in the crash. The sedan’s right front bumper was the point of impact, matching the boy’s lower leg injuries. The report notes the boy was not wearing a helmet, but this is listed after the driver’s error of unsafe speed. The focus remains on the driver’s excessive speed, which led directly to the severe injuries suffered by the vulnerable e-scooter rider.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
