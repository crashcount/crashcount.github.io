The old and the young are not spared. Three children died. Eight seniors over 65 died since 2022. The numbers do not lie. They do not comfort.</p><p>Just days ago, a 90-year-old man was killed crossing Avenue U at East 14th Street. A blue moped hit him and fled. His grandson <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/90-year-old-killed-brooklyn-moped-nypd/>expressed concern about rampant motorcycles in residential areas</a>. The street was left empty. The man did not come home.</p><p>Last week, Dov Broyde, 70, was struck and killed by a Smart Car while crossing Avenue I. The driver stayed. No charges were filed. The city moves on. The families do not.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the damage.</strong> In three years, they killed 17 people and hurt 846 more on these streets. Trucks and buses killed 4. Motorcycles and mopeds killed none, but left 28 injured. Bikes caused no deaths and 22 injuries. The machines are heavy. The bodies are not.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-and-silence>Leadership: Words and Silence</h3><p>State Senator Sam Sutton represents this district.

His head was wide open. It was a blue scooter. The driver had a mask. He hit the guy and he left.&rdquo; The words are plain. The horror is not.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day of delay is another risk. Call Senator Sutton. Demand action. Demand a street where you can cross and come home alive. The dead cannot speak.

The front end of the vehicle was crushed in the collision. A 27-year-old woman, riding as an unbelted front passenger, suffered head and crush injuries but remained conscious. The report states, 'The air stank of alcohol,' and lists 'Alcohol Involvement' as a contributing factor. The data points to driver error involving alcohol, a systemic danger that endangers all occupants. The victim’s lack of safety equipment is noted in the report, but only after the primary role of alcohol use by the driver. The crash underscores the ongoing threat posed by impaired driving on New York City streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The vehicle's center front end struck a 73-year-old woman who was crossing the intersection with the signal. The report states she was in the crosswalk and had the light. She suffered fatal head and crush injuries and died at the scene. The SUV sustained no damage. The police report lists 'Unspecified' as the contributing factor for both the driver and the pedestrian, but the narrative confirms the driver turned into the crosswalk while the woman crossed with the light. The driver’s action—making a right turn into a marked crosswalk occupied by a pedestrian—created the lethal impact. The victim’s behavior is noted only to confirm she was crossing with the signal, as reported.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Life ended in seconds.</p><p class=mb3>A deadly crash unfolded on McDonald Avenue near Bay Parkway in Brooklyn when a van, traveling south, changed lanes unsafely and struck a station wagon/SUV, according to the police report. The report states, "A van veered, struck a station wagon. The SUV’s driver, 54, died belted in place. The airbag burst. His body broke inside." The driver of the SUV was killed, suffering injuries to his entire body despite the deployment of the airbag and use of a lap belt. Two others were in the van. The police report explicitly cites "Unsafe Lane Changing" as the contributing factor. The van’s pre-crash action is listed as "Changing Lanes," and the point of impact was the center front end. No victim behavior is listed as a contributing factor. The focus remains on the van driver’s unsafe maneuver, which led directly to the fatal outcome.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
