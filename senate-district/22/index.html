Fifty-one seriously injured.</strong> Since 2022, the streets have not spared the old or the young. In the past year alone, fifteen people died and over 1,500 were hurt. Five of the dead were children or elders. The disaster moves slow, but it does not stop.</p><p><strong>Just weeks ago, a 90-year-old man was killed crossing Avenue U at East 14th.</strong> A blue moped hit him and fled. &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/brooklyn-man-90-struck-by-hit-and-run-moped-rider-dies/>said a witness</a>. Police are still looking for the rider. The family waits for answers. The street stays the same.</p><p><strong>Days before, a 70-year-old man was killed at Avenue I and East 5th.</strong> The driver was distracted. The man died crossing the street. No new laws, no new protections. Just another name on the list.</p><h2 id=the-vehicles-that-kill>The Vehicles That Kill</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars did most of the damage:</strong> 21 deaths, 14 serious injuries. <strong>Trucks and buses killed four.</strong> Motorcycles and mopeds took one more. Bikes caused none. The pattern is clear. The danger is heavy and fast.</p><h2 id=leadership-missing-in-action>Leadership: Missing in Action</h2><p>State Senator Sam Sutton missed the vote on the Stop Super Speeders Act—a bill that would have forced repeat dangerous drivers to slow down with speed-limiting devices. The bill passed committee without him (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). While others pushed for action, Sutton was silent. &ldquo;We hope the authorities can find the person who did this. We are also concerned about the motorcycles running rampant in crowded residential areas,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/90-year-old-killed-brooklyn-moped-nypd/>said the victim&rsquo;s grandson</a>. The pleas go unanswered.</p><h2 id=what-now>What Now?</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay means another family broken. <strong>Call Senator Sutton. Demand he show up, vote, and fight for real change.</strong> The dead cannot speak. The living must.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, titled 'Relates to requiring the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices for repeated violation of maximum speed limits,' mandates these devices for drivers who rack up eleven or more points in 24 months, or six speed or red light camera tickets in a year. The measure aims to curb repeat dangerous driving. Senators including Jamaal Bailey, Jabari Brisport, and others voted yes. The bill targets drivers with a pattern of violations, seeking to cut risk for pedestrians and cyclists by limiting repeat speeding.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Grief and anger fill Brooklyn.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC (May 2, 2025) reports on the fatal crash that killed a mother and two children on Ocean Parkway. The driver, Miriam Yarimi, had 'a lengthy record of speeding' and a recent camera violation. Despite her suspended license, no law prevented her from driving. The article highlights the 'Stop Super Speeders' bill, which would require speed limiter devices for drivers with six or more camera violations in a year. Amber Adler, a local advocate, calls Ocean Parkway a 'safety menace' and urges passage of the bill. The crash exposes gaps in enforcement and policy, leaving repeat offenders unchecked and vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
