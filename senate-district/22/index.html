They never made it across. An Audi, moving at 68 miles per hour, ran the red. The car did not brake. The driver’s license was suspended. The city had mailed 21 speed camera tickets and five red light tickets to her door. She paid the fines. She kept driving. The boy who survived is still in a coma.
