Since 2022, <strong>36 people have died</strong> in crashes here. <strong>Over 4,100 have been injured</strong>. Forty-five were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same again. The dead are not numbers. They are elders, children, neighbors. In the last month alone, two elderly men were killed while crossing the street. One was struck by a moped that fled the scene. &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/brooklyn-90-year-old-man-hit-run-rider/>said an eyewitness</a>. The other was hit by a Smart Car near his home. The driver stayed. The man died anyway. No charges were filed. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/man-70-fatally-struck-by-brooklyn-smart-car-driver/>NY Daily News</a>.</p><h3 id=the-vehicles-that-kill>The Vehicles That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the damage</strong>—18 deaths, 973 injuries. Trucks and buses killed 4, injured 367. Motorcycles and mopeds killed none in the last period, but left dozens hurt. Bikes injured 22. The streets are not safe for the old, the young, or anyone on foot. &ldquo;We want to make sure what happened doesn&rsquo;t happen again,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/90-year-old-killed-brooklyn-moped-nypd/>said a neighbor</a>. But it does, week after week.</p><h3 id=what-has-senator-sutton-done>What Has Senator Sutton Done?</h3><p><strong>Senator Sam Sutton missed key votes</strong> on bills that would have made streets safer. On June 12, he was absent for a committee vote on the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed-limiting devices. The bill passed committee anyway. Sutton also missed votes on school zone safety and speed camera bills. When he did vote, it was for a bill boosting street safety and access, but the record shows more absence than action. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>See the record</a>.</p><h3 id=the-call-no-more-waiting>The Call: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another family broken.</strong> Call Senator Sutton. Demand he show up, vote, and fight for real change. Tell him the dead cannot wait. The living are counting on him.</p><p><strong>Contact your leaders. Demand action. Do not let them hide behind silence.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
