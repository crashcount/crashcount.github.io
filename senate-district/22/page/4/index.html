They never made it across. An Audi, moving at 68 miles per hour, ran the red. The car did not brake. The driver’s license was suspended. The city had mailed 21 speed camera tickets and five red light tickets to her door. She paid the fines. She kept driving. The boy who survived is still in a coma.

According to the police report, a 21-year-old e-bike rider, unlicensed and unhelmeted, was struck head-on by an unlicensed SUV. The rider was ejected, left unconscious, and suffered severe head bleeding. The SUV carried two occupants, both unlicensed. The report states, 'Traffic control disregarded.' This failure to obey traffic signals or signs was listed as the primary contributing factor for all involved. The e-bike rider was not wearing a helmet, but this is noted only after the systemic disregard for traffic control. The crash underscores the lethal consequences when drivers ignore basic rules and operate vehicles without licenses.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
