Ten people killed in the last year. Eighteen left with injuries so grave they may never walk the same. In the same stretch, over 1,200 hurt. The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a 17-year-old boy died on East 8th Street. He rode a moped. A car turned left. The crash threw him and his passenger into the street. &ldquo;Jhoan later died at the hospital,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/teen-boy-dead-man-critically-injured-in-moped-crash-in-brooklyn/>wrote the Daily News</a>. No arrests. No comfort for his family. The street is quiet again, but the loss remains.</p><p>On Avenue N, a man on a motorcycle was killed. On Avenue L, a 73-year-old woman crossing with the signal was struck and killed by an SUV. The stories repeat. The faces change. The outcome does not.</p><h3 id=broken-bodies-broken-system>Broken Bodies, Broken System</h3><p>The violence does not spare the young or the old. Three children under 18 killed in the last year. Five more seriously hurt. The old are not safe either. One woman, 73, crossing with the light, was killed by a turning SUV. The driver kept his license. The woman lost her life.</p><p>The carnage is not random. Most deaths come from cars and SUVs—<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>17 killed, 11 seriously hurt</a> in three years. Trucks and buses took four more lives. Motorcycles and mopeds killed none but caused 1 serious injury; bikes caused no deaths or serious injuries. The city counts the dead. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-silence>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Silence</h3><p>State Senator Sam Sutton holds the seat. The record shows no bold action, no public push for the bills that would slow cars or hold repeat speeders to account. Albany passed Sammy’s Law, giving New York City the power to lower speed limits. The city can act. The Senator can lead.</p><p>But the silence is heavy. The dead do not vote. The living wait for change.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-thoughts-and-prayers>Call to Action: Demand More Than Thoughts and Prayers</h3><p>Call Senator Sutton. Demand action. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand support for the Stop Super Speeders Act. Demand streets where a child can cross without fear. The toll will not stop until the laws do.</p><p>Do not wait for another name to join the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The incident occurred as the man stepped into the street, not at an intersection and without a crossing signal, as detailed in the report: 'A 70-year-old man stepped into the street without a signal. An eastbound SUV struck him head-on. He died from head and internal wounds. The driver held a license. The bumper bore the mark where he fell.' The vehicle involved was a 2023 Acura SUV, traveling straight ahead with two occupants. The point of impact was the center front end, and the right front bumper showed damage. The police report lists 'Unspecified' as the contributing factors for both the driver and the pedestrian, and does not cite any specific driver error. The pedestrian’s action—crossing without a signal or crosswalk—is noted after the absence of identified driver errors. The report does not mention any additional contributing factors or behaviors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
