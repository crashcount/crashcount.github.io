In the last twelve months, <strong>11 people died</strong> and <strong>22 suffered serious injuries</strong> in crashes. <strong>Three children never made it home.</strong> These are not just numbers. They are families torn open, lives ended in the crosswalk, on the curb, at the corner store.</p><p>Last week, a 90-year-old man was crossing Avenue U at East 14th Street. A blue moped came fast. The rider wore a mask. He hit the old man and left him bleeding in the street. &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/brooklyn-90-year-old-man-hit-run-rider/>said a witness</a>. The killer did not stop. Police are still looking.</p><p>The day before, a 70-year-old man was crossing Avenue I. A Smart Car driver plowed into him. The man died at Maimonides. The driver stayed. No charges were filed. The street was quiet again by morning. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/man-70-fatally-struck-by-brooklyn-smart-car-driver/>Source</a></p><h2 id=the-patterns-that-kill>The Patterns That Kill</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the killing.</strong> In this district since 2022, they have taken <strong>18 lives</strong> and left hundreds more broken. Trucks and buses killed four. Motorcycles and mopeds killed none, but left many hurt. Bikes have not killed anyone, but have caused injuries. The pattern is clear. The danger comes on four wheels, heavy and fast.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-or-absence>Leadership: Action or Absence?</h2><p>State Senator Sam Sutton missed two key votes this June. One bill would have forced repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>S4045</a>). Another would have expanded speed cameras near schools (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8117>S8117</a>). Both passed without his support. The silence is loud. The streets stay deadly.</p><h2 id=what-now>What Now?</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day without action is another day someone does not come home. Call Senator Sutton. Demand he show up for the living and the dead. Demand real change. The blood on the street is not washed away by words.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The crash began when an Audi, driven by Mariam Yarimi on a suspended license, rear-ended a Toyota, then struck the family in the crosswalk. Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said, "A mother and two young children killed. Another child fighting for his life. A family and a neighborhood devastated." Six children and four adults were hospitalized. Residents told ABC7 that speeding and red-light running are common on Ocean Parkway. Authorities are investigating whether the driver ran a red light or was speeding. No arrests have been made.
