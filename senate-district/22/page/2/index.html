They never made it across. An Audi, moving at 68 miles per hour, ran the red. The car did not brake. The driver’s license was suspended. The city had mailed 21 speed camera tickets and five red light tickets to her door. She paid the fines. She kept driving. The boy who survived is still in a coma. The Brooklyn District Attorney called it <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/16/miriam-yarimi-driver-accused-killing-brooklyn-mom-and-two-kids-in-person-court-appearance/>&ldquo;one of the worst collisions I&rsquo;ve ever seen on a New York City street&rdquo;</a>.</p><p>A week later, a 61-year-old man tried to cross Bay Parkway. He was hit by an SUV. He died where he fell. The numbers do not stop. In the last year, <strong>nine people died</strong> on the streets of SD 22. <strong>Seventeen more were seriously injured.</strong> Children, elders, mothers, fathers. The names change. The story does not.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>SUVs killed more than any other machine. In three years, they took 17 lives and left 11 with serious wounds. Trucks and buses killed four. Motorcycles and mopeds, none. Bikes, none. The city counts the bodies. The city counts the tickets. The city does not stop the killing.</p><h3 id=the-silence-from-above>The Silence from Above</h3><p>The law lets drivers pay their way past the rules. &ldquo;A driver who is reckless and continues to speed, who continues to run red lights, they can pay off those camera tickets, there are no points on their licenses and technically their cars are not in scoff,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/miriam-yarimi-ocean-parkway-brooklyn-crash/>said Brooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez</a>. The system lets them back behind the wheel. The system is working as designed.</p><p>Senator Sam Sutton represents this district. In the record, there is no word, no bill, no vote, no public stand. The silence is loud. The blood is real.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Senator Sutton. Demand a law that stops repeat offenders before the next family is lost. Demand streets that put people before cars.
