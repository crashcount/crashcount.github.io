In the last twelve months, <strong>11 people died</strong> and <strong>22 suffered serious injuries</strong> in crashes. <strong>Three children never made it home</strong>. The numbers do not flinch: <strong>1,357 injured</strong> in just one year.

His head was wide open,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/brooklyn-90-year-old-man-hit-run-rider/>said an eyewitness</a>. The driver wore a mask. He did not stop.

Since 2022, they have taken <strong>18 lives</strong> and left <strong>872 injured</strong>. Trucks and buses killed 4. Motorcycles and mopeds killed none, but left dozens hurt. Bikes injured 22.

The collision occurred at 7:35 p.m. and left the boy with crush injuries to his legs. The report states, 'A 14-year-old boy on an e-scooter, no helmet, struck by a speeding sedan. The car’s right bumper crushed his legs. He stayed awake. Blood pooled on the street where his ride ended.' The police report explicitly cites 'Unsafe Speed' as the contributing factor in the crash. The sedan’s right front bumper was the point of impact, matching the boy’s lower leg injuries. The report notes the boy was not wearing a helmet, but this is listed after the driver’s error of unsafe speed. The focus remains on the driver’s excessive speed, which led directly to the severe injuries suffered by the vulnerable e-scooter rider.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
