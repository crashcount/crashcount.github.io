Since 2022, <strong>36 people have died</strong> and <strong>45 have been seriously injured</strong> in crashes. The dead are not numbers. They are elders, children, neighbors. In the last twelve months alone, <strong>11 people lost their lives</strong> and <strong>22 suffered serious injuries</strong>. Three of the dead were children. Two were over 65. The violence does not stop.</p><p>Last week, a 90-year-old man was crossing East 14th Street at Avenue U. A blue moped hit him and fled. &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/brooklyn-90-year-old-man-hit-run-rider/>said a witness</a>. The driver did not look back. The family waits for justice. The street remains the same.</p><p>The day before, a 70-year-old man was killed crossing Avenue I at East 5th Street. The driver stayed. No charges were filed. The city moves on. The blood dries. The crosswalk is still there.</p><h3 id=the-vehicles-that-kill>The Vehicles That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the harm</strong>. Since 2022, they have killed 18 people and injured hundreds more. Trucks and buses killed four. Motorcycles and mopeds killed none, but left dozens injured. Bikes injured, but did not kill. The pattern is clear. The bigger the vehicle, the greater the damage. The street does not forgive.</p><h3 id=leadership-missing-in-action>Leadership: Missing in Action</h3><p>State Senator Sam Sutton missed the vote on the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, a bill that would have forced the worst repeat offenders to slow down. He also missed the vote on a bill to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8117>expand school speed cameras</a>. The silence is loud. &ldquo;We hope the authorities can find the person who did this. We are also concerned about the motorcycles running rampant in crowded residential areas,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/90-year-old-killed-brooklyn-moped-nypd/>said the victim&rsquo;s grandson</a>. The community waits. The senator does not answer.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of blood on the street.</strong> Call Senator Sutton. Demand action. Demand votes. Demand streets where children and elders can cross and come home alive. The dead cannot speak.
