A 71-year-old man turned left. The moped slammed into the car. The boy flew from the seat. He died at Maimonides. His passenger, 14, was left broken and unconscious. There were no arrests. The police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/teen-boy-dead-man-critically-injured-in-moped-crash-in-brooklyn/>said Jhoan later died at the hospital</a>. The street was quiet again, but the loss stayed.</p><p>A week earlier, a drunk driver in a black Suburban tore through Coney Island Avenue. He hit a Volvo, then a marked NYPD car. Two officers were left with broken bones and head trauma. A passenger was thrown from the SUV, left in critical condition. The driver was charged with DWI and reckless endangerment. Police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/15/brooklyn-drunk-driver-hurts-2-passengers-2-nypd-cops-in-chain-reaction-crash/>reported one officer suffered a broken pelvis and arm, as well as head trauma, while another suffered a broken hip</a>.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-relentless-and-unforgiving>The Numbers: Relentless and Unforgiving</h3><p><strong>In the last 12 months, SD 22 saw 10 deaths and 1,306 injuries on its streets.</strong> Three children died. Nineteen people suffered serious injuries. The violence did not spare the old or the young. Cars and SUVs did most of the killing—17 deaths. Trucks and buses took four more. Motorcycles and mopeds, two. Bikes, none. The numbers do not lie. They do not comfort.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-or-absence>Leadership: Action or Absence?</h3><p>State Senator Sam Sutton holds the seat.

The living wait for action.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. These are not accidents.</strong> Every crash is a policy failure. Every death is a choice. Call Senator Sutton.
