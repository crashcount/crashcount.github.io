Fifty-one seriously injured.</strong> Since 2022, the streets have not spared the old or the young. In the past year alone, fifteen people died and over 1,500 were hurt. Five of the dead were children or elders. The disaster moves slow, but it does not stop.</p><p><strong>Just weeks ago, a 90-year-old man was killed crossing Avenue U at East 14th.</strong> A blue moped hit him and fled. &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/brooklyn-man-90-struck-by-hit-and-run-moped-rider-dies/>said a witness</a>. Police are still looking for the rider. The family waits for answers. The street stays the same.</p><p><strong>Days before, a 70-year-old man was killed at Avenue I and East 5th.</strong> The driver was distracted. The man died crossing the street. No new laws, no new protections. Just another name on the list.</p><h2 id=the-vehicles-that-kill>The Vehicles That Kill</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars did most of the damage:</strong> 21 deaths, 14 serious injuries. <strong>Trucks and buses killed four.</strong> Motorcycles and mopeds took one more. Bikes caused none. The pattern is clear. The danger is heavy and fast.</p><h2 id=leadership-missing-in-action>Leadership: Missing in Action</h2><p>State Senator Sam Sutton missed the vote on the Stop Super Speeders Act—a bill that would have forced repeat dangerous drivers to slow down with speed-limiting devices. The bill passed committee without him (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). While others pushed for action, Sutton was silent. &ldquo;We hope the authorities can find the person who did this. We are also concerned about the motorcycles running rampant in crowded residential areas,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/90-year-old-killed-brooklyn-moped-nypd/>said the victim&rsquo;s grandson</a>. The pleas go unanswered.</p><h2 id=what-now>What Now?</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay means another family broken. <strong>Call Senator Sutton. Demand he show up, vote, and fight for real change.</strong> The dead cannot speak. The living must.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The impact threw a 21-year-old male passenger from the e-bike, leaving him with severe lacerations across his body. The report states the victim was ejected and remained conscious at the scene.

The narrative notes the victim was not wearing a helmet, but this detail is mentioned only after driver errors.
