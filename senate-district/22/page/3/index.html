Since 2022, <strong>36 people have died</strong> in crashes here. <strong>Over 4,100 have been injured</strong>. Forty-five were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same again. The dead are not numbers. They are elders, children, neighbors. In the last month alone, two elderly men were killed while crossing the street. One was struck by a moped that fled the scene. &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/brooklyn-90-year-old-man-hit-run-rider/>said an eyewitness</a>. The other was hit by a Smart Car near his home. The driver stayed. The man died anyway.

Trucks and buses killed 4, injured 367. Motorcycles and mopeds killed none in the last period, but left dozens hurt. Bikes injured 22. The streets are not safe for the old, the young, or anyone on foot. &ldquo;We want to make sure what happened doesn&rsquo;t happen again,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/90-year-old-killed-brooklyn-moped-nypd/>said a neighbor</a>.

On June 12, he was absent for a committee vote on the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed-limiting devices. The bill passed committee anyway. Sutton also missed votes on school zone safety and speed camera bills. When he did vote, it was for a bill boosting street safety and access, but the record shows more absence than action. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>See the record</a>.</p><h3 id=the-call-no-more-waiting>The Call: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another family broken.</strong> Call Senator Sutton.

The report states the pedestrian was killed instantly, suffering crush injuries and head trauma. The incident occurred at approximately 3:30 p.m. The vehicle’s point of impact was the center front end, and the damage was noted on the left front bumper. The police report lists 'Unspecified' as contributing factors for both the driver and the pedestrian. The narrative notes the pedestrian was crossing against the signal, but this is mentioned only after the driver’s actions and systemic dangers. The driver was licensed and traveling straight ahead at the time of the crash.
