Eighteen people have died since 2022. Seventy-one have been seriously injured. The dead include children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians. Each number is a name lost, a family broken.</p><p>Just days ago, two men were killed crossing a Brooklyn intersection. A car drove through and left them dead in the street. The driver fled. Neighbors did not sound surprised. Neighbors <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>described</a> how &ldquo;drivers speed on that stretch of roadway.&rdquo; The bodies are gone, but the danger remains.</p><p>A 90-year-old man was struck and killed by a moped. The driver did not stop. Security footage showed the moment of impact. The man died at the hospital. There are no words for the silence that follows a life cut short. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/90-year-old-man-killed-in-hit-and-run-in-brooklyn-involving-moped/>CBS New York reported</a>, but the city moved on.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the harm. In this district, cars and trucks killed eight, left 17 with serious injuries, and hurt hundreds more. Motorcycles and mopeds took no lives but left 18 injured. Bikes were involved in 10 injuries. The street is a gauntlet for anyone not behind a windshield.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>State Senator Kevin Parker has voted for safety bills. He backed the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed-limiting devices. He voted to extend school speed zones. These are steps, not solutions. The blood on the street says more is needed. Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Call Senator Parker. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat offenders. Demand streets where children can cross without fear. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The plan uses 'hardened daylighting'—physical barriers, granite blocks, and planters—to stop cars from parking near corners. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' Nearly half of city traffic deaths happen at intersections, often due to blocked sightlines and turning vehicles. The redesign targets high-crash Brooklyn intersections first, including Ocean Avenue at Church Avenue.
