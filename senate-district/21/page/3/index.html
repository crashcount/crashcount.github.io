Seventy-one suffered wounds so grave they may never walk the same. The dead include children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians. Each one had a name. Each one is gone.</p><p>Just days ago, <strong>two men were killed crossing a Brooklyn street</strong>. A car tore through the intersection. The driver fled. Neighbors did not sound surprised. <em>“Drivers speed on that stretch of roadway,”</em> <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>one told CBS New York</a>. The bodies are fresh. The danger is old.</p><p>A 90-year-old man died after a moped hit him and kept going. Security video showed the moment of impact. The man died at the hospital. The driver did not stop. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/90-year-old-man-killed-in-hit-and-run-in-brooklyn-involving-moped/>CBS New York reported the facts</a>. No one in power came to the scene.</p><h3 id=the-patterns-that-kill>The Patterns That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage.</strong> Since 2022, cars and SUVs killed eight people and injured 870 more in SD 21. Trucks and buses killed four. Motorcycles and mopeds, bikes, and vans left dozens more hurt. The violence is not random. It is a pattern. It is policy made flesh.</p><h3 id=what-has-senator-parker-done>What Has Senator Parker Done?</h3><p>State Senator Kevin Parker has voted yes on bills to curb repeat speeders and expand school speed zones. He backed the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, which would force the worst offenders to install speed-limiting devices. He supported laws to create safety zones and expand ignition interlock monitoring. These are steps. But the blood still runs.</p><p>The streets remain deadly. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so. The cameras catch speeders, but the worst keep driving. The laws are not enough. The dead do not come back.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>Call Senator Parker. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat offenders.</strong> Do not wait for another name on the list. The time for patience is over. The time for mourning is every day. The time for action is now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The crash, which occurred at 8:11 a.m., set off a chain reaction that crumpled a line of parked cars. The report states that a three-year-old boy, restrained in the front passenger seat, suffered crush injuries to his face. The narrative describes the aftermath: 'The air smelled of metal. Sirens rose over the wreckage.' Police cite 'Alcohol Involvement' and 'Unsafe Speed' as contributing factors.
