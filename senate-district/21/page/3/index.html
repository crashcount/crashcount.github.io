Eighteen people have died since 2022. Seventy-one have been seriously injured. The dead include children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians. Each number is a name lost, a family broken.</p><p>Just days ago, two men were killed crossing a Brooklyn intersection. A car drove through and left them dead in the street. The driver fled. Neighbors did not sound surprised. Neighbors <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>described</a> how &ldquo;drivers speed on that stretch of roadway.&rdquo; The bodies are gone, but the danger remains.</p><p>A 90-year-old man was struck and killed by a moped. The driver did not stop. Security footage showed the moment of impact. The man died at the hospital. There are no words for the silence that follows a life cut short. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/90-year-old-man-killed-in-hit-and-run-in-brooklyn-involving-moped/>CBS New York reported</a>, but the city moved on.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the harm. In this district, cars and trucks killed eight, left 17 with serious injuries, and hurt hundreds more. Motorcycles and mopeds took no lives but left 18 injured. Bikes were involved in 10 injuries. The street is a gauntlet for anyone not behind a windshield.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>State Senator Kevin Parker has voted for safety bills. He backed the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed-limiting devices. He voted to extend school speed zones. These are steps, not solutions. The blood on the street says more is needed. Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Call Senator Parker. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against repeat offenders. Demand streets where children can cross without fear. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report states she was 'crossing with the light' and was in the crosswalk at the time of impact. The collision resulted in fatal injuries to the pedestrian, who died at the scene. The police report explicitly cites 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as the contributing factor on the part of the sedan driver. The vehicle's point of impact was the center front end, matching the narrative of a direct, forceful collision. The victim's behavior—crossing with the signal—is noted in the report, but the primary cause remains the driver's failure to yield. The crash underscores the lethal consequences when drivers disregard pedestrian right-of-way at intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
