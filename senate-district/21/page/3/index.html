An e-bike shot straight. Two young men launched from the bike, heads striking pavement. Blood pooled. Both lay conscious, bleeding, silent in the Brooklyn night. The street bore witness to their pain.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a sedan making a left turn at Utica Avenue and Avenue H in Brooklyn collided with an e-bike traveling straight. The crash occurred at 22:40. The report states, 'A sedan turned left. An e-bike kept straight. Two young men flew from the bike, no helmets. Their heads hit pavement. Blood pooled. Both conscious. Both bleeding.' Both e-bike riders, aged 22 and 21, were ejected and suffered severe head injuries with heavy bleeding. The police report lists 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as a contributing factor, highlighting a driver error. The sedan's left turn across the e-bike's path and the disregard for traffic control devices are central to the crash. The report notes the e-bike riders were not wearing helmets, but this detail is mentioned after the driver’s failure to obey traffic rules. The focus remains on the systemic danger posed by driver actions and traffic violations.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The crash occurred at 19:47, with both victims—aged 23 and 26—suffering severe lacerations and partial ejection from the scooter. The report states, 'A Lexus struck an e-scooter carrying two men. No helmets. Both thrown, torn, bleeding. Steel met flesh. Skin split open.' Both men were conscious but badly injured, left broken across the road. The police report explicitly cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor. The sedan driver, licensed in New York, was traveling straight ahead at the time of impact. The report also notes 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a secondary factor, but the primary failure remains with the distracted driver.
