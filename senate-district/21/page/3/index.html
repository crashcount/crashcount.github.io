A car sped through the intersection and hit them. Both died. The driver fled. Neighbors were not surprised. “Drivers speed on that stretch of roadway,” <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>one said</a>. The bodies were still warm when police took a suspect into custody. The street stayed the same.</p><p>Just a day before, a 90-year-old man was struck by a moped. He died at the hospital. The driver left him behind. Security video showed the moment of impact. There was no time to react. No time to say goodbye. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/90-year-old-man-killed-in-hit-and-run-in-brooklyn-involving-moped/>CBS New York reported</a> the facts. The city moved on.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h3><p><strong>In the last 12 months, SD 21 saw 6 deaths, 22 serious injuries, and 1,569 people hurt in 2,134 crashes.</strong> Children, elders, and everyone in between. One child dead. One elder dead. The numbers do not stop. Cars and SUVs are the main killers—<strong>8 deaths, 17 serious injuries</strong>—but trucks and buses took 4 more lives. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes added to the toll. The street does not care who you are.</p><h3 id=senator-parker-votes-and-silence>Senator Parker: Votes and Silence</h3><p>State Senator Kevin Parker has voted for bills that fund safer street designs and support speed cameras. He voted yes on the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, which would require repeat dangerous drivers to install speed-limiting devices. He co-sponsored bills to consider “complete streets.” But many of these laws only require consideration, not action. The streets stay wide. The cars stay fast. The dead stay dead.</p><h3 id=the-call-that-cannot-wait>The Call That Cannot Wait</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable. Every death is a failure.</strong></p><p>Call Senator Parker. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real redesigns, not just studies. Demand action for the living, not excuses for the dead.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.
