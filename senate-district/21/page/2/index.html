Twenty-four seriously hurt.</strong> In the last year alone, Senate District 21 has seen 2,058 crashes. The numbers are blunt. The pain is not. A pregnant woman killed in a hit-and-run. A cyclist crushed by a truck. An old man, 89, dead behind the wheel. Children struck on their way to school. Each loss is a hole in a family, a scar on the street.</p><p>On May 26, a woman was run down and dragged after a crash. The driver fled. Police are still searching. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/nypd-looking-for-driver-who-struck-and-killed-woman-in-brooklyn/>Police say a maroon Chevy hit the victim&rsquo;s car from behind, and when she got out to approach the vehicle she was run over and dragged.</a> No one has been charged. No one has answered for her death.</p><p>A few blocks away, a pregnant woman was killed by another hit-and-run driver. Her family mourns. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/woman-killed-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-was-pregnant-family-says/>A woman killed in a hit-and-run in Brooklyn on Saturday night was pregnant, her family says.</a> The killer is gone. The street is quiet again.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> In three years, 17 people have died and 68 have been seriously injured in SD 21. Most were walking or biking. Cars and trucks did the killing—eight deaths from cars and SUVs, four from trucks and buses. The rest from motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes. The victims are young and old. Some were crossing with the light. Some were children.</p><p>A school bus jumped the curb in Flatbush. A woman and an eight-year-old boy were hit. The boy’s arm broke. The woman’s neck and hip ached. The bus driver said he hit the gas instead of the brake. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/woman-8-year-old-boy-struck-school-bus-flatbush-brooklyn/16148988/>The operator told police he was traveling west on Farragut Road, making a turn onto northbound Bedford Avenue, when he hit the gas instead of the brakes, jumped the curb and struck the pedestrians before smashing into a fence.</a></p><h3 id=what-has-kevin-parker-done>What Has Kevin Parker Done?</h3><p><strong>Senator Kevin Parker has moved on street safety, but the pace is slow.</strong> He voted yes on a bill to require safer street design for all users, not just drivers. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>He backed S 9718, which calls for &lsquo;complete street design principles.&rsquo;</a> He co-sponsored another bill to force agencies to consider vulnerable users in every new project. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S131>He joined S 131, demanding transparency and safer design.</a></p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The bills are not yet law. The streets are not yet safe. The silence after each crash is louder than any promise.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-demand-now><strong>Call to Action: Demand More, Demand Now</strong></h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Senator Parker. Call your council member. Demand real change—lower speed limits, more protected crossings, and streets built for people, not just cars. Do not wait for the next siren. Do not let another family grieve alone. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
