A moped slams into a turning SUV. The rider is hurled, body torn, blood on the street. Semiconscious, broken, he lies in the silence. Traffic control disregarded. The city’s wounds deepen.</p><p class=mb3>At 4:58 a.m. on Utica Avenue at Clarendon Road in Brooklyn, a violent collision left a 41-year-old moped rider severely injured. According to the police report, a moped traveling north struck the right front bumper of a station wagon/SUV that was making a left turn. The report lists 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as the primary contributing factor. The moped rider was ejected from his vehicle, suffering severe lacerations to his entire body and was found semiconscious at the scene. The narrative describes the rider as 'broken in the dawn,' with blood marking the street. No victim actions are cited as contributing factors. The crash underscores the lethal consequences when drivers disregard traffic controls at New York City intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
