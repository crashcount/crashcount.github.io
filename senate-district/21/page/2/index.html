A moped hit him and kept going. He died at the hospital. The driver did not stop. The street did not forgive. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/90-year-old-man-killed-in-hit-and-run-in-brooklyn-involving-moped/>CBS New York reported</a> the facts: &ldquo;New security video shows the moment the man was struck.&rdquo; There is no comfort in the footage.

He voted yes on a bill to force safer street design for all users, not just drivers. The bill passed. It calls for &ldquo;complete street design principles&rdquo; to protect people on foot and bike. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>Senate Bill S 9718</a> is a start. Parker also co-sponsored a bill to require safer design on projects using public money. But the blood on the street says more is needed. The city and state have the power to lower speed limits, redesign crossings, and end the reign of repeat dangerous drivers. The question is not what can be done. It is why it is not done faster.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of loss.</strong> Call Senator Parker. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real street redesign. Demand an end to repeat offenders. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report states that the van's driver, a 31-year-old man, suffered crush injuries to his legs. The narrative describes, 'A van veered south, driver asleep. It struck four parked sedans. Steel folded. Glass scattered. The 31-year-old man woke to crushed legs and silence.' The police report lists 'Fell Asleep' as the contributing factor in the crash. No other contributing factors are cited for the victims or parked vehicles. The collision underscores the systemic danger posed when drivers lose control of their vehicles, even for a moment.

The report notes the e-bike riders were not wearing helmets, but this detail is mentioned after the driver’s failure to obey traffic rules.

The victim's behavior—crossing with the signal—is noted in the report, but the primary cause remains the driver's failure to yield. The crash underscores the lethal consequences when drivers disregard pedestrian right-of-way at intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
