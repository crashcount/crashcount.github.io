Seventy-one left with serious injuries.</strong> More than 8,000 crashes since 2022. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about age. Children, elders, mothers, sons. The street does not choose.</p><p>Just last week, two men died crossing a Brooklyn intersection. The driver fled. Neighbors spoke plain: <strong>&ldquo;Drivers speed on that stretch of roadway&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>CBS New York</a>). A 90-year-old man was struck by a moped and left to die. Security video showed the moment. The driver kept going (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/90-year-old-man-killed-in-hit-and-run-in-brooklyn-involving-moped/>CBS New York</a>).</p><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do the most harm.</strong> In this district, cars and SUVs killed eight, trucks and buses killed four, motorcycles and mopeds killed none, and bikes killed none. The dead do not get to ask why.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-and-silence>Leadership: Votes and Silence</h3><p>State Senator Kevin Parker has voted for bills to curb repeat speeders and extend school speed zones. He said yes to the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force the worst offenders to slow down (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). He voted to keep speed cameras near schools. These are steps. But the blood on the street says more is needed.</p><p>In 2022, safe streets groups called out Parker for ignoring their calls. They wanted more protected bike lanes, better bus routes, and a voice for the dead and injured (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/08/09/streetspac-to-central-brooklyn-voters-retire-state-sen-kevin-parker-now>Streetsblog NYC</a>). The record is mixed. The danger is not.</p><h3 id=the-work-ahead>The Work Ahead</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. The state can force repeat speeders off the road. But laws mean nothing if leaders do not act, and if the public does not demand it.</p><p><strong>Call your senator. Call your council member. Demand safer streets.</strong> Do not wait for another name on the list. The dead cannot speak. The living must.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
