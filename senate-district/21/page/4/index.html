A car tore through the intersection. The driver kept going. Neighbors were not surprised. “Drivers speed on that stretch of roadway,” <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>one said</a>. The bodies were left behind. The street stayed the same.</p><p>The week before, a 90-year-old man was killed by a moped. The driver fled. The old man died in the hospital. No new laws, no new barriers, just another name for the list. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/90-year-old-man-killed-in-hit-and-run-in-brooklyn-involving-moped/>CBS New York reported</a> the moment he was struck. The city moved on.</p><p><strong>In the last year, SD 21 saw 6 deaths and 1,566 injuries in 2,161 crashes.</strong> Twenty-two people were seriously hurt. Children, elders, cyclists, pedestrians. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p>The killers are cars, trucks, mopeds, vans. <strong>SUVs and sedans caused most of the pain</strong>—over 895 injuries and 8 deaths since 2022. Trucks and buses killed 4. Motorcycles and mopeds injured 18. Bikes, too, left their mark. The street does not care who you are. It only matters who is heavier, who is faster, who is left standing.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h3><p>State Senator Kevin Parker voted yes on bills to curb repeat speeders and extend school speed zones. He backed the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force the worst offenders to slow down. He voted to create more safety zones. These are steps, not leaps. The blood on the street says more is needed.</p><p>But the city still waits for a 20 mph speed limit. The cameras catch some, but not all. The law cracks down on the reckless, but the dead stay dead. The survivors limp home.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-make-them-hear-you>Call to Action: Make Them Hear You</h3><p><strong>Call Senator Parker. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement. Demand streets where children can cross and elders can walk.</strong></p><p>Every day you wait, another family waits for a call that will break them. The time for patience is over.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
