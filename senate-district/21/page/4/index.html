A moped hit him and kept going. He died at the hospital. The driver did not stop. The street did not forgive. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/90-year-old-man-killed-in-hit-and-run-in-brooklyn-involving-moped/>CBS New York reported</a> the facts: &ldquo;New security video shows the moment the man was struck.&rdquo; There is no comfort in the footage.

He voted yes on a bill to force safer street design for all users, not just drivers. The bill passed. It calls for &ldquo;complete street design principles&rdquo; to protect people on foot and bike. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>Senate Bill S 9718</a> is a start. Parker also co-sponsored a bill to require safer design on projects using public money. But the blood on the street says more is needed. The city and state have the power to lower speed limits, redesign crossings, and end the reign of repeat dangerous drivers. The question is not what can be done. It is why it is not done faster.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of loss.</strong> Call Senator Parker. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real street redesign. Demand an end to repeat offenders. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

He targets abuse by city officials and fake permits. His bill exempts people with disabilities. Another measure rewards whistleblowers. The Council should pass both. The city’s streets demand it.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2022, Councilman Lincoln Restler (District 33) announced legislation to revoke tens of thousands of personal vehicle parking placards, with exemptions for people with disabilities and those covered by collective bargaining. The editorial, titled 'Free perking: Pull back run amok NYC parking placards,' calls out rampant placard abuse: 'End this scam.' Restler’s companion bill would reward whistleblowers who report cheaters with 25% of fines collected. Both measures have four co-sponsors. The editorial urges the Council to pass the bills and for Mayor Adams to sign them. Placard abuse fuels lawless parking, endangering pedestrians and cyclists. The city’s lack of oversight lets drivers block crosswalks and bike lanes. Restler’s push aims to restore fairness and safety to New York’s streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

S.5004 would force a medical exam after seven license renewals. The move follows a teen’s death by a senior driver. New York lags behind other states on older driver safety rules.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0090-2022, filed at session’s end, came from the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced March 24, 2022, it urges Albany to pass S.5004. The resolution’s title: 'calling upon the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.5004, to enhance the fitness and safety requirements for certain licensed individuals.' Council Members Kalman Yeger (primary sponsor, District 44) and Robert F. Holden (co-sponsor, District 30) led the push. The bill responds to the death of Madeline Sershen, 17, killed by an 88-year-old driver who ran a red. S.5004 would require drivers to prove medical fitness with a physician’s exam after their seventh license renewal. New York’s current rules only demand a vision test every eight years, far less strict than many states. The council’s action highlights a gap in protections for pedestrians and other vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
