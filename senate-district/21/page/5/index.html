The city’s streets demand it.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2022, Councilman Lincoln Restler (District 33) announced legislation to revoke tens of thousands of personal vehicle parking placards, with exemptions for people with disabilities and those covered by collective bargaining. The editorial, titled 'Free perking: Pull back run amok NYC parking placards,' calls out rampant placard abuse: 'End this scam.' Restler’s companion bill would reward whistleblowers who report cheaters with 25% of fines collected. Both measures have four co-sponsors. The editorial urges the Council to pass the bills and for Mayor Adams to sign them. Placard abuse fuels lawless parking, endangering pedestrians and cyclists. The city’s lack of oversight lets drivers block crosswalks and bike lanes.
