Since 2022, <strong>18 people have died</strong>. <strong>71 have been seriously injured</strong>. <strong>5 deaths already this year</strong>. These are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors. A 16-year-old on a bike, crushed by a truck. A 74-year-old woman, killed crossing with the signal. A 90-year-old man, struck by a moped and left to die. The road does not forgive.</p><p>Last week, two men were killed crossing a Brooklyn street. The car did not stop. Neighbors <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>said drivers speed on that stretch of roadway.</a> The bodies were still warm when the next crash came. Fourteen people were hurt when a van slammed into a tree. The city moves on. The blood dries. The danger stays.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the highest price.</strong> In this district, cars and trucks are the main killers—<strong>8 deaths and 17 serious injuries</strong> from cars and SUVs, <strong>4 deaths and 4 serious injuries</strong> from trucks and buses. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll. The young are not spared. <strong>Two children have died</strong> since 2022. The old are not spared. The city counts the bodies. The street stays the same.</p><h3 id=what-has-senator-parker-done>What Has Senator Parker Done?</h3><p>State Senator Kevin Parker has voted for safety bills. He voted yes to require speed-limiting devices for repeat speeders, a move to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>curb repeat dangerous driving</a>. He voted to extend school speed zones. These are steps. But the crisis is not over. The crashes keep coming.

This is policy.</strong> Call Senator Parker. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people walking and biking.

The editorial, titled 'Free perking: Pull back run amok NYC parking placards,' calls out rampant placard abuse: 'End this scam.' Restler’s companion bill would reward whistleblowers who report cheaters with 25% of fines collected. Both measures have four co-sponsors. The editorial urges the Council to pass the bills and for Mayor Adams to sign them. Placard abuse fuels lawless parking, endangering pedestrians and cyclists.
