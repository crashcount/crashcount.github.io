In the past year, <strong>4 people died</strong> and <strong>1,491 were injured</strong> in crashes. Seventeen of those injuries were serious—lives changed in a blink. Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians all paid the price. A 16-year-old girl was killed crossing at 46th Street and 47th Avenue. A cyclist, Amanda Servedio, was struck and killed while returning from a ride. She &ldquo;went airborne. She flew like 30 feet. It was a lot of force,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>said a witness</a>. The driver fled. The family waits for justice.</p><p><strong>No one is safe.</strong> In April, an unlicensed driver spun onto the sidewalk outside a school, breaking a 7-year-old girl&rsquo;s femur and injuring two others. &ldquo;Bah was arrested and charged with reckless endangerment, reckless driving and driving without a license,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/04/us-news/out-of-control-nyc-driver-hits-two-kids-1-adult-during-evening-rush-leaving-girl-7-with-broken-femur-cops/>reported the press</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-pressure>Leadership: Progress and Pressure</h3><p><strong>Senator Michael Gianaris has taken steps.</strong> He voted for the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>Complete Streets bill</a>, pushing for safer street design. He co-sponsored bills for <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4421>fare-free buses</a> and <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S3832>advanced vehicle safety tech</a>.

It is policy. It is delay. It is silence. <strong>Call Senator Gianaris. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real penalties for repeat offenders.

Prosecutors say Fiseku, fleeing police after an attempted burglary, sped through red lights and bike lanes, ultimately hitting Servedio at 37th Street and 34th Avenue. Surveillance captured the chase. The indictment states, 'The defendant allegedly led police on a 10-minute chase through the crowded streets.' Servedio, 36, was returning from a cycling event and had the right of way. Fiseku abandoned his truck and evaded arrest until February.
