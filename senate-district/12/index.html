It struck Amanda Servedio, a cyclist with the right of way. She flew from her bike. The driver fled. Police found the truck later. Servedio died at Elmhurst Hospital. The city lost another rider.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist reported on June 24, 2025, that Bekim Fiseku was indicted for murder and manslaughter after fatally striking cyclist Amanda Servedio in Astoria. Prosecutors say Fiseku, fleeing police after an attempted burglary, sped through red lights and bike lanes, ultimately hitting Servedio at 37th Street and 34th Avenue. Surveillance captured the chase. The indictment states, 'The defendant allegedly led police on a 10-minute chase through the crowded streets.' Servedio, 36, was returning from a cycling event and had the right of way. Fiseku abandoned his truck and evaded arrest until February. The case highlights the lethal risk posed by reckless drivers and high-speed police pursuits on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
