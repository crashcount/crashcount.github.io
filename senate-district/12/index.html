Seventeen seriously hurt.</strong> In the last year, Senate District 12 saw 2,492 crashes. The bodies are not numbers. A cyclist, Amanda Servedio, was struck and killed in Astoria by a pickup fleeing police. She was coming home from a ride. She had the right of way. A witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>described the impact</a>: &ldquo;She went airborne. She flew like 30 feet. It was a lot of force.&rdquo;</p><p>A 7-year-old girl was hit outside her school by an unlicensed driver. She left with a broken femur and a head wound. The car jumped the curb. The driver was charged with reckless endangerment and driving without a license. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/04/us-news/out-of-control-nyc-driver-hits-two-kids-1-adult-during-evening-rush-leaving-girl-7-with-broken-femur-cops/>Three people were struck.</a></p><p><strong>The old and the young.

Who Acts?</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do the killing.</strong> In this district, they caused the most deaths and injuries to pedestrians. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes also took lives, but the numbers are smaller. The street is a gauntlet. The most vulnerable pay the price.</p><h3 id=senator-gianaris-action-and-silence>Senator Gianaris: Action and Silence</h3><p>Senator Michael Gianaris has taken steps. He voted yes on a bill to force safer street design statewide. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/28/reckless-the-114-precinct-is-an-island-of-high-speed-chases-in-queens>He backed penalties for repeat reckless drivers.</a> He called for suspending registrations for the worst offenders. He supported the push to open a safe path on the Queensboro Bridge, ending years of delay. Gianaris <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-completes-long-stalled-plan-to-separate-bikes-and-pedestrians-on-queensboro-bridge>praised the completion of new pedestrian paths</a>: &ldquo;After years of advocacy, many of us were excited to see [the city&rsquo;s Department of Transportation] complete the work to open new, dedicated pedestrian paths on the Queensboro Bridge.&rdquo;</p><p>But the blood on the street says it is not enough. The laws are slow. The deaths are fast.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next? No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day, another family waits for a call that never comes.</strong></p><p><strong>Call Senator Gianaris. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real penalties for repeat speeders. Demand streets built for people, not cars.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another child’s shoe in the road.

Surveillance captured the chase. The indictment states, 'The defendant allegedly led police on a 10-minute chase through the crowded streets.'

The project, first announced under former Mayor Bill de Blasio, faced delays after Mayor Eric Adams took office. The north outer roadway is now for cyclists, the south for pedestrians. State Senate Deputy Majority Leader Michael Gianaris, District 12, praised the completion, saying, 'After years of advocacy, many of us were excited to see [the city's Department of Transportation] complete the work to open new, dedicated pedestrian paths on the Queensboro Bridge.' Gianaris also criticized the unexplained delays. The plan ends years of conflict and danger for vulnerable road users forced to share a narrow lane.

The report states, 'A Kawasaki motorcycle merges. Metal strikes left rear bumper. The rider, twenty-two, crumples to the pavement. Blood pools near his leg, torn and raw. No helmet. He is awake. The Ford shows no wounds.' The collision left the motorcyclist with severe lacerations to his lower leg and foot. Police data lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified.' The Ford car involved sustained no damage and its driver is not reported as injured. The report notes the rider was not wearing a helmet, but does not identify this as a contributing factor. No driver errors are cited in the official record. The narrative centers on the violence of impact and the vulnerability of the rider.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The city must weigh the cost—and the gains.</p><p class=mb3>On April 14, 2025, a policy analysis by Charles Komanoff examined the impact of fare-free buses in New York City. The report, covered by Streetsblog NYC, found that eliminating fares would cut bus trip times by 12 percent and boost annual ridership by 169 million, a 23 percent jump. The study states: 'Each dollar of city government support would produce more than two dollars worth of benefits for residents, primarily by removing the burden of fare payments while providing faster and more reliable bus service.' Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and State Senator Michael Gianaris, both of Queens, have pushed the MTA to consider free buses. Komanoff’s analysis shows that faster buses mean less time waiting, cleaner air, fewer crashes, and a small but real drop in car trips. The report adds fuel to the debate over city funding for free bus service.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The study, covered by Streetsblog, found that eliminating fares would speed up bus trips by 12 percent and increase annual ridership by 169 million—up 20 percent. The report states: "Fare-free buses would juice bus speeds and ridership while also bringing economic benefits to bus riders themselves." State Senator Michael Gianaris, representing District 12, is mentioned as a supporter. The analysis, led by Charles Komanoff, shows that removing fares slashes dwell times and makes service faster and more reliable. While the shift from cars to buses is modest, the benefits for bus riders are clear: less waiting, more access, and safer streets. The debate over funding and implementation continues in the council.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report does not list any victim behavior as a contributing factor, only noting the absence of a helmet after describing the driver’s inattention.

The protest highlighted the ongoing crisis: nine lanes for cars, one narrow, shared lane for cyclists and pedestrians. Crashes and near-misses are common.

The Department of Transportation had planned to open the dedicated walkway on March 16, but the mayor's office intervened, citing the need for a briefing. The lawmakers wrote, 'The reasons given for this delay are not satisfactory, as all communications from the DOT have indicated that the project is complete and ready to open to the public.' They warned, 'Any further delays to this project that is otherwise ready to open will unnecessarily put at risk the thousands of New Yorkers who cycle and walk the current shared path every day.' The project, in the works since at least 2017, remains stalled. Cyclists and pedestrians are forced to share a cramped, hazardous lane.
