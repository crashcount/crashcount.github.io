She was riding home from a cycling event when a pickup, fleeing police, ran her down at 37th Street and 34th Avenue. She flew thirty feet. She did not scream. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>&ldquo;She went airborne. She flew like 30 feet. It was a lot of force.&rdquo;</a> The driver left her in the street. Her father <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>said they were upset police didn&rsquo;t stop the chase</a>: &ldquo;It was probably not the place to be doing a high-speed chase, in the residential neighborhood, and we were very upset that that&rsquo;s what actually happened.&rdquo;</p><p>A few months later, an unlicensed driver reversed into a box truck, spun onto the sidewalk outside a school, and hit three people. A seven-year-old girl broke her femur. A fourteen-year-old limped away. A man was bruised. The driver was charged with reckless endangerment and driving without a license. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/04/us-news/out-of-control-nyc-driver-hits-two-kids-1-adult-during-evening-rush-leaving-girl-7-with-broken-femur-cops/>Three people in the path of the sedan were struck, including the 7-year-old girl, who also suffered a head injury.</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, SD 12 saw <strong>5 deaths</strong> and <strong>19 serious injuries</strong> from crashes. There were <strong>2,673 crashes</strong> and <strong>1,657 injuries</strong>. The bodies pile up. The numbers do not lie.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt. Cars and trucks caused the most harm: <strong>5 deaths, 11 serious injuries</strong>. Motorcycles and mopeds killed and maimed too. Bikes killed one, seriously injured two. No one is safe. Not the old, not the young. Not on the sidewalk, not in the crosswalk.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h3><p>State Senator Michael Gianaris has spoken for safety. He co-sponsored and voted for the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. He called for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/28/reckless-the-114-precinct-is-an-island-of-high-speed-chases-in-queens>stronger penalties for repeat reckless drivers</a>. He pushed for <a href=https://nypost.com/2023/03/30/dot-to-install-traffic-light-at-queens-corner-where-little-girl-died/>safer crossings after a child was killed</a>. He demanded the city <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/09/pols-demand-adams-open-queensboro-bridge-pedestrian-path>open the Queensboro Bridge pedestrian path</a>. But the deaths keep coming. The streets are not safe. The laws are not enough. The city moves slow. The blood dries fast.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your leaders. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real penalties for repeat offenders. Demand streets built for people, not cars.</strong></p><p>Every day you wait, someone else will not come home.

The pilot ran for one year, costing $15 million, with increased ridership and fewer assaults on drivers. Mamdani supports expanding bus lanes and meeting Streets Master Plan mandates. State Senator Michael Gianaris backed the pilot, calling the cost manageable. Experts warn of service tradeoffs. The safety analyst notes: increased ridership signals a shift from cars, boosting safety for pedestrians and cyclists through safety in numbers and less vehicle traffic.

The bill, titled 'Relates to requiring the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices for repeated violation of maximum speed limits,' mandates these devices for drivers who rack up eleven or more points in 24 months, or six speed or red light camera tickets in a year. The measure aims to curb repeat dangerous driving. Senators including Jamaal Bailey, Jabari Brisport, and others voted yes. The bill targets drivers with a pattern of violations, seeking to cut risk for pedestrians and cyclists by limiting repeat speeding.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The group’s ranks swell with each tragedy. No specific bill or committee is named in this event. Kuntzman’s statement underscores the relentless danger faced by pedestrians and cyclists. The safety analyst notes: the event describes a new member joining an advocacy group, which does not directly affect pedestrian or cyclist safety at the population level. The city’s streets remain perilous.

The project, first announced under former Mayor Bill de Blasio, faced delays after Mayor Eric Adams took office. The north outer roadway is now for cyclists, the south for pedestrians. State Senate Deputy Majority Leader Michael Gianaris, District 12, praised the completion, saying, 'After years of advocacy, many of us were excited to see [the city's Department of Transportation] complete the work to open new, dedicated pedestrian paths on the Queensboro Bridge.' Gianaris also criticized the unexplained delays. The plan ends years of conflict and danger for vulnerable road users forced to share a narrow lane.

Faster boarding slashes dwell times. Riders save time. Streets get safer, air gets cleaner. The city must weigh the cost—and the gains.</p><p class=mb3>On April 14, 2025, a policy analysis by Charles Komanoff examined the impact of fare-free buses in New York City. The report, covered by Streetsblog NYC, found that eliminating fares would cut bus trip times by 12 percent and boost annual ridership by 169 million, a 23 percent jump. The study states: 'Each dollar of city government support would produce more than two dollars worth of benefits for residents, primarily by removing the burden of fare payments while providing faster and more reliable bus service.' Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and State Senator Michael Gianaris, both of Queens, have pushed the MTA to consider free buses. Komanoff’s analysis shows that faster buses mean less time waiting, cleaner air, fewer crashes, and a small but real drop in car trips. The report adds fuel to the debate over city funding for free bus service.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The study, covered by Streetsblog, found that eliminating fares would speed up bus trips by 12 percent and increase annual ridership by 169 million—up 20 percent.

The analysis, led by Charles Komanoff, shows that removing fares slashes dwell times and makes service faster and more reliable.
