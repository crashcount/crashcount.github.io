Sixteen left with injuries so grave they may never walk the same.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, 1,546 people were hurt in 2,521 crashes. Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians—no one is spared. A 7-year-old girl’s femur snapped outside her school. A 94-year-old woman was pinned under a van. These are not accidents. They are the cost of inaction.</p><h3 id=the-faces-behind-the-numbers>The Faces Behind the Numbers</h3><p>On a spring afternoon, a driver with no license lost control outside Our World Neighborhood Charter School. <strong>A 7-year-old girl, a 14-year-old, and a man were struck on the sidewalk.</strong> The younger girl’s leg broke. Her head hit the curb. Police charged the driver with reckless endangerment and driving without a license. Police <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/04/us-news/out-of-control-nyc-driver-hits-two-kids-1-adult-during-evening-rush-leaving-girl-7-with-broken-femur-cops/>said Bah was arrested and charged with reckless endangerment, reckless driving and driving without a license</a>.</p><p>A month earlier, a United States Postal Service van turned and drove over a 94-year-old woman in a crosswalk.

He called for stronger penalties for repeat reckless drivers and supported the long-delayed opening of the Queensboro Bridge pedestrian path. But the blood on the street says it is not enough. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program has lapsed. Unlicensed and reckless drivers still roam free. The city’s most vulnerable are still left to fend for themselves.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now? No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Call your leaders. Demand more.</strong> Tell Senator Gianaris and every official who claims to care: the time for half-measures is over. <strong>Push for real street redesigns, real accountability, and real protection for those on foot and bike.</strong> Until then, the numbers will keep climbing, and the names behind them will keep breaking our hearts.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The project, first announced under former Mayor Bill de Blasio, faced delays after Mayor Eric Adams took office. The north outer roadway is now for cyclists, the south for pedestrians. State Senate Deputy Majority Leader Michael Gianaris, District 12, praised the completion, saying, 'After years of advocacy, many of us were excited to see [the city's Department of Transportation] complete the work to open new, dedicated pedestrian paths on the Queensboro Bridge.'

The report, covered by Streetsblog NYC, found that eliminating fares would cut bus trip times by 12 percent and boost annual ridership by 169 million, a 23 percent jump. The study states: 'Each dollar of city government support would produce more than two dollars worth of benefits for residents, primarily by removing the burden of fare payments while providing faster and more reliable bus service.' Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and State Senator Michael Gianaris, both of Queens, have pushed the MTA to consider free buses. Komanoff’s analysis shows that faster buses mean less time waiting, cleaner air, fewer crashes, and a small but real drop in car trips.

Failure to yield leaves silence and broken bodies behind.</p><p class=mb3>A violent collision unfolded at Woodhaven Boulevard and 60th Drive in Queens, involving a sedan, motorcycle, and SUV. According to the police report, the crash occurred at 9:22 a.m. when all vehicles were traveling south. The report states 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as a contributing factor. The motorcycle was 'demolished,' and its 55-year-old male rider was 'ejected' and killed, suffering 'crush injuries' to his entire body. The narrative describes the scene: 'A sedan, motorcycle, and SUV collide, metal shrieks. The motorcycle is crushed. A 55-year-old man, ejected, dies on the street.
