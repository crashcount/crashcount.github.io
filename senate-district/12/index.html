Sixteen left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months, 1,544 were hurt in 2,525 crashes. Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—no one is spared. A 7-year-old girl, her femur snapped and head bleeding, was struck outside her school by an unlicensed driver who spun onto the sidewalk (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/04/us-news/out-of-control-nyc-driver-hits-two-kids-1-adult-during-evening-rush-leaving-girl-7-with-broken-femur-cops/>unlicensed driver hits kids</a>).

He voted yes on a bill to force streets to be built for everyone, not just drivers. The bill <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>calls for redesigning streets to protect all users</a> and passed despite opposition. He has also pushed for tougher penalties on repeat reckless drivers, saying, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/28/reckless-the-114-precinct-is-an-island-of-high-speed-chases-in-queens>&ldquo;Repeat reckless drivers must be held to account.&rdquo;</a></p><p>He backed the push for a traffic light after a child was killed in Astoria (<a href=https://nypost.com/2023/03/30/dot-to-install-traffic-light-at-queens-corner-where-little-girl-died/>traffic light after child killed</a>).

The deaths keep coming.</p><h2 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Every day without change is another day of risk.</strong> Call Senator Gianaris. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real street redesigns, not just promises. Demand that speed cameras stay on. Demand that repeat reckless drivers lose their right to drive. <strong>Do not wait for another child to die.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

State Senate Deputy Majority Leader Michael Gianaris, District 12, praised the completion, saying, 'After years of advocacy, many of us were excited to see [the city's Department of Transportation] complete the work to open new, dedicated pedestrian paths on the Queensboro Bridge.'

Streets stay deadly.</p><p class=mb3>This report covers the sharp rise in high-speed police chases in the NYPD’s 114th Precinct, Astoria, Queens. The article, published October 28, 2024, details community outrage after a cyclist’s death and repeated injuries. NYPD policy says chases should end when risk outweighs reward, but enforcement fails. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program, which once forced repeat offenders into safety courses, has expired. Comptroller Brad Lander says, 'Drivers who are repeatedly caught by speed and red-light cameras currently face no consequences other than a fine in the mail. Repeat reckless drivers must be held to account.' State Senator Michael Gianaris calls for stronger penalties, including suspending registrations. The NYPD has not adopted reforms. Residents and advocates demand legislative action and transparency. Without it, vulnerable road users remain at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
