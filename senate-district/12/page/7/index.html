Five people killed, nineteen left with serious injuries, and over 1,600 hurt in crashes in the last year alone (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The dead include children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians. The living carry scars—broken bones, lost work, empty chairs at dinner.</p><p>Just months ago, a cyclist named Amanda Servedio was struck and killed at 37th Street and 34th Avenue. She was coming home from a ride. A pickup, fleeing police, hit her and kept going. A witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>described</a> the horror: &ldquo;She went airborne. She flew like 30 feet. It was a lot of force.&rdquo; Her father <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>blamed the police chase</a>: &ldquo;It was probably not the place to be doing a high-speed chase, in the residential neighborhood, and we were very upset that that&rsquo;s what actually happened.&rdquo;</p><p>A seven-year-old girl was crushed outside her school on 35th Avenue. She left with a broken femur and a head wound. The driver was unlicensed. The street was busy with children. Police <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/04/us-news/out-of-control-nyc-driver-hits-two-kids-1-adult-during-evening-rush-leaving-girl-7-with-broken-femur-cops/>charged the driver with reckless endangerment, reckless driving, and driving without a license</a>.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p>SUVs and cars do the most harm. In three years, they killed five, seriously injured eleven, and hurt hundreds more. Trucks and buses killed four. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes also left bodies and broken lives. The old, the young, the ones on foot or on wheels—they pay the price for streets built for speed.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Senator Michael Gianaris has backed some steps. He voted for <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>complete street design changes</a> and <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4421>pushed for fare-free buses</a>, which can cut car use and make streets safer. He called for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/28/reckless-the-114-precinct-is-an-island-of-high-speed-chases-in-queens>stronger penalties for repeat reckless drivers</a>. He stood with families after children died and demanded new signals and crosswalks. But the blood still runs. The streets are not safe. The laws are slow. The deaths keep coming.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p>Every crash is preventable. Every death is a policy failure. Call Senator Gianaris. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real penalties for repeat offenders. Demand streets where children can walk home alive.</p><p>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. Act now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
