Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians are struck down on streets meant to carry them home.</p><p>Just months ago, a cyclist named Amanda Servedio was killed in Astoria. She was riding home from a cycling event. A man in a pickup, fleeing police, ran her down. A witness said, <strong>&ldquo;She went airborne. She flew like 30 feet. It was a lot of force.&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>NY Daily News</a>. Her father’s words cut deeper: <strong>&ldquo;We were certainly upset that they didn&rsquo;t stop the chase&mldr; It was probably not the place to be doing a high-speed chase, in the residential neighborhood, and we were very upset that that&rsquo;s what actually happened.&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>NY Daily News</a>.</p><p>A few blocks away, an unlicensed driver reversed onto a sidewalk outside a school. A seven-year-old girl was left with a broken femur and a head wound. Her classmate and a man were also hit. The driver was charged, but the pain remains <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/04/us-news/out-of-control-nyc-driver-hits-two-kids-1-adult-during-evening-rush-leaving-girl-7-with-broken-femur-cops/>New York Post</a>.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-behind-the-names>The Numbers Behind the Names</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs caused the most harm:</strong> 5 deaths, 536 minor injuries, 143 moderate, 11 serious. <strong>Trucks and buses killed 4, injured 36, and left 2 with serious wounds.</strong> Motorcycles and mopeds, 1 death, 18 minor injuries, 9 moderate, 1 serious. Even bikes killed 1 and injured 25. The numbers do not lie. The danger is everywhere.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h3><p>Senator Michael Gianaris has backed bills for safer streets. He voted yes on a law to force &ldquo;complete street&rdquo; design, making roads safer for all <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>Open States</a>. He pushed for fare-free buses, which can pull cars off the road <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4421>Open States</a>. He called for tougher penalties on repeat reckless drivers <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/28/reckless-the-114-precinct-is-an-island-of-high-speed-chases-in-queens>Streetsblog NYC</a>. But the blood on the street says it is not enough. The city still allows high-speed chases in crowded neighborhoods. The most dangerous drivers keep their keys.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Senator Gianaris. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand an end to reckless chases. Demand action before another child is left bleeding on the curb.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
