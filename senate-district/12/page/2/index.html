Another was seventy-five. In the same period, <strong>1,651 people were hurt</strong>—nineteen of them so badly their lives will never be the same. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old, walking or riding. They only rise.</p><p>Just this spring, a 7-year-old girl was left with a broken femur and a head wound outside her school. The driver did not have a license. The car jumped the curb and took her down. &ldquo;Three people in the path of the sedan were struck, including the 7-year-old girl, who also suffered a head injury,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/04/us-news/out-of-control-nyc-driver-hits-two-kids-1-adult-during-evening-rush-leaving-girl-7-with-broken-femur-cops/>reported police</a>. The sidewalk was no shield.</p><p>In October, a cyclist was run down and killed in Astoria. The driver was fleeing police. She was coming home from a ride. &ldquo;She went airborne. She flew like 30 feet. It was a lot of force,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>said a witness</a>. The street swallowed her whole.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-risk>Who Bears the Risk</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do the most harm.</strong> In three years, they killed 5, hurt 550, and left 11 with serious injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds took 1 life and injured 19 more. Bikes killed 1, injured 16. The numbers are not equal, but the pain is. Each crash is a family broken, a life cut short, a name turned into a number.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-miles-to-go>Leadership: Steps Forward, Miles to Go</h3><p>State Senator Michael Gianaris has moved. He co-sponsored and voted yes on the <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act</strong>, a bill to force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. He pushed for more speed cameras near schools. He stood with families who lost loved ones. But the blood keeps flowing. The law is not yet enough. The streets are not yet safe.</p><h3 id=act-demand-more-than-words>Act: Demand More Than Words</h3><p><strong>Call your leaders. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real penalties for repeat offenders. Demand streets where a child can walk to school and come home alive.</strong></p><p>Every day we wait, another family waits for a knock at the door.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Council Member Julie Won and State Senator Michael Gianaris attended, both supporting the reconfiguration. Won said, 'I have received no new information since Mayor Adams canceled the March 16 ribbon-cutting.' The protest highlighted the ongoing crisis: nine lanes for cars, one narrow, shared lane for cyclists and pedestrians. Crashes and near-misses are common. City Hall claims the project will impact several communities, but offers no timeline. The lane reverted to car use after the protest, leaving vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation had planned to open the dedicated walkway on March 16, but the mayor's office intervened, citing the need for a briefing. The lawmakers wrote, 'The reasons given for this delay are not satisfactory, as all communications from the DOT have indicated that the project is complete and ready to open to the public.' They warned, 'Any further delays to this project that is otherwise ready to open will unnecessarily put at risk the thousands of New Yorkers who cycle and walk the current shared path every day.' The project, in the works since at least 2017, remains stalled. Cyclists and pedestrians are forced to share a cramped, hazardous lane. City Hall insists on more review, while advocates plan a protest ribbon-cutting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Her knee splits open. Blood stains the street. She lies conscious, torn and bleeding in the evening light. The crash leaves pain and silence in its wake.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a cyclist traveling east on 31st Avenue near 51st Street struck a 17-year-old girl as she crossed the roadway. The report details that the bike’s front wheel impacted her leg, causing severe lacerations to her knee and lower leg. The victim remained conscious but was left bleeding on the asphalt. Police cite 'View Obstructed/Limited' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as contributing factors to the crash. The victim was not at an intersection and was crossing without a signal, but the report explicitly lists driver inattention and obstructed view as primary causes. The collision underscores the dangers faced by pedestrians on city streets when drivers—regardless of vehicle type—fail to maintain awareness and visibility.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The pause threatens subway and bus service. Advocates demand any replacement funds boost operations, not highways. Riders need frequent, affordable transit—not more gridlock and pollution.</p><p class=mb3>This editorial, published October 1, 2024, addresses Governor Hochul’s decision to pause congestion pricing and seek alternative funding for the MTA’s $15-billion capital plan. The article states: “If the governor wants to do the MTA and riders a favor, she should use the money she finds to instead boost MTA operations.” Author Samuel Santaella criticizes Hochul’s move, arguing it jeopardizes service for working-class New Yorkers. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and State Senator Michael Gianaris are cited as proponents of fare-free buses, while Riders Alliance pushes for six-minute service. The piece urges Hochul to reject highway expansions and instead invest in frequent, affordable transit. The editorial frames this as a fight for clean air, equity, and safety for all New Yorkers who rely on public transportation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
