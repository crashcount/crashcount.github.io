In the past year, <strong>4 people died</strong> and <strong>1,491 were injured</strong> in crashes. Seventeen of those injuries were serious—lives changed in a blink. Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians all paid the price. A 16-year-old girl was killed crossing at 46th Street and 47th Avenue. A cyclist, Amanda Servedio, was struck and killed while returning from a ride. She &ldquo;went airborne. She flew like 30 feet. It was a lot of force,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>said a witness</a>. The driver fled. The family waits for justice.</p><p><strong>No one is safe.</strong> In April, an unlicensed driver spun onto the sidewalk outside a school, breaking a 7-year-old girl&rsquo;s femur and injuring two others. &ldquo;Bah was arrested and charged with reckless endangerment, reckless driving and driving without a license,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/04/us-news/out-of-control-nyc-driver-hits-two-kids-1-adult-during-evening-rush-leaving-girl-7-with-broken-femur-cops/>reported the press</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-pressure>Leadership: Progress and Pressure</h3><p><strong>Senator Michael Gianaris has taken steps.</strong> He voted for the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>Complete Streets bill</a>, pushing for safer street design. He co-sponsored bills for <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4421>fare-free buses</a> and <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S3832>advanced vehicle safety tech</a>.

It is policy. It is delay. It is silence. <strong>Call Senator Gianaris. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real penalties for repeat offenders.
