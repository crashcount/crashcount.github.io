The group’s ranks swell with each tragedy. No specific bill or committee is named in this event. Kuntzman’s statement underscores the relentless danger faced by pedestrians and cyclists.

Faster boarding slashes dwell times. Riders save time. Streets get safer, air gets cleaner. The city must weigh the cost—and the gains.</p><p class=mb3>On April 14, 2025, a policy analysis by Charles Komanoff examined the impact of fare-free buses in New York City. The report, covered by Streetsblog NYC, found that eliminating fares would cut bus trip times by 12 percent and boost annual ridership by 169 million, a 23 percent jump. The study states: 'Each dollar of city government support would produce more than two dollars worth of benefits for residents, primarily by removing the burden of fare payments while providing faster and more reliable bus service.' Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and State Senator Michael Gianaris, both of Queens, have pushed the MTA to consider free buses. Komanoff’s analysis shows that faster buses mean less time waiting, cleaner air, fewer crashes, and a small but real drop in car trips. The report adds fuel to the debate over city funding for free bus service.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation had planned a ribbon-cutting for March 16, but Mayor Adams canceled it. Council Member Julie Won and State Senator Michael Gianaris attended, both supporting the reconfiguration. Won said, 'I have received no new information since Mayor Adams canceled the March 16 ribbon-cutting.' The protest highlighted the ongoing crisis: nine lanes for cars, one narrow, shared lane for cyclists and pedestrians. Crashes and near-misses are common. City Hall claims the project will impact several communities, but offers no timeline. The lane reverted to car use after the protest, leaving vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation had planned to open the dedicated walkway on March 16, but the mayor's office intervened, citing the need for a briefing. The lawmakers wrote, 'The reasons given for this delay are not satisfactory, as all communications from the DOT have indicated that the project is complete and ready to open to the public.' They warned, 'Any further delays to this project that is otherwise ready to open will unnecessarily put at risk the thousands of New Yorkers who cycle and walk the current shared path every day.' The project, in the works since at least 2017, remains stalled. Cyclists and pedestrians are forced to share a cramped, hazardous lane.

Cyclists and pedestrians pay the price. One cyclist is dead. NYPD ignores its own rules. Dangerous drivers face no real penalty. Officials and residents demand action. The city stalls. Streets stay deadly.</p><p class=mb3>This report covers the sharp rise in high-speed police chases in the NYPD’s 114th Precinct, Astoria, Queens. The article, published October 28, 2024, details community outrage after a cyclist’s death and repeated injuries. NYPD policy says chases should end when risk outweighs reward, but enforcement fails. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program, which once forced repeat offenders into safety courses, has expired. Comptroller Brad Lander says, 'Drivers who are repeatedly caught by speed and red-light cameras currently face no consequences other than a fine in the mail. Repeat reckless drivers must be held to account.' State Senator Michael Gianaris calls for stronger penalties, including suspending registrations. The NYPD has not adopted reforms. Residents and advocates demand legislative action and transparency. Without it, vulnerable road users remain at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
