Council Member Julie Won and State Senator Michael Gianaris attended, both supporting the reconfiguration. Won said, 'I have received no new information since Mayor Adams canceled the March 16 ribbon-cutting.' The protest highlighted the ongoing crisis: nine lanes for cars, one narrow, shared lane for cyclists and pedestrians. Crashes and near-misses are common. City Hall claims the project will impact several communities, but offers no timeline. The lane reverted to car use after the protest, leaving vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation had planned to open the dedicated walkway on March 16, but the mayor's office intervened, citing the need for a briefing. The lawmakers wrote, 'The reasons given for this delay are not satisfactory, as all communications from the DOT have indicated that the project is complete and ready to open to the public.' They warned, 'Any further delays to this project that is otherwise ready to open will unnecessarily put at risk the thousands of New Yorkers who cycle and walk the current shared path every day.' The project, in the works since at least 2017, remains stalled. Cyclists and pedestrians are forced to share a cramped, hazardous lane. City Hall insists on more review, while advocates plan a protest ribbon-cutting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Police said Bah 'lost control of her Nissan Versa and drove onto the sidewalk,' injuring the pedestrians. The younger girl suffered a broken leg and head injury; the older girl and a 58-year-old man had leg injuries. Bah was charged with reckless endangerment, reckless driving, and driving without a license. She has never held a valid New York driver's license. The Highway Collision Investigation Squad is reviewing how control was lost. Residents called for 'increased safety measures, like speed bumps.'

The article, published October 28, 2024, details community outrage after a cyclist’s death and repeated injuries. NYPD policy says chases should end when risk outweighs reward, but enforcement fails. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program, which once forced repeat offenders into safety courses, has expired. Comptroller Brad Lander says, 'Drivers who are repeatedly caught by speed and red-light cameras currently face no consequences other than a fine in the mail. Repeat reckless drivers must be held to account.' State Senator Michael Gianaris calls for stronger penalties, including suspending registrations. The NYPD has not adopted reforms. Residents and advocates demand legislative action and transparency.
