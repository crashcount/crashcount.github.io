An 84-year-old driver sped through a stop sign at 42nd Street and 19th Avenue, hitting two men standing by a food truck. The car was going about 60 miles an hour. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/astoria-queens-killed-crash-food-truck/>&ldquo;It was catastrophic. It just wiped out everything. He must have been gassed to the floor.&rdquo;</a> The force severed a foot.

I&rsquo;m just grateful that something moved me out of the way.&rdquo;</a></p><p>In the last 12 months, SD 12 saw 5 deaths and 27 serious injuries on its streets. Over 2,000 people were hurt. The dead include the old and the young. The numbers keep coming. The pain does not end.</p><h3 id=patterns-of-harm-who-pays-the-price>Patterns of Harm: Who Pays the Price</h3><p>Cars and SUVs do the most damage. In this district, they killed 5, seriously hurt 12, and injured hundreds more. Trucks and buses killed 5. Motorcycles and mopeds killed 1. Bikes killed 1. The bodies pile up, but the story is the same: speed, steel, and a moment&rsquo;s loss.</p><h3 id=leadership-what-gianaris-has-doneand-what-comes-next>Leadership: What Gianaris Has Done—and What Comes Next</h3><p>State Senator Michael Gianaris has moved. He co-sponsored and voted yes on the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting devices. He backed <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-completes-long-stalled-plan-to-separate-bikes-and-pedestrians-on-queensboro-bridge>dedicated bike and pedestrian paths</a> on the Queensboro Bridge after years of delay. He called for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/28/reckless-the-114-precinct-is-an-island-of-high-speed-chases-in-queens>stronger penalties for reckless drivers</a>. But the carnage continues. Promises and votes are not enough. Streets remain deadly.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call Senator Gianaris. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph default speed limit. Demand the city and state act now, not after the next body. Every day of delay is another family broken.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report, covered by Streetsblog NYC, found that eliminating fares would cut bus trip times by 12 percent and boost annual ridership by 169 million, a 23 percent jump. The study states: 'Each dollar of city government support would produce more than two dollars worth of benefits for residents, primarily by removing the burden of fare payments while providing faster and more reliable bus service.' Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and State Senator Michael Gianaris, both of Queens, have pushed the MTA to consider free buses. Komanoff’s analysis shows that faster buses mean less time waiting, cleaner air, fewer crashes, and a small but real drop in car trips. The report adds fuel to the debate over city funding for free bus service.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The study, covered by Streetsblog, found that eliminating fares would speed up bus trips by 12 percent and increase annual ridership by 169 million—up 20 percent. The report states: "Fare-free buses would juice bus speeds and ridership while also bringing economic benefits to bus riders themselves." State Senator Michael Gianaris, representing District 12, is mentioned as a supporter. The analysis, led by Charles Komanoff, shows that removing fares slashes dwell times and makes service faster and more reliable.
