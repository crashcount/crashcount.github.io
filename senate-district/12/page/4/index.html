She was riding home from a cycling event when a pickup, fleeing police, ran her down at 37th Street and 34th Avenue. She flew thirty feet. She did not scream. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>&ldquo;She went airborne. She flew like 30 feet. It was a lot of force.&rdquo;</a> The driver left her in the street. Her father <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>said they were upset police didn&rsquo;t stop the chase</a>: &ldquo;It was probably not the place to be doing a high-speed chase, in the residential neighborhood, and we were very upset that that&rsquo;s what actually happened.&rdquo;</p><p>A few months later, an unlicensed driver reversed into a box truck, spun onto the sidewalk outside a school, and hit three people. A seven-year-old girl broke her femur. A fourteen-year-old limped away. A man was bruised. The driver was charged with reckless endangerment and driving without a license. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/04/us-news/out-of-control-nyc-driver-hits-two-kids-1-adult-during-evening-rush-leaving-girl-7-with-broken-femur-cops/>Three people in the path of the sedan were struck, including the 7-year-old girl, who also suffered a head injury.</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, SD 12 saw <strong>5 deaths</strong> and <strong>19 serious injuries</strong> from crashes. There were <strong>2,673 crashes</strong> and <strong>1,657 injuries</strong>. The bodies pile up. The numbers do not lie.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt. Cars and trucks caused the most harm: <strong>5 deaths, 11 serious injuries</strong>. Motorcycles and mopeds killed and maimed too. Bikes killed one, seriously injured two. No one is safe. Not the old, not the young. Not on the sidewalk, not in the crosswalk.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h3><p>State Senator Michael Gianaris has spoken for safety. He co-sponsored and voted for the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. He called for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/28/reckless-the-114-precinct-is-an-island-of-high-speed-chases-in-queens>stronger penalties for repeat reckless drivers</a>. He pushed for <a href=https://nypost.com/2023/03/30/dot-to-install-traffic-light-at-queens-corner-where-little-girl-died/>safer crossings after a child was killed</a>. He demanded the city <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/09/pols-demand-adams-open-queensboro-bridge-pedestrian-path>open the Queensboro Bridge pedestrian path</a>. But the deaths keep coming. The streets are not safe. The laws are not enough. The city moves slow. The blood dries fast.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your leaders. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real penalties for repeat offenders. Demand streets built for people, not cars.</strong></p><p>Every day you wait, someone else will not come home.

Fifteen routes, more buses, faster rides. Focus on low-income neighborhoods. The move aims to shift New Yorkers from cars to transit. Congestion pricing looms. Riders want speed, reliability, and access.</p><p class=mb3>Senator Michael Gianaris introduced the 'Congestion Pricing Done Right' bill on March 4, 2024. The bill, now before the legislature, seeks to expand New York City's fare-free bus pilot from five to fifteen lines, with three in each borough. The measure promises $45 million for better bus reliability and frequency, targeting low-income and disadvantaged communities. The bill summary states: 'expand and extend New York City's fare-free bus pilot program.' Gianaris, as sponsor, aims to boost mass transit before congestion pricing takes effect. Supporters, including Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, Riders Alliance, and the Transport Workers Union, stress that affordable, frequent buses are vital for safety and equity. MTA Chair Janno Lieber backs more service but warns that bus lanes lag behind. The bill focuses on routes that can handle more buses without new infrastructure, aiming to make public transit a real alternative to cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, covered on September 18, 2023, drew over 200 residents and was organized by Western Queens elected officials. The workshop addressed a 'significant increase in traffic-related deaths, including several high-profile fatalities involving cyclists and pedestrians.' Councilwoman Tiffany Cabán, State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, and Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani called the deaths preventable and demanded urgent changes. Cabán stated, 'If it saves lives, it’s worth doing.'
