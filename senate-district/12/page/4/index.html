A 7-year-old girl, her femur snapped and head bleeding, was struck outside her school by an unlicensed driver who spun onto the sidewalk (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/04/us-news/out-of-control-nyc-driver-hits-two-kids-1-adult-during-evening-rush-leaving-girl-7-with-broken-femur-cops/>unlicensed driver hits kids</a>).

The bill <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>calls for redesigning streets to protect all users</a> and passed despite opposition. He has also pushed for tougher penalties on repeat reckless drivers, saying, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/28/reckless-the-114-precinct-is-an-island-of-high-speed-chases-in-queens>&ldquo;Repeat reckless drivers must be held to account.&rdquo;</a></p><p>He backed the push for a traffic light after a child was killed in Astoria (<a href=https://nypost.com/2023/03/30/dot-to-install-traffic-light-at-queens-corner-where-little-girl-died/>traffic light after child killed</a>).

The deaths keep coming.</p><h2 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Every day without change is another day of risk.</strong> Call Senator Gianaris. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real street redesigns, not just promises. Demand that speed cameras stay on. Demand that repeat reckless drivers lose their right to drive. <strong>Do not wait for another child to die.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
