Seventeen left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months, 1,490 neighbors have been hurt in 2,469 crashes. The dead include a 16-year-old girl, a 28-year-old woman on a bike, and a 75-year-old man in the back seat of a taxi. The youngest injured is seven. The oldest, ninety-four. No one is spared.</p><p>On June 26, a sedan making a left turn struck and killed a 16-year-old girl crossing at 46th Street and 47th Avenue.
