Seventeen left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months, 1,490 neighbors have been hurt in 2,469 crashes. The dead include a 16-year-old girl, a 28-year-old woman on a bike, and a 75-year-old man in the back seat of a taxi. The youngest injured is seven. The oldest, ninety-four. No one is spared.</p><p>On June 26, a sedan making a left turn struck and killed a 16-year-old girl crossing at 46th Street and 47th Avenue. She died at the intersection, her life ended by a car with a clear view obstructed. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data records the loss</a>. Days before, a cyclist was killed in Astoria when a pickup, fleeing police, ran her down. &ldquo;She went airborne. She flew like 30 feet. It was a lot of force,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>said a witness</a>. Amanda Servedio was coming home from a cycling event. She never made it back.</p><p>Children are not safe. In April, an unlicensed driver spun out of control outside a school in Astoria, crushing a seven-year-old girl’s leg and injuring two others. The driver was charged with reckless endangerment and driving without a license. The sidewalk is no refuge. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/04/us-news/out-of-control-nyc-driver-hits-two-kids-1-adult-during-evening-rush-leaving-girl-7-with-broken-femur-cops/>&ldquo;Three people in the path of the sedan were struck, including the 7-year-old girl, who also suffered a head injury,&rdquo;</a> police said.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-pressure>Leadership: Progress and Pressure</h3><p><strong>State Senator Michael Gianaris has voted for and sponsored bills to make streets safer.</strong> He backed the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>Complete Streets bill</a> and co-sponsored measures for <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S3832>advanced vehicle safety technology</a> and <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4421>fare-free buses</a>.
