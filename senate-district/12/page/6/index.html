Seventeen seriously hurt.</strong> In the last year, Senate District 12 saw 2,492 crashes. The bodies are not numbers. A cyclist, Amanda Servedio, was struck and killed in Astoria by a pickup fleeing police. She was coming home from a ride. She had the right of way. A witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>described the impact</a>: &ldquo;She went airborne. She flew like 30 feet. It was a lot of force.&rdquo;</p><p>A 7-year-old girl was hit outside her school by an unlicensed driver. She left with a broken femur and a head wound. The car jumped the curb. The driver was charged with reckless endangerment and driving without a license. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/04/us-news/out-of-control-nyc-driver-hits-two-kids-1-adult-during-evening-rush-leaving-girl-7-with-broken-femur-cops/>Three people were struck.</a></p><p><strong>The old and the young.

Who Acts?</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do the killing.</strong> In this district, they caused the most deaths and injuries to pedestrians. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes also took lives, but the numbers are smaller. The street is a gauntlet. The most vulnerable pay the price.</p><h3 id=senator-gianaris-action-and-silence>Senator Gianaris: Action and Silence</h3><p>Senator Michael Gianaris has taken steps. He voted yes on a bill to force safer street design statewide. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/28/reckless-the-114-precinct-is-an-island-of-high-speed-chases-in-queens>He backed penalties for repeat reckless drivers.</a> He called for suspending registrations for the worst offenders. He supported the push to open a safe path on the Queensboro Bridge, ending years of delay. Gianaris <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-completes-long-stalled-plan-to-separate-bikes-and-pedestrians-on-queensboro-bridge>praised the completion of new pedestrian paths</a>: &ldquo;After years of advocacy, many of us were excited to see [the city&rsquo;s Department of Transportation] complete the work to open new, dedicated pedestrian paths on the Queensboro Bridge.&rdquo;</p><p>But the blood on the street says it is not enough. The laws are slow. The deaths are fast.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next? No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day, another family waits for a call that never comes.</strong></p><p><strong>Call Senator Gianaris. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real penalties for repeat speeders. Demand streets built for people, not cars.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another child’s shoe in the road.

The incident, which killed 74-year-old Be Tran at Myrtle and Seneca Avenues, triggered public outcry. Gianaris criticized the city’s process, saying, 'They have to wait until that happens to get the score high enough to realize that an intersection needs protection.' He joined activists from the Ridgewood Tenants Union and Transportation Alternatives, demanding new signals and better street design. Gianaris said he contacted the Department of Transportation a year earlier with no result. The city claims over 20 traffic control approvals in Ridgewood, but residents and advocates say it’s not enough.
