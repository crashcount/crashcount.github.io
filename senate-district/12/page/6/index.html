Sixteen left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months, 1,544 were hurt in 2,525 crashes. Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—no one is spared. A 7-year-old girl, her femur snapped and head bleeding, was struck outside her school by an unlicensed driver who spun onto the sidewalk (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/04/us-news/out-of-control-nyc-driver-hits-two-kids-1-adult-during-evening-rush-leaving-girl-7-with-broken-femur-cops/>unlicensed driver hits kids</a>).

He voted yes on a bill to force streets to be built for everyone, not just drivers. The bill <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>calls for redesigning streets to protect all users</a> and passed despite opposition. He has also pushed for tougher penalties on repeat reckless drivers, saying, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/28/reckless-the-114-precinct-is-an-island-of-high-speed-chases-in-queens>&ldquo;Repeat reckless drivers must be held to account.&rdquo;</a></p><p>He backed the push for a traffic light after a child was killed in Astoria (<a href=https://nypost.com/2023/03/30/dot-to-install-traffic-light-at-queens-corner-where-little-girl-died/>traffic light after child killed</a>).

The deaths keep coming.</p><h2 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Every day without change is another day of risk.</strong> Call Senator Gianaris. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real street redesigns, not just promises. Demand that speed cameras stay on. Demand that repeat reckless drivers lose their right to drive. <strong>Do not wait for another child to die.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Gianaris criticized the city’s process, saying, 'They have to wait until that happens to get the score high enough to realize that an intersection needs protection.' He joined activists from the Ridgewood Tenants Union and Transportation Alternatives, demanding new signals and better street design. Gianaris said he contacted the Department of Transportation a year earlier with no result.
