The matter, titled 'NYC to install a traffic signal at the site of Queens crash that killed 7-year-old,' drew support from State Sen. Michael Gianaris, who said, 'I am glad the city is installing a traffic signal at the site of Naadhun's tragic death, in accordance with her family’s wishes.' Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez stated, 'No loss of life on our streets is acceptable.' The DOT has already added curb extensions and new crosswalks. Community members, including Alex Duncan, argue that one signal is not enough and demand systemic safety changes along the corridor.

Critics say low fees fuel car ownership, crowding out transit, bikes, and green space. Experts warn it’s a subsidy for drivers, not a fix for congestion or emissions.</p><p class=mb3>On March 16, 2023, a Senate proposal surfaced to create a Residential Parking Permit system in New York City. The plan, now under City Council review, would charge drivers up to $30 per month for curbside parking, with revenue aimed at funding the MTA. The proposal leaves key details—like reserving 20% of spaces for non-residents—to the Council. The bill’s summary claims it will reduce emissions and support transit. Senator Michael Gianaris supports the measure, but critics are blunt. Bike New York’s Jon Orcutt calls it a 'big nothingburger.' Donald Shoup says the $30 fee is a subsidy for cars. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives argues, 'public space should be used for transit, bike lanes, and green space, not car storage.' Studies show similar programs in other cities have failed to cut congestion or emissions, and may even increase car ownership. The Department of Transportation has testified against the plan, warning it entrenches private car storage at the expense of vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, part of the larger Fix The MTA Package, would phase in free local and Select Bus Service, increase bus frequency by 20%, freeze fares, and expand permanent bus lane camera enforcement. Funding would rise from $200 million in 2023 to $638 million in 2026, with $488 million yearly for more buses and $300 million annually for frequent subways. Mamdani called the proposal 'urgent and necessary,' stressing that 'seniors, working class New Yorkers, people who use the bus the most are able to do so without fear of being priced out.' Gianaris said, 'incrementalism...is not working.'
