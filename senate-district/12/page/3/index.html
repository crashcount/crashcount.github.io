An 84-year-old driver sped through a stop sign at 42nd Street and 19th Avenue, hitting two men standing by a food truck. The car was going about 60 miles an hour. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/astoria-queens-killed-crash-food-truck/>&ldquo;It was catastrophic. It just wiped out everything. He must have been gassed to the floor.&rdquo;</a> The force severed a foot.

I&rsquo;m just grateful that something moved me out of the way.&rdquo;</a></p><p>In the last 12 months, SD 12 saw 5 deaths and 27 serious injuries on its streets. Over 2,000 people were hurt. The dead include the old and the young. The numbers keep coming. The pain does not end.</p><h3 id=patterns-of-harm-who-pays-the-price>Patterns of Harm: Who Pays the Price</h3><p>Cars and SUVs do the most damage. In this district, they killed 5, seriously hurt 12, and injured hundreds more. Trucks and buses killed 5. Motorcycles and mopeds killed 1. Bikes killed 1. The bodies pile up, but the story is the same: speed, steel, and a moment&rsquo;s loss.</p><h3 id=leadership-what-gianaris-has-doneand-what-comes-next>Leadership: What Gianaris Has Done—and What Comes Next</h3><p>State Senator Michael Gianaris has moved. He co-sponsored and voted yes on the <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Stop Super Speeders Act</a>, a bill to force repeat speeders to install speed-limiting devices. He backed <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-completes-long-stalled-plan-to-separate-bikes-and-pedestrians-on-queensboro-bridge>dedicated bike and pedestrian paths</a> on the Queensboro Bridge after years of delay. He called for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/28/reckless-the-114-precinct-is-an-island-of-high-speed-chases-in-queens>stronger penalties for reckless drivers</a>. But the carnage continues. Promises and votes are not enough. Streets remain deadly.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call Senator Gianaris. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph default speed limit. Demand the city and state act now, not after the next body. Every day of delay is another family broken.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The pedestrian was crossing without a signal, but this is noted only after the primary driver errors. The vehicle's point of impact and damage were both at the center front end, underscoring the directness of the collision.

The article, published October 28, 2024, details community outrage after a cyclist’s death and repeated injuries. NYPD policy says chases should end when risk outweighs reward, but enforcement fails. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program, which once forced repeat offenders into safety courses, has expired. Comptroller Brad Lander says, 'Drivers who are repeatedly caught by speed and red-light cameras currently face no consequences other than a fine in the mail. Repeat reckless drivers must be held to account.' State Senator Michael Gianaris calls for stronger penalties, including suspending registrations. The NYPD has not adopted reforms. Residents and advocates demand legislative action and transparency. Without it, vulnerable road users remain at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article states: “If the governor wants to do the MTA and riders a favor, she should use the money she finds to instead boost MTA operations.” Author Samuel Santaella criticizes Hochul’s move, arguing it jeopardizes service for working-class New Yorkers. Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and State Senator Michael Gianaris are cited as proponents of fare-free buses, while Riders Alliance pushes for six-minute service.

The e-bike rider was wearing a helmet, as noted in the report, but this is mentioned only after the driver's errors. The collision occurred at 11:35 a.m., with the truck's right front bumper cited as the point of impact.

Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2024, the New York State legislative session ended without passing a replacement funding plan for the MTA after Governor Kathy Hochul paused congestion pricing. The matter, described as 'Albany pumps the brakes on MTA funding plan in rebuke of Hochul’s move to ditch congestion pricing,' left the MTA without the $1 billion annual revenue congestion pricing would have provided. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins announced the session’s close without a deal. Lawmakers including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris, State Sen. John Liu, Assemblyman Harvey Epstein, and Assemblyman Tony Simone criticized the governor’s decision and the proposed IOU bailout. Gounardes said, 'I cannot in good conscience ratify a decision that will eliminate a significant, dedicated revenue source for the MTA’s capital plan.' The pause leaves the city’s transit future—and the safety of those who rely on it—uncertain.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Yamaha motorcycle, traveling straight ahead, struck the truck's right rear bumper. The 26-year-old motorcyclist, wearing a helmet, was ejected from his bike.
