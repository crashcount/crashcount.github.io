She was riding home from a cycling event when a pickup, fleeing police, ran her down at 37th Street and 34th Avenue. She flew thirty feet. She did not scream. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>&ldquo;She went airborne. She flew like 30 feet. It was a lot of force.&rdquo;</a> The driver left her in the street. Her father <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>said they were upset police didn&rsquo;t stop the chase</a>: &ldquo;It was probably not the place to be doing a high-speed chase, in the residential neighborhood, and we were very upset that that&rsquo;s what actually happened.&rdquo;</p><p>A few months later, an unlicensed driver reversed into a box truck, spun onto the sidewalk outside a school, and hit three people. A seven-year-old girl broke her femur. A fourteen-year-old limped away. A man was bruised. The driver was charged with reckless endangerment and driving without a license. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/04/us-news/out-of-control-nyc-driver-hits-two-kids-1-adult-during-evening-rush-leaving-girl-7-with-broken-femur-cops/>Three people in the path of the sedan were struck, including the 7-year-old girl, who also suffered a head injury.</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, SD 12 saw <strong>5 deaths</strong> and <strong>19 serious injuries</strong> from crashes. There were <strong>2,673 crashes</strong> and <strong>1,657 injuries</strong>. The bodies pile up. The numbers do not lie.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt. Cars and trucks caused the most harm: <strong>5 deaths, 11 serious injuries</strong>. Motorcycles and mopeds killed and maimed too. Bikes killed one, seriously injured two. No one is safe. Not the old, not the young. Not on the sidewalk, not in the crosswalk.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h3><p>State Senator Michael Gianaris has spoken for safety. He co-sponsored and voted for the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit. He called for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/28/reckless-the-114-precinct-is-an-island-of-high-speed-chases-in-queens>stronger penalties for repeat reckless drivers</a>. He pushed for <a href=https://nypost.com/2023/03/30/dot-to-install-traffic-light-at-queens-corner-where-little-girl-died/>safer crossings after a child was killed</a>. He demanded the city <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/09/pols-demand-adams-open-queensboro-bridge-pedestrian-path>open the Queensboro Bridge pedestrian path</a>. But the deaths keep coming. The streets are not safe. The laws are not enough. The city moves slow. The blood dries fast.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h3><p><strong>Call your leaders. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real penalties for repeat offenders. Demand streets built for people, not cars.</strong></p><p>Every day you wait, someone else will not come home.

Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2024, the New York State legislative session ended without passing a replacement funding plan for the MTA after Governor Kathy Hochul paused congestion pricing. The matter, described as 'Albany pumps the brakes on MTA funding plan in rebuke of Hochul’s move to ditch congestion pricing,' left the MTA without the $1 billion annual revenue congestion pricing would have provided. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins announced the session’s close without a deal. Lawmakers including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris, State Sen. John Liu, Assemblyman Harvey Epstein, and Assemblyman Tony Simone criticized the governor’s decision and the proposed IOU bailout. Gounardes said, 'I cannot in good conscience ratify a decision that will eliminate a significant, dedicated revenue source for the MTA’s capital plan.' The pause leaves the city’s transit future—and the safety of those who rely on it—uncertain.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary states: 'State lawmakers proposed spending $90 million this year to improve bus service frequency and expand the scope of the MTA's free bus pilot.' The proposal, supported by Sen. Michael Gianaris and Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, also adopts the FARES Act, extending half-price MetroCards to commuter rail, and funds new discounts for seniors and people with disabilities. Lawmakers back the QueensLink rail project and recommend subway improvements. They reject tougher toll enforcement, instead supporting the Toll Payer Protection Act.

Michael Gianaris and Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani, seek $90 million for increased bus service and 15 more free bus routes. These measures, part of the 'Get Congestion Pricing Right' package, appear in both houses’ 'one-house' budgets as of March 12, 2024. The matter summary states: 'City buses would run more frequently under new proposals from state legislators in Albany, who included increased bus services and new fare discounts in budget proposals.' Mamdani and Gianaris led the push, citing the need for better transit before congestion pricing launches this summer. Their plan includes expanded Fair Fares, new discounts for seniors and disabled riders, and a weekly CityTicket for unlimited intracity rail travel. Advocates and lawmakers argue these steps are critical for equity and access, especially as the city prepares to charge drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street. The proposals now enter negotiations with Governor Hochul.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, now before the legislature, seeks to expand New York City's fare-free bus pilot from five to fifteen lines, with three in each borough. The measure promises $45 million for better bus reliability and frequency, targeting low-income and disadvantaged communities. The bill summary states: 'expand and extend New York City's fare-free bus pilot program.' Gianaris, as sponsor, aims to boost mass transit before congestion pricing takes effect. Supporters, including Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, Riders Alliance, and the Transport Workers Union, stress that affordable, frequent buses are vital for safety and equity. MTA Chair Janno Lieber backs more service but warns that bus lanes lag behind. The bill focuses on routes that can handle more buses without new infrastructure, aiming to make public transit a real alternative to cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
