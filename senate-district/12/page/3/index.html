Seventeen left with wounds that will not heal.</strong> In the last year alone, 1,511 people in Senate District 12 were injured in crashes. The youngest was a child. The oldest, a neighbor who had seen too many winters. The numbers are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, friends, and strangers who never made it home.</p><p><strong>Just months ago, a cyclist named Amanda Servedio was killed in Astoria.</strong> She was riding home from a cycling event. A man in a pickup, running from police, sped through the streets. He hit her at 37th Street and 34th Avenue. She flew thirty feet. She did not scream. &ldquo;She went airborne. She flew like 30 feet.

Her father, Frank Servedio, said, &ldquo;We were certainly upset that they didn&rsquo;t stop the chase&mldr; It was probably not the place to be doing a high-speed chase, in the residential neighborhood, and we were very upset that that&rsquo;s what actually happened.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>link</a></p><p><strong>Children are not spared.</strong> In April, an unlicensed driver reversed onto the sidewalk outside a school in Astoria. A seven-year-old girl was left with a broken femur and a head injury. A 14-year-old and a man were also struck. The driver was charged with reckless endangerment and driving without a license. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/04/us-news/out-of-control-nyc-driver-hits-two-kids-1-adult-during-evening-rush-leaving-girl-7-with-broken-femur-cops/>link</a></p><h3 id=leadership-words-votes-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Votes, and Waiting</h3><p><strong>Senator Michael Gianaris has taken some steps.</strong> He voted yes on a bill to require safer street design for all users, not just drivers. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>link</a> He has called for stronger penalties for repeat reckless drivers and supported the push for a dedicated pedestrian path on the Queensboro Bridge. But the blood on the street is not washed away by votes and letters. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program, which once forced repeat offenders into safety courses, has expired. The city and state have not moved fast enough. The streets remain deadly.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-no-more-waiting>The Next Step: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay, every half-measure, every excuse leaves another family grieving. <strong>Call Senator Gianaris. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit.

These measures, part of the 'Get Congestion Pricing Right' package, appear in both houses’ 'one-house' budgets as of March 12, 2024. The matter summary states: 'City buses would run more frequently under new proposals from state legislators in Albany, who included increased bus services and new fare discounts in budget proposals.' Mamdani and Gianaris led the push, citing the need for better transit before congestion pricing launches this summer. Their plan includes expanded Fair Fares, new discounts for seniors and disabled riders, and a weekly CityTicket for unlimited intracity rail travel. Advocates and lawmakers argue these steps are critical for equity and access, especially as the city prepares to charge drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street.
