Sixteen left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months, 1,544 were hurt in 2,525 crashes. Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—no one is spared. A 7-year-old girl, her femur snapped and head bleeding, was struck outside her school by an unlicensed driver who spun onto the sidewalk (<a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/04/us-news/out-of-control-nyc-driver-hits-two-kids-1-adult-during-evening-rush-leaving-girl-7-with-broken-femur-cops/>unlicensed driver hits kids</a>).

He voted yes on a bill to force streets to be built for everyone, not just drivers. The bill <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>calls for redesigning streets to protect all users</a> and passed despite opposition. He has also pushed for tougher penalties on repeat reckless drivers, saying, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/28/reckless-the-114-precinct-is-an-island-of-high-speed-chases-in-queens>&ldquo;Repeat reckless drivers must be held to account.&rdquo;</a></p><p>He backed the push for a traffic light after a child was killed in Astoria (<a href=https://nypost.com/2023/03/30/dot-to-install-traffic-light-at-queens-corner-where-little-girl-died/>traffic light after child killed</a>).

The deaths keep coming.</p><h2 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Every day without change is another day of risk.</strong> Call Senator Gianaris. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real street redesigns, not just promises. Demand that speed cameras stay on. Demand that repeat reckless drivers lose their right to drive. <strong>Do not wait for another child to die.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Critics say low fees fuel car ownership, crowding out transit, bikes, and green space. Experts warn it’s a subsidy for drivers, not a fix for congestion or emissions.</p><p class=mb3>On March 16, 2023, a Senate proposal surfaced to create a Residential Parking Permit system in New York City. The plan, now under City Council review, would charge drivers up to $30 per month for curbside parking, with revenue aimed at funding the MTA. The proposal leaves key details—like reserving 20% of spaces for non-residents—to the Council. The bill’s summary claims it will reduce emissions and support transit. Senator Michael Gianaris supports the measure, but critics are blunt. Bike New York’s Jon Orcutt calls it a 'big nothingburger.' Donald Shoup says the $30 fee is a subsidy for cars. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives argues, 'public space should be used for transit, bike lanes, and green space, not car storage.' Studies show similar programs in other cities have failed to cut congestion or emissions, and may even increase car ownership. The Department of Transportation has testified against the plan, warning it entrenches private car storage at the expense of vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal boosts bus service, freezes fares, and expands camera enforcement. They call it urgent. The plan aims to make transit faster, cheaper, and safer for all riders.</p><p class=mb3>On December 14, 2022, Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and State Senator Michael Gianaris introduced the Formula Three Act, a legislative proposal to overhaul MTA funding and fare policy. The plan, part of the larger Fix The MTA Package, would phase in free local and Select Bus Service, increase bus frequency by 20%, freeze fares, and expand permanent bus lane camera enforcement. Funding would rise from $200 million in 2023 to $638 million in 2026, with $488 million yearly for more buses and $300 million annually for frequent subways. Mamdani called the proposal 'urgent and necessary,' stressing that 'seniors, working class New Yorkers, people who use the bus the most are able to do so without fear of being priced out.' Gianaris said, 'incrementalism...is not working.' The lawmakers urge bold action to ensure public transit is accessible, affordable, and excellent.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
