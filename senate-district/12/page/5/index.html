Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians are struck down on streets meant to carry them home.</p><p>Just months ago, a cyclist named Amanda Servedio was killed in Astoria. She was riding home from a cycling event. A man in a pickup, fleeing police, ran her down. A witness said, <strong>&ldquo;She went airborne. She flew like 30 feet. It was a lot of force.&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>NY Daily News</a>. Her father’s words cut deeper: <strong>&ldquo;We were certainly upset that they didn&rsquo;t stop the chase&mldr; It was probably not the place to be doing a high-speed chase, in the residential neighborhood, and we were very upset that that&rsquo;s what actually happened.&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>NY Daily News</a>.</p><p>A few blocks away, an unlicensed driver reversed onto a sidewalk outside a school. A seven-year-old girl was left with a broken femur and a head wound. Her classmate and a man were also hit. The driver was charged, but the pain remains <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/04/us-news/out-of-control-nyc-driver-hits-two-kids-1-adult-during-evening-rush-leaving-girl-7-with-broken-femur-cops/>New York Post</a>.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-behind-the-names>The Numbers Behind the Names</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs caused the most harm:</strong> 5 deaths, 536 minor injuries, 143 moderate, 11 serious. <strong>Trucks and buses killed 4, injured 36, and left 2 with serious wounds.</strong> Motorcycles and mopeds, 1 death, 18 minor injuries, 9 moderate, 1 serious. Even bikes killed 1 and injured 25. The numbers do not lie. The danger is everywhere.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h3><p>Senator Michael Gianaris has backed bills for safer streets. He voted yes on a law to force &ldquo;complete street&rdquo; design, making roads safer for all <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>Open States</a>. He pushed for fare-free buses, which can pull cars off the road <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4421>Open States</a>. He called for tougher penalties on repeat reckless drivers <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/28/reckless-the-114-precinct-is-an-island-of-high-speed-chases-in-queens>Streetsblog NYC</a>. But the blood on the street says it is not enough. The city still allows high-speed chases in crowded neighborhoods. The most dangerous drivers keep their keys.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Senator Gianaris. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand an end to reckless chases. Demand action before another child is left bleeding on the curb.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Critics say low fees fuel car ownership, crowding out transit, bikes, and green space. Experts warn it’s a subsidy for drivers, not a fix for congestion or emissions.</p><p class=mb3>On March 16, 2023, a Senate proposal surfaced to create a Residential Parking Permit system in New York City. The plan, now under City Council review, would charge drivers up to $30 per month for curbside parking, with revenue aimed at funding the MTA. The proposal leaves key details—like reserving 20% of spaces for non-residents—to the Council. The bill’s summary claims it will reduce emissions and support transit. Senator Michael Gianaris supports the measure, but critics are blunt. Bike New York’s Jon Orcutt calls it a 'big nothingburger.' Donald Shoup says the $30 fee is a subsidy for cars. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives argues, 'public space should be used for transit, bike lanes, and green space, not car storage.' Studies show similar programs in other cities have failed to cut congestion or emissions, and may even increase car ownership. The Department of Transportation has testified against the plan, warning it entrenches private car storage at the expense of vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Her brother started a petition. Over 26,000 signed. Neighbors and State Sen. Michael Gianaris demand a traffic light. DOT hesitates. Drivers keep ignoring stop signs. The crosswalk remains deadly. The city stalls. Families mourn.</p><p class=mb3>On March 5, 2023, State Senator Michael Gianaris responded to the death of Dolma Naadhum, a 7-year-old killed at a Newtown Road intersection in Astoria, Queens. The incident sparked a petition—over 26,000 signatures—calling for traffic lights to replace stop signs at three crossings. Gianaris pledged to 'make sure we fix Newtown Road where this happened, and to honor her father's request that there be traffic lights there.' The Department of Transportation upgraded crosswalk markings but has not committed to a traffic light, citing a low crash history. Residents and the victim’s family say the intersection remains dangerous, with drivers ignoring stop signs. Gianaris’s support highlights official recognition of the need for stronger protections for pedestrians, especially children, at this site.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal boosts bus service, freezes fares, and expands camera enforcement. They call it urgent. The plan aims to make transit faster, cheaper, and safer for all riders.</p><p class=mb3>On December 14, 2022, Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and State Senator Michael Gianaris introduced the Formula Three Act, a legislative proposal to overhaul MTA funding and fare policy. The plan, part of the larger Fix The MTA Package, would phase in free local and Select Bus Service, increase bus frequency by 20%, freeze fares, and expand permanent bus lane camera enforcement. Funding would rise from $200 million in 2023 to $638 million in 2026, with $488 million yearly for more buses and $300 million annually for frequent subways. Mamdani called the proposal 'urgent and necessary,' stressing that 'seniors, working class New Yorkers, people who use the bus the most are able to do so without fear of being priced out.' Gianaris said, 'incrementalism...is not working.' The lawmakers urge bold action to ensure public transit is accessible, affordable, and excellent.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
