In the last twelve months, four people died. Over 1,500 were injured. Seventeen suffered wounds so grave they will not forget them. The dead include a 16-year-old girl, a 75-year-old man, a 55-year-old woman, and a cyclist run down in Astoria. The numbers do not rest. They keep coming.</p><p>Just months ago, a cyclist named Amanda Servedio was returning from a ride. She had the right of way. A man in a pickup, fleeing police, ran her down at 37th Street and 34th Avenue. She flew thirty feet. &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t even scream,&rdquo; a witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>said</a>. &ldquo;She went airborne. She flew like 30 feet. It was a lot of force.&rdquo; Her father <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>said</a>, &ldquo;We were certainly upset that they didn&rsquo;t stop the chase&mldr; It was probably not the place to be doing a high-speed chase, in the residential neighborhood.&rdquo;</p><p>A week before, an unlicensed driver reversed onto the sidewalk outside a school. A seven-year-old girl left with a broken femur. A 14-year-old and a man, both hurt. The driver was charged with reckless endangerment and driving without a license. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/04/us-news/out-of-control-nyc-driver-hits-two-kids-1-adult-during-evening-rush-leaving-girl-7-with-broken-femur-cops/>Police charged the driver</a>.</p><h3 id=the-record-of-leadership>The Record of Leadership</h3><p>Senator Michael Gianaris has spoken for safer streets. He backed the separation of bikes and pedestrians on the Queensboro Bridge, <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-completes-long-stalled-plan-to-separate-bikes-and-pedestrians-on-queensboro-bridge>saying</a>, &ldquo;After years of advocacy, many of us were excited to see [the city&rsquo;s Department of Transportation] complete the work to open new, dedicated pedestrian paths on the Queensboro Bridge.&rdquo; He called for stronger penalties for repeat reckless drivers and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/28/reckless-the-114-precinct-is-an-island-of-high-speed-chases-in-queens>voted yes</a> on a bill to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>require complete street design</a> for all users, not just cars.</p><p>But the deaths do not stop. The city’s Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program has expired. The worst drivers face only fines. The streets remain a gauntlet for the old, the young, the ones on foot or bike.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Call Senator Gianaris. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand the Stop Super Speeders Act. Demand streets that do not kill. Every day you wait, another family waits for a call that will break them.</p><p><a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Critics say low fees fuel car ownership, crowding out transit, bikes, and green space. Experts warn it’s a subsidy for drivers, not a fix for congestion or emissions.</p><p class=mb3>On March 16, 2023, a Senate proposal surfaced to create a Residential Parking Permit system in New York City. The plan, now under City Council review, would charge drivers up to $30 per month for curbside parking, with revenue aimed at funding the MTA. The proposal leaves key details—like reserving 20% of spaces for non-residents—to the Council. The bill’s summary claims it will reduce emissions and support transit. Senator Michael Gianaris supports the measure, but critics are blunt. Bike New York’s Jon Orcutt calls it a 'big nothingburger.' Donald Shoup says the $30 fee is a subsidy for cars. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives argues, 'public space should be used for transit, bike lanes, and green space, not car storage.' Studies show similar programs in other cities have failed to cut congestion or emissions, and may even increase car ownership. The Department of Transportation has testified against the plan, warning it entrenches private car storage at the expense of vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal boosts bus service, freezes fares, and expands camera enforcement. They call it urgent. The plan aims to make transit faster, cheaper, and safer for all riders.</p><p class=mb3>On December 14, 2022, Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and State Senator Michael Gianaris introduced the Formula Three Act, a legislative proposal to overhaul MTA funding and fare policy. The plan, part of the larger Fix The MTA Package, would phase in free local and Select Bus Service, increase bus frequency by 20%, freeze fares, and expand permanent bus lane camera enforcement. Funding would rise from $200 million in 2023 to $638 million in 2026, with $488 million yearly for more buses and $300 million annually for frequent subways. Mamdani called the proposal 'urgent and necessary,' stressing that 'seniors, working class New Yorkers, people who use the bus the most are able to do so without fear of being priced out.' Gianaris said, 'incrementalism...is not working.' The lawmakers urge bold action to ensure public transit is accessible, affordable, and excellent.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
