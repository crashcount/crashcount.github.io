It was 1 a.m. The boy was left in critical condition, a head injury sending him to the hospital. The bus driver and three passengers walked away unhurt. No word on what led to the crash.

Over <strong>1,800 people hurt</strong>. The dead include children, elders, riders, walkers. Cars and SUVs did most of the killing—<strong>8 deaths</strong> and hundreds hurt. Trucks and buses took more. Motorcycles and mopeds left bodies and broken bones. Bikes, too, but far fewer. The violence is steady. The names change. The pain stays.</p><h2 id=senator-scarcella-spanton-votes-and-silence>Senator Scarcella-Spanton: Votes and Silence</h2><p>Senator Jessica Scarcella-Spanton voted to curb repeat speeders, backing a bill to force dangerous drivers to install speed-limiting devices.

She <a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/congestion-pricing-accessibility-mta-board-june-2024/>called congestion pricing &ldquo;the wrong plan for my constituents,&rdquo;</a> even as it promised fewer cars and safer crossings.

Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras at every school. Demand streets where a child can cross and live. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice.
