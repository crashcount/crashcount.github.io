In the last twelve months, six people died and 1,411 were injured in crashes. Nine suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. One was a child. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><p>Just weeks ago, an 87-year-old man was pinned under an MTA bus in Sheepshead Bay. He was standing near the corner when the driver turned left and hit him. Police found him under the wheels. He left for the hospital in critical condition. The driver stayed at the scene. The bus was empty. No arrests. No comfort. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-87-is-critically-injured-after-mta-bus-driver-strikes-him-in-brooklyn-nypd>Police said officers who responded to the scene discovered an 87-year-old man pinned under the city bus at East 12th Street and Avenue Z in Sheepshead Bay around 6:40 p.m.</a></p><p>On May 17, a man tried to cross Targee Street. He did not reach the other side. A moped and two parked cars. He died in the street. The record says only this: crush injuries, apparent death. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash records</a>.</p><h2 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h2><p>Cars and SUVs killed eight. Trucks and buses killed three. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes killed none. The rest were left broken—over 4,000 injured since 2022. The young, the old, the nameless. The street does not care.</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-and-silence>Leadership: Votes and Silence</h2><p>State Senator Jessica Scarcella-Spanton has stood in the way of proven safety tools. She voted <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>against renewing the school zone speed camera program</a>—a program that saves lives. She called speed cameras a burden, not a shield. The Senate passed the measure 38-21; three city senators—Stephen Chan, Andrew Lanza, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton—voted no.</p><p>She also sponsored a bill to repeal congestion pricing, a move that would put more cars on the street and more bodies in the morgue. The bill does not mention the dead or the maimed. Only drivers.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call your leaders. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras on every deadly stretch. Demand that the lives of children and elders matter more than the comfort of drivers. The street will not change itself. You must force it.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
