On Mar 7, 2025, a driver in an SUV going north on Hylan Boulevard hit an 80‑year‑old man at Benton Avenue. He died at the intersection (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>, CrashID 4797079).</p><p>Weeks earlier, on Dec 11, 2024, a driver turning left in a 2023 SUV killed a 64‑year‑old woman crossing Mason Avenue near 242 Mason. Police recorded failure to yield by the driver (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>, CrashID 4777953).</p><p>On Mar 3, 2023, a pickup driver going west on Mermaid Avenue hit two people crossing with the signal at West 24th Street. A 41‑year‑old woman died; an 18‑year‑old man was hurt (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>, CrashID 4609976).</p><h3 id=streets-that-dont-forgive>Streets that don’t forgive</h3><p>Some deaths sit at the door of heavy vehicles and left turns. In Sheepshead Bay on Jun 2, 2025, police said a 34‑year‑old bus driver made a left and struck an 87‑year‑old man, pinning him under the bus at East 12th Street and Avenue Z. He was taken to the hospital in critical condition (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-87-is-critically-injured-after-mta-bus-driver-strikes-him-in-brooklyn-nypd>Gothamist</a>).</p><p>On the Belt Parkway before dawn on Nov 4, 2022, two westbound car drivers hit a 58‑year‑old man outside a crosswalk. He died at the scene (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>, CrashID 4578958).</p><p>Not all harm comes from lawless speed. Confusion kills too. Staten Island Borough President Vito Fossella put it bluntly about Hylan Boulevard’s bus lane signs: “That’s one accident every four days where somebody perhaps unwittingly thinks they must turn from the middle lane” (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/bus-lanes-staten-island-hylan-boulevard/>amNY</a>). The reporting counted 32 such crashes this year tied to bad turns.</p><h3 id=the-count-this-year>The count this year</h3><p>In the year to date, <strong>6 people have been killed</strong> in crashes here, up from <strong>5</strong> at this point last year, with <strong>1,432 injuries</strong> in <strong>2,311</strong> crashes, by our cut of <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Pedestrians bear the brunt. Since 2022, drivers of sedans and SUVs account for most recorded pedestrian harm in this district’s data cuts — hundreds injured, with deaths in both groups — per our analysis of the city datasets (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=votes-tools-and-the-gap>Votes, tools, and the gap</h3><p>Albany renewed NYC’s 24‑hour school‑zone speed cameras this June, but Staten Island’s own Sen. <strong>Jessica Scarcella‑Spanton</strong> voted no, as did Assembly Member <strong>Sam Pirozzolo</strong> in his chamber, according to <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>Streetsblog</a>. The program is a proven brake on speeding, and these votes mattered.</p><p>At the same time, Scarcella‑Spanton voted yes in committee for the <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (S 4045)</strong> — a bill to require intelligent speed assistance for repeat offenders (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). That tool targets the small set of drivers who do the most harm.</p><p>The fixes are on the table. Sammy’s Law lets the city lower speed limits. The superspeeder bill would force chronic speeders to slow down. The record here shows why those steps cannot wait.</p><h3 id=what-must-happen-next>What must happen next</h3><p>Lower speeds save lives. Habitual speeders need hard limits.
