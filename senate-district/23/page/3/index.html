Twenty-nine with injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong> In the last three years, Senate District 23 has seen 8,496 crashes. Four thousand three hundred thirty-one people hurt. The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross the street. In the last year alone, seven killed. One was a child.

She called it &ldquo;the wrong plan for my constituents&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/congestion-pricing-accessibility-mta-board-june-2024/>at a June 2024 MTA board meeting</a>.
