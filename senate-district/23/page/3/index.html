A woman crossing the street. An old man pinned under a bus. In Senate District 23, the story repeats. In the last twelve months, six people have died and over 1,500 have been injured in crashes. Thirteen suffered serious injuries. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about age. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared.</p><p>Just last week, on July 5th, Jeremy Claudio, 34, was killed on Bay Street. He hit the door of a Toyota making a K-turn. The police said the driver was &ldquo;making a K-turn from the northbound lane&mldr; into its southbound lane when the collision occurred&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/staten-island-motorcyclist-killed-k-turn-07062025/>amNY</a>). Claudio died at the hospital. The driver stayed. No arrests. The street is quiet again, but the blood is not washed away.</p><p>On June 2nd, an 87-year-old man was pinned under an MTA bus in Sheepshead Bay. He was &ldquo;standing near the corner when the driver made a left onto the avenue and hit him&rdquo; (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-87-is-critically-injured-after-mta-bus-driver-strikes-him-in-brooklyn-nypd>Gothamist</a>). He left in critical condition. The bus was empty. The corner was not.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-behind-the-names>The Numbers Behind the Names</h3><p>Cars and SUVs killed eight. Trucks and buses killed three. Motorcycles and mopeds, none. Bikes, none. But the injuries run higher: over 500 hurt by cars and SUVs, dozens by trucks and buses. The pattern is clear. The danger is heavy and fast.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-silence-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Votes, Silence, and Missed Chances</h3><p>State Senator Jessica Scarcella-Spanton has voted for some safety bills. She backed the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would force repeat speeders to install devices that keep them from breaking the limit (<a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>Open States</a>). But when it mattered most, she voted against renewing the city’s speed camera program—a tool proven to save lives (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>Streetsblog NYC</a>). The cameras are still here, but not because of her.</p><p>She has also stood against congestion pricing, a policy that would cut traffic and make streets safer for everyone outside a car (<a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/congestion-pricing-accessibility-mta-board-june-2024/>amNY</a>). The voices of the dead do not reach Albany.</p><h3 id=what-now-the-blood-is-not-dry>What Now? The Blood Is Not Dry</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every day, another crash. Another family waits in the hospital. Call Senator Scarcella-Spanton. Demand she fight for speed cameras, safer crossings, and real change. Do not wait for another name to join the list. The street will not forgive our silence.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
