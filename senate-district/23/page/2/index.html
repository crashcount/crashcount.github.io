He hit the side of a Toyota making a K-turn. The crash happened in the afternoon, in plain sight. The rider, Jeremy Claudio, was thirty-four. He died at the hospital. The driver stayed at the scene. There were no arrests. The NYPD is still investigating. As <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/staten-island-motorcyclist-killed-k-turn-07062025/>reported by amNY</a>, &ldquo;A motorcyclist was killed after colliding with a driver awkwardly turning their car on Staten Island during the Fourth of July holiday weekend.&rdquo;</p><p>This is not rare. In the past twelve months, SD 23 saw <strong>6 deaths and 1,569 injuries</strong> in traffic crashes. Thirteen people were seriously hurt. The old and the young are not spared. Two people over 75 died. One under 18 died. The numbers do not stop. They only grow.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage.</strong> They killed 8 people and hurt hundreds more. Trucks and buses killed 3. Motorcycles and mopeds, 0. Bikes, 0. The street is not safe for anyone on foot or on two wheels. The numbers are not just numbers. They are lives. They are families left with empty chairs.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-and-inaction>Leadership: Action and Inaction</h2><p>State Senator Jessica Scarcella-Spanton voted for safer street design last year. She backed a bill to use &ldquo;complete street design principles&rdquo; to protect all users, not just drivers. <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>The bill passed</a>. But when it mattered most, she voted <strong>against renewing New York City&rsquo;s speed camera program</strong>—a tool proven to save lives. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>She was one of only three city senators to vote no</a>. Cameras catch the drivers who speed past schools and kill. The vote was a choice. The cost is paid by the people outside the cars.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every delay is a choice. Call Senator Scarcella-Spanton. Tell her to stand with the dead and the living. Demand she support speed cameras, lower speed limits, and real protection for people who walk and ride. The blood on Bay Street is not washed away by silence.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Riders left stranded.</p><p class=mb3>On June 24, 2024, the MTA Board heard public testimony and political debate on the fallout from Governor Hochul’s indefinite pause of congestion pricing, which was set to begin June 30. The meeting focused on the loss of funding for transit accessibility. The matter, described as 'New Yorkers decry loss of congestion pricing money for accessible transit to MTA Board,' drew sharp criticism from disability advocates and riders. State Senator Jessica Scarcella-Spanton, representing District 23, praised the Governor’s pause, calling congestion pricing 'the wrong plan for my constituents.' The pause leaves a $15 billion hole in the MTA’s capital budget, halting upgrades like elevators and ramps at dozens of stations. Advocates warned that without this funding, disabled New Yorkers, seniors, and veterans remain shut out of the subway. The MTA faces a federal mandate to make 95% of stations accessible by 2055, but these projects now stall. Riders demanded action. Politicians offered little hope.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
