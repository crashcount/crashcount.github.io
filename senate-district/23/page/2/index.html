Nine left with wounds that will not heal. In the last year alone, SD 23 saw 1,410 people injured and 2,534 crashes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The dead are not numbers. They are the 80-year-old man struck at an intersection on Hylan Boulevard. The 64-year-old woman crushed by an SUV while crossing Mason Avenue. The 58-year-old man killed by a moped on Targee Street. A 17-year-old, helmet on, dead on the Belt Parkway (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Most victims are on foot. Most vehicles are cars and SUVs. The street does not forgive. The curb is no shield. The crosswalk is a promise broken again and again.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-and-silence>Leadership: Votes and Silence</h3><p>State Senator Jessica Scarcella-Spanton <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>voted yes on a bill to redesign streets for safety</a>. But when it mattered most, she <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>voted against renewing New York City&rsquo;s speed camera program</a>—a tool proven to save lives. She <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S2622>sponsored a bill to repeal congestion pricing</a>, a move that would put more cars and more danger on city streets.</p><p>When the MTA Board heard from the public about the loss of funding for accessible transit, Scarcella-Spanton <a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/congestion-pricing-accessibility-mta-board-june-2024/>praised the pause on congestion pricing</a>, calling it &ldquo;the wrong plan for my constituents.&rdquo; The voices of the disabled, the elderly, and the families of the dead were drowned out. The money for ramps and elevators vanished. The risk stayed.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h3><p>Speed kills. Delay kills. The numbers do not lie. SUVs and cars <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>caused eight deaths and 700 injuries</a> to pedestrians and cyclists in this district since 2022. Trucks and buses killed three more. Motorcycles and mopeds, none. Bikes, none. The street is a gauntlet for the old, the young, the walker, the cyclist.</p><p>&ldquo;We want to make sure that our maintenance workers and contractors are safe,&rdquo; <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/nyc-mta-bridges-tunnels-will-get-speed-cameras-hochul-says>said MTA Bridges and Tunnels President Catherine Sheridan</a>, as speed cameras finally came to city crossings. But on the streets of SD 23, the cameras that could save lives are still up for debate.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</h3><p>Contact Senator Scarcella-Spanton. Demand a vote for life, not delay. Tell her: every day without speed cameras, every day with more cars, is another day someone does not come home. Join forces with local groups. Call. Write. Show up. The dead cannot speak. The living must.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
