It was 1 a.m. The boy was left in critical condition, a head injury sending him to the hospital. The bus driver and three passengers walked away unhurt. No word on what led to the crash.

Over <strong>1,800 people hurt</strong>. The dead include children, elders, riders, walkers. Cars and SUVs did most of the killing—<strong>8 deaths</strong> and hundreds hurt. Trucks and buses took more. Motorcycles and mopeds left bodies and broken bones. Bikes, too, but far fewer. The violence is steady. The names change. The pain stays.</p><h2 id=senator-scarcella-spanton-votes-and-silence>Senator Scarcella-Spanton: Votes and Silence</h2><p>Senator Jessica Scarcella-Spanton voted to curb repeat speeders, backing a bill to force dangerous drivers to install speed-limiting devices.

She <a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/congestion-pricing-accessibility-mta-board-june-2024/>called congestion pricing &ldquo;the wrong plan for my constituents,&rdquo;</a> even as it promised fewer cars and safer crossings.

Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras at every school. Demand streets where a child can cross and live. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice.

The bill seeks to exempt NYPD officers, even off-duty, from paying congestion pricing tolls in Manhattan’s central business district. Reinvent Albany called the measure 'contrary to notions of basic fairness' and a '$22 million handout' to a special interest. The Traffic Mobility Review Board had already rejected such exemptions. The group warned that multiple exemption bills could cost the public $100 million yearly and force higher tolls for everyone else. Neither Pheffer Amato nor Scarcella-Spanton commented.

The collision threw the boy from his bike, leaving him with crush injuries across his entire body. He was conscious at the scene, according to the narrative. The police report also lists 'Other Vehicular' factors, and for the cyclist, 'Unsafe Speed' is noted, but only after the primary driver error. The SUV’s point of impact was the center front end, confirming a direct strike. The crash unfolded at 19:58 in Staten Island, with the victim suffering severe trauma. No helmet was worn, but the report centers driver failure to yield as the key cause.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Politicians split. Riders left stranded.</p><p class=mb3>On June 24, 2024, the MTA Board heard public testimony and political debate on the fallout from Governor Hochul’s indefinite pause of congestion pricing, which was set to begin June 30. The meeting focused on the loss of funding for transit accessibility. The matter, described as 'New Yorkers decry loss of congestion pricing money for accessible transit to MTA Board,' drew sharp criticism from disability advocates and riders. State Senator Jessica Scarcella-Spanton, representing District 23, praised the Governor’s pause, calling congestion pricing 'the wrong plan for my constituents.' The pause leaves a $15 billion hole in the MTA’s capital budget, halting upgrades like elevators and ramps at dozens of stations. Advocates warned that without this funding, disabled New Yorkers, seniors, and veterans remain shut out of the subway. The MTA faces a federal mandate to make 95% of stations accessible by 2055, but these projects now stall. Riders demanded action. Politicians offered little hope.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
