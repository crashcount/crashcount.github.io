It was 1 a.m. The boy was left in critical condition, a head injury sending him to the hospital. The bus driver and three passengers walked away unhurt. No word on what led to the crash.

Over <strong>1,800 people hurt</strong>. The dead include children, elders, riders, walkers. Cars and SUVs did most of the killing—<strong>8 deaths</strong> and hundreds hurt. Trucks and buses took more. Motorcycles and mopeds left bodies and broken bones. Bikes, too, but far fewer. The violence is steady. The names change. The pain stays.</p><h2 id=senator-scarcella-spanton-votes-and-silence>Senator Scarcella-Spanton: Votes and Silence</h2><p>Senator Jessica Scarcella-Spanton voted to curb repeat speeders, backing a bill to force dangerous drivers to install speed-limiting devices.

She <a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/congestion-pricing-accessibility-mta-board-june-2024/>called congestion pricing &ldquo;the wrong plan for my constituents,&rdquo;</a> even as it promised fewer cars and safer crossings.

Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras at every school. Demand streets where a child can cross and live. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice.

The Senate passed the measure 38-21; three city senators—Stephen Chan, Andrew Lanza, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton—voted no. The Assembly passed it 110-31, with nine city lawmakers—Alec Brook-Krasny, Lester Chang, Simcha Eichenstein, Michael Novakhov, Stacey Pheffer Amato, Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Reilly, David Weprin, Kalman Yeger—opposing. The Streetsblog NYC article, 'Ye Shall Know Their Names! Meet the Dirty Dozen City Pols Who Voted Against Speed Camera Program,' quotes lawmakers dismissing speed cameras as revenue grabs or burdens. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action, so no direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists can be assessed.' Still, the votes signal disregard for proven tools that protect those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The study, covered by Barbara Russo-Lennon, found a 25% drop in Manhattan traffic jams, with smaller but real declines in the Bronx and New Jersey. The report states: 'Congestion pricing is delivering clear benefits, saving people time and the aggravation of being stuck in traffic.' Council Member Frank Morano and State Sen. Jessica Scarcella-Spanton criticized the program, citing Staten Island’s smaller gains and health concerns. MTA Chair Janno Lieber defended the policy, pointing to improved drive times and transit use. Safety analysts note congestion pricing reduces car traffic, lowers crash risk for pedestrians and cyclists, encourages mode shift, and supports safer, more equitable streets. The program’s future now rests with the federal courts.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan allows cameras on seven bridges and two tunnels, ticketing drivers who exceed speed limits. Fines start at $50 for a first offense, rising to $75 and $100 for repeat violations within 18 months. Governor Hochul's office called the program 'one more way the governor is working to improve safety on our roads and bridges for workers and travelers alike.' MTA Bridges and Tunnels President Catherine Sheridan said, 'We want to make sure that our maintenance workers and contractors are safe.' The program, part of the $254 billion state budget, will be reviewed again in 2031. The move targets driver speed, a key factor in crash severity, and signals a shift toward automated enforcement on major city crossings.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
