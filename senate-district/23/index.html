Since 2022, <strong>22 people have died</strong> in crashes here. <strong>4,599 have been injured</strong>. Thirty-four suffered wounds so grave they are called serious injuries in the city’s ledger. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. They are the man pinned under a bus in Sheepshead Bay, the motorcyclist thrown from his bike on Bay Street, the pedestrian struck crossing Hylan Boulevard.</p><p>Just last week, <strong>Jeremy Claudio, 34, died on Bay Street</strong>. He was riding his motorcycle. A driver made a K-turn. Claudio hit the door. He was rushed to the hospital. He did not come home. Police said, “a 40-year-old woman was operating the Toyota, making a K-turn from the northbound lane&mldr; when the collision occurred” (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/staten-island-motorcyclist-killed-k-turn-07062025/>amNY</a>).</p><p>In June, an <strong>87-year-old man was pinned under an MTA bus</strong>. He was standing near the corner. The driver turned left. The man was taken to the hospital in critical condition. Police said, “officers who responded to the scene discovered an 87-year-old man pinned under the city bus&mldr; The man was standing near the corner when the driver made a left onto the avenue and hit him” (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-87-is-critically-injured-after-mta-bus-driver-strikes-him-in-brooklyn-nypd>Gothamist</a>).</p><h3 id=the-record-what-senator-scarcella-spanton-has-done>The Record: What Senator Scarcella-Spanton Has Done</h3><p>Senator Jessica Scarcella-Spanton has voted for some safety bills. She backed <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S8117>school speed cameras</a>. She voted yes on a <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>bill for safer street design</a>. She also voted yes to <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>curb repeat speeders</a>.</p><p>But she has also stood in the way. She <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>voted against reauthorizing the city’s speed camera program</a>. She <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S2622>sponsored bills to repeal congestion pricing</a>, a move that would keep traffic thick and streets hostile for the most vulnerable.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-who-pays-the-price>The Pattern: Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm</strong>. Of the deaths and injuries to pedestrians, most come from sedans and SUVs. Trucks and buses kill and maim too. Motorcycles and mopeds add to the toll. Bikes are almost never the cause of death.</p><p>The pattern is clear. The most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, the old, the young—pay the price for inaction and delay. Each crash is a policy failure. Each death is a choice made by those in power.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-relentless-change>Call to Action: Demand Relentless Change</h3><p><strong>This does not have to continue.</strong> Call Senator Scarcella-Spanton. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras on every dangerous street. Demand action, not excuses. The dead cannot call. The living must.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Senate passed the measure 38-21; three city senators—Stephen Chan, Andrew Lanza, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton—voted no. The Assembly passed it 110-31, with nine city lawmakers—Alec Brook-Krasny, Lester Chang, Simcha Eichenstein, Michael Novakhov, Stacey Pheffer Amato, Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Reilly, David Weprin, Kalman Yeger—opposing. The Streetsblog NYC article, 'Ye Shall Know Their Names! Meet the Dirty Dozen City Pols Who Voted Against Speed Camera Program,' quotes lawmakers dismissing speed cameras as revenue grabs or burdens. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action, so no direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists can be assessed.' Still, the votes signal disregard for proven tools that protect those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets clear. Delays drop. Fewer cars mean more space for people. The city breathes. Vulnerable road users gain ground. Data shows real relief, not empty promises.</p><p class=mb3>On June 18, 2025, the Regional Plan Association released a report on congestion pricing’s impact. The study, covered by Barbara Russo-Lennon, found a 25% drop in Manhattan traffic jams, with smaller but real declines in the Bronx and New Jersey. The report states: 'Congestion pricing is delivering clear benefits, saving people time and the aggravation of being stuck in traffic.' Council Member Frank Morano and State Sen. Jessica Scarcella-Spanton criticized the program, citing Staten Island’s smaller gains and health concerns. MTA Chair Janno Lieber defended the policy, pointing to improved drive times and transit use. Safety analysts note congestion pricing reduces car traffic, lowers crash risk for pedestrians and cyclists, encourages mode shift, and supports safer, more equitable streets. The program’s future now rests with the federal courts.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill seeks to exempt NYPD officers, even off-duty, from paying congestion pricing tolls in Manhattan’s central business district. Reinvent Albany called the measure 'contrary to notions of basic fairness' and a '$22 million handout' to a special interest. The Traffic Mobility Review Board had already rejected such exemptions. The group warned that multiple exemption bills could cost the public $100 million yearly and force higher tolls for everyone else. Neither Pheffer Amato nor Scarcella-Spanton commented. The watchdog urged lawmakers to serve the many, not the powerful few.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
