Thirteen left with life-changing injuries.</strong> That’s just in the last twelve months across Senate District 23. The dead include an 80-year-old man crossing Hylan Boulevard, a 64-year-old woman struck by an SUV turning left on Mason Avenue, and a 34-year-old motorcyclist who collided with a car making a K-turn on Bay Street. These are fathers, mothers, sons, and daughters. The street does not care who you are.</p><p>Just last week, on July 5th, Jeremy Claudio, age 34, was riding his motorcycle on Bay Street. A Toyota Rav 4 made a K-turn across traffic. Claudio hit the driver’s door. He was rushed to the hospital and died there. The driver was unhurt. There were no arrests. The NYPD is still investigating, as <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/staten-island-motorcyclist-killed-k-turn-07062025/>reported by amNY</a>.</p><h2 id=who-bears-the-cost>Who Bears the Cost</h2><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the highest price.</strong> In the last three years, cars and SUVs caused 8 deaths and over 700 injuries to people outside vehicles in SD 23. Trucks and buses killed 3 more. Motorcycles and mopeds, 0. Bikes, 0. The street is not fair. It favors the heavy and the fast.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn’t</h2><p>State Senator Jessica Scarcella-Spanton voted yes on the Stop Super Speeders Act, a bill to force repeat dangerous drivers to install speed-limiting devices. The bill targets drivers with a pattern of violations, seeking to cut risk for pedestrians and cyclists by limiting repeat speeding, as <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S4045>the measure aims to curb repeat dangerous driving</a>.</p><p>But when it mattered most, Scarcella-Spanton voted no on reauthorizing New York City&rsquo;s school zone speed camera program. She stood with a small group of city senators who opposed a tool proven to save lives. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>The Senate passed the measure 38-21; three city senators—Stephen Chan, Andrew Lanza, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton—voted no</a>.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call your State Senator. Call your Council Member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras on every deadly stretch. Demand that repeat offenders lose their right to endanger others. Every day of delay is another family broken. <strong>Act now.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Senate passed the measure 38-21; three city senators—Stephen Chan, Andrew Lanza, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton—voted no. The Assembly passed it 110-31, with nine city lawmakers—Alec Brook-Krasny, Lester Chang, Simcha Eichenstein, Michael Novakhov, Stacey Pheffer Amato, Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Reilly, David Weprin, Kalman Yeger—opposing. The Streetsblog NYC article, 'Ye Shall Know Their Names! Meet the Dirty Dozen City Pols Who Voted Against Speed Camera Program,' quotes lawmakers dismissing speed cameras as revenue grabs or burdens. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action, so no direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists can be assessed.' Still, the votes signal disregard for proven tools that protect those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets clear. Delays drop. Fewer cars mean more space for people. The city breathes. Vulnerable road users gain ground. Data shows real relief, not empty promises.</p><p class=mb3>On June 18, 2025, the Regional Plan Association released a report on congestion pricing’s impact. The study, covered by Barbara Russo-Lennon, found a 25% drop in Manhattan traffic jams, with smaller but real declines in the Bronx and New Jersey. The report states: 'Congestion pricing is delivering clear benefits, saving people time and the aggravation of being stuck in traffic.' Council Member Frank Morano and State Sen. Jessica Scarcella-Spanton criticized the program, citing Staten Island’s smaller gains and health concerns. MTA Chair Janno Lieber defended the policy, pointing to improved drive times and transit use. Safety analysts note congestion pricing reduces car traffic, lowers crash risk for pedestrians and cyclists, encourages mode shift, and supports safer, more equitable streets. The program’s future now rests with the federal courts.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Enforcement aims to slow drivers and cut risk on vital routes.</p><p class=mb3>Patch reported on May 8, 2025, that New York lawmakers approved an expansion of a speed camera pilot program for MTA bridges and tunnels. The plan allows cameras on seven bridges and two tunnels, ticketing drivers who exceed speed limits. Fines start at $50 for a first offense, rising to $75 and $100 for repeat violations within 18 months. Governor Hochul's office called the program 'one more way the governor is working to improve safety on our roads and bridges for workers and travelers alike.' MTA Bridges and Tunnels President Catherine Sheridan said, 'We want to make sure that our maintenance workers and contractors are safe.' The program, part of the $254 billion state budget, will be reviewed again in 2031. The move targets driver speed, a key factor in crash severity, and signals a shift toward automated enforcement on major city crossings.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
