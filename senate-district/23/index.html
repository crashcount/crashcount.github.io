A woman, 64, crushed by a turning SUV on Mason Avenue. An 80-year-old man, dead at an intersection on Hylan Boulevard. The stories repeat. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-and-silence>Leadership: Votes and Silence</h3><p>Senator Jessica Scarcella-Spanton has made choices. She voted for safer street design, backing a bill to &ldquo;enable safe access to public roads for all users by utilizing complete street design principles&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9718>see the record</a>. But when the city needed speed cameras—proven to cut speeding and save lives—she voted no. She stood with those who called them a burden, not a shield. The <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/23/ye-shall-know-their-names-meet-11-city-pols-who-voted-against-speed-camera-program>list of lawmakers who voted against speed cameras</a> is short. Her name is on it.</p><p>She has also fought to stop congestion pricing, a policy that would cut car traffic and crashes. She called it &ldquo;the wrong plan for my constituents&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/congestion-pricing-accessibility-mta-board-june-2024/>as reported by amNY</a>. The cost is measured in more than dollars. It is measured in bodies.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>The disaster is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every delay, every vote against proven tools, means another family grieves. The streets will not change themselves. Call Senator Scarcella-Spanton. Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand speed cameras on every deadly stretch. Demand action, not excuses.</p><p><strong>The dead cannot call.

The Senate passed the measure 38-21; three city senators—Stephen Chan, Andrew Lanza, Jessica Scarcella-Spanton—voted no. The Assembly passed it 110-31, with nine city lawmakers—Alec Brook-Krasny, Lester Chang, Simcha Eichenstein, Michael Novakhov, Stacey Pheffer Amato, Sam Pirozzolo, Michael Reilly, David Weprin, Kalman Yeger—opposing. The Streetsblog NYC article, 'Ye Shall Know Their Names! Meet the Dirty Dozen City Pols Who Voted Against Speed Camera Program,' quotes lawmakers dismissing speed cameras as revenue grabs or burdens. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action, so no direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists can be assessed.' Still, the votes signal disregard for proven tools that protect those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets clear. Delays drop. Fewer cars mean more space for people. The city breathes. Vulnerable road users gain ground. Data shows real relief, not empty promises.</p><p class=mb3>On June 18, 2025, the Regional Plan Association released a report on congestion pricing’s impact. The study, covered by Barbara Russo-Lennon, found a 25% drop in Manhattan traffic jams, with smaller but real declines in the Bronx and New Jersey. The report states: 'Congestion pricing is delivering clear benefits, saving people time and the aggravation of being stuck in traffic.' Council Member Frank Morano and State Sen. Jessica Scarcella-Spanton criticized the program, citing Staten Island’s smaller gains and health concerns. MTA Chair Janno Lieber defended the policy, pointing to improved drive times and transit use. Safety analysts note congestion pricing reduces car traffic, lowers crash risk for pedestrians and cyclists, encourages mode shift, and supports safer, more equitable streets.

The plan allows cameras on seven bridges and two tunnels, ticketing drivers who exceed speed limits. Fines start at $50 for a first offense, rising to $75 and $100 for repeat violations within 18 months. Governor Hochul's office called the program 'one more way the governor is working to improve safety on our roads and bridges for workers and travelers alike.' MTA Bridges and Tunnels President Catherine Sheridan said, 'We want to make sure that our maintenance workers and contractors are safe.' The program, part of the $254 billion state budget, will be reviewed again in 2031.
