Thirty-seven left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 2,300 hurt since 2022. The dead include children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians. The living carry scars you cannot see.</p><p>Just last week, a city worker was slashed by a delivery cyclist after a near miss at Broadway and Cedar. He was fixing a street sign. He was not in the bike lane. &ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t even in the bike lane, they were parked on the corner, fixing the light or the sign or something,&rdquo; a witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/electric-biker-slashes-city-worker-nearly-crash-lower-manhattan/>said</a>. The cyclist cut him and fled. The worker went to the hospital. The city kept moving. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/electric-biker-slashes-city-worker-nearly-crash-lower-manhattan/>Read the account</a>.</p><p>Days earlier, a van towing a food cart broke loose and slammed into a parked car with a woman and child inside. Police found <strong>76 propane tanks and 75 gallons of gasoline</strong> in the van. The driver was charged with reckless endangerment. The woman and child survived. This is not luck. This is a city playing with fire. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/cops-bust-minivan-driver-in-manhattan-for-carrying-propane-tanks/>See the report</a>.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>Cars and trucks do the most harm.</strong> Since 2022, they have killed at least eight people and injured hundreds more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes have also left bodies broken. The old, the young, the ones just crossing the street. The numbers are not just numbers. They are names, faces, families.</p><h2 id=what-has-marte-done>What Has Marte Done?</h2><p>Council Member Christopher Marte has backed bills to clear abandoned vehicles, ban fake plates, and boost lighting and speed humps near parks. He voted to decriminalize jaywalking and to require taxi door warning decals. He co-sponsored a bill to daylight crosswalks, keeping parked cars from blocking sightlines. But some bills move slow. Some changes are small. The city studies, delays, and the street keeps taking.</p><p>On Canal Street, Marte said the time for action is long overdue. He pledged support for urgent changes. But the street is still the same. &ldquo;He acknowledged the time is long overdue to take action in response to the dire conditions of Canal Street. He pledged his support to take action.&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/03/09/opinion-its-time-for-immediate-action-on-canal-street>Read the pledge</a>.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>This did not have to happen.</strong> Every death, every injury, every child in a hospital bed. These are not accidents. They are the price of delay. Call Council Member Marte. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand streets for people, not cars. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The article details how Ruth and Valery Oistenau were knocked down by a cyclist while waiting to cross in the East Village. Their injuries were dismissed by police, reflecting a broader issue: 'Many, possibly most, incidents between bikes of all sorts and pedestrians are not reported.' NYPD policy since 2020 means only the most severe injuries get documented. Mayor Eric Adams stated, 'Bikes must follow the same laws that vehicles follow,' but enforcement and reporting lag behind reality. Dr. Jonathan Kirschner calls for better public-health data, noting, 'the incidence of injuries from encounters between pedestrians and bikes is on the rise.' The lack of accurate reporting leaves the true scope of the danger unknown and unaddressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
