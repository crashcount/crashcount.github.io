The driver fled. The community gathered for a vigil. The news anchor said the crash is &ldquo;raising questions about a bigger safety problem at an intersection of Canal Street&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/vigil-held-for-pedestrian-cyclist-killed-in-chinatown-hit-and-run/>CBS New York</a>).</p><p>A few days before, a firefighter died on the FDR Drive. He fell from his motorcycle. A driver ran him over and left him in the road. Police said he was &ldquo;struck by an unknown vehicle that did not remain on the scene&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/31-year-old-firefighter-matthew-goicochea-killed-overnight-motorcycle-crash-fdr-drive-fdny-says/17279439/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>In the past twelve months, District 1 saw <strong>3 deaths and 13 serious injuries</strong>. There were <strong>807 injuries</strong> in total. The dead include children and elders. The living carry scars.</p><h2 id=the-numbers-are-names>The Numbers Are Names</h2><p>The numbers do not stop. Since 2022, District 1 has seen <strong>13 deaths, 36 serious injuries, and 2,418 total injuries</strong>. Cars and trucks did most of the killing. Trucks alone took four lives. Bikes and mopeds are not blameless, but the weight of death rolls on four wheels.</p><h2 id=martes-record-small-steps-slow-change>Marte’s Record: Small Steps, Slow Change</h2><p>Council Member Christopher Marte has voted for some safety bills. He backed laws to remove abandoned cars, require taxi dooring warnings, and co-sponsored bills for better lighting and speed humps near parks. He called for &ldquo;immediate action&rdquo; on Canal Street, saying the time is long overdue (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/03/09/opinion-its-time-for-immediate-action-on-canal-street>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>But the street stays the same. Canal Street is still a gauntlet. The city studies, delays, and the bodies pile up. Bills for daylighting and crosswalk safety sit in committee. The most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, children—wait for the city to choose them over cars.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</h2><p><strong>The deaths are not fate. They are policy.</strong> Call Council Member Marte. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings, daylighted corners, and real enforcement. Join <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a> and <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a>. Do not wait for another vigil.

"We want a real solution to the bike and pedestrian safety issue," said CB 5 Vice Chair Samir Lavingia. The board warns that without bike lanes, cyclists will ride sidewalks, risking conflict.

Video shows the vehicles touching in a V shape. Investigator Nelson Yu, a retired NYPD detective, confronted the woman, demanding identification and handcuffing her after she failed to produce ID. Yu ordered, 'Get out of the car and show some ID,' and later, 'Get in the car! You're not going anywhere!' The woman was placed in the back seat of Yu’s vehicle. The arrest was later voided. The Attorney General’s office stated, 'OAG is investigating this matter internally and will not have further comment at this time.' The incident highlights the risks of parked vehicles and the escalation that can follow minor collisions, especially when law enforcement is involved.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
