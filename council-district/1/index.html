Fourteen left with life-altering wounds.</strong> In the last year alone, District 1 saw 680 people injured in 1,458 crashes. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about age. A cyclist, 44, slammed into a van door on Broome Street and was thrown under a truck. Medics tried to bring him back. They could not. <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/bicyclist-soho-struck-truck-driver-05012025/>“I saw a body on the ground, and then the fire people were trying to revive him. It didn’t look good,”</a> said a witness. The street kept moving.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians, cyclists, children.</strong> The most vulnerable pay the highest price. Trucks, SUVs, cars—they do not yield. In three years, 35 people suffered serious injuries. Eleven did not survive. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><h2 id=martes-record-action-and-delay>Marte’s Record: Action and Delay</h2><p>Council Member Christopher Marte has stood up for safer streets. He backed the <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nycs-delancey-street-to-get-road-diet-thanks-to-21m-from-feds>Delancey Street redesign</a>, calling the corridor &ldquo;an accident waiting to happen.&rdquo; He co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>expand protected bike lanes</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, shifting blame away from those on foot. He pushed for <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>lower speed limits</a> and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/27/dot-begins-slow-process-of-lowering-speed-limits-on-a-small-number-of-streets>regional slow zones</a>. But the city moves slow. The first slow zone covers a handful of blocks. Most streets remain unchanged. <strong>Promises do not stop trucks.</strong></p><h2 id=the-system-grinds-on>The System Grinds On</h2><p><strong>The danger is not random.</strong> Cars and trucks caused most deaths and injuries. Buses, mopeds, bikes—all played their part. The city counts the bodies. The council passes bills. The curb stays deadly. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/01/manhattan-e-bike-rider-dies-after-being-doored-by-van-run-over-by-box-truck/>“I opened the door. I didn’t even see the guy. I only saw the accident,”</a> said the van driver. The cyclist never saw tomorrow.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every crash is a policy choice. Every death is a failure to act. <strong>Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand protected lanes, not just promises.</strong> The dead cannot speak.

The endorsement, reported by Streetsblog NYC and covered by Gersh Kuntzman, followed a review of candidate plans. StreetsPAC called Lander’s proposal 'by far the most comprehensive blueprint ... we've ever seen from a candidate for any office.' Lander promised more protected bike lanes, a citywide Bus Rapid Transit network, and using congestion pricing revenue for busways and bikeways. He pledged six-minute service on subways and buses and action on street homelessness. StreetsPAC’s endorsement signals strong support for policies that prioritize vulnerable road users. Their safety analyst noted: 'A comprehensive plan for safer streets and better public transit typically prioritizes vulnerable road users, supports mode shift, and aligns with best practices for population-level safety improvements.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Charles Komanoff, a noted analyst, criticized NYLCV’s endorsement, arguing, 'Both City of Yes and congestion pricing will generate huge environmental dividends.' Komanoff said NYLCV’s scorecard ignored Marte’s record on housing and transportation, which should have disqualified him. NYLCV President Julie Tighe admitted to a slight incumbent bias and highlighted Marte’s park work, but could not confirm if congestion pricing was discussed.

The incident occurred at 5:35 p.m. The narrative states, 'An 88-year-old man stepped into the street, no signal, no crosswalk. A Toyota sedan struck him head-on. He fell, bleeding from the head, silent on the cold asphalt. The driver kept going straight.' The report lists 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a contributing factor. The sedan's point of impact was the right front bumper, and the driver was traveling straight ahead. The victim suffered severe head bleeding and was in shock. The police report does not cite any driver errors or violations, but emphasizes the pedestrian's location and action at the time of the crash.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill is 'Laid Over in Committee.' Its title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting standing or parking a vehicle within 20 feet of a crosswalk at an intersection.' Council Member Erik D. Bottcher is the primary sponsor, joined by Julie Won, Jumaane Williams, and others. The bill prohibits standing or parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and mandates the Department of Transportation to install daylighting barriers at a minimum of 1,000 intersections per year. The law also requires citywide outreach and reporting. This measure aims to keep sightlines clear at crossings, a known danger zone for people on foot and bike. The bill has not yet received a vote.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable.
