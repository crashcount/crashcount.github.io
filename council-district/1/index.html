A stolen car, driven at over 100 miles per hour, tore through the intersection. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/06/women-accused-in-horrific-chinatown-crash-that-claimed-two-lives-plead-not-guilty/>May Kwok</a> sat on a bench. <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/07/chinatown-deadly-crash-safety-upgrades-canal-street>Kevin Cruickshank</a> rode his bike. Both were killed before they could move. The driver and passenger tried to run. Police found alcohol and guns in the car. The city called for upgrades. But the street stayed the same for years. Seven have died on Canal since 2011. The city now promises changes. But for Kwok and Cruickshank, it is too late.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;We are taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection while developing a long-term safety redesign for the entire Canal Street corridor.&rdquo; — <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez</a></p></blockquote><h3 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h3><p>In the last twelve months, District 1 saw <strong>3 deaths</strong> and <strong>14 serious injuries</strong> from crashes. There were <strong>1,741 crashes</strong> and <strong>821 injuries</strong>. Cyclists and pedestrians bear the brunt. Trucks and SUVs killed more than any other vehicle. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>One cyclist died at Centre and Broome</a>. An 81-year-old man was killed crossing Delancey. The numbers are steady. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=martes-record-promises-and-small-steps>Marte’s Record: Promises and Small Steps</h3><p>Council Member Christopher Marte stood with residents on Canal Street. He said the time for action was long overdue. He pledged support. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/03/09/opinion-its-time-for-immediate-action-on-canal-street>He acknowledged the time is long overdue to take action in response to the dire conditions of Canal Street. He pledged his support to take action.</a> But the street stayed deadly. Marte voted for bills to clear abandoned cars, daylight crosswalks, and warn taxi passengers about dooring. He co-sponsored bills for safer bike share and better lighting. These are steps. But the bodies keep coming. The city moves slow. The cars do not.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</h3><p><strong>The dead cannot wait for another study.</strong> Call Council Member Marte. Demand real protection for people on foot and bike. Tell him to fight for street redesigns, not just decals and warnings. <strong>Push for fewer cars, slower speeds, and space for people.</strong> The time for talk is over. The street must change now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
