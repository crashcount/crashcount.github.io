Fifteen left with serious injuries.</strong> In the past year alone, District 1 has seen 1,461 crashes. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do. A cyclist, thrown from his e-bike on Broome Street, died after a van door flung open and a truck rolled over him. The van driver <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/01/manhattan-e-bike-rider-dies-after-being-doored-by-van-run-over-by-box-truck/>admitted</a>, &ldquo;I opened the door. I didn’t even see the guy. I only saw the accident.&rdquo; Medics worked on the pavement. He did not come back.</p><p>Pedestrians, cyclists, children—none are spared. In three years, <strong>11 people have died</strong> and <strong>2,181 have been injured</strong> on these streets. Trucks killed four. Cars and SUVs killed three. One was killed by a bike. The rest by machines that do not stop for flesh.</p><h2 id=leadership-bills-votes-and-the-slow-grind>Leadership: Bills, Votes, and the Slow Grind</h2><p>Council Member Christopher Marte has backed bills to daylight crosswalks, expand bike parking, and add speed humps. He voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths. He called Delancey Street a <a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/gillibrand-local-pols-unveil-18m-federal-grant-to-redesign-dangerous-stretch-of-delancey-street/>&ldquo;crisis&rdquo;</a> and pushed for a redesign after years of carnage. He welcomed a slow zone south of Canal, but the city moves street by street, not block by block. <strong>Most streets remain unchanged.</strong></p><h2 id=the-system-still-built-for-cars>The System: Still Built for Cars</h2><p>Speed limits drop on a handful of roads. Protected bike lanes crawl forward. But the danger remains. A witness saw the aftermath on Broome Street: <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/bicyclist-soho-struck-truck-driver-05012025/>&ldquo;I saw a body on the ground, and then the fire people were trying to revive him. It didn’t look good.&rdquo;</a> The city studies. The council debates. The trucks keep rolling.</p><h2 id=what-now-demand-more-demand-it-now>What Now: Demand More, Demand It Now</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Marte. Call the Mayor. Tell them: <strong>Every day of delay is another life at risk.</strong> Demand a 20 mph speed limit on every street. Demand daylighted crosswalks, protected bike lanes, and enforcement that targets drivers, not the dead.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another body in the road.

The article states, "Saturday's wreck occurred because the crew lost power to the rudder and was unable to steer the ship." The East River current pushed the powerless vessel backward, causing it to collide with the bridge, snap all three masts, and kill two people. The ship, carrying 277 people, was later towed to Pier 36. The incident highlights the risks of mechanical failure and the need for robust safety protocols when navigating crowded urban waterways. The bridge's clearance—127 feet—was lower than the ship's main mast, compounding the danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Marte was the only Manhattan council member to vote against the 'City of Yes' housing package and pushed for exemptions to congestion pricing. Charles Komanoff, a noted analyst, criticized NYLCV’s endorsement, arguing, 'Both City of Yes and congestion pricing will generate huge environmental dividends.' Komanoff said NYLCV’s scorecard ignored Marte’s record on housing and transportation, which should have disqualified him. NYLCV President Julie Tighe admitted to a slight incumbent bias and highlighted Marte’s park work, but could not confirm if congestion pricing was discussed. Critics argue the endorsement rewards actions that increase car use and danger for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill is 'Laid Over in Committee.' Its title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting standing or parking a vehicle within 20 feet of a crosswalk at an intersection.' Council Member Erik D. Bottcher is the primary sponsor, joined by Julie Won, Jumaane Williams, and others. The bill prohibits standing or parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and mandates the Department of Transportation to install daylighting barriers at a minimum of 1,000 intersections per year. The law also requires citywide outreach and reporting. This measure aims to keep sightlines clear at crossings, a known danger zone for people on foot and bike. The bill has not yet received a vote.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states, 'A taxi struck a slowing sedan. Steel kissed steel. The airbag burst.' The collision left a 37-year-old man, identified as the driver of one of the vehicles, with crush injuries to his arm. He remained conscious at the scene, clutching his injured limb. Both vehicles were traveling north and slowing or stopping when the impact happened. The taxi sustained center front-end damage, while the sedan was hit at the center back end. The police report lists the contributing factor as 'Unspecified,' and does not cite any victim behavior as a cause.

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable.
