He was struck while crossing outside a crosswalk. The SUV kept straight. The city later promised “immediate steps” at Bowery and Canal after another high‑speed crash killed two more people this summer, saying it would “fortify this intersection” and plan a full corridor redesign. Those are the city’s words, not ours (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash record</a>, <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Gothamist</a>, <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/07/chinatown-deadly-crash-safety-upgrades-canal-street>NY1</a>).</li><li>On Delancey Street, an 81‑year‑old man was killed in February 2024. The police coded the cause as driver distraction during a right turn (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>On Water Street near Jackson, July 4, 2024: four people killed, one child injured. A pickup hit people “not in roadway,” per the city record. No adjectives can help here (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li></ul><p>District 1 has lost <strong>nine pedestrians and two cyclists</strong> since 2022. Another two people riding in vehicles are dead. More than 2,400 people are hurt. Trucks and buses are a small slice of crashes but have caused four pedestrian deaths here; SUVs and cars killed three (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>district stats</a>).</p><h3 id=when-the-clock-turns-the-injuries-rise>When the clock turns, the injuries rise</h3><p>The injuries spread across the day, but the deaths spike at 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. Four people died in each of those hours. Serious injuries cluster late night, with the 10 p.m. hour logging six. Darkness is not an excuse. It is a pattern (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>district hourly data</a>).</p><p>DOT’s own hot spots line up with what people here know. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Delancey Street</a> leads for injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Canal Street</a> shows deaths and harm, again and again. The FDR Drive is high on injuries too. The city now says it will narrow lanes and add barriers at Bowery and Canal after two more deaths tied to 100‑plus mph driving. “Immediate steps,” the commissioner said (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Gothamist</a>). Advocates answered that “the vast majority of the corridor will remain deadly” (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Gothamist</a>).</p><h3 id=how-people-are-getting-hit>How people are getting hit</h3><p>Pedestrians here are struck most often by sedans and SUVs. The data show 202 pedestrian crashes with sedans and 174 with SUVs. Heavy vehicles — trucks and buses — don’t hit as often, but the bodies don’t care about ratios: four pedestrian deaths from trucks and buses, four from trucks alone in the rollup. Bikes are in the mix too as striking vehicles in 65 pedestrian crashes. This is not a turf war. It is a ledger of impact and speed (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>district vehicle rollup</a>).</p><p>Contributing factors in this district read like a shrug: “other” dominates the codes tied to 14 deaths. Distraction shows up. So does failure to yield. Alcohol appears once. The form fields are blunt and empty, but the outcomes are not (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>district factors</a>).</p><h3 id=promises-on-canal-still-waiting-on-the-rest>Promises on Canal, still waiting on the rest</h3><p>After two people were killed at Bowery and Canal in July, the city moved to add barriers and narrow lanes and to lower speeds at that corner. “We are taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection,” the commissioner said. Community voices warned that “the vast majority of the corridor will remain deadly.” Both statements stand. Both are recorded (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Gothamist</a>).</p><p>The city also passed smaller safety laws this year: dooring‑warning decals for taxis, faster towing of abandoned cars, micromobility rules in apps. Useful. Limited. None of them make a speeding driver lift a foot on Canal or Delancey (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Council vote — decals</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>abandoned vehicles</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>micromobility rules</a>).</p><h3 id=what-fixes-this-here>What fixes this, here</h3><p>Start where the bodies fall.</p><ul><li>Daylight crosswalks and harden turns along Delancey and Canal. The bill to ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks would scale daylighting to 1,000 intersections a year. It is sitting in committee. Move it (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>daylighting bill</a>).</li><li>Lock in barriers and lane narrowing on Bowery at Canal, then carry it block by block, east to west. Don’t stop at one crash corner (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Gothamist</a>).</li><li>Target night hours. Light the crossings. Enforce turning and yielding where the deaths cluster, 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. The data point the way (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>district hourly data</a>).</li></ul><h3 id=the-citywide-brakes-we-still-need>The citywide brakes we still need</h3><p>Speed is the blade. A citywide 20 mph default and speed limiters for repeat speeders would cut risk on every block. Albany has the votes for cameras all day and night, and New York has seen how a tiny group of drivers cause outsized harm. The case is made. The fix is known. We link to how to push it below. No more names on Canal. No more chalk on Delancey (<a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>).</p><p>One more number before you turn the page: <strong>nine pedestrians dead</strong> here since 2022. This is a small district. The streets are not.</p><p>Take one step that matters. <a href=/take_action/>Push the city to slow the streets</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

City drags its feet. Council set aside funds. DOT stalls. Pedestrians and cyclists wait. Business objections ring hollow. The mayor ignores the crisis. The call is clear: clear the streets for people, not cars.</p><p class=mb3>This is an opinion piece published July 11, 2022, titled 'Pedestrianize the Financial District Now!' It urges immediate action on the 'Make Way for Lower Manhattan' plan, which would turn streets below Chambers into shared spaces for walkers and cyclists. The Financial District Neighborhood Association backs the plan. Former Council Member Margaret Chin allocated $500,000 for early work in 2019. The Department of Transportation has not moved forward. The piece states, 'Any pedestrianization plan worth its salt will curtail the space for government-subsidized 'free' car storage.' The author slams the mayor for ignoring placard abuse and calls business objections a smokescreen. The plan’s delay keeps narrow, dangerous streets clogged with government vehicles, putting vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT drags its feet. Residents and business owners clash over urgency. The plan sits in study. Cyclists and pedestrians wait. The city’s slow pace keeps danger alive on narrow streets.</p><p class=mb3>This update covers the 'Make Way for Lower Manhattan' shared streets proposal, discussed July 1, 2022. The Department of Transportation (DOT) briefed Manhattan Community Board 1 on the plan, which aims to prioritize pedestrians and cyclists in the Financial District. The project, funded by $500,000 from then-Council Member Margaret Chin, remains in the study phase, delayed by the pandemic. DOT Project Manager Jenny Leung said the city is updating conditions and planning stakeholder engagement. Community Board 1 and the Financial District Neighborhood Association (FDNA) have backed the plan since 2015 and 2016, respectively. FDNA Board Member Catherine Hughes pressed for urgency, saying, 'It's time for a pilot project now.' Business leader Jessica Lappin voiced logistical concerns. The plan envisions shared streets with 5 mph speed limits and a future pedestrian plaza. Progress is slow. The city’s delay leaves vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He acknowledged the time is long overdue to take action in response to the dire conditions of Canal Street. He pledged his support to take action." -- Christopher Marte</p><p class=mb3>On March 9, 2022, a public statement titled 'It’s Time for Immediate Action on Canal Street' spotlighted the deadly imbalance on Canal Street. The Department of Transportation and Council Member Chris Marte faced residents at a design workshop. The matter: 'What is to be done about traffic and safety on Canal Street?' Marte pledged support for urgent changes. The op-ed notes that pedestrians are 65% of users but get as little as 10% of street space. Residents demand widened sidewalks, protected bike lanes, and enforcement against double-parking and crosswalk invasions. The call is clear: shift space from cars to people. The city’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users at daily risk. The time for talk is over. The street must change now.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
