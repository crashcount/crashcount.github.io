Fourteen left with life-altering wounds.</strong> In the last year alone, District 1 saw 680 people injured in 1,458 crashes. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about age. A cyclist, 44, slammed into a van door on Broome Street and was thrown under a truck. Medics tried to bring him back. They could not. <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/bicyclist-soho-struck-truck-driver-05012025/>“I saw a body on the ground, and then the fire people were trying to revive him. It didn’t look good,”</a> said a witness. The street kept moving.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians, cyclists, children.</strong> The most vulnerable pay the highest price. Trucks, SUVs, cars—they do not yield. In three years, 35 people suffered serious injuries. Eleven did not survive. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><h2 id=martes-record-action-and-delay>Marte’s Record: Action and Delay</h2><p>Council Member Christopher Marte has stood up for safer streets. He backed the <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nycs-delancey-street-to-get-road-diet-thanks-to-21m-from-feds>Delancey Street redesign</a>, calling the corridor &ldquo;an accident waiting to happen.&rdquo; He co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>expand protected bike lanes</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, shifting blame away from those on foot. He pushed for <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>lower speed limits</a> and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/27/dot-begins-slow-process-of-lowering-speed-limits-on-a-small-number-of-streets>regional slow zones</a>. But the city moves slow. The first slow zone covers a handful of blocks. Most streets remain unchanged. <strong>Promises do not stop trucks.</strong></p><h2 id=the-system-grinds-on>The System Grinds On</h2><p><strong>The danger is not random.</strong> Cars and trucks caused most deaths and injuries. Buses, mopeds, bikes—all played their part. The city counts the bodies. The council passes bills. The curb stays deadly. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/01/manhattan-e-bike-rider-dies-after-being-doored-by-van-run-over-by-box-truck/>“I opened the door. I didn’t even see the guy. I only saw the accident,”</a> said the van driver. The cyclist never saw tomorrow.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every crash is a policy choice. Every death is a failure to act. <strong>Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand protected lanes, not just promises.</strong> The dead cannot speak.

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The family’s attorney called it a “deadly maneuver” for a minor violation. The city later billed Williams’ family for police vehicle damages. The NYPD has not commented, citing litigation.
