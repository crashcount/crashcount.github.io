Fourteen left with life-altering wounds.</strong> In the last year alone, District 1 saw 680 people injured in 1,458 crashes. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about age. A cyclist, 44, slammed into a van door on Broome Street and was thrown under a truck. Medics tried to bring him back. They could not. <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/bicyclist-soho-struck-truck-driver-05012025/>“I saw a body on the ground, and then the fire people were trying to revive him. It didn’t look good,”</a> said a witness. The street kept moving.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians, cyclists, children.</strong> The most vulnerable pay the highest price. Trucks, SUVs, cars—they do not yield. In three years, 35 people suffered serious injuries. Eleven did not survive. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><h2 id=martes-record-action-and-delay>Marte’s Record: Action and Delay</h2><p>Council Member Christopher Marte has stood up for safer streets. He backed the <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nycs-delancey-street-to-get-road-diet-thanks-to-21m-from-feds>Delancey Street redesign</a>, calling the corridor &ldquo;an accident waiting to happen.&rdquo; He co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>expand protected bike lanes</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, shifting blame away from those on foot. He pushed for <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>lower speed limits</a> and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/27/dot-begins-slow-process-of-lowering-speed-limits-on-a-small-number-of-streets>regional slow zones</a>. But the city moves slow. The first slow zone covers a handful of blocks. Most streets remain unchanged. <strong>Promises do not stop trucks.</strong></p><h2 id=the-system-grinds-on>The System Grinds On</h2><p><strong>The danger is not random.</strong> Cars and trucks caused most deaths and injuries. Buses, mopeds, bikes—all played their part. The city counts the bodies. The council passes bills. The curb stays deadly. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/01/manhattan-e-bike-rider-dies-after-being-doored-by-van-run-over-by-box-truck/>“I opened the door. I didn’t even see the guy. I only saw the accident,”</a> said the van driver. The cyclist never saw tomorrow.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every crash is a policy choice. Every death is a failure to act. <strong>Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand protected lanes, not just promises.</strong> The dead cannot speak.

The article states, "Saturday's wreck occurred because the crew lost power to the rudder and was unable to steer the ship." The East River current pushed the powerless vessel backward, causing it to collide with the bridge, snap all three masts, and kill two people. The ship, carrying 277 people, was later towed to Pier 36. The incident highlights the risks of mechanical failure and the need for robust safety protocols when navigating crowded urban waterways. The bridge's clearance—127 feet—was lower than the ship's main mast, compounding the danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing.

The article notes the police are investigating if officers left the scene without reporting the crash. The incident came three months after NYPD restricted car chases for low-level offenses. Commissioner Tisch said, “Our officers deserve clear guidance and smart protocols when determining whether to engage in a vehicle pursuit on our streets.” The pursuit was reportedly justified under new policy, which still allows chases for serious crimes. The fatal fire highlights the ongoing risks of police pursuits and questions the effectiveness of recent reforms.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
