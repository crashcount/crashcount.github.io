In the past year, three people died and fourteen suffered serious injuries in crashes across District 1. Cyclists, walkers, elders, children—no one is spared. Just days ago, a 65-year-old man on an e-bike was struck on Second Avenue. The driver fled. Paramedics found the man unconscious, his head split open. They worked CPR on the asphalt, then rushed him to Bellevue in critical condition. The unlicensed driver was caught two hours later. Police say he faces charges for leaving the scene and driving without a license. The bike’s red light kept flashing in the road <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/30/hit-and-run-rogue-driver-caught-after-seriously-injuring-cycling-senior-in-heart-of-the-city>as the street was shut down</a> [West Side Spirit].</p><p>On July 19, a speeding car flew off the Manhattan Bridge, killing Kevin Cruickshank, a cyclist, and May Kwok, who was sitting on a bench. Police found guns, alcohol, and an overdue rental car. One driver refused a breathalyzer. The intersection was already known as dangerous. “His trip was cut short at an intersection known to some to be very dangerous. It is time to make this known to all and time for the city to take action,” <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/manhattan-bridge-crash-driver-faces-murder-rap-marte-blasts-dot-for-neglect-KB4883851>said Cruickshank’s sister</a>.</p><h3 id=martes-record-steps-forward-miles-to-go>Marte’s Record: Steps Forward, Miles to Go</h3><p>Council Member Christopher Marte has voted for and co-sponsored bills to clear abandoned vehicles, daylight crosswalks, and warn taxi passengers about dooring. He backed the law to decriminalize jaywalking and called for urgent action on Canal Street. But the carnage continues. After the Manhattan Bridge crash, Marte <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/manhattan-bridge-crash-driver-faces-murder-rap-marte-blasts-dot-for-neglect-KB4883851>blamed the Department of Transportation for &ldquo;ongoing neglect&rdquo;</a>. He pledged support for change, but the streets remain deadly.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-who-pays-the-price>The Numbers: Who Pays the Price</h3><p>In three and a half years, District 1 saw 13 killed, 37 seriously hurt, and over 2,400 injured. Cars and SUVs did most of the damage. Trucks, bikes, mopeds, and motorcycles all took their toll. The names fade, but the pain stays. The city’s response is slow. The blood dries, but the danger does not.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call Council Member Marte. Demand real protection for people on foot and bike. Insist on street redesigns, not just decals and warnings. Every day of delay is another day someone dies.</p><p><a href=https://council.nyc.gov/districts/>Contact your council member and demand action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The crackdown targets delivery workers, especially undocumented riders, for offenses like sidewalk riding and nonstandard bike setups. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the move, stating, 'When it comes to traffic safety, compliance is not optional.' Protesters and advocates argue the policy is discriminatory and escalates minor violations, risking severe consequences for vulnerable workers. Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives called it 'really inappropriate escalation.' The article highlights confusion over traffic rules and the risk of criminalization for actions previously handled as civil matters, raising questions about enforcement priorities and the impact on immigrant communities.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists and advocates argue the penalties are harsher than those faced by drivers for similar actions. As one protester said, “It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.” Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the crackdown, citing the lack of licensing for e-bikes as a challenge for enforcement, but acknowledged the need for legislative reform.

The article details a standoff between the MTA, New York State, and U.S. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy, who demands the tolls be taken down, threatening to withhold highway funds. The MTA argues the legality of the tolls and seeks a court injunction, stating, 'congestion pricing is legal and proper.' The system, operational since January 2025, has reduced daily vehicle entries into Manhattan’s core by 76,000 in April and raised $159 million in the first quarter. The dispute highlights tensions over funding priorities and the impact on lower-income drivers, but the courts, not drivers or pedestrians, will decide the fate of the tolls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

NTSB investigators boarded the vessel three days later, seeking to determine why the ship moved backward instead of forward.

Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model.
