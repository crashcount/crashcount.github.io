The article details heated opposition from local residents and bus riders, who argued the plan was rushed and lacked proper traffic analysis. Stacy Rauch, a daily bus rider, said, 'The bigger problem is we don’t have enough buses.' Critics worried diverted car traffic would overwhelm nearby streets. The city compared the move to the 14th Street car ban, but residents noted differences in bus frequency. The article highlights accusations of conflicts of interest involving community board members and advocacy groups. The policy aims to prioritize buses and vulnerable road users, but leaves open questions about implementation and neighborhood impact.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Residents worry rerouted vehicles will jam local streets and worsen safety. Jessica Lavoie of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association warns, "diverting traffic from this critical corridor onto narrow residential streets would lead to increased congestion, safety hazards, and diminished quality of life." The Department of Transportation aims to replicate the 14th Street busway, which "reduced congestion, sped up bus travel and curbed accidents."

The crackdown targets delivery workers, especially undocumented riders, for offenses like sidewalk riding and nonstandard bike setups. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the move, stating, 'When it comes to traffic safety, compliance is not optional.' Protesters and advocates argue the policy is discriminatory and escalates minor violations, risking severe consequences for vulnerable workers. Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives called it 'really inappropriate escalation.'

As one protester said, “It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.” Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the crackdown, citing the lack of licensing for e-bikes as a challenge for enforcement, but acknowledged the need for legislative reform.

It tore down the loop, carriage in tow. Pedestrians leapt fences to escape. Cyclists shouted warnings. The horse ran half a mile before another driver caught it. No injuries. Fear lingered.</p><p class=mb3>According to the New York Post (2025-05-19), a carriage horse ran loose through Central Park after its bridle came off and the driver was separated. Eyewitness Hayley said, "I was there with my friend walking on the sidewalk and almost got trampled by the poor horse. It was so terrifying." Parkgoers scrambled for safety, some jumping fences. Cyclists chased the horse, warning others. The horse was not tethered to a hitching post, as none was nearby. Christina Hansen, union rep for carriage horses, stated, "There were no injuries or property damage reported, and there's currently no indication the horse's driver was negligent." The incident highlights gaps in securing procedures and the absence of hitching posts, raising questions about safety for pedestrians and park users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
