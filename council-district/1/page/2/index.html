Fourteen left with life-altering wounds.</strong> In the last year alone, District 1 saw 680 people injured in 1,458 crashes. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about age. A cyclist, 44, slammed into a van door on Broome Street and was thrown under a truck. Medics tried to bring him back. They could not. <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/bicyclist-soho-struck-truck-driver-05012025/>“I saw a body on the ground, and then the fire people were trying to revive him. It didn’t look good,”</a> said a witness. The street kept moving.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians, cyclists, children.</strong> The most vulnerable pay the highest price. Trucks, SUVs, cars—they do not yield. In three years, 35 people suffered serious injuries. Eleven did not survive. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><h2 id=martes-record-action-and-delay>Marte’s Record: Action and Delay</h2><p>Council Member Christopher Marte has stood up for safer streets. He backed the <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nycs-delancey-street-to-get-road-diet-thanks-to-21m-from-feds>Delancey Street redesign</a>, calling the corridor &ldquo;an accident waiting to happen.&rdquo; He co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>expand protected bike lanes</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, shifting blame away from those on foot. He pushed for <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>lower speed limits</a> and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/27/dot-begins-slow-process-of-lowering-speed-limits-on-a-small-number-of-streets>regional slow zones</a>. But the city moves slow. The first slow zone covers a handful of blocks. Most streets remain unchanged. <strong>Promises do not stop trucks.</strong></p><h2 id=the-system-grinds-on>The System Grinds On</h2><p><strong>The danger is not random.</strong> Cars and trucks caused most deaths and injuries. Buses, mopeds, bikes—all played their part. The city counts the bodies. The council passes bills. The curb stays deadly. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/01/manhattan-e-bike-rider-dies-after-being-doored-by-van-run-over-by-box-truck/>“I opened the door. I didn’t even see the guy. I only saw the accident,”</a> said the van driver. The cyclist never saw tomorrow.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Every crash is a policy choice. Every death is a failure to act. <strong>Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand protected lanes, not just promises.</strong> The dead cannot speak.

The bill reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to setting maximum amounts for certain member usage fees charged by a bike share operator.' Council Member Chi A. Ossé leads as primary sponsor, joined by Restler, Marte, Hudson, Cabán, Brannan, Hanif, Brewer, and Abreu. The bill would prohibit bike share companies from charging members more than the base subway fare for e-bike rides of one hour or less, or regular bike rides of two hours or less. The law would take effect 120 days after passage and apply to new or renewed contracts. This measure aims to keep bike share affordable for New Yorkers, making cycling a more accessible option.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure covers just 0.13% of city streets, possibly reaching 0.8% if regional slow zones expand. The first such zone will be south of Canal Street in lower Manhattan. DOT can only lower limits street by street unless the City Council acts. Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers confirmed no citywide bill exists. Council Member Christopher Marte welcomed the slow zone in his district, citing rampant speeding off the bridges. Advocates and officials demand faster, broader action, saying, 'Twenty is plenty wherever you'll find people, and in New York that's everywhere.' DOT says it will prioritize areas near schools and neighborhoods with more non-white and low-income residents. The rollout is slow.

Introduced April 11, 2024, the bill bans parking, standing, stopping, or operating a vehicle with obscured or defaced license plates. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting the parking, standing, stopping, or operation of a motor vehicle with obscured or defaced license plates.' Council Member Oswald Feliz leads as primary sponsor, joined by Holden, Bottcher, Gennaro, Marte, Restler, Ung, and Paladino. The bill hits violators with up to $1,000 fines, possible jail, and escalating penalties for repeat offenses. The measure aims to end the dodge—drivers hiding plates to evade enforcement.

Both motorcycles were cited for 'Unsafe Speed' and were changing lanes prior to the collision. The SUV sustained damage to its left rear bumper.

Council Member James F. Gennaro leads as primary sponsor, joined by Gale A. Brewer, Christopher Marte, Alexa Avilés, Farah N. Louis, and Justin L. Brannan. The bill would require commercial e-bikes to be registered and display visible license information. Employers, not delivery workers, would be fined for violations like sidewalk riding.
