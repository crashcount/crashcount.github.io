Fifteen left with serious injuries.</strong> In the past year alone, District 1 has seen 1,461 crashes. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do. A cyclist, thrown from his e-bike on Broome Street, died after a van door flung open and a truck rolled over him. The van driver <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/01/manhattan-e-bike-rider-dies-after-being-doored-by-van-run-over-by-box-truck/>admitted</a>, &ldquo;I opened the door. I didn’t even see the guy. I only saw the accident.&rdquo; Medics worked on the pavement. He did not come back.</p><p>Pedestrians, cyclists, children—none are spared. In three years, <strong>11 people have died</strong> and <strong>2,181 have been injured</strong> on these streets. Trucks killed four. Cars and SUVs killed three. One was killed by a bike. The rest by machines that do not stop for flesh.</p><h2 id=leadership-bills-votes-and-the-slow-grind>Leadership: Bills, Votes, and the Slow Grind</h2><p>Council Member Christopher Marte has backed bills to daylight crosswalks, expand bike parking, and add speed humps. He voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths. He called Delancey Street a <a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/gillibrand-local-pols-unveil-18m-federal-grant-to-redesign-dangerous-stretch-of-delancey-street/>&ldquo;crisis&rdquo;</a> and pushed for a redesign after years of carnage. He welcomed a slow zone south of Canal, but the city moves street by street, not block by block. <strong>Most streets remain unchanged.</strong></p><h2 id=the-system-still-built-for-cars>The System: Still Built for Cars</h2><p>Speed limits drop on a handful of roads. Protected bike lanes crawl forward. But the danger remains. A witness saw the aftermath on Broome Street: <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/bicyclist-soho-struck-truck-driver-05012025/>&ldquo;I saw a body on the ground, and then the fire people were trying to revive him. It didn’t look good.&rdquo;</a> The city studies. The council debates. The trucks keep rolling.</p><h2 id=what-now-demand-more-demand-it-now>What Now: Demand More, Demand It Now</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Marte. Call the Mayor. Tell them: <strong>Every day of delay is another life at risk.</strong> Demand a 20 mph speed limit on every street. Demand daylighted crosswalks, protected bike lanes, and enforcement that targets drivers, not the dead.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another body in the road. Act now.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to setting maximum amounts for certain member usage fees charged by a bike share operator.' Council Member Chi A. Ossé leads as primary sponsor, joined by Restler, Marte, Hudson, Cabán, Brannan, Hanif, Brewer, and Abreu. The bill would prohibit bike share companies from charging members more than the base subway fare for e-bike rides of one hour or less, or regular bike rides of two hours or less. The law would take effect 120 days after passage and apply to new or renewed contracts. This measure aims to keep bike share affordable for New Yorkers, making cycling a more accessible option.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure covers just 0.13% of city streets, possibly reaching 0.8% if regional slow zones expand. The first such zone will be south of Canal Street in lower Manhattan. DOT can only lower limits street by street unless the City Council acts. Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers confirmed no citywide bill exists. Council Member Christopher Marte welcomed the slow zone in his district, citing rampant speeding off the bridges. Advocates and officials demand faster, broader action, saying, 'Twenty is plenty wherever you'll find people, and in New York that's everywhere.' DOT says it will prioritize areas near schools and neighborhoods with more non-white and low-income residents. The rollout is slow.

The bill targets commercial e-bikes, forcing registration and employer liability for violations. Sponsors say it will help identify dangerous riders and shift fines to companies, not workers. The measure sits in committee.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0224-2024, now laid over in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, urges Albany to pass S.7587/A.7833—the 'Commercial E-Bike Licensing Act.' The resolution, introduced March 7, 2024, calls for 'the registration of bicycles with electric assist used for commercial purposes and creates liability for employers for certain violations.' Council Member James F. Gennaro leads as primary sponsor, joined by Gale A. Brewer, Christopher Marte, Alexa Avilés, Farah N. Louis, and Justin L. Brannan. The bill would require commercial e-bikes to be registered and display visible license information. Employers, not delivery workers, would be fined for violations like sidewalk riding. The council frames this as a way to identify dangerous vehicles and hold companies accountable, aiming to reduce injuries and deaths among pedestrians and cyclists. The measure remains under committee review.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crash occurred just before dawn. The report states the pedestrian was 'crossing, no signal, or crosswalk' and was not at an intersection. The SUV's point of impact was the center front end, and the vehicle was described as 'going straight ahead.' The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified' for both the driver and the pedestrian. The narrative notes the victim 'died there, alone, under the empty sky.' No specific driver errors are cited in the report, but the fatal outcome underscores the lethal risk vulnerable road users face on wide, fast-moving corridors like Canal Street.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The report states, 'Three sedans slammed mid-turn. A man, 57, crushed at the wheel. A 6-year-old girl pinned in the back seat, neck hurt, crying.' Both the man and the child suffered crush injuries, with the girl sustaining neck trauma. The police report lists 'Turning Improperly' and 'Following Too Closely' as contributing factors. These driver errors—improper turning and tailgating—created a chain reaction that left two people injured. The report notes that southbound traffic continued moving and no one stopped. The focus remains on the hazardous driver behaviors and the systemic dangers present at this Manhattan intersection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bills, now before committee, aim to expand bike parking and storage in city parks and buildings. The matter summary states: 'A package of bills before the City Council would create more bike parking and storage in local parks and city-owned buildings to protect against theft.' Marte, the sponsor, said, 'The city is transforming to be a more bike-friendly place, but to increase that safety, to increase that accessibility, we need to make sure that we have bike storage that people can feel confident of where they're gonna leave their bikes.' Emily Jacobi of Transportation Alternatives backed the bills, noting, 'These bills will expand bike parking and bike accessibility across New York City.' The bills target the gap between car and bike parking, aiming to give cyclists safer, more reliable options.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
