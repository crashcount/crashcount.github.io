The East River current pushed the powerless vessel backward, causing it to collide with the bridge, snap all three masts, and kill two people. The ship, carrying 277 people, was later towed to Pier 36. The incident highlights the risks of mechanical failure and the need for robust safety protocols when navigating crowded urban waterways.

The article notes, “Advocates have fought to open a separate pedestrian path, citing dangerous overcrowding that has led to conflicts among cyclists, pedestrians and micromobility users.” The bridge was the last city-owned East River crossing without split paths. Manhattan Community Board 6 urged the city to act, pressing DOT to open the path despite construction delays.

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Marte was the only Manhattan council member to vote against the 'City of Yes' housing package and pushed for exemptions to congestion pricing. Charles Komanoff, a noted analyst, criticized NYLCV’s endorsement, arguing, 'Both City of Yes and congestion pricing will generate huge environmental dividends.' Komanoff said NYLCV’s scorecard ignored Marte’s record on housing and transportation, which should have disqualified him. NYLCV President Julie Tighe admitted to a slight incumbent bias and highlighted Marte’s park work, but could not confirm if congestion pricing was discussed.
