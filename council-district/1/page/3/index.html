Fifteen left with serious injuries.</strong> In the past year alone, District 1 has seen 1,461 crashes. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do. A cyclist, thrown from his e-bike on Broome Street, died after a van door flung open and a truck rolled over him. The van driver <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/01/manhattan-e-bike-rider-dies-after-being-doored-by-van-run-over-by-box-truck/>admitted</a>, &ldquo;I opened the door. I didn’t even see the guy. I only saw the accident.&rdquo; Medics worked on the pavement. He did not come back.</p><p>Pedestrians, cyclists, children—none are spared. In three years, <strong>11 people have died</strong> and <strong>2,181 have been injured</strong> on these streets. Trucks killed four. Cars and SUVs killed three. One was killed by a bike. The rest by machines that do not stop for flesh.</p><h2 id=leadership-bills-votes-and-the-slow-grind>Leadership: Bills, Votes, and the Slow Grind</h2><p>Council Member Christopher Marte has backed bills to daylight crosswalks, expand bike parking, and add speed humps. He voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths. He called Delancey Street a <a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/gillibrand-local-pols-unveil-18m-federal-grant-to-redesign-dangerous-stretch-of-delancey-street/>&ldquo;crisis&rdquo;</a> and pushed for a redesign after years of carnage. He welcomed a slow zone south of Canal, but the city moves street by street, not block by block. <strong>Most streets remain unchanged.</strong></p><h2 id=the-system-still-built-for-cars>The System: Still Built for Cars</h2><p>Speed limits drop on a handful of roads. Protected bike lanes crawl forward. But the danger remains. A witness saw the aftermath on Broome Street: <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/bicyclist-soho-struck-truck-driver-05012025/>&ldquo;I saw a body on the ground, and then the fire people were trying to revive him. It didn’t look good.&rdquo;</a> The city studies. The council debates. The trucks keep rolling.</p><h2 id=what-now-demand-more-demand-it-now>What Now: Demand More, Demand It Now</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Marte. Call the Mayor. Tell them: <strong>Every day of delay is another life at risk.</strong> Demand a 20 mph speed limit on every street. Demand daylighted crosswalks, protected bike lanes, and enforcement that targets drivers, not the dead.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another body in the road.

Local officials and advocates warn of rising danger for pedestrians and cyclists. The plan ignores transit alternatives and threatens Lower Manhattan’s safety and air.</p><p class=mb3>On November 7, 2023, New Jersey revealed its $11-billion plan to widen the Jersey Turnpike, doubling lanes between Newark Airport and the Hudson River tunnels. The project, detailed in a recent environmental review, will increase traffic by 32 percent by 2050, sending more than 1,200 extra cars per hour into Manhattan during morning peak. The Turnpike Authority claims the expansion is needed for congestion relief, but the review did not consider public transit alternatives. Council Member Christopher Marte opposes the plan, warning, 'our health, safety, and transit could all be severely worsened.' Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop urges investment in mass transit instead. Juan Restrepo of Transportation Alternatives calls for reducing car dependency. The NYC Department of Transportation is studying Canal Street redesigns for vulnerable users, but has not addressed evening impacts. Advocates demand action to protect pedestrians and cyclists from the looming surge in traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill required the Department of Transportation to create a dedicated parking enforcement unit. Its summary: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the establishment of a parking enforcement unit within the department of transportation.' Council Members Christopher Marte (primary sponsor), Lincoln Restler, and Rita C. Joseph backed the measure. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote or enactment. The proposal would have targeted illegal parking, a key threat to pedestrians and cyclists. With the bill’s failure, enforcement remains fragmented. Vulnerable road users continue to face blocked crosswalks and bike lanes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
