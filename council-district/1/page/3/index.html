It jumped the curb at Bowery and Canal. A cyclist, Kevin Cruickshank, was killed. A woman sitting on a bench, May Kwok, died too. The car did not stop. Drugs and alcohol were found inside. The driver had a record—she had hit a pedestrian in Brooklyn three months before and fled. She was out without bail. The city let her go. Now two more are dead. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/man-morning-bike-ride-killed-among-victims-chinatown-crash-2-women-arrested/17215969/>&ldquo;It appears to be excessive speed. Two people are in custody, unfortunate incident. No one should lose their life in that manner,&rdquo;</a> said Mayor Adams at the scene.</p><p>This is not rare. In the last twelve months, District 1 saw <strong>3 deaths and 15 serious injuries</strong>. There were <strong>1,706 crashes</strong>. Cyclists and pedestrians pay the price. The numbers do not stop. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=the-toll-on-the-most-vulnerable>The Toll on the Most Vulnerable</h3><p>Kevin was a fixture in the neighborhood. He rode his bike every morning. He helped his friends. He is gone now. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/20/us-news/horrifying-video-shows-moment-stolen-car-fatally-plows-into-nyc-woman-sitting-on-a-bench-in-crash-that-left-2-dead/>&ldquo;Kevin loved riding his bicycle and was often seen around the neighborhood coming back from a long ride. It’s devastating to know he was killed doing something he loved,&rdquo;</a> said a family spokeswoman.</p><p>The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors. They are mothers, sons, friends. The street does not care. The cars do not stop.</p><h3 id=martes-record-small-steps-slow-change>Marte’s Record: Small Steps, Slow Change</h3><p>Council Member Christopher Marte has voted for bills to clear abandoned cars, add daylight at crosswalks, and warn taxi passengers about dooring. He co-sponsored measures for safer bike share, better lighting, and speed humps near parks. He spoke in 2022: <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/03/09/opinion-its-time-for-immediate-action-on-canal-street>&ldquo;The time is long overdue to take action in response to the dire conditions of Canal Street. He pledged his support to take action.&rdquo;</a> But Canal Street is still a death trap. The city studies. The cars keep coming.</p><p><strong>The crisis is not abstract. It is flesh and bone on the sidewalk.</strong></p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</h3><p><strong>Call Council Member Marte. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes and sidewalks wide enough for life. Demand action, not studies.

The piece notes a sharp rise in injuries from police pursuits: 398 crashes and 315 injuries in the first eleven months of 2024, up 47% from the previous year. The NYPD is revising its pursuit policy after ten deaths in cases where “no drugs or guns were found.”</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law orders the Department of Transportation to install daylighting barriers at a minimum of 1,000 intersections each year, up from 100. The city must also run outreach and education. The bill aims to keep crosswalks clear, improve visibility, and protect people on foot and bike. No more hiding behind parked cars.
