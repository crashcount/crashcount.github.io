Two people died. May Kwok, 63, was sitting on a bench. Kevin Cruickshank, 55, was riding his bike. The driver left them in pieces and ran. Police found an open bottle of tequila and two pistols in the wreck. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/22/chinatown-hit-run-crash-murder-autumn-donna-ascension-romero-kennedy-lecraft/>&ldquo;They then tried to flee the scene followed by multiple eyewitnesses who told them to stop and come back because they had just killed two people.&rdquo;</a></p><p>This is not rare. In the last twelve months, District 1 saw <strong>805 injuries, 14 serious injuries, and 3 deaths</strong> from crashes. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, parents, children.</p><h3 id=the-slow-grind-of-policy>The Slow Grind of Policy</h3><p>Council Member Christopher Marte has spoken of urgency. In 2022, he said the time is &ldquo;long overdue to take action in response to the dire conditions of Canal Street.&rdquo; He <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/03/09/opinion-its-time-for-immediate-action-on-canal-street>pledged his support to take action</a>.</p><p>Since then, Marte has voted for bills to clear abandoned cars, add warning decals to taxis, and co-sponsored laws for better lighting, speed humps, and safer bike share. He backed the SAFE Streets Act and a ban on fake plates. But the street stays the same. Canal stays deadly. The benches stay close to the curb. The cars keep coming.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h3><p>The city studies. The council votes. The bodies pile up. A witness to the latest crash said, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/police-chase-midtown-manhattan-results-multiple-smashed-cars-drivers-arrest/17241821/>&ldquo;It felt like he was scratching like big noise and I was honking like stop and he kept doing it.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>Most deaths here are preventable.</strong> The city knows what works: slower speeds, daylighted corners, protected space for people. But action is slow. The cost is paid in blood.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand real change.</strong> Tell Marte and City Hall: No more studies. No more delay. Make Canal and every street safe for the living.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
