Fifteen left with serious injuries.</strong> In the past year alone, District 1 has seen 1,461 crashes. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do. A cyclist, thrown from his e-bike on Broome Street, died after a van door flung open and a truck rolled over him. The van driver <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/01/manhattan-e-bike-rider-dies-after-being-doored-by-van-run-over-by-box-truck/>admitted</a>, &ldquo;I opened the door. I didn’t even see the guy. I only saw the accident.&rdquo; Medics worked on the pavement. He did not come back.</p><p>Pedestrians, cyclists, children—none are spared. In three years, <strong>11 people have died</strong> and <strong>2,181 have been injured</strong> on these streets. Trucks killed four. Cars and SUVs killed three. One was killed by a bike. The rest by machines that do not stop for flesh.</p><h2 id=leadership-bills-votes-and-the-slow-grind>Leadership: Bills, Votes, and the Slow Grind</h2><p>Council Member Christopher Marte has backed bills to daylight crosswalks, expand bike parking, and add speed humps. He voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths. He called Delancey Street a <a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/gillibrand-local-pols-unveil-18m-federal-grant-to-redesign-dangerous-stretch-of-delancey-street/>&ldquo;crisis&rdquo;</a> and pushed for a redesign after years of carnage. He welcomed a slow zone south of Canal, but the city moves street by street, not block by block. <strong>Most streets remain unchanged.</strong></p><h2 id=the-system-still-built-for-cars>The System: Still Built for Cars</h2><p>Speed limits drop on a handful of roads. Protected bike lanes crawl forward. But the danger remains. A witness saw the aftermath on Broome Street: <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/bicyclist-soho-struck-truck-driver-05012025/>&ldquo;I saw a body on the ground, and then the fire people were trying to revive him. It didn’t look good.&rdquo;</a> The city studies. The council debates. The trucks keep rolling.</p><h2 id=what-now-demand-more-demand-it-now>What Now: Demand More, Demand It Now</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Marte. Call the Mayor. Tell them: <strong>Every day of delay is another life at risk.</strong> Demand a 20 mph speed limit on every street. Demand daylighted crosswalks, protected bike lanes, and enforcement that targets drivers, not the dead.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another body in the road.

Hanif stated, 'Our airspace is not for sale to the highest bidder and should only be available to essential needs of our city.' The bill responds to mounting complaints—nearly 60,000 since 2010—over helicopter noise and pollution.

The event targeted New York City’s sluggish bus service and the high cost of MTA fares.

Marte declared, 'It shouldn't just be a vote to get 30 miles of additional bus lanes. That should be the minimum.' The rally pressed the city to prioritize bus lanes, bike lanes, and pedestrian-oriented streets, echoing the Streets Master Plan. No formal bill was under consideration, but the council and advocates pushed for $3.1 billion in funding for these changes.

The matter, titled 'Hearing Day: Could Fees for Outdoor Dining Lead to Proper Pricing of City’s Curbs?', was discussed in committee. Council Member Julie Menin, representing District 5, participated and voiced concerns about noise, garbage, and parking loss. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez explained that fees would depend on location and space size. Advocates like Sara Lind and Marco Conner DiAquoi argued for equity, noting, 'Seventy-five percent of our public curb space is devoted to the movement and storage of vehicles.' The hearing highlighted calls for better public space management and a dedicated oversight office. Community boards remained divided, citing nightlife and local control issues. The debate centered on reclaiming curb space from cars and making the city safer and fairer for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
