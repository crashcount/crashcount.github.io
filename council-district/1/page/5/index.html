Fourteen left with life-altering wounds.</strong> In the last year alone, District 1 saw 680 people injured in 1,458 crashes. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about age. A cyclist, 44, slammed into a van door on Broome Street and was thrown under a truck. Medics tried to bring him back. They could not. <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/bicyclist-soho-struck-truck-driver-05012025/>“I saw a body on the ground, and then the fire people were trying to revive him. It didn’t look good,”</a> said a witness. The street kept moving.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians, cyclists, children.</strong> The most vulnerable pay the highest price. Trucks, SUVs, cars—they do not yield. In three years, 35 people suffered serious injuries. Eleven did not survive. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><h2 id=martes-record-action-and-delay>Marte’s Record: Action and Delay</h2><p>Council Member Christopher Marte has stood up for safer streets. He backed the <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nycs-delancey-street-to-get-road-diet-thanks-to-21m-from-feds>Delancey Street redesign</a>, calling the corridor &ldquo;an accident waiting to happen.&rdquo; He co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>expand protected bike lanes</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, shifting blame away from those on foot. He pushed for <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>lower speed limits</a> and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/27/dot-begins-slow-process-of-lowering-speed-limits-on-a-small-number-of-streets>regional slow zones</a>.

Buses, mopeds, bikes—all played their part. The city counts the bodies. The council passes bills. The curb stays deadly. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/01/manhattan-e-bike-rider-dies-after-being-doored-by-van-run-over-by-box-truck/>“I opened the door. I didn’t even see the guy.

Every death is a failure to act. <strong>Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every crosswalk.

The bill came through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, first introduced April 28, 2022. The law's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to a citywide greenway plan.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors including Rivera, Hudson, and others. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor on October 27, 2022. The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law. The measure compels the city to plan and maintain safe routes for non-drivers, with regular public reporting and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation (DOT) briefed Manhattan Community Board 1 on the plan, which aims to prioritize pedestrians and cyclists in the Financial District. The project, funded by $500,000 from then-Council Member Margaret Chin, remains in the study phase, delayed by the pandemic. DOT Project Manager Jenny Leung said the city is updating conditions and planning stakeholder engagement. Community Board 1 and the Financial District Neighborhood Association (FDNA) have backed the plan since 2015 and 2016, respectively. FDNA Board Member Catherine Hughes pressed for urgency, saying, 'It's time for a pilot project now.' Business leader Jessica Lappin voiced logistical concerns. The plan envisions shared streets with 5 mph speed limits and a future pedestrian plaza. Progress is slow.
