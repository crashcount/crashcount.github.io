Fourteen left with life-altering wounds.</strong> In the last year alone, District 1 saw 680 people injured in 1,458 crashes. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about age. A cyclist, 44, slammed into a van door on Broome Street and was thrown under a truck. Medics tried to bring him back. They could not. <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/bicyclist-soho-struck-truck-driver-05012025/>“I saw a body on the ground, and then the fire people were trying to revive him. It didn’t look good,”</a> said a witness. The street kept moving.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians, cyclists, children.</strong> The most vulnerable pay the highest price.

Buses, mopeds, bikes—all played their part. The city counts the bodies. The council passes bills. The curb stays deadly. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/01/manhattan-e-bike-rider-dies-after-being-doored-by-van-run-over-by-box-truck/>“I opened the door. I didn’t even see the guy.

The bill, now before the City Council, gives the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection power to revoke licenses for deceptive practices. Christopher Marte, another council member, proposed two related bills: one limits delivery backpack weights, the other bans retaliation against workers who refuse unsafe deliveries or miss tight deadlines. Marte’s bill also requires companies promising 15-minute delivery to state that speed is not guaranteed, citing 'the safety of the public and delivery workers.' Menin said, 'These stores are operating in the city in a completely unregulated fashion.' The bills respond to concerns that fast-delivery apps push workers to break traffic laws, endangering pedestrians and cyclists as e-bikes speed through city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill responds to mounting complaints—nearly 60,000 since 2010—over helicopter noise and pollution.

The event targeted New York City’s sluggish bus service and the high cost of MTA fares. The rally demanded Mayor Adams speed up bus commutes, install at least 30 miles of new bus lanes in 2022, and expand the Fair Fares program for low-income riders. Marte declared, 'It shouldn't just be a vote to get 30 miles of additional bus lanes. That should be the minimum.' The rally pressed the city to prioritize bus lanes, bike lanes, and pedestrian-oriented streets, echoing the Streets Master Plan. No formal bill was under consideration, but the council and advocates pushed for $3.1 billion in funding for these changes.

The city stalls. Danger grows. Action cannot wait.</p><p class=mb3>On March 9, 2022, a public statement titled 'It’s Time for Immediate Action on Canal Street' spotlighted the deadly imbalance on Canal Street. The Department of Transportation and Council Member Chris Marte faced residents at a design workshop. The matter: 'What is to be done about traffic and safety on Canal Street?' Marte pledged support for urgent changes. The op-ed notes that pedestrians are 65% of users but get as little as 10% of street space. Residents demand widened sidewalks, protected bike lanes, and enforcement against double-parking and crosswalk invasions. The call is clear: shift space from cars to people. The city’s inaction leaves vulnerable road users at daily risk. The time for talk is over. The street must change now.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No more 15-minute delivery ads. Fast promises push e-bike riders to break laws. Pedestrians and workers pay the price. Marte says: slow down, save lives. The bill aims to cut the deadly rush.</p><p class=mb3>On February 21, 2022, Councilman Christopher Marte introduced a bill in the New York City Council to ban on-demand grocery apps from advertising 15-minute delivery times. The bill, not yet assigned a committee or vote date, responds to the rise of companies like Gorillas and Getir. The matter summary states the bill 'would bar on-demand grocery apps from advertising 15-minute delivery times, citing threats to worker and pedestrian safety.' Marte, representing District 1, argues that these ads pressure delivery workers on e-bikes and scooters to break traffic laws, endangering themselves and pedestrians. 'We don’t think that should be legal,' Marte said. He believes giving workers more time will save lives by reducing the rush. The bill is part of a broader push for delivery worker protections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It called on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to ensure any subway station undergoing enhancement or renovation becomes fully accessible to people with disabilities. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling upon the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to make any subway stations undergoing enhancement or renovation fully accessible to people with disabilities.' Council Member Darlene Mealy sponsored the resolution, joined by Brannan, Menin, Louis, Yeger, Hanif, Hudson, Marte, Joseph, Riley, and Brooks-Powers. The resolution was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. Only 117 out of 493 subway stations are accessible. The Council’s action highlights the city’s failure to guarantee safe, equal passage for all riders. Elevators and upgrades are overdue.

Livable streets groups, including Open Plans and Transportation Alternatives, supported curbside fees and called for an Office of Public Space Management.
