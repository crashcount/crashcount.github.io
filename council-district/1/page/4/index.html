Fifteen left with serious injuries.</strong> In the past year alone, District 1 has seen 1,461 crashes. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do. A cyclist, thrown from his e-bike on Broome Street, died after a van door flung open and a truck rolled over him. The van driver <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/01/manhattan-e-bike-rider-dies-after-being-doored-by-van-run-over-by-box-truck/>admitted</a>, &ldquo;I opened the door. I didn’t even see the guy. I only saw the accident.&rdquo; Medics worked on the pavement. He did not come back.</p><p>Pedestrians, cyclists, children—none are spared. In three years, <strong>11 people have died</strong> and <strong>2,181 have been injured</strong> on these streets. Trucks killed four. Cars and SUVs killed three. One was killed by a bike. The rest by machines that do not stop for flesh.</p><h2 id=leadership-bills-votes-and-the-slow-grind>Leadership: Bills, Votes, and the Slow Grind</h2><p>Council Member Christopher Marte has backed bills to daylight crosswalks, expand bike parking, and add speed humps. He voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths. He called Delancey Street a <a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/gillibrand-local-pols-unveil-18m-federal-grant-to-redesign-dangerous-stretch-of-delancey-street/>&ldquo;crisis&rdquo;</a> and pushed for a redesign after years of carnage. He welcomed a slow zone south of Canal, but the city moves street by street, not block by block. <strong>Most streets remain unchanged.</strong></p><h2 id=the-system-still-built-for-cars>The System: Still Built for Cars</h2><p>Speed limits drop on a handful of roads. Protected bike lanes crawl forward. But the danger remains. A witness saw the aftermath on Broome Street: <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/bicyclist-soho-struck-truck-driver-05012025/>&ldquo;I saw a body on the ground, and then the fire people were trying to revive him. It didn’t look good.&rdquo;</a> The city studies. The council debates. The trucks keep rolling.</p><h2 id=what-now-demand-more-demand-it-now>What Now: Demand More, Demand It Now</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Marte. Call the Mayor. Tell them: <strong>Every day of delay is another life at risk.</strong> Demand a 20 mph speed limit on every street. Demand daylighted crosswalks, protected bike lanes, and enforcement that targets drivers, not the dead.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another body in the road. Act now.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill also ordered a study comparing these devices to unlit signs, probing their power to deter traffic violations and mapping out logistical hurdles. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the installation of solar-powered crosswalks.' Council Member Lincoln Restler led as primary sponsor, joined by Menin, Brooks-Powers, Rivera, and over thirty others. The bill was filed at session’s end on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst note was provided. The city’s crosswalks remain unchanged.

Streets choke. Danger grows.</p><p class=mb3>On August 8, 2022, Council Member Christopher Marte responded to the Straphangers Campaign’s report naming Manhattan’s M102 as the city’s slowest major bus line. The report, titled 'Slow in the City: Straphangers Campaign reveals the most dawdling, unreliable NYC bus lines,' highlighted severe congestion and unreliable service. Marte urged the city to replicate the 14th Street busway model across Manhattan, stating, 'We don’t have to wait until congestion pricing to take action. We know what works.' The mayor pledged 150 miles of new bus lanes over four years. The MTA and DOT officials acknowledged the need for better enforcement and safer, more efficient bus infrastructure. The push for bus priority lanes and congestion pricing aims to clear streets, speed up transit, and protect vulnerable road users from the daily hazards of traffic and delay.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city is reviewing the plan.</p><p class=mb3>On August 2, 2022, Council Member Christopher Marte backed a proposal for a protected bike lane on the West Side Highway. The plan, led by Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine, calls for closing a car lane and building a two-way bike lane along Manhattan’s western edge. Levine said, 'This solution would make this route safer for everybody.' Marte called the current Greenway 'an accident waiting to happen.' The proposal aims to relieve congestion on the Greenway and give e-bikes a safe, legal path. The city’s transportation department is reviewing the idea, but the New York State Department of Transportation, which controls the highway, has not commented. The plan draws inspiration from the Brooklyn Bridge bike lane, which Levine says improved safety there.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
