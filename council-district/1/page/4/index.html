In the past year, three people died and fourteen suffered serious injuries in crashes across District 1. Cyclists, walkers, elders, children—no one is spared. Just days ago, a 65-year-old man on an e-bike was struck on Second Avenue. The driver fled. Paramedics found the man unconscious, his head split open. They worked CPR on the asphalt, then rushed him to Bellevue in critical condition. The unlicensed driver was caught two hours later. Police say he faces charges for leaving the scene and driving without a license. The bike’s red light kept flashing in the road <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/30/hit-and-run-rogue-driver-caught-after-seriously-injuring-cycling-senior-in-heart-of-the-city>as the street was shut down</a> [West Side Spirit].</p><p>On July 19, a speeding car flew off the Manhattan Bridge, killing Kevin Cruickshank, a cyclist, and May Kwok, who was sitting on a bench. Police found guns, alcohol, and an overdue rental car. One driver refused a breathalyzer. The intersection was already known as dangerous. “His trip was cut short at an intersection known to some to be very dangerous. It is time to make this known to all and time for the city to take action,” <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/manhattan-bridge-crash-driver-faces-murder-rap-marte-blasts-dot-for-neglect-KB4883851>said Cruickshank’s sister</a>.</p><h3 id=martes-record-steps-forward-miles-to-go>Marte’s Record: Steps Forward, Miles to Go</h3><p>Council Member Christopher Marte has voted for and co-sponsored bills to clear abandoned vehicles, daylight crosswalks, and warn taxi passengers about dooring. He backed the law to decriminalize jaywalking and called for urgent action on Canal Street. But the carnage continues. After the Manhattan Bridge crash, Marte <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/manhattan-bridge-crash-driver-faces-murder-rap-marte-blasts-dot-for-neglect-KB4883851>blamed the Department of Transportation for &ldquo;ongoing neglect&rdquo;</a>. He pledged support for change, but the streets remain deadly.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-who-pays-the-price>The Numbers: Who Pays the Price</h3><p>In three and a half years, District 1 saw 13 killed, 37 seriously hurt, and over 2,400 injured. Cars and SUVs did most of the damage. Trucks, bikes, mopeds, and motorcycles all took their toll. The names fade, but the pain stays. The city’s response is slow. The blood dries, but the danger does not.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call Council Member Marte. Demand real protection for people on foot and bike. Insist on street redesigns, not just decals and warnings. Every day of delay is another day someone dies.</p><p><a href=https://council.nyc.gov/districts/>Contact your council member and demand action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, heard by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, passed on September 26, 2024, and became law on October 26, 2024. Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers. It shifts blame from people on foot to the system and those behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary reads: 'requiring the department of transportation to provide information about bicycle and other micromobility device activity.' Council Member Selvena N.

Systemic failure echoed in steel.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, three sedans crashed near FDR Drive and Delancey Street during a right turn. The report states, 'Three sedans slammed mid-turn. A man, 57, crushed at the wheel. A 6-year-old girl pinned in the back seat, neck hurt, crying.' Both the man and the child suffered crush injuries, with the girl sustaining neck trauma. The police report lists 'Turning Improperly' and 'Following Too Closely' as contributing factors. These driver errors—improper turning and tailgating—created a chain reaction that left two people injured. The report notes that southbound traffic continued moving and no one stopped. The focus remains on the hazardous driver behaviors and the systemic dangers present at this Manhattan intersection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
