He was fixing a street sign when the cyclist nearly hit his truck. Words were exchanged. The cyclist pulled a box cutter and cut the worker’s arm and back before fleeing. The city called it an <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/dot-worker-slashed-by-e-biker-manhattan/>&ldquo;abhorrent assault of a NYC DOT employee who performs critical work to keep our city moving&rdquo;</a>. No arrest. No peace.</p><p>On July 15, a van towing a food cart broke loose near 42nd and 10th. It struck a parked car with a woman and a child inside. Police found 76 propane tanks and 75 gallons of gasoline in the van. The driver was arrested for reckless endangerment. The <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/cops-bust-minivan-driver-in-manhattan-for-carrying-propane-tanks/>firefighters forced entry</a>. The woman and child went to the hospital. The street could have gone up in flames.</p><h2 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h2><p><strong>In the last 12 months, District 1 saw 2 deaths, 16 serious injuries, and 736 people hurt in 1,560 crashes.</strong></p><p>Most of the blood comes from cars and trucks. SUVs alone killed 2 people and injured 150 more. Trucks killed 4. Bikes and mopeds are not blameless, but the carnage is driven by heavy metal. The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross the street—no one is spared. The numbers are not just numbers. They are bodies on the pavement.</p><h2 id=what-has-marte-done>What Has Marte Done?</h2><p>Council Member Christopher Marte has voted for bills to clear abandoned vehicles, add daylight at crosswalks, and warn taxi passengers about dooring. He co-sponsored laws to ban fake plates, require speed humps near parks, and boost pedestrian lighting. He backed a bill to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>prohibit standing or parking a vehicle within 20 feet of a crosswalk</a>, aiming to keep sightlines clear. He stood with residents calling for urgent changes on Canal Street, saying the time is <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/03/09/opinion-its-time-for-immediate-action-on-canal-street>&ldquo;long overdue to take action in response to the dire conditions&rdquo;</a>.</p><p>But the pace is slow. The streets are not safe. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-demand-more-demand-now>Call to Action: Demand More, Demand Now</h2><p><strong>Call Council Member Marte. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected space for people, not cars. Demand action before another name is added to the list.</strong></p><p>The city has the power. The council has the votes. The blood is on their hands until the killing stops.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report also notes the pedestrian was 'Crossing Against Signal,' but this detail follows the documented driver errors of unsafe speed and failure to yield.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
