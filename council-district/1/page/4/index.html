It jumped the curb at Bowery and Canal. A cyclist, Kevin Cruickshank, was killed. A woman sitting on a bench, May Kwok, died too. The car did not stop. Drugs and alcohol were found inside. The driver had a record—she had hit a pedestrian in Brooklyn three months before and fled. She was out without bail. The city let her go. Now two more are dead. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/man-morning-bike-ride-killed-among-victims-chinatown-crash-2-women-arrested/17215969/>&ldquo;It appears to be excessive speed. Two people are in custody, unfortunate incident. No one should lose their life in that manner,&rdquo;</a> said Mayor Adams at the scene.</p><p>This is not rare. In the last twelve months, District 1 saw <strong>3 deaths and 15 serious injuries</strong>. There were <strong>1,706 crashes</strong>. Cyclists and pedestrians pay the price. The numbers do not stop. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=the-toll-on-the-most-vulnerable>The Toll on the Most Vulnerable</h3><p>Kevin was a fixture in the neighborhood. He rode his bike every morning. He helped his friends. He is gone now. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/20/us-news/horrifying-video-shows-moment-stolen-car-fatally-plows-into-nyc-woman-sitting-on-a-bench-in-crash-that-left-2-dead/>&ldquo;Kevin loved riding his bicycle and was often seen around the neighborhood coming back from a long ride. It’s devastating to know he was killed doing something he loved,&rdquo;</a> said a family spokeswoman.</p><p>The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors. They are mothers, sons, friends. The street does not care. The cars do not stop.</p><h3 id=martes-record-small-steps-slow-change>Marte’s Record: Small Steps, Slow Change</h3><p>Council Member Christopher Marte has voted for bills to clear abandoned cars, add daylight at crosswalks, and warn taxi passengers about dooring. He co-sponsored measures for safer bike share, better lighting, and speed humps near parks. He spoke in 2022: <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/03/09/opinion-its-time-for-immediate-action-on-canal-street>&ldquo;The time is long overdue to take action in response to the dire conditions of Canal Street. He pledged his support to take action.&rdquo;</a> But Canal Street is still a death trap. The city studies. The cars keep coming.</p><p><strong>The crisis is not abstract. It is flesh and bone on the sidewalk.</strong></p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</h3><p><strong>Call Council Member Marte. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes and sidewalks wide enough for life. Demand action, not studies.
