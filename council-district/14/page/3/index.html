An SUV turned into a driveway, struck her, and kept going. She died at St. Barnabas Hospital. The driver vanished into the dark. Police are still searching. The news called it a hit-and-run. The city calls it another number. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/08/07/us-news/44-year-old-woman-killed-in-nyc-hit-and-run-by-reckless-driver-turning-into-driveway/>&ldquo;A 44-year-old woman was fatally mowed down by a reckless driver who struck her while turning into a Bronx driveway before zooming off,&rdquo; police said.</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, District 14 has seen <strong>1 death, 9 serious injuries, and 787 people hurt</strong> in 1,121 crashes. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors. They are the people who wait at the bus stop, who cross to buy bread, who walk home from work. The violence does not stop. It does not slow. It is relentless.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h3><p>Council Member Pierina Ana Sanchez has voted for bills to clear abandoned cars, add daylighting at crosswalks, and require more street safety reporting. She backed speed humps near parks and better lighting for pedestrians. She supported bus lanes on Fordham Road and Tremont Avenue, but the city stalled, and the buses still crawl. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/07/29/fordham-rd-still-hell-for-bus-riders-after-mayor-adams-scrubbed-a-better-road-design>&ldquo;Mayor Adams&rsquo; decision to shelve plans for an upgraded bus lane to Fordham Road last year has had a predictable result: buses on the crosstown Bronx route are still crawling at the same slow speed.&rdquo;</a></p><p>But laws and votes do not stop cars. They do not bring back the dead. They do not comfort the families who wait for justice that never comes.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Speed kills.</strong> Most deaths and injuries come from cars and SUVs. The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has the power to redesign streets so drivers cannot flee. It has the power to end this slow disaster. But power unused is no power at all.</p><p><strong>Call Council Member Sanchez. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real bus lanes. Demand streets where people can walk and live.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name to become a number. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report states she was found unconscious, suffering severe lacerations and injuries to her entire body. The driver did not remain at the scene; the vehicle and its operator vanished, leaving no identifying information. The narrative notes: 'A 71-year-old woman lay unconscious in the crosswalk, blood on the pavement, body torn. She crossed with the signal. A vehicle struck her and vanished.' The police report does not list any contributing factors for the driver, but the act of fleeing the scene after striking a pedestrian in a crosswalk underscores the systemic danger faced by vulnerable road users. The victim’s compliance with the crossing signal is noted only after the driver’s failure to remain at the scene.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Councilmember Carmen De La Rosa, representing District 10, advanced a bill to allow food carts within two feet of the curb, instead of forcing them to abut traffic. The hearing, covered by Gothamist, saw rare agreement on banning vending in bike lanes and bridges, but fierce debate over location rules. The matter summary reads: 'NY street vendors and store owners, sometimes rivals, find some common ground.' De La Rosa’s bill aims to reduce danger for vendors forced close to traffic. Erin Piscopink of the NYC BID Association warned of unclear obstruction definitions and overcrowding. Councilmember Pierina Sanchez, another leader, called for real permit reform. The bills, part of a sweeping package, could come to a vote this year.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Adriano Espaillat quietly lobbied Bronx officials against proposed Fordham Road bus lane upgrades. The project, under city review since 2022, aimed to speed up buses for 85,000 daily riders by installing dedicated busways or offset lanes. According to Streetsblog, Espaillat leaned on younger electeds to align with Council Member Oswald Feliz, a vocal critic. 'He defers to the local elected officials, and all of them seem to be in agreement,' said Espaillat’s chief of staff, Aneiry Batista. Lawmakers who once supported the upgrades grew silent or opposed them after Espaillat’s intervention. The Department of Transportation, MTA, and governor’s office met with Espaillat to discuss the project, but delays persisted. The opposition from Feliz and business groups led DOT to scrap the most ambitious safety options. Riders, many without cars, remain exposed to slow, hazardous conditions as cars block bus lanes and traffic crawls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
