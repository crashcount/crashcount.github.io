His car is dead. He calls friends for help. A Mercedes slams into him. The driver runs. The man, Darryl Mathis Jr., dies at St. Barnabas Hospital. His friends arrive too late. &ldquo;He called to get a jump, and after that, he got hit from behind, a hit-and-run. They were on their way to come give him a jump and he got hit waiting for them. And then he called to let them know, I&rsquo;ve been hit. I can&rsquo;t breathe. His friends called the ambulance when they arrived.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/24/beloved-club-promoter-darryl-mathis-jr-killed-by-hit-run-bronx-mercedes-driver/>said Cornelius &lsquo;Big Grim&rsquo; Whitaker</a>.</p><p><strong>In the last year, District 14 saw 2 deaths and 8 serious injuries from crashes.</strong> There were 919 crashes. 635 people were hurt. Children, elders, workers. The violence is steady. The faces change. The pain stays.</p><h3 id=the-record-of-leadership>The Record of Leadership</h3><p>Council Member Pierina Ana Sanchez has signed her name to bills that matter. She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, pushing Albany to let New York set lower speed limits and give crash victims more rights. She backed the law that ended jaywalking tickets, so police can&rsquo;t blame the dead for crossing the street. She voted for a citywide greenway plan and for daylighting crosswalks—removing parked cars that block a child&rsquo;s view of the road. These are steps. But the blood on the street says it&rsquo;s not enough.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage.</strong> In three years, they killed at least one person on foot or bike. Trucks and buses killed one more. Motorcycles and mopeds left bodies broken. The numbers are cold. The street is colder.</p><h3 id=the-call-that-cant-wait>The Call That Can&rsquo;t Wait</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a failure. The city has the power to lower speed limits. The Council can ban parking near crosswalks. The law can put people before cars. But laws mean nothing if leaders wait.</p><p><strong>Call Council Member Sanchez. Demand action. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand streets where no one waits for help that never comes.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report states she was found unconscious, suffering severe lacerations and injuries to her entire body. The driver did not remain at the scene; the vehicle and its operator vanished, leaving no identifying information. The narrative notes: 'A 71-year-old woman lay unconscious in the crosswalk, blood on the pavement, body torn. She crossed with the signal. A vehicle struck her and vanished.' The police report does not list any contributing factors for the driver, but the act of fleeing the scene after striking a pedestrian in a crosswalk underscores the systemic danger faced by vulnerable road users. The victim’s compliance with the crossing signal is noted only after the driver’s failure to remain at the scene.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Adriano Espaillat quietly lobbied Bronx officials against proposed Fordham Road bus lane upgrades. The project, under city review since 2022, aimed to speed up buses for 85,000 daily riders by installing dedicated busways or offset lanes. According to Streetsblog, Espaillat leaned on younger electeds to align with Council Member Oswald Feliz, a vocal critic. 'He defers to the local elected officials, and all of them seem to be in agreement,' said Espaillat’s chief of staff, Aneiry Batista. Lawmakers who once supported the upgrades grew silent or opposed them after Espaillat’s intervention. The Department of Transportation, MTA, and governor’s office met with Espaillat to discuss the project, but delays persisted. The opposition from Feliz and business groups led DOT to scrap the most ambitious safety options. Riders, many without cars, remain exposed to slow, hazardous conditions as cars block bus lanes and traffic crawls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Powerful voices stall safer streets.</p><p class=mb3>On June 9, 2023, Bronx institutions—the Zoo and the Botanical Garden—joined others to oppose the Department of Transportation’s Fordham Road busway plan. The matter: 'Bus Advocates Target Anti-Busway ‘Hypocrites’ at Bronx Zoo and Botanical Garden.' Council Member Pierina Sanchez noted 70 percent of her district’s residents lack cars. The institutions sent a private letter to Mayor Adams, urging him to block all bus improvements. Riders Alliance and local residents accused them of hypocrisy, citing their public support for transit and environmental causes. The Botanical Garden’s representative demanded an Environmental Impact Statement, citing fears of more car traffic and pollution. Surveys show most Fordham Road shoppers walk or use transit. The opposition delays upgrades that would protect pedestrians and speed up commutes for thousands.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Bowed to business and institutional pressure. Riders lose. Offset bus lanes will replace the plan. Bus speeds will rise less. Bronx transit users, mostly car-free, get crumbs. Political muscle wins. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2023, the Department of Transportation (DOT) canceled the Fordham Road busway plan, citing 'community concerns.' The matter, discussed with the community advisory board on May 31, shifted focus to extending offset bus lanes instead. Council Member Pierina Sanchez, representing Kingsbridge, criticized the move: "My concern with the offset bus lane is that we're not going to see significant improvements." DOT's own studies showed a busway would have improved speeds by 30 percent, but the agency predicts only a 20 percent gain with the new plan. The decision followed lobbying from business groups and institutions, despite surveys showing most Bronx residents rely on transit. Riders Alliance spokesman Danny Pearlstein called the cancellation a disservice to bus riders. The change leaves 85,000 daily commuters with slower buses and no real safety or speed gains.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
