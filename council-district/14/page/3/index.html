His car is dead. He calls friends for help. A Mercedes slams into him. The driver runs. The man, Darryl Mathis Jr., dies at St. Barnabas Hospital. His friends arrive too late. &ldquo;He called to get a jump, and after that, he got hit from behind, a hit-and-run. They were on their way to come give him a jump and he got hit waiting for them. And then he called to let them know, I&rsquo;ve been hit. I can&rsquo;t breathe.

Children, elders, workers. The violence is steady. The faces change. The pain stays.</p><h3 id=the-record-of-leadership>The Record of Leadership</h3><p>Council Member Pierina Ana Sanchez has signed her name to bills that matter. She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, pushing Albany to let New York set lower speed limits and give crash victims more rights. She backed the law that ended jaywalking tickets, so police can&rsquo;t blame the dead for crossing the street. She voted for a citywide greenway plan and for daylighting crosswalks—removing parked cars that block a child&rsquo;s view of the road. These are steps. But the blood on the street says it&rsquo;s not enough.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage.</strong> In three years, they killed at least one person on foot or bike. Trucks and buses killed one more. Motorcycles and mopeds left bodies broken. The numbers are cold. The street is colder.</p><h3 id=the-call-that-cant-wait>The Call That Can&rsquo;t Wait</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a failure. The city has the power to lower speed limits. The Council can ban parking near crosswalks. The law can put people before cars. But laws mean nothing if leaders wait.</p><p><strong>Call Council Member Sanchez. Demand action. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand streets where no one waits for help that never comes.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0501-2022 was introduced to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on June 2, 2022. The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to hazardous obstruction by vehicles and civilian complaints to the department of transportation for hazardous obstruction violations,' aimed to create a new civil penalty for vehicles blocking bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or hydrants within 1,320 feet of a school. The penalty: $175 per violation, enforced through the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings. Civilians, except city employees, could file complaints and receive 25% of collected fines. The Department of Transportation would support this with a phased-in reporting program and annual public reports. Council Member Carlina Rivera led as primary sponsor, joined by over two dozen co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law.
