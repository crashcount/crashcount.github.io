She supported laws for better street safety data, more daylight at crosswalks, and speed humps near parks. She also voted to decriminalize jaywalking, a law that, as one official put it, ends <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/12/breaking-council-balks-on-legalizing-jaywalking#:~:text=,of%20the%20advocacy%20group%20Elizabeth">punitive enforcement that advocates say &lsquo;criminaliz[es] pedestrians [for] their own deaths&rsquo;</a>.</p><p>But the biggest fights—slower speeds, protected bike lanes, busways—move slow.

The driver remained at the scene and faced no immediate charges. Family members called for more safety measures at the busy intersection, noting, "There has to be a cross guard over there for the pedestrian to cross the street safely."

Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz stated, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." The crash damaged the overpass wall and scattered debris onto the street below. No injuries were reported, though conflicting accounts left passenger presence unclear. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz highlighted the broader issue: "We’re seeing all over the city parking regulations not being enforced." The incident underscores the risks posed by illegal parking and the need for stricter enforcement and infrastructure checks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
