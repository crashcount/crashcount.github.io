They did not get up. Police charged a 21‑year‑old Mercedes driver with DWI and vehicular manslaughter after the multicar crash on the Bronx River Parkway near Gun Hill Road. NYPD said he tried to pass, hit a Volkswagen, then struck the riders. Both died at local hospitals. Officials named them as Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19, and Enrique Martinez, 21. The driver refused a chemical test, according to a criminal complaint.</p><blockquote><p>“Two people were killed.

His arm split open. He stayed conscious, pain echoing down Undercliff Avenue. Steel met flesh. The street bore witness. The driver’s speed left no room for mercy.</p><p class=mb3>A 13-year-old pedestrian was struck by a Station Wagon/Sport Utility Vehicle on Undercliff Avenue near 1501 in the Bronx at 10:40 p.m., according to the police report. The report states the boy was crossing the street outside a crosswalk and without a signal when the SUV, traveling at an unsafe speed, hit him head-on. The impact caused severe bleeding from his arm, but he remained conscious at the scene. Police explicitly cite 'Unsafe Speed' as the contributing factor for the crash. The driver was traveling straight ahead when the collision occurred, and the vehicle’s center front end struck the boy. The police report does not list any pedestrian actions as contributing factors, focusing solely on the driver’s unsafe speed. The crash underscores the lethal consequences of excessive speed on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The street remains hostile.</p><p class=mb3>On July 29, 2024, Mayor Adams’ cancellation of the Fordham Road offset bus lane left Bronx riders stranded in slow traffic. The Department of Transportation had proposed moving the bus lane off the curb to block double-parking, but Adams scrapped the plan. The matter: 'Mayor Adams' decision to shelve plans for an upgraded bus lane to Fordham Road last year has had a predictable result: buses on the crosstown Bronx route are still crawling at the same slow speed.' Council Member Pierina Sanchez supported the redesign. Council Member Oswald Feliz opposed it. Both declined comment. NYPD enforcement replaced design, but ticketing is weak and driver behavior unchanged. Riders remain frustrated, waiting for city leaders to act. Vulnerable road users—bus passengers—bear the cost.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
