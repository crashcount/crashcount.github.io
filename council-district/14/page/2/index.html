She supported laws for better street safety data, more daylight at crosswalks, and speed humps near parks. She also voted to decriminalize jaywalking, a law that, as one official put it, ends <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/12/breaking-council-balks-on-legalizing-jaywalking#:~:text=,of%20the%20advocacy%20group%20Elizabeth">punitive enforcement that advocates say &lsquo;criminaliz[es] pedestrians [for] their own deaths&rsquo;</a>.</p><p>But the biggest fights—slower speeds, protected bike lanes, busways—move slow.

The crash occurred midblock at E. 149th St. and Morris Ave. Police said a 2019 Ford Transit van, turning left, hit Fofana as he crossed. The article quotes his sister-in-law: "He was going to buy socks. That's why he crossed the street." Police told the family that after the initial impact, two more vehicles struck Fofana. The driver remained at the scene and faced no immediate charges. Family members called for more safety measures at the busy intersection, noting, "There has to be a cross guard over there for the pedestrian to cross the street safely."

No injuries were reported, but the crash caused structural damage. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz noted, "That’s a very big bus, so even going very slowly, it can do a lot of damage," highlighting the risk of lax parking enforcement.
