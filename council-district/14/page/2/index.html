They did not get up. Police charged a 21‑year‑old Mercedes driver with DWI and vehicular manslaughter after the multicar crash on the Bronx River Parkway near Gun Hill Road. NYPD said he tried to pass, hit a Volkswagen, then struck the riders. Both died at local hospitals. Officials named them as Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19, and Enrique Martinez, 21. The driver refused a chemical test, according to a criminal complaint.</p><blockquote><p>“Two people were killed.

Morning rush waited.</p><h3 id=where-the-borough-bleeds>Where the borough bleeds</h3><p>District 14’s worst corridors are not secrets. Crashes cluster on <a href=#>Jerome Avenue</a> and the <a href=#>Grand Concourse</a>, and two more deaths land on <a href=#>University Avenue</a>. City data also lists fatalities on the <a href=#>Major Deegan</a> and <a href=#>Cross Bronx</a>. The names repeat in police logs and hospital charts.</p><ul><li>Jerome Avenue: 1 death, 132 injuries, 7 serious injuries.</li><li>Grand Concourse: 0 deaths, 161 injuries, 4 serious injuries.</li><li>University Avenue: 2 deaths, 118 injuries, 2 serious injuries.</li><li>Major Deegan Expressway: 1 death, 157 injuries.</li><li>Cross Bronx Expressway: 1 death, 104 injuries.</li></ul><p>Most harm comes from cars and SUVs. Pedestrians bear it: 3 killed and 492 hurt here since 2022. Cyclists: 176 injured. Riders on motorized two‑wheelers: 91 injured.</p><h3 id=the-clock-tells-on-us>The clock tells on us</h3><p>Harm spikes at night and at the edges of day. Midnight to 2 a.m. shows two deaths and 226 injuries. Six p.m. sees one death and 127 injuries. Ten, eleven, noon: more death stacked across the dial. The line never goes flat.</p><p>Alcohol shows up in the ledger. Fourteen injuries and two serious injuries in alcohol‑involved crashes in this district’s span. “Drugs involved” appears too.</p><p>A 65‑year‑old man, crossing with the signal at West Kingsbridge Road and University Avenue, died when a turning Ford van failed to yield, according to city data. A 44‑year‑old woman was killed off‑intersection on Macombs Road at West 174th; the report lists driver inattention. A 15‑year‑old girl died after a moped hit an SUV at West 192nd and University.</p><h3 id=what-city-hall-can-fix-tomorrow>What City Hall can fix tomorrow</h3><p>Sightlines save. A Council bill would ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and force the city to install daylighting barriers at 1,000 intersections a year, up from 100. It’s laid over in committee, but the aim is plain: clear corners, protect the walk. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Legistar file Int 1138‑2024</a>.</p><p>Bus lanes move bodies and calm traffic. On Fordham Road, the city shelved a stronger redesign. Riders are still stuck while cars block lanes. Council Member Pierina Sanchez backed a better plan; the mayor killed it. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/07/29/fordham-rd-still-hell-for-bus-riders-after-mayor-adams-scrubbed-a-better-road-design>Streetsblog</a>. On Tremont Avenue, DOT floated a short two‑way busway for the crawling Bx36; local leaders urged more. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/18/city-proposes-short-busway-for-clogged-cross-bronx-roadway>Streetsblog</a> and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/05/06/city-considers-fixes-for-another-ridiculously-slow-cross-bronx-bus>Streetsblog</a>.</p><p>The Council passed smaller steps. Removing abandoned cars faster. Dooring warnings on taxis. Tracking the Streets Master Plan so delays and failures are visible. Votes are on the record. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Legistar</a>.</p><h3 id=stop-the-speed-stop-the-funerals>Stop the speed; stop the funerals</h3><p>The danger funnels through a few patterns: failure to yield, distraction, alcohol, unsafe speed. Here, “unsafe speed” appears in injury tallies. Citywide, repeat speeders are a known threat. Albany renewed round‑the‑clock school‑zone cameras through 2030, and advocates push two changes that would cut deep:</p><ul><li>Lower the default speed limit to 20 mph under Sammy’s Law.</li><li>Force chronic speeders to use intelligent speed assistance devices.</li></ul><p>Both measures are detailed in our call to action and backed by research into repeat offenders’ harm. Read the plan and pick up the phone.</p><h3 id=what-to-build-on-jerome-the-concourse-and-university>What to build on Jerome, the Concourse, and University</h3><ul><li>Daylight every corner. Install barriers, not paint. Enact the crosswalk parking ban now.</li><li>Harden turns and add leading pedestrian intervals on Jerome, the Concourse, and University.</li><li>Extend bus‑ and truck‑priority lanes on Fordham and Tremont to cut weaving and double‑parking.</li></ul><p>None of this brings back a 19‑year‑old and a 21‑year‑old thrown onto parkway asphalt. It keeps the next family from waiting at Jacobi for the bad news.</p><p>Take one step today. <strong>Ask the city to slow every street and rein in repeat speeders</strong>. Start here: <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bus crashed into the wall, leaving it hanging over the edge. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz said, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." No injuries were reported, but the crash caused structural damage and scattered debris below. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz noted, "It speaks to the importance of enforcing our parking rules because it was going around a double-parked car." The incident highlights the danger posed by lax parking enforcement and infrastructure vulnerable to impact.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
