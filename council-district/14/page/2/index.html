She backed the law to decriminalize jaywalking and pushed for more transparency on street safety projects. She supported dedicated bus lanes on Tremont Avenue, but progress is slow and the most dangerous streets—like Fordham Road—remain clogged and deadly. <strong>Bills pass. Streets stay the same.</strong></p><h2 id=the-call-demand-action-not-excuses>The Call: Demand Action, Not Excuses</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another body on the street.</strong> Call Council Member Sanchez.

Clear markings mean fewer deadly gaps for walkers and riders.</p><p class=mb3>Int 1160-2025, now enacted, passed the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and full Council in February 2025. The law demands the Department of Transportation install pavement markings or temporary lines within five business days after any street resurfacing. If DOT misses the deadline, it must notify the public and explain the delay. The bill’s matter title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to installing pavement markings.' Council Member Farah N. Louis led as primary sponsor, joined by Brannan, Schulman, Banks, Farías, Carr, and Ariola. The law took effect March 15, 2025.

The bus crashed into the wall, breaking through and leaving debris below. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz said, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." No injuries were reported, but the crash caused structural damage. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz noted, "That’s a very big bus, so even going very slowly, it can do a lot of damage," highlighting the risk of lax parking enforcement. The incident underscores systemic issues: double-parking and weak infrastructure can combine to threaten lives, even when no one is hurt.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
