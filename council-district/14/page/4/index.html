Thirty-three left with life-altering injuries.</strong> Since 2022, District 14 has seen 3,898 crashes. The bodies pile up. The names fade. In the last year alone, 784 people were hurt, nine so badly they may never walk the same. One was killed. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>A 65-year-old man was crushed crossing with the light</a>.

Days later, a driver jumped the curb and plowed into six people on the sidewalk. No arrests. No answers. The city <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/city-commits-45-million-redo-dangerous-three-way-intersection-bronx>funds intersection fixes after 17 years of delay</a>, but the blood keeps flowing. <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/city-commits-45-million-redo-dangerous-three-way-intersection-bronx>&ldquo;We are excited to make progress on this key corridor, which will make incredible pedestrian and vehicular safety improvements,&rdquo;</a> said a city official, years too late for the dead.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h2><p>Council Member Pierina Ana Sanchez has voted for and co-sponsored bills to clear abandoned cars, daylight crosswalks, and speed up bus lanes. She backed the law to decriminalize jaywalking and pushed for more transparency on street safety projects. She supported dedicated bus lanes on Tremont Avenue, but progress is slow and the most dangerous streets—like Fordham Road—remain clogged and deadly. <strong>Bills pass. Streets stay the same.</strong></p><h2 id=the-call-demand-action-not-excuses>The Call: Demand Action, Not Excuses</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another body on the street.</strong> Call Council Member Sanchez. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings and busways that put people first. Join <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>.

The matter: 'Bus Advocates Target Anti-Busway ‘Hypocrites’ at Bronx Zoo and Botanical Garden.' Council Member Pierina Sanchez noted 70 percent of her district’s residents lack cars. The institutions sent a private letter to Mayor Adams, urging him to block all bus improvements. Riders Alliance and local residents accused them of hypocrisy, citing their public support for transit and environmental causes. The Botanical Garden’s representative demanded an Environmental Impact Statement, citing fears of more car traffic and pollution. Surveys show most Fordham Road shoppers walk or use transit.

Bowed to business and institutional pressure. Riders lose. Offset bus lanes will replace the plan. Bus speeds will rise less. Bronx transit users, mostly car-free, get crumbs. Political muscle wins. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2023, the Department of Transportation (DOT) canceled the Fordham Road busway plan, citing 'community concerns.' The matter, discussed with the community advisory board on May 31, shifted focus to extending offset bus lanes instead. Council Member Pierina Sanchez, representing Kingsbridge, criticized the move: "My concern with the offset bus lane is that we're not going to see significant improvements." DOT's own studies showed a busway would have improved speeds by 30 percent, but the agency predicts only a 20 percent gain with the new plan. The decision followed lobbying from business groups and institutions, despite surveys showing most Bronx residents rely on transit. Riders Alliance spokesman Danny Pearlstein called the cancellation a disservice to bus riders. The change leaves 85,000 daily commuters with slower buses and no real safety or speed gains.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
