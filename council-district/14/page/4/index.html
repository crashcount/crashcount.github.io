She supported laws for better street safety data, more daylight at crosswalks, and speed humps near parks. She also voted to decriminalize jaywalking, a law that, as one official put it, ends <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/12/breaking-council-balks-on-legalizing-jaywalking#:~:text=,of%20the%20advocacy%20group%20Elizabeth">punitive enforcement that advocates say &lsquo;criminaliz[es] pedestrians [for] their own deaths&rsquo;</a>.</p><p>But the biggest fights—slower speeds, protected bike lanes, busways—move slow.

Adriano Espaillat quietly lobbied Bronx officials against proposed Fordham Road bus lane upgrades. The project, under city review since 2022, aimed to speed up buses for 85,000 daily riders by installing dedicated busways or offset lanes. According to Streetsblog, Espaillat leaned on younger electeds to align with Council Member Oswald Feliz, a vocal critic. 'He defers to the local elected officials, and all of them seem to be in agreement,' said Espaillat’s chief of staff, Aneiry Batista. Lawmakers who once supported the upgrades grew silent or opposed them after Espaillat’s intervention. The Department of Transportation, MTA, and governor’s office met with Espaillat to discuss the project, but delays persisted. The opposition from Feliz and business groups led DOT to scrap the most ambitious safety options. Riders, many without cars, remain exposed to slow, hazardous conditions as cars block bus lanes and traffic crawls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2023, the Department of Transportation (DOT) canceled the Fordham Road busway plan, citing 'community concerns.' The matter, discussed with the community advisory board on May 31, shifted focus to extending offset bus lanes instead. Council Member Pierina Sanchez, representing Kingsbridge, criticized the move: "My concern with the offset bus lane is that we're not going to see significant improvements." DOT's own studies showed a busway would have improved speeds by 30 percent, but the agency predicts only a 20 percent gain with the new plan. The decision followed lobbying from business groups and institutions, despite surveys showing most Bronx residents rely on transit. Riders Alliance spokesman Danny Pearlstein called the cancellation a disservice to bus riders. The change leaves 85,000 daily commuters with slower buses and no real safety or speed gains.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
