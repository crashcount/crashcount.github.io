In the last year alone, 784 people were hurt, nine so badly they may never walk the same. One was killed.

She backed the law to decriminalize jaywalking and pushed for more transparency on street safety projects. She supported dedicated bus lanes on Tremont Avenue, but progress is slow and the most dangerous streets—like Fordham Road—remain clogged and deadly. <strong>Bills pass. Streets stay the same.</strong></p><h2 id=the-call-demand-action-not-excuses>The Call: Demand Action, Not Excuses</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another body on the street.</strong> Call Council Member Sanchez.
