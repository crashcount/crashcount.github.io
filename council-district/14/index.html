An SUV turned into a driveway, struck her, and kept going. She died at St. Barnabas Hospital. The driver vanished into the dark. Police are still searching. The news called it a hit-and-run. The city calls it another number. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/08/07/us-news/44-year-old-woman-killed-in-nyc-hit-and-run-by-reckless-driver-turning-into-driveway/>&ldquo;A 44-year-old woman was fatally mowed down by a reckless driver who struck her while turning into a Bronx driveway before zooming off,&rdquo; police said.</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, District 14 has seen <strong>1 death, 9 serious injuries, and 787 people hurt</strong> in 1,121 crashes. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors. They are the people who wait at the bus stop, who cross to buy bread, who walk home from work. The violence does not stop. It does not slow. It is relentless.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h3><p>Council Member Pierina Ana Sanchez has voted for bills to clear abandoned cars, add daylighting at crosswalks, and require more street safety reporting. She backed speed humps near parks and better lighting for pedestrians. She supported bus lanes on Fordham Road and Tremont Avenue, but the city stalled, and the buses still crawl. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/07/29/fordham-rd-still-hell-for-bus-riders-after-mayor-adams-scrubbed-a-better-road-design>&ldquo;Mayor Adams&rsquo; decision to shelve plans for an upgraded bus lane to Fordham Road last year has had a predictable result: buses on the crosstown Bronx route are still crawling at the same slow speed.&rdquo;</a></p><p>But laws and votes do not stop cars. They do not bring back the dead. They do not comfort the families who wait for justice that never comes.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Speed kills.</strong> Most deaths and injuries come from cars and SUVs. The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has the power to redesign streets so drivers cannot flee. It has the power to end this slow disaster. But power unused is no power at all.</p><p><strong>Call Council Member Sanchez. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real bus lanes. Demand streets where people can walk and live.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name to become a number. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
