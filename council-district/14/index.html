They did not get up. Police charged a 21‑year‑old Mercedes driver with DWI and vehicular manslaughter after the multicar crash on the Bronx River Parkway near Gun Hill Road. NYPD said he tried to pass, hit a Volkswagen, then struck the riders. Both died at local hospitals. Officials named them as Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19, and Enrique Martinez, 21. The driver refused a chemical test, according to a criminal complaint.</p><blockquote><p>“Two people were killed.

Morning rush waited.</p><h3 id=where-the-borough-bleeds>Where the borough bleeds</h3><p>District 14’s worst corridors are not secrets. Crashes cluster on <a href=#>Jerome Avenue</a> and the <a href=#>Grand Concourse</a>, and two more deaths land on <a href=#>University Avenue</a>. City data also lists fatalities on the <a href=#>Major Deegan</a> and <a href=#>Cross Bronx</a>. The names repeat in police logs and hospital charts.</p><ul><li>Jerome Avenue: 1 death, 132 injuries, 7 serious injuries.</li><li>Grand Concourse: 0 deaths, 161 injuries, 4 serious injuries.</li><li>University Avenue: 2 deaths, 118 injuries, 2 serious injuries.</li><li>Major Deegan Expressway: 1 death, 157 injuries.</li><li>Cross Bronx Expressway: 1 death, 104 injuries.</li></ul><p>Most harm comes from cars and SUVs. Pedestrians bear it: 3 killed and 492 hurt here since 2022. Cyclists: 176 injured. Riders on motorized two‑wheelers: 91 injured.</p><h3 id=the-clock-tells-on-us>The clock tells on us</h3><p>Harm spikes at night and at the edges of day. Midnight to 2 a.m. shows two deaths and 226 injuries. Six p.m. sees one death and 127 injuries. Ten, eleven, noon: more death stacked across the dial. The line never goes flat.</p><p>Alcohol shows up in the ledger. Fourteen injuries and two serious injuries in alcohol‑involved crashes in this district’s span. “Drugs involved” appears too.</p><p>A 65‑year‑old man, crossing with the signal at West Kingsbridge Road and University Avenue, died when a turning Ford van failed to yield, according to city data. A 44‑year‑old woman was killed off‑intersection on Macombs Road at West 174th; the report lists driver inattention. A 15‑year‑old girl died after a moped hit an SUV at West 192nd and University.</p><h3 id=what-city-hall-can-fix-tomorrow>What City Hall can fix tomorrow</h3><p>Sightlines save. A Council bill would ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and force the city to install daylighting barriers at 1,000 intersections a year, up from 100. It’s laid over in committee, but the aim is plain: clear corners, protect the walk. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Legistar file Int 1138‑2024</a>.</p><p>Bus lanes move bodies and calm traffic. On Fordham Road, the city shelved a stronger redesign. Riders are still stuck while cars block lanes. Council Member Pierina Sanchez backed a better plan; the mayor killed it. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/07/29/fordham-rd-still-hell-for-bus-riders-after-mayor-adams-scrubbed-a-better-road-design>Streetsblog</a>. On Tremont Avenue, DOT floated a short two‑way busway for the crawling Bx36; local leaders urged more. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/18/city-proposes-short-busway-for-clogged-cross-bronx-roadway>Streetsblog</a> and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/05/06/city-considers-fixes-for-another-ridiculously-slow-cross-bronx-bus>Streetsblog</a>.</p><p>The Council passed smaller steps. Removing abandoned cars faster. Dooring warnings on taxis. Tracking the Streets Master Plan so delays and failures are visible. Votes are on the record. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Legistar</a>.</p><h3 id=stop-the-speed-stop-the-funerals>Stop the speed; stop the funerals</h3><p>The danger funnels through a few patterns: failure to yield, distraction, alcohol, unsafe speed. Here, “unsafe speed” appears in injury tallies. Citywide, repeat speeders are a known threat. Albany renewed round‑the‑clock school‑zone cameras through 2030, and advocates push two changes that would cut deep:</p><ul><li>Lower the default speed limit to 20 mph under Sammy’s Law.</li><li>Force chronic speeders to use intelligent speed assistance devices.</li></ul><p>Both measures are detailed in our call to action and backed by research into repeat offenders’ harm. Read the plan and pick up the phone.</p><h3 id=what-to-build-on-jerome-the-concourse-and-university>What to build on Jerome, the Concourse, and University</h3><ul><li>Daylight every corner. Install barriers, not paint. Enact the crosswalk parking ban now.</li><li>Harden turns and add leading pedestrian intervals on Jerome, the Concourse, and University.</li><li>Extend bus‑ and truck‑priority lanes on Fordham and Tremont to cut weaving and double‑parking.</li></ul><p>None of this brings back a 19‑year‑old and a 21‑year‑old thrown onto parkway asphalt. It keeps the next family from waiting at Jacobi for the bad news.</p><p>Take one step today. <strong>Ask the city to slow every street and rein in repeat speeders</strong>.
