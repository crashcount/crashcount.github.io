One was a child. One was a senior. The numbers do not flinch: 676 people injured, 3 killed, 3 seriously hurt in just twelve months (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Each number is a life. Each life, a family left with silence.

In the last three years, cars and SUVs killed 2 people and injured over 300 more. Trucks and buses killed 1, injured 20. Motorcycles and mopeds, 0 deaths, 8 injuries. Bikes, 0 deaths, 20 injuries. The pattern is clear. The bigger the vehicle, the greater the risk. The city counts the bodies. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Council Member Shahana Hanif has backed bills to daylight intersections, expand bike lanes, and legalize safe crossings. She voted to end jaywalking enforcement, shifting blame away from those on foot. She co-sponsored the push for the SAFE Streets Act and called for speed humps, curb extensions, and bollards. She joined the call for the <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/stop-super-speeders-brooklyn-borough-hall/>Stop Super Speeders bill</a> after a mother and her daughters were killed, saying current enforcement is not enough (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/stop-super-speeders-brooklyn-borough-hall/>brooklynpaper.com</a>).</p><p>But the pace is slow. Bills sit in committee. Streets wait for change. The dead do not wait.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every day without action is a choice. Call Council Member Hanif. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighting at every corner. Demand the city use its new power to slow the cars and save the living.</p><p>Do not wait for another child’s name in the news.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The lane calmed a deadly stretch. Drivers still parked illegally. Children darted into traffic. Now, cyclists and pedestrians face more danger. Policy shifts, safety slips. Streets stay lethal.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC reported on June 13, 2025, that Mayor Adams will remove the protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue, a corridor known for high crash rates. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'before this bike lane from 2018 to 2022 this is the area that had the second largest numbers of pedestrian fatalities and crashes in the city.' The lane faced opposition from some Hasidic leaders, citing children running into the lane from illegally parked cars and buses. Despite tweaks—school bus zones, daylighted corners, no standing areas—drivers kept parking illegally, blocking sightlines and endangering children. The city rarely removes protected lanes, but Adams acted after political pressure. Moving the lane to Classon Avenue, as some demand, would force cyclists onto a chaotic BQE ramp. The decision highlights persistent driver violations and policy gaps that leave vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Steel and stone replace painted lines.</p><p class=mb3>The Brooklyn Paper reported on June 11, 2025, that NYC DOT will redesign intersections to protect cyclists and pedestrians. The plan uses 'hardened daylighting'—physical barriers, granite blocks, and planters—to stop cars from parking near corners. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' Nearly half of city traffic deaths happen at intersections, often due to blocked sightlines and turning vehicles. The redesign targets high-crash Brooklyn intersections first, including Ocean Avenue at Church Avenue. The move highlights the city's shift from painted lines to physical infrastructure, aiming to reduce systemic risk for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
