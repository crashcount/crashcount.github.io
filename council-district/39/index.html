The truck kept going, police said; a driver was later arrested and charged with leaving the scene that led to death (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/truck-driver-charged-off-duty-nypd-officer-killed-hit-run-crash-home-84th-precinct-brooklyn/17676103/>ABC7</a>, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/27/nypd-cop-dies-in-fiery-bqe-motorcycle-crash-on-way-to-work/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>Since Jan 1, 2022, in Council District 39, 15 people have been killed and <strong>2,567 injured</strong> in traffic crashes. That toll is drawn from city crash records for this district (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Deaths do not come at random hours. The 3 PM hour has seen the sharpest spike, with three deaths recorded in that slot alone in this district’s data window (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-corridor-that-keeps-bleeding>The corridor that keeps bleeding</h3><p>The BQE is a hotspot here.

The Aug 27 hit‑and‑run happened by the Atlantic Ave exit, in the heart of that zone (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/off-duty-nypd-officer-killed-hit-run-crash-work-brooklyn/17664404/>ABC7</a>, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/27/nypd-cop-dies-in-fiery-bqe-motorcycle-crash-on-way-to-work/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>Other corners in this district keep hurting people: Ocean Pkwy, Union St, Caton Ave — each listed with clusters of injuries, and in two cases, deaths (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=turning-trucks-broken-bones>Turning trucks, broken bones</h3><p>Right‑turning trucks killed twice here in the last two years.

She is also a co‑sponsor on a separate bill to ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and build at least 1,000 hardened daylighted corners a year (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1138‑2024</a>). Brooklyn electeds have pushed the city to adopt universal daylighting with physical barriers, not paint (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/17/seven-brooklyn-electeds-join-growing-calls-for-universal-daylighting>Streetsblog</a>).</p><p>These are the kinds of fixes that protect people from turning trucks and cars on Ocean Pkwy, Union St, and Caton Ave. They keep eyes on crosswalks. They keep people alive. The Council should pass them.</p><h3 id=stop-the-worst-repeat-speeders>Stop the worst repeat speeders</h3><p>After a mother and two daughters were killed in Gravesend, lawmakers and advocates rallied to pass the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would require speed‑limiting tech for drivers who rack up repeat violations. “The speed limiter technology is available to us. Let’s use it. It will save lives,” Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon said at the rally (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/stop-super-speeders-brooklyn-borough-hall/>Brooklyn Paper</a>).</p><p>District 39’s state delegation includes Assembly Member <a href=/assembly-district/44/>Robert Carroll</a> and State Senator <a href=/senate-district/17/>Steve Chan</a>. The record provided here shows Hanif’s support for stronger street safety laws and the city daylighting bills; it does not document whether Carroll or Chan have co‑sponsored the state speed‑limiter bill. What gives?</p><h3 id=one-street-one-choice>One street, one choice</h3><p>The BQE took another life in Cobble Hill. Ocean Pkwy, Union St, Caton Ave keep adding bodies to the ledger. The fixes sit on desks in City Hall and Albany.</p><p>Lower speeds. Harden the corners. Make the turns safe. Then do it again on the next block.</p><p>Take one step now. Tell your officials to pass the daylighting and curb‑extension bills and back speed limiters for repeat offenders.

Eighteen caucus members back the bill, aiming to force a vote this year. The matter: 'eliminate parking within 20 feet of an intersection.' Council Member Sandy Nurse called daylighting 'a proven, effective way to make our streets safer.' DOT raised doubts about non-hardened daylighting, but safety analysts say restricting parking near intersections improves visibility, reduces collisions, and protects people on foot and bike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets remain deadly.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News (2025-06-24) reports a 17-year-old died after his moped collided with a Genesis G80 driven by a 71-year-old man making a left turn on East 8th St. in Brooklyn. Police said the moped 'slammed into' the car, then hit a parked Honda Odyssey. Both the teen and his passenger suffered trauma; the teen died at Maimonides Medical Center. The car driver remained at the scene. No arrests were made, and the NYPD Highway District Collision Squad is investigating. The article also notes a separate fatal moped crash days earlier involving a drunk, unlicensed driver. These incidents highlight persistent risks for vulnerable road users and ongoing gaps in street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Seddio claims the lane will only shift location and disputes the safety benefits, arguing, 'The bike lane will still exist, but merely shift to an alternative location in the road.' He also questions crash data, citing seasonal differences: 'The change in accident and injury rates is better explained by seasonal weather patterns.' Streetsblog notes that after the redesign, crashes dropped by 18–19% and injuries by 25–26%. The case highlights ongoing tension between local political power, city notification procedures, and efforts to protect cyclists and pedestrians through street design.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The fight for safe passage on Bedford Avenue continues in court.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC reported on June 18, 2025, that Judge Carolyn Walker-Diallo halted New York City's plan to remove three blocks of the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane. The court found the city may have acted "arbitrarily, capriciously, and illegally" by ordering the removal without proper legal notice. City law requires the Department of Transportation to notify local officials and allow time for public discussion, but, as the court papers state, "DOT did not provide the required notice." Plaintiffs argued that removing the lane would "irreparably" harm cyclists, especially children. The city claimed it would only shift the lane, not remove it, but advocates countered that any removal increases danger. The case highlights the need for transparent processes and the risks when safety infrastructure is hastily altered.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The lane calmed a deadly stretch. Drivers still parked illegally. Children darted into traffic. Now, cyclists and pedestrians face more danger. Policy shifts, safety slips. Streets stay lethal.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC reported on June 13, 2025, that Mayor Adams will remove the protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue, a corridor known for high crash rates. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'before this bike lane from 2018 to 2022 this is the area that had the second largest numbers of pedestrian fatalities and crashes in the city.' The lane faced opposition from some Hasidic leaders, citing children running into the lane from illegally parked cars and buses. Despite tweaks—school bus zones, daylighted corners, no standing areas—drivers kept parking illegally, blocking sightlines and endangering children. The city rarely removes protected lanes, but Adams acted after political pressure. Moving the lane to Classon Avenue, as some demand, would force cyclists onto a chaotic BQE ramp. The decision highlights persistent driver violations and policy gaps that leave vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
