The truck kept going, police said; a driver was later arrested and charged with leaving the scene that led to death (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/truck-driver-charged-off-duty-nypd-officer-killed-hit-run-crash-home-84th-precinct-brooklyn/17676103/>ABC7</a>, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/27/nypd-cop-dies-in-fiery-bqe-motorcycle-crash-on-way-to-work/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>Since Jan 1, 2022, in Council District 39, 15 people have been killed and <strong>2,567 injured</strong> in traffic crashes. That toll is drawn from city crash records for this district (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Deaths do not come at random hours. The 3 PM hour has seen the sharpest spike, with three deaths recorded in that slot alone in this district’s data window (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-corridor-that-keeps-bleeding>The corridor that keeps bleeding</h3><p>The BQE is a hotspot here.

The Aug 27 hit‑and‑run happened by the Atlantic Ave exit, in the heart of that zone (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/off-duty-nypd-officer-killed-hit-run-crash-work-brooklyn/17664404/>ABC7</a>, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/27/nypd-cop-dies-in-fiery-bqe-motorcycle-crash-on-way-to-work/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>Other corners in this district keep hurting people: Ocean Pkwy, Union St, Caton Ave — each listed with clusters of injuries, and in two cases, deaths (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=turning-trucks-broken-bones>Turning trucks, broken bones</h3><p>Right‑turning trucks killed twice here in the last two years.

She is also a co‑sponsor on a separate bill to ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and build at least 1,000 hardened daylighted corners a year (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1138‑2024</a>). Brooklyn electeds have pushed the city to adopt universal daylighting with physical barriers, not paint (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/17/seven-brooklyn-electeds-join-growing-calls-for-universal-daylighting>Streetsblog</a>).</p><p>These are the kinds of fixes that protect people from turning trucks and cars on Ocean Pkwy, Union St, and Caton Ave. They keep eyes on crosswalks. They keep people alive. The Council should pass them.</p><h3 id=stop-the-worst-repeat-speeders>Stop the worst repeat speeders</h3><p>After a mother and two daughters were killed in Gravesend, lawmakers and advocates rallied to pass the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would require speed‑limiting tech for drivers who rack up repeat violations. “The speed limiter technology is available to us. Let’s use it. It will save lives,” Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon said at the rally (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/stop-super-speeders-brooklyn-borough-hall/>Brooklyn Paper</a>).</p><p>District 39’s state delegation includes Assembly Member <a href=/assembly-district/44/>Robert Carroll</a> and State Senator <a href=/senate-district/17/>Steve Chan</a>. The record provided here shows Hanif’s support for stronger street safety laws and the city daylighting bills; it does not document whether Carroll or Chan have co‑sponsored the state speed‑limiter bill. What gives?</p><h3 id=one-street-one-choice>One street, one choice</h3><p>The BQE took another life in Cobble Hill. Ocean Pkwy, Union St, Caton Ave keep adding bodies to the ledger. The fixes sit on desks in City Hall and Albany.</p><p>Lower speeds. Harden the corners. Make the turns safe. Then do it again on the next block.</p><p>Take one step now.

Last week, a speeding driver ran a red light, killing two pedestrians. The article quotes Adams, who once called Third Avenue 'extremely intimidating' and said it 'must be at the top of our list.' Despite this, his administration 'put the brakes on a potentially life-saving road redesign,' favoring business interests. Attorney Peter Beadle notes, 'they had a plan ready to go and then it was pulled back.' The city could face legal action for failing to act despite knowing the risks, echoing a 2017 state court ruling on municipal liability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vulnerable road users watch and wait.</p><p class=mb3>On June 25, 2025, New York City held local elections with major implications for street safety. The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, saw candidates who championed 'the importance of bike lanes, public transit, and open streets' win across the city. Council members Lincoln Restler, Shahana Hanif, Shekar Krishnan, Chi Oss, Crystal Hudson, and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams all prevailed on platforms supporting safer streets. Mark Levine, who called for bold highway changes, won the Comptroller race. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text is a vague statement of support for livable streets but does not describe a specific policy action or legislative change, so its direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists cannot be determined.' The victories signal a mandate for people-first streets, but concrete safety gains depend on future action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Seddio claims the lane will only shift location and disputes the safety benefits, arguing, 'The bike lane will still exist, but merely shift to an alternative location in the road.' He also questions crash data, citing seasonal differences: 'The change in accident and injury rates is better explained by seasonal weather patterns.' Streetsblog notes that after the redesign, crashes dropped by 18–19% and injuries by 25–26%.

The city had cited community feedback and a viral video of a child struck by an e-bike as reasons for removal. The Department of Transportation installed the protected lane after five pedestrian deaths in 2021 and 2022. Local lawmakers protested the removal, calling the process hasty.
