One was a child. One was a senior.

Each life, a family left with silence.

In the last three years, cars and SUVs killed 2 people and injured over 300 more. Trucks and buses killed 1, injured 20. Motorcycles and mopeds, 0 deaths, 8 injuries. Bikes, 0 deaths, 20 injuries.

The city moves on.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Council Member Shahana Hanif has backed bills to daylight intersections, expand bike lanes, and legalize safe crossings. She voted to end jaywalking enforcement, shifting blame away from those on foot. She co-sponsored the push for the SAFE Streets Act and called for speed humps, curb extensions, and bollards. She joined the call for the <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/stop-super-speeders-brooklyn-borough-hall/>Stop Super Speeders bill</a> after a mother and her daughters were killed, saying current enforcement is not enough (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/stop-super-speeders-brooklyn-borough-hall/>brooklynpaper.com</a>).</p><p>But the pace is slow. Bills sit in committee. Streets wait for change. The dead do not wait.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every day without action is a choice. Call Council Member Hanif. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighting at every corner. Demand the city use its new power to slow the cars and save the living.</p><p>Do not wait for another child’s name in the news.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The move follows a decade-long push to reclaim the block, used as both a play space and a parking lot for placard-holding teachers. The matter, described as 'a fully reimagined pedestrian plaza,' has backing from Hanif, who said, 'It’s going be a plaza. It’ll be closed off and won’t have parking spaces.' The Park Slope Fifth Avenue BID and Old Stone House plan to apply for permanent plaza status with the Department of Transportation. Advocates like Kathy Park Price cite placard abuse and safety risks, calling for a permanent pedestrian space to expand the park and protect the community. The DOT has not committed to a permanent plan.

The article states, 'This policy is discriminatory and ableist, and harmful to climate goals.' Hanif notes e-bikes enabled her to ride after hip surgery. The ban forces riders onto dangerous streets, blocks access for families and people with limited mobility, and invites selective NYPD enforcement.

No action taken.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0256-2022, introduced April 28, 2022, in the Committee on Public Safety, sought to amend the city code to require NYPD to report when officers use a motor vehicle as force. The bill’s matter title reads: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to use of force incidents involving police department use of a motor vehicle.” Council Member Althea V. Stevens led as primary sponsor, joined by 26 co-sponsors including Hudson, Williams, Restler, Krishnan, and others. The bill would have added 'use of a motor vehicle to gain control of a subject' as a reporting category. It was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not advance. This measure aimed to expose police vehicle violence by demanding full transparency in use-of-force reporting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. Curb extensions are designed to increase pedestrian visibility and reduce deadly conflicts at crossings, directly targeting systemic dangers faced by people on foot.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The action is not a formal bill, but a policy stance led by Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Council Member Lincoln Restler. The group, including Council Members Jennifer Gutierrez, Crystal Hudson, Chi Osse, Sandy Nurse, Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Rita Joseph, and Farah Louis, demands that developers seeking zoning changes first apply for a special permit to waive parking requirements. Restler said, 'Developers need our consent and approval, and we are telling them, plainly, that they have to file for a special permit to end parking requirements.' Reynoso added, 'You don't need to do that anymore.' Avilés called parking mandates a barrier to affordable housing and climate action. The group argues that parking minimums raise construction costs, encourage car use, and block green space. Restler warned he is 'far more likely to vote no' on projects without a parking waiver. Advocates and policy experts back the move, and related state legislation is pending.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
