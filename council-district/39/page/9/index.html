The Aug 27 hit‑and‑run happened by the Atlantic Ave exit, in the heart of that zone (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/off-duty-nypd-officer-killed-hit-run-crash-work-brooklyn/17664404/>ABC7</a>, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/27/nypd-cop-dies-in-fiery-bqe-motorcycle-crash-on-way-to-work/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>Other corners in this district keep hurting people: Ocean Pkwy, Union St, Caton Ave — each listed with clusters of injuries, and in two cases, deaths (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=turning-trucks-broken-bones>Turning trucks, broken bones</h3><p>Right‑turning trucks killed twice here in the last two years.

She is also a co‑sponsor on a separate bill to ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and build at least 1,000 hardened daylighted corners a year (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1138‑2024</a>). Brooklyn electeds have pushed the city to adopt universal daylighting with physical barriers, not paint (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/17/seven-brooklyn-electeds-join-growing-calls-for-universal-daylighting>Streetsblog</a>).</p><p>These are the kinds of fixes that protect people from turning trucks and cars on Ocean Pkwy, Union St, and Caton Ave. They keep eyes on crosswalks. They keep people alive. The Council should pass them.</p><h3 id=stop-the-worst-repeat-speeders>Stop the worst repeat speeders</h3><p>After a mother and two daughters were killed in Gravesend, lawmakers and advocates rallied to pass the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would require speed‑limiting tech for drivers who rack up repeat violations. “The speed limiter technology is available to us. Let’s use it. It will save lives,” Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon said at the rally (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/stop-super-speeders-brooklyn-borough-hall/>Brooklyn Paper</a>).</p><p>District 39’s state delegation includes Assembly Member <a href=/assembly-district/44/>Robert Carroll</a> and State Senator <a href=/senate-district/17/>Steve Chan</a>. The record provided here shows Hanif’s support for stronger street safety laws and the city daylighting bills; it does not document whether Carroll or Chan have co‑sponsored the state speed‑limiter bill. What gives?</p><h3 id=one-street-one-choice>One street, one choice</h3><p>The BQE took another life in Cobble Hill. Ocean Pkwy, Union St, Caton Ave keep adding bodies to the ledger.

White, known for representing victims of traffic violence, was charged with criminal mischief for removing plastic that hid a car’s license plate—a tactic often used to dodge cameras and tolls. The NYPD did not ticket the driver, who had a record of violations, and instead labeled him the 'victim.' Hanif called the arrest 'outrageous' and 'police misconduct,' demanding accountability from precinct leadership. She said, 'It is shocking how the NYPD continues to prioritize unlawful and reckless car owners while harassing cyclists and pedestrians at every opportunity.' Legal experts, including White’s attorney Gideon Oliver, questioned the charges and called for dismissal. The case highlights systemic failures in traffic enforcement and police discretion, with vulnerable road users left exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The effort, not yet a formal bill, marks the start of a multiyear process with capital funding. The DOT presented plans to 'create more space for pedestrians and cyclists,' and floated ideas to connect Prospect Park’s northern entrance to the Soldiers Memorial Arch. Council Members Crystal Hudson and Shahana Hanif previously called for DOT to address 'signal timing and unprotected bike lanes.' Community advocates and residents voiced strong support for closing parts of the plaza to traffic and improving infrastructure for people walking and biking. The process includes public meetings, surveys, and a traffic study, with preliminary designs expected in 2024. While some residents worry about car access, the push is clear: less traffic, more safety for the vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Shahana Hanif (District 39) and Crystal Hudson pressed DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez to address the plaza’s 'endless traffic, poor sidewalk conditions, broken benches, and overflowing trash cans.' Hanif and Hudson demanded immediate safety upgrades after recent crashes injured pedestrians and cyclists. DOT Deputy Commissioner Eric Beaton said, 'We want to take it to the next level... more consistent and better designed public spaces.'

Narcisse said, “People are suffering waiting 30 minutes, 40 minutes, it’s unfair to the riders.” She stressed that better bus service could cut down on illegal dollar vans. The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, has started community engagement. Some community boards worry about lost parking, but Rodriguez called their role advisory, saying, “we want to hear what the riders want.” Narcisse acknowledged driver backlash but insisted on the need for faster, reliable transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They want protected bike lanes, speed bumps, and better signals. Community groups back them. The plaza stays dangerous for walkers and cyclists. DOT promises a review. Action is overdue.</p><p class=mb3>On May 11, 2022, Council Members Crystal Hudson and Shahana Hanif sent a letter to the Department of Transportation urging immediate safety upgrades at Grand Army Plaza. The matter, titled 'Brooklyn Pols: Fix Grand Army Plaza and Make it Safer,' calls for more protected bike lanes, speed bumps, improved traffic signals, and completion of stalled capital work. The councilmembers cited ongoing crashes, injuries, and community complaints about dangerous conditions. They requested a comprehensive traffic study and highlighted support from over 2,000 neighbors and local advocacy groups. DOT responded that it would review the letter and meet with the community. The push comes as past improvements have failed to end the threat to pedestrians and cyclists. Hudson and Hanif’s action keeps pressure on the city to fix a deadly crossroads.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The 40-year-old e-scooter rider was ejected and suffered severe bleeding from his arm. According to the police report, 'A taxi struck an eastbound e-scooter. The rider, 40, flew off. No helmet. Blood streamed from his arm. The brakes had failed.' The report lists 'Brakes Defective' as a contributing factor for both vehicles.
