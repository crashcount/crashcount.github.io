Over 2,300 injured.</strong> These are not just numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. In the last twelve months alone, four lives ended on these streets. Five more suffered injuries so grave they may never recover, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the highest price.</strong> An 83-year-old woman was killed by a turning dump truck at Butler and Bond, as shown in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash records</a>. A 16-year-old cyclist was crushed by a box truck at Ditmas and Coney Island Avenue, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>the same data</a>. The old and the young, both struck down while moving through their own city.</p><h3 id=we-need-political-courage>&ldquo;We Need Political Courage&rdquo;</h3><p>Council Member Shahana Hanif has not been silent. She has called out the mayor for &ldquo;undoing street safety&rdquo; and demanded a city that &ldquo;prioritizes pedestrians, and ends these senseless murders,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/08/18/its-22-another-cyclist-has-been-killed-by-another-driver-who-has-not-been-charged>said Hanif</a>. She has co-sponsored <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>bills to force curb extensions</a> at the most dangerous intersections and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>to ban parking near crosswalks</a>. She joined other Brooklyn leaders to <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/17/seven-brooklyn-electeds-join-growing-calls-for-universal-daylighting>demand universal daylighting with hardened materials</a> at every corner.</p><p>But the pace is slow. Bills sit in committee. Paint fades. The city waits.</p><h3 id=the-system-favors-speed-not-safety>The System Favors Speed, Not Safety</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do most of the harm.</strong> In District 39, they are responsible for the vast majority of deaths and injuries, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. Enforcement often falls hardest on cyclists and delivery workers, not the drivers who kill. Hanif has pushed back, calling it &ldquo;unjust&rdquo; to &ldquo;hold cyclists to a far higher standard than motor vehicle drivers,&rdquo; as <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/12/cyclist-launches-class-action-suit-for-bogus-nypd-red-light-tickets>reported here</a>.</p><h3 id=act-now-demand-action-not-excuses>Act Now: Demand Action, Not Excuses</h3><p><strong>Every day, someone else pays the price for delay.</strong> Call Council Member Hanif. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit, curb extensions, and real protection for people on foot and bike. <strong>Do not wait for another name to become a number.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Advocates back the push.</p><p class=mb3>On January 17, 2024, seven Brooklyn elected officials—including Council Member Shahana Hanif, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, Assembly Members Marcela Mitaynes, Jo Anne Simon, Robert Carroll, and State Senators Zellnor Myrie and Andrew Gounardes—issued a joint letter to the NYC Department of Transportation. They called for 'universal daylighting with hardened materials such as boulders, planters, and bike corrals' at intersections. The officials cited recent fatal crashes and urged the city to opt into a state law banning parking within 20 feet of corners. They want federal funds used for these changes. The group opposes DOT’s slow pace and reliance on paint, demanding physical barriers. Community board leaders and advocates support the move. DOT says it will review the letter and remains committed to evidence-based daylighting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She pressed the Department of Transportation for urgent safety upgrades, saying, 'How many more crashes until the DOT pays attention?' Hanif noted the recent completion of a protected bike lane on Ninth Street but stressed that more action is needed. She thanked neighbors for their support and vowed to work with the DOT. So far in 2023, 3,702 cyclists have been injured and 22 killed on New York City streets.

The matter, described as 'DOT continues to ignore dangers it created on Brooklyn’s Fourth Ave,' centers on DOT’s decision to replace bike lanes with a second car lane, violating a city law that requires temporary bike lanes during such work. Council Members Lincoln Restler, Alexa Aviles, Shahana Hanif, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, State Senator Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, and groups like Bike New York and Transportation Alternatives sent a letter demanding the bike lane’s return and physical barriers to stop illegal parking on pedestrian islands. The letter urges DOT to 'ensure curb lanes be preserved for safe cyclist passage' and to 'deploy quick-build physical elements' for pedestrian safety. DOT has not responded. Cyclists and pedestrians remain at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Despite over 34,000 drivers meeting the threshold in the last year, only about 1,200 took the course in three years. DOT has not explained the reporting delay or provided outcome data.
