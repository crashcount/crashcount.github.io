One was a child. One was old enough to remember the city before seat belts. In twelve months, 673 people were hurt on the streets of District 39. Two were hurt so badly they may never walk the same. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p><strong>Cars and trucks do most of the killing.</strong> SUVs, sedans, trucks, and taxis. A 16-year-old cyclist crushed by a turning truck at Coney Island and Ditmas. An 83-year-old woman struck by a dump truck on Butler Street. A 74-year-old woman killed by an SUV at 14th Avenue and 39th Street. The details are always the same: a body, a street, a driver who keeps breathing.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Council Member Shahana Hanif has signed her name to bills that could save lives. She co-sponsored laws to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>speed up protected bike lanes</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>add curb extensions</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>. She stood with others to <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/17/seven-brooklyn-electeds-join-growing-calls-for-universal-daylighting>demand physical barriers at corners</a> and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/18/dot-continues-to-ignore-dangers-it-created-on-brooklyns-4th-ave>restore bike lanes erased by city construction</a>. She backed the <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/stop-super-speeders-brooklyn-borough-hall/>Stop Super Speeders bill</a> after a mother and her daughters were killed in Gravesend. She is not silent. But the city moves slow. Paint instead of concrete. Promises instead of barricades. The dead do not wait.</p><h3 id=what-next-the-work-left-undone>What Next: The Work Left Undone</h3><p><strong>The carnage continues.</strong> In the last year, crashes rose. Injuries rose. Deaths doubled. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has the power to daylight every corner. It has the power to build real protection for people on foot and bike. It does not use it fast enough.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand action.</strong> Tell Shahana Hanif and every official: No more delays. No more paint. No more children in the road. The next life lost could be yours. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

White, known for representing victims of traffic violence, was charged with criminal mischief for removing plastic that hid a car’s license plate—a tactic often used to dodge cameras and tolls. The NYPD did not ticket the driver, who had a record of violations, and instead labeled him the 'victim.' Hanif called the arrest 'outrageous' and 'police misconduct,' demanding accountability from precinct leadership. She said, 'It is shocking how the NYPD continues to prioritize unlawful and reckless car owners while harassing cyclists and pedestrians at every opportunity.' Legal experts, including White’s attorney Gideon Oliver, questioned the charges and called for dismissal. The case highlights systemic failures in traffic enforcement and police discretion, with vulnerable road users left exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Emergencies at non-NYCHA properties could override this order, with required notification to local officials. The bill required DOT to report on completed and pending NYCHA sidewalk repairs by June 30, 2023.

The measure was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without enactment.

The plan, a priority for the Adams administration and MTA, aims to speed up the B41 bus from Downtown Brooklyn to Marine Park. Narcisse and Councilmember Rita Joseph joined Mayor Eric Adams at a press conference, riding the B41 and speaking with riders. Narcisse said, “People are suffering waiting 30 minutes, 40 minutes, it’s unfair to the riders.” She stressed that better bus service could cut down on illegal dollar vans. The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, has started community engagement. Some community boards worry about lost parking, but Rodriguez called their role advisory, saying, “we want to hear what the riders want.” Narcisse acknowledged driver backlash but insisted on the need for faster, reliable transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Hanif stated, 'Our airspace is not for sale to the highest bidder and should only be available to essential needs of our city.' The bill responds to mounting complaints—nearly 60,000 since 2010—over helicopter noise and pollution. The proposal aims to cut thousands of flights, reduce greenhouse gases, and restore peace to city parks and neighborhoods.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
