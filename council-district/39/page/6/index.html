One was a child. One was old enough to remember the city before seat belts. In twelve months, 673 people were hurt on the streets of District 39. Two were hurt so badly they may never walk the same.

A 16-year-old cyclist crushed by a turning truck at Coney Island and Ditmas. An 83-year-old woman struck by a dump truck on Butler Street. A 74-year-old woman killed by an SUV at 14th Avenue and 39th Street.

She co-sponsored laws to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>speed up protected bike lanes</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>add curb extensions</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>. She stood with others to <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/17/seven-brooklyn-electeds-join-growing-calls-for-universal-daylighting>demand physical barriers at corners</a> and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/18/dot-continues-to-ignore-dangers-it-created-on-brooklyns-4th-ave>restore bike lanes erased by city construction</a>. She backed the <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/stop-super-speeders-brooklyn-borough-hall/>Stop Super Speeders bill</a> after a mother and her daughters were killed in Gravesend.

The dead do not wait.</p><h3 id=what-next-the-work-left-undone>What Next: The Work Left Undone</h3><p><strong>The carnage continues.</strong> In the last year, crashes rose. Injuries rose. Deaths doubled. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has the power to daylight every corner. It has the power to build real protection for people on foot and bike. It does not use it fast enough.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand action.</strong> Tell Shahana Hanif and every official: No more delays. No more paint. No more children in the road. The next life lost could be yours. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Brooklyn Council Member Shahana Hanif accused Mayor Adams of 'undoing street safety' and called for 'political courage' to protect pedestrians and cyclists. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives demanded immediate, legally-required action under the NYC Streets Plan. Fourteen of the 20 deaths involved e-bikes. Ninety-three percent of fatalities happened on streets lacking protected lanes. Despite record ridership, the city missed its own goals for new bike lanes.

Council Member Farah N. Louis sponsored the bill, joined by 21 co-sponsors including Williams, Hanif, and Yeger. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023.

The bill, named for Sammy Cohen Eckstein, killed by a reckless driver in 2013, has stalled in Albany despite mounting pressure. Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez introduced a resolution urging passage, co-sponsored by Shahana Hanif and Lincoln Restler. Adams, however, said, 'We’re going to let the state do what the state does in response to Sammy’s Law,' and focused on other budget priorities. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, chair of the Transportation Committee, called for pairing lower speed limits with street redesigns in neglected neighborhoods. As children and cyclists die in record numbers, the council’s inaction leaves vulnerable New Yorkers at risk. The law would not lower limits automatically, but grant the city authority to act.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Keith Powers introduced the buy-back bill, which creates a citywide program for defective or uncertified batteries. Powers said, "We don't want to penalize businesses and workers without thinking about this strategically." The Council also moved bills from Oswald Feliz, Gale Brewer, Alexa Avilés, and Robert Holden. These measures ban uncertified batteries, require fireproof charging containers, mandate public education, and order FDNY reporting on battery fires. Speaker Adrienne Adams clarified the bills target commercial sellers, not workers. Shahana Hanif urged that policy must "keep workers" at the center. The Council and delivery workers’ union stressed that tech companies, not workers, should bear costs. The FDNY opposed the reporting bill over resource concerns. The legislation aims to curb battery fires while protecting delivery workers who depend on e-bikes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
