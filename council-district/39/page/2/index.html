The truck kept going, police said; a driver was later arrested and charged with leaving the scene that led to death (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/truck-driver-charged-off-duty-nypd-officer-killed-hit-run-crash-home-84th-precinct-brooklyn/17676103/>ABC7</a>, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/27/nypd-cop-dies-in-fiery-bqe-motorcycle-crash-on-way-to-work/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>Since Jan 1, 2022, in Council District 39, 15 people have been killed and <strong>2,567 injured</strong> in traffic crashes. That toll is drawn from city crash records for this district (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Deaths do not come at random hours. The 3 PM hour has seen the sharpest spike, with three deaths recorded in that slot alone in this district’s data window (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-corridor-that-keeps-bleeding>The corridor that keeps bleeding</h3><p>The BQE is a hotspot here.

The Aug 27 hit‑and‑run happened by the Atlantic Ave exit, in the heart of that zone (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/off-duty-nypd-officer-killed-hit-run-crash-work-brooklyn/17664404/>ABC7</a>, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/27/nypd-cop-dies-in-fiery-bqe-motorcycle-crash-on-way-to-work/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>Other corners in this district keep hurting people: Ocean Pkwy, Union St, Caton Ave — each listed with clusters of injuries, and in two cases, deaths (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=turning-trucks-broken-bones>Turning trucks, broken bones</h3><p>Right‑turning trucks killed twice here in the last two years.

She is also a co‑sponsor on a separate bill to ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and build at least 1,000 hardened daylighted corners a year (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1138‑2024</a>). Brooklyn electeds have pushed the city to adopt universal daylighting with physical barriers, not paint (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/17/seven-brooklyn-electeds-join-growing-calls-for-universal-daylighting>Streetsblog</a>).</p><p>These are the kinds of fixes that protect people from turning trucks and cars on Ocean Pkwy, Union St, and Caton Ave. They keep eyes on crosswalks. They keep people alive. The Council should pass them.</p><h3 id=stop-the-worst-repeat-speeders>Stop the worst repeat speeders</h3><p>After a mother and two daughters were killed in Gravesend, lawmakers and advocates rallied to pass the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would require speed‑limiting tech for drivers who rack up repeat violations. “The speed limiter technology is available to us. Let’s use it. It will save lives,” Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon said at the rally (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/stop-super-speeders-brooklyn-borough-hall/>Brooklyn Paper</a>).</p><p>District 39’s state delegation includes Assembly Member <a href=/assembly-district/44/>Robert Carroll</a> and State Senator <a href=/senate-district/17/>Steve Chan</a>. The record provided here shows Hanif’s support for stronger street safety laws and the city daylighting bills; it does not document whether Carroll or Chan have co‑sponsored the state speed‑limiter bill. What gives?</p><h3 id=one-street-one-choice>One street, one choice</h3><p>The BQE took another life in Cobble Hill. Ocean Pkwy, Union St, Caton Ave keep adding bodies to the ledger. The fixes sit on desks in City Hall and Albany.</p><p>Lower speeds. Harden the corners. Make the turns safe. Then do it again on the next block.</p><p>Take one step now.

The city planned to restore the old painted lane, citing complaints about fast bikes and e-bikes. But advocates and residents sued, arguing the old design was unsafe and that 'safety of all road users has improved since the upgraded design was installed.' The judge's order prevents immediate removal, pending an August hearing. Transportation Alternatives called the ruling a win for street safety, saying, 'We won't let anyone make our streets more dangerous.' The case highlights ongoing tension between street safety improvements and city policy decisions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article states, "One police officer suffered a broken pelvis and arm, as well as head trauma, while another suffered a broken hip." A passenger in the Suburban was ejected and critically injured. The driver, Diyorjon Sobirjonov, was charged with DWI, reckless endangerment, and related offenses after refusing a blood-alcohol test.

Barriers force drivers to slow, protect cyclists, and clear sightlines. Seventy-nine crashes last year on Ocean Avenue alone. The city moves slow, but hard edges cut risk where cars once ruled.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC reported on June 12, 2025, that the Department of Transportation will install hard barriers at six Brooklyn intersections to protect cyclists and pedestrians. The new design 'daylights' corners, using concrete, granite, and planters to keep cars back and create mini-protected bike lanes. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' The agency targeted intersections with a history of turning crashes—Ocean Avenue saw 79 crashes in 2024, injuring 75 people, including 15 pedestrians and 13 cyclists. Advocates praised the move but called for faster, broader use of hard infrastructure. The article notes that most pedestrian injuries and deaths in New York occur at intersections, and that keeping corners clear is standard in other states. DOT opposes removing parking without barriers, citing risks of faster, more dangerous turns.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
