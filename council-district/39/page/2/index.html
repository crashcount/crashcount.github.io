Over 2,300 injured.</strong> These are not just numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. In the last twelve months alone, four lives ended on these streets. Five more suffered injuries so grave they may never recover, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the highest price.</strong> An 83-year-old woman was killed by a turning dump truck at Butler and Bond, as shown in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash records</a>. A 16-year-old cyclist was crushed by a box truck at Ditmas and Coney Island Avenue, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>the same data</a>. The old and the young, both struck down while moving through their own city.</p><h3 id=we-need-political-courage>&ldquo;We Need Political Courage&rdquo;</h3><p>Council Member Shahana Hanif has not been silent. She has called out the mayor for &ldquo;undoing street safety&rdquo; and demanded a city that &ldquo;prioritizes pedestrians, and ends these senseless murders,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/08/18/its-22-another-cyclist-has-been-killed-by-another-driver-who-has-not-been-charged>said Hanif</a>. She has co-sponsored <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>bills to force curb extensions</a> at the most dangerous intersections and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>to ban parking near crosswalks</a>.

Enforcement often falls hardest on cyclists and delivery workers, not the drivers who kill. Hanif has pushed back, calling it &ldquo;unjust&rdquo; to &ldquo;hold cyclists to a far higher standard than motor vehicle drivers,&rdquo; as <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/12/cyclist-launches-class-action-suit-for-bogus-nypd-red-light-tickets>reported here</a>.</p><h3 id=act-now-demand-action-not-excuses>Act Now: Demand Action, Not Excuses</h3><p><strong>Every day, someone else pays the price for delay.</strong> Call Council Member Hanif.

Police said the driver, spotted near Brighton Beach, "maneuvered onto the service road in [the] direction of several officers who set up a roadblock to stop this vehicle." When the driver "veered toward one of the officers and nearly hit him," an officer fired, striking the driver. The car continued another mile before crashing again. The driver died at Brookdale Hospital. The incident was captured on police body cameras. Officers were treated at local hospitals but not injured.
