Vulnerable road users watch and wait.</p><p class=mb3>On June 25, 2025, New York City held local elections with major implications for street safety. The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, saw candidates who championed 'the importance of bike lanes, public transit, and open streets' win across the city. Council members Lincoln Restler, Shahana Hanif, Shekar Krishnan, Chi Oss, Crystal Hudson, and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams all prevailed on platforms supporting safer streets. Mark Levine, who called for bold highway changes, won the Comptroller race. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text is a vague statement of support for livable streets but does not describe a specific policy action or legislative change, so its direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists cannot be determined.' The victories signal a mandate for people-first streets, but concrete safety gains depend on future action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cifuni followed for two blocks, confronted Pigford, and was then run over. Prosecutors described the incident in court, noting Pigford refused to engage before fleeing. The article quotes Cifuni’s family and Assistant District Attorney Tara Kelly: 'Pigford was driving a stolen 2016 Chevy Trax... when she rear-ended Cifuni’s 2021 Toyota 4Runner.' The case highlights the lethal risk of hit-and-run drivers and the dangers posed by stolen vehicles on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Concrete islands promise safer crossings. Details remain thin. Cars may still block buses. The street could change. Pedestrians and riders wait. The city holds its breath.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC (2025-06-09) reports the Department of Transportation plans a center-running bus lane on Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn. The project aims to connect neighborhoods and calm traffic. DOT Assistant Director Dustin Khuu said the goal is a 'high performing transit priority street.' The plan includes concrete bus boarding islands and may reduce car lanes, giving more space to pedestrians and buses. However, the article notes gaps: 'DOT didn't share a block-by-block breakdown,' and curbside parking may remain, risking bus lane obstruction by double-parked vehicles. The city may physically protect the lane, but details are pending. The B41 bus, serving 28,000 daily trips, crawls at 4 mph during rush hour. The proposal highlights the need for clear enforcement and design to keep cars out of bus lanes and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law lets cyclists go with the walk signal. NYPD ignored it. Officers escalated to criminal summonses. Immigrant workers hit hardest. Council Member Hanif seeks civil, not criminal, penalties.</p><p class=mb3>On May 12, 2025, a federal class action lawsuit was filed against the NYPD for issuing red light tickets and criminal summonses to cyclists who legally proceed through intersections during the pedestrian 'Walk' signal, as allowed by a 2019 law. The suit seeks an injunction, damages, and better officer training. The NYPD continued ticketing, despite the law. Brooklyn Council Member Shahana Hanif is 'exploring' ways for the City Council to 'restore the previous protocol of issuing civil summonses.' The lawsuit highlights that the NYPD's actions disproportionately harm immigrant workers who rely on cycling for work. Attorney Mariann Wang said, 'This action seeks to ensure the NYPD finally follows the law as it has been written for years, and stops unlawfully detaining and prosecuting cyclists when they've done nothing wrong.' The NYPD declined to comment.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
