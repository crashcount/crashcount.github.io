The truck kept going, police said; a driver was later arrested and charged with leaving the scene that led to death (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/truck-driver-charged-off-duty-nypd-officer-killed-hit-run-crash-home-84th-precinct-brooklyn/17676103/>ABC7</a>, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/27/nypd-cop-dies-in-fiery-bqe-motorcycle-crash-on-way-to-work/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>Since Jan 1, 2022, in Council District 39, 15 people have been killed and <strong>2,567 injured</strong> in traffic crashes. That toll is drawn from city crash records for this district (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Deaths do not come at random hours. The 3 PM hour has seen the sharpest spike, with three deaths recorded in that slot alone in this district’s data window (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-corridor-that-keeps-bleeding>The corridor that keeps bleeding</h3><p>The BQE is a hotspot here.

The Aug 27 hit‑and‑run happened by the Atlantic Ave exit, in the heart of that zone (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/off-duty-nypd-officer-killed-hit-run-crash-work-brooklyn/17664404/>ABC7</a>, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/27/nypd-cop-dies-in-fiery-bqe-motorcycle-crash-on-way-to-work/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>Other corners in this district keep hurting people: Ocean Pkwy, Union St, Caton Ave — each listed with clusters of injuries, and in two cases, deaths (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=turning-trucks-broken-bones>Turning trucks, broken bones</h3><p>Right‑turning trucks killed twice here in the last two years.

She is also a co‑sponsor on a separate bill to ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and build at least 1,000 hardened daylighted corners a year (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1138‑2024</a>). Brooklyn electeds have pushed the city to adopt universal daylighting with physical barriers, not paint (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/17/seven-brooklyn-electeds-join-growing-calls-for-universal-daylighting>Streetsblog</a>).</p><p>These are the kinds of fixes that protect people from turning trucks and cars on Ocean Pkwy, Union St, and Caton Ave. They keep eyes on crosswalks. They keep people alive. The Council should pass them.</p><h3 id=stop-the-worst-repeat-speeders>Stop the worst repeat speeders</h3><p>After a mother and two daughters were killed in Gravesend, lawmakers and advocates rallied to pass the Stop Super Speeders Act, which would require speed‑limiting tech for drivers who rack up repeat violations. “The speed limiter technology is available to us. Let’s use it. It will save lives,” Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon said at the rally (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/stop-super-speeders-brooklyn-borough-hall/>Brooklyn Paper</a>).</p><p>District 39’s state delegation includes Assembly Member <a href=/assembly-district/44/>Robert Carroll</a> and State Senator <a href=/senate-district/17/>Steve Chan</a>. The record provided here shows Hanif’s support for stronger street safety laws and the city daylighting bills; it does not document whether Carroll or Chan have co‑sponsored the state speed‑limiter bill. What gives?</p><h3 id=one-street-one-choice>One street, one choice</h3><p>The BQE took another life in Cobble Hill. Ocean Pkwy, Union St, Caton Ave keep adding bodies to the ledger. The fixes sit on desks in City Hall and Albany.</p><p>Lower speeds. Harden the corners. Make the turns safe. Then do it again on the next block.</p><p>Take one step now.

The bill divided the city into zones: the Manhattan core, an inner transit zone with no parking mandates, an outer transit zone with reduced mandates, and areas beyond where mandates mostly remain. The matter summary states, 'The final plan did not eliminate parking mandates citywide but divided the city into zones.' Council Member Crystal Hudson pushed to eliminate mandates in all her districts. Council Member Shahana Hanif opposed carve-outs. Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez called parking mandates 'a concession to cars that we don’t need and can’t afford.' Council Member Sandy Nurse’s district saw mandates shaped by community board amendments, not her advocacy. Dan Garodnick, Department of City Planning chair, said, 'parking and housing are no longer coming into conflict in the parts of New York City that are well-served by transit.' The bill passed after compromises, leaving mandates in some areas and progress in others.

The vehicle veered left and collided with a Lexus, with the impact crushing the front of both vehicles. The police report lists 'Illness' and 'Lost Consciousness' as contributing factors. The man, who was wearing a lap belt and harness, suffered fatal chest injuries and was not ejected from the vehicle. The report states, 'A 73-year-old man lost consciousness at the wheel. His Ford SUV veered left, crushing into a Lexus.' No driver errors such as distraction or speeding are cited beyond the medical emergency. The crash underscores the lethal consequences when a driver becomes incapacitated at speed.

No protected bike lanes. The driver sped off. The street stayed the same. Neighbors rallied. The council member listened. The injury was harsh. The system failed. Brooklyn’s gap in bike safety remains wide.</p><p class=mb3>On January 9, 2025, Streetsblog NYC published an essay detailing a crash on Henry Street in Brooklyn. The piece, titled 'A Brush With Danger Made Me Exhibit A in My Fight for Better Bike Lanes in Brooklyn,' describes the lack of protected bike lanes in Cobble Hill and Carroll Gardens. The author recounts merging into traffic, being closely followed by a driver, and crashing on a wet, greasy iron grid. The car sped away. Passersby helped. The cyclist suffered a broken collarbone. The essay notes, 'Our area of Brooklyn is a major hole in the borough's protected bike lane network.' Council Member Shahana Hanif attended a community meeting on the issue. The call is clear: Brooklyn’s streets favor cars, not people. The absence of protected lanes leaves cyclists exposed and injured. The system’s neglect is the danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
