Over 2,300 injured.</strong> These are not just numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. In the last twelve months alone, four lives ended on these streets. Five more suffered injuries so grave they may never recover, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the highest price.</strong> An 83-year-old woman was killed by a turning dump truck at Butler and Bond, as shown in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash records</a>. A 16-year-old cyclist was crushed by a box truck at Ditmas and Coney Island Avenue, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>the same data</a>. The old and the young, both struck down while moving through their own city.</p><h3 id=we-need-political-courage>&ldquo;We Need Political Courage&rdquo;</h3><p>Council Member Shahana Hanif has not been silent. She has called out the mayor for &ldquo;undoing street safety&rdquo; and demanded a city that &ldquo;prioritizes pedestrians, and ends these senseless murders,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/08/18/its-22-another-cyclist-has-been-killed-by-another-driver-who-has-not-been-charged>said Hanif</a>. She has co-sponsored <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>bills to force curb extensions</a> at the most dangerous intersections and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>to ban parking near crosswalks</a>.

Enforcement often falls hardest on cyclists and delivery workers, not the drivers who kill. Hanif has pushed back, calling it &ldquo;unjust&rdquo; to &ldquo;hold cyclists to a far higher standard than motor vehicle drivers,&rdquo; as <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/12/cyclist-launches-class-action-suit-for-bogus-nypd-red-light-tickets>reported here</a>.</p><h3 id=act-now-demand-action-not-excuses>Act Now: Demand Action, Not Excuses</h3><p><strong>Every day, someone else pays the price for delay.</strong> Call Council Member Hanif.

The vehicle veered left and collided with a Lexus, with the impact crushing the front of both vehicles. The police report lists 'Illness' and 'Lost Consciousness' as contributing factors. The man, who was wearing a lap belt and harness, suffered fatal chest injuries and was not ejected from the vehicle. The report states, 'A 73-year-old man lost consciousness at the wheel. His Ford SUV veered left, crushing into a Lexus.' No driver errors such as distraction or speeding are cited beyond the medical emergency. The crash underscores the lethal consequences when a driver becomes incapacitated at speed. The system offered no safeguard for the driver or others on the road.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

No protected bike lanes. The driver sped off. The street stayed the same. Neighbors rallied. The council member listened. The injury was harsh. The system failed. Brooklyn’s gap in bike safety remains wide.</p><p class=mb3>On January 9, 2025, Streetsblog NYC published an essay detailing a crash on Henry Street in Brooklyn. The piece, titled 'A Brush With Danger Made Me Exhibit A in My Fight for Better Bike Lanes in Brooklyn,' describes the lack of protected bike lanes in Cobble Hill and Carroll Gardens. The author recounts merging into traffic, being closely followed by a driver, and crashing on a wet, greasy iron grid. The car sped away. Passersby helped. The cyclist suffered a broken collarbone. The essay notes, 'Our area of Brooklyn is a major hole in the borough's protected bike lane network.' Council Member Shahana Hanif attended a community meeting on the issue. The call is clear: Brooklyn’s streets favor cars, not people. The absence of protected lanes leaves cyclists exposed and injured. The system’s neglect is the danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
