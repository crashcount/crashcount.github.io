Let’s use it. It will save lives,” Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon said at the rally (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/stop-super-speeders-brooklyn-borough-hall/>Brooklyn Paper</a>).</p><p>District 39’s state delegation includes Assembly Member <a href=/assembly-district/44/>Robert Carroll</a> and State Senator <a href=/senate-district/17/>Steve Chan</a>.

The DOT halted improvements at Third Avenue, citing commercial needs and parking.

Hanif met with DOT officials on January 12, 2023, expressing disappointment at the lack of immediate action. Maria Stylianou of Families for Safe Streets called the current half-measures unacceptable. Community members and activists, including Aaron Naparstek and Sarah Goodyear, condemned the city’s prioritization of parking over safety.

The crash happened where the protected bike lane ends and becomes sharrows, leaving riders unprotected. Council Member Shahana Hanif reported the death and said her office is working with NYPD and NYC DOT. Hanif promised to meet with DOT officials, stating, 'We should not have to live this way.' Transportation Alternatives blamed the street design, saying, 'At the location of this crash, the design of Ninth Street creates dangerous conditions for bike riders.' The area west of Third Avenue lacks protection due to DOT’s decision to preserve parking. From 2020 to 2022, eleven cyclists and six pedestrians were injured on this stretch.

They condemned the blanket ban, arguing it blocks access for delivery workers and families. Joseph and her colleagues oppose the current ban and the classification of e-bikes as motor vehicles.

The matter, titled 'Brooklyn pols call for repeal of Prospect Park e-bike ban,' highlights how the current policy keeps e-bikers out of the park, even after citywide legalization. The councilmembers wrote, 'E-bike users include delivery workers who keep us fed, families on cargo bikes, individuals recovering from surgery, older adults, people who live in areas with fewer public transit options, those who want to limit their carbon footprint by not driving cars, and so many more.' They argue the ban unfairly targets vulnerable riders and blocks access for those who rely on e-bikes for work and daily life. The Parks Department’s stance forces e-bike users onto more dangerous streets, undermining safety and equity. The councilmembers call for a new, inclusive policy shaped by community input.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The letter states, 'E-bikes are legal to ride on New York City streets and make moving around the city more accessible without adding more pollution and congestion.' The council members oppose the Parks Department’s policy that classifies e-bikes as motor vehicles, grouping them with SUVs and trucks. They argue this ban blocks access for delivery workers, families, older adults, and people with limited transit options. The lawmakers call for a new policy that permits e-bikes while addressing safety concerns, insisting the current rule undermines city values of accessibility and environmental care.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

White, known for representing victims of traffic violence, was charged with criminal mischief for removing plastic that hid a car’s license plate—a tactic often used to dodge cameras and tolls. The NYPD did not ticket the driver, who had a record of violations, and instead labeled him the 'victim.' Hanif called the arrest 'outrageous' and 'police misconduct,' demanding accountability from precinct leadership. She said, 'It is shocking how the NYPD continues to prioritize unlawful and reckless car owners while harassing cyclists and pedestrians at every opportunity.' Legal experts, including White’s attorney Gideon Oliver, questioned the charges and called for dismissal. The case highlights systemic failures in traffic enforcement and police discretion, with vulnerable road users left exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Members Crystal Hudson and Shahana Hanif previously called for DOT to address 'signal timing and unprotected bike lanes.' Community advocates and residents voiced strong support for closing parts of the plaza to traffic and improving infrastructure for people walking and biking. The process includes public meetings, surveys, and a traffic study, with preliminary designs expected in 2024.

Narcisse said, “People are suffering waiting 30 minutes, 40 minutes, it’s unfair to the riders.” She stressed that better bus service could cut down on illegal dollar vans. The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, has started community engagement. Some community boards worry about lost parking, but Rodriguez called their role advisory, saying, “we want to hear what the riders want.” Narcisse acknowledged driver backlash but insisted on the need for faster, reliable transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill targets tourist and luxury flights, sparing only essential services. Noise, pollution, and safety risks drive the move. The city’s airspace faces a reckoning.</p><p class=mb3>On June 27, 2022, Council Member Lincoln Restler and colleagues introduced a bill to ban all non-essential helicopter flights from the Wall Street and East 34th Street city-owned helipads. The legislation, discussed in the City Council, exempts NYPD, news, and hospital helicopters. The bill’s matter title: 'Stop the Chop.' Council Members Amanda Farias, Gale Brewer, Shahana Hanif, Alexa Avilés, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, Christopher Marte, and Carlina Rivera joined as sponsors. Hanif stated, 'Our airspace is not for sale to the highest bidder and should only be available to essential needs of our city.' The bill responds to mounting complaints—nearly 60,000 since 2010—over helicopter noise and pollution. The proposal aims to cut thousands of flights, reduce greenhouse gases, and restore peace to city parks and neighborhoods.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Kids and neighbors get space. Teachers lose parking. Council Member Hanif backs the plaza. Advocates fought for years. The city acts only during school recess. Permanent change remains uncertain.</p><p class=mb3>Council Member Shahana Hanif supports the plan to close Fourth Street, west of Fifth Avenue, to cars from July 8 through Labor Day weekend. The move follows a decade-long push to reclaim the block, used as both a play space and a parking lot for placard-holding teachers. The matter, described as 'a fully reimagined pedestrian plaza,' has backing from Hanif, who said, 'It’s going be a plaza. It’ll be closed off and won’t have parking spaces.' The Park Slope Fifth Avenue BID and Old Stone House plan to apply for permanent plaza status with the Department of Transportation. Advocates like Kathy Park Price cite placard abuse and safety risks, calling for a permanent pedestrian space to expand the park and protect the community. The DOT has not committed to a permanent plan. For now, the street will be car-free only during summer recess.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Parents, workers, and people with disabilities faced threats and exclusion. Council Members Hanif, Joseph, and Hudson demand change. The ban blocks safe routes, targets the vulnerable, and deepens inequality.</p><p class=mb3>This policy debate, highlighted in a June 3, 2022 Streetsblog NYC opinion, centers on the Parks Department's ban on e-assist bikes in Prospect Park. Council Members Shahana Hanif, Rita Joseph, and Crystal Hudson, whose districts border or include the park, call for a new policy to allow e-assist bikes. The article states, 'This policy is discriminatory and ableist, and harmful to climate goals.' Hanif notes e-bikes enabled her to ride after hip surgery. The ban forces riders onto dangerous streets, blocks access for families and people with limited mobility, and invites selective NYPD enforcement. The council members urge Mayor Adams to lift the ban, arguing it closes the park to those who need safe, accessible routes most.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
