Over 2,300 injured.</strong> These are not just numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. In the last twelve months alone, four lives ended on these streets. Five more suffered injuries so grave they may never recover, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the highest price.</strong> An 83-year-old woman was killed by a turning dump truck at Butler and Bond, as shown in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash records</a>. A 16-year-old cyclist was crushed by a box truck at Ditmas and Coney Island Avenue, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>the same data</a>. The old and the young, both struck down while moving through their own city.</p><h3 id=we-need-political-courage>&ldquo;We Need Political Courage&rdquo;</h3><p>Council Member Shahana Hanif has not been silent. She has called out the mayor for &ldquo;undoing street safety&rdquo; and demanded a city that &ldquo;prioritizes pedestrians, and ends these senseless murders,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/08/18/its-22-another-cyclist-has-been-killed-by-another-driver-who-has-not-been-charged>said Hanif</a>. She has co-sponsored <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>bills to force curb extensions</a> at the most dangerous intersections and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>to ban parking near crosswalks</a>. She joined other Brooklyn leaders to <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/17/seven-brooklyn-electeds-join-growing-calls-for-universal-daylighting>demand universal daylighting with hardened materials</a> at every corner.</p><p>But the pace is slow. Bills sit in committee. Paint fades. The city waits.</p><h3 id=the-system-favors-speed-not-safety>The System Favors Speed, Not Safety</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do most of the harm.</strong> In District 39, they are responsible for the vast majority of deaths and injuries, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. Enforcement often falls hardest on cyclists and delivery workers, not the drivers who kill. Hanif has pushed back, calling it &ldquo;unjust&rdquo; to &ldquo;hold cyclists to a far higher standard than motor vehicle drivers,&rdquo; as <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/12/cyclist-launches-class-action-suit-for-bogus-nypd-red-light-tickets>reported here</a>.</p><h3 id=act-now-demand-action-not-excuses>Act Now: Demand Action, Not Excuses</h3><p><strong>Every day, someone else pays the price for delay.</strong> Call Council Member Hanif. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit, curb extensions, and real protection for people on foot and bike. <strong>Do not wait for another name to become a number.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

White, known for representing victims of traffic violence, was charged with criminal mischief for removing plastic that hid a car’s license plate—a tactic often used to dodge cameras and tolls. The NYPD did not ticket the driver, who had a record of violations, and instead labeled him the 'victim.' Hanif called the arrest 'outrageous' and 'police misconduct,' demanding accountability from precinct leadership. She said, 'It is shocking how the NYPD continues to prioritize unlawful and reckless car owners while harassing cyclists and pedestrians at every opportunity.' Legal experts, including White’s attorney Gideon Oliver, questioned the charges and called for dismissal. The case highlights systemic failures in traffic enforcement and police discretion, with vulnerable road users left exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The effort, not yet a formal bill, marks the start of a multiyear process with capital funding. The DOT presented plans to 'create more space for pedestrians and cyclists,' and floated ideas to connect Prospect Park’s northern entrance to the Soldiers Memorial Arch. Council Members Crystal Hudson and Shahana Hanif previously called for DOT to address 'signal timing and unprotected bike lanes.' Community advocates and residents voiced strong support for closing parts of the plaza to traffic and improving infrastructure for people walking and biking. The process includes public meetings, surveys, and a traffic study, with preliminary designs expected in 2024. While some residents worry about car access, the push is clear: less traffic, more safety for the vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, 'Both drivers had looked away.' The listed contributing factor for both vehicles was 'Driver Inattention/Distraction.' The SUV was moving straight ahead, while the sedan was stopped in traffic. The crash shows the danger when drivers lose focus, as distraction led directly to severe harm for vulnerable passengers.

Council Member Shahana Hanif (District 39) and Crystal Hudson pressed DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez to address the plaza’s 'endless traffic, poor sidewalk conditions, broken benches, and overflowing trash cans.' Hanif and Hudson demanded immediate safety upgrades after recent crashes injured pedestrians and cyclists. DOT Deputy Commissioner Eric Beaton said, 'We want to take it to the next level... more consistent and better designed public spaces.' The agency is seeking public feedback and plans to draft detailed designs within the year.

The city moves to act, despite driver backlash and parking fears.</p><p class=mb3>On August 9, 2022, Councilmember Mercedes Narcisse (District 46) endorsed the Flatbush Avenue dedicated bus lane proposal. The plan, a priority for the Adams administration and MTA, aims to speed up the B41 bus from Downtown Brooklyn to Marine Park. Narcisse and Councilmember Rita Joseph joined Mayor Eric Adams at a press conference, riding the B41 and speaking with riders. Narcisse said, “People are suffering waiting 30 minutes, 40 minutes, it’s unfair to the riders.” She stressed that better bus service could cut down on illegal dollar vans. The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, has started community engagement. Some community boards worry about lost parking, but Rodriguez called their role advisory, saying, “we want to hear what the riders want.” Narcisse acknowledged driver backlash but insisted on the need for faster, reliable transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Members Amanda Farias, Gale Brewer, Shahana Hanif, Alexa Avilés, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, Christopher Marte, and Carlina Rivera joined as sponsors. Hanif stated, 'Our airspace is not for sale to the highest bidder and should only be available to essential needs of our city.' The bill responds to mounting complaints—nearly 60,000 since 2010—over helicopter noise and pollution.

Advocates like Kathy Park Price cite placard abuse and safety risks, calling for a permanent pedestrian space to expand the park and protect the community.

The action is not a formal bill, but a policy stance led by Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Council Member Lincoln Restler. The group, including Council Members Jennifer Gutierrez, Crystal Hudson, Chi Osse, Sandy Nurse, Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Rita Joseph, and Farah Louis, demands that developers seeking zoning changes first apply for a special permit to waive parking requirements. Restler said, 'Developers need our consent and approval, and we are telling them, plainly, that they have to file for a special permit to end parking requirements.' Reynoso added, 'You don't need to do that anymore.' Avilés called parking mandates a barrier to affordable housing and climate action. The group argues that parking minimums raise construction costs, encourage car use, and block green space. Restler warned he is 'far more likely to vote no' on projects without a parking waiver.
