One was a child. One was a senior. The numbers do not flinch: 676 people injured, 3 killed, 3 seriously hurt in just twelve months (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Each number is a life. Each life, a family left with silence.

In the last three years, cars and SUVs killed 2 people and injured over 300 more. Trucks and buses killed 1, injured 20. Motorcycles and mopeds, 0 deaths, 8 injuries. Bikes, 0 deaths, 20 injuries.

The city moves on.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Council Member Shahana Hanif has backed bills to daylight intersections, expand bike lanes, and legalize safe crossings. She voted to end jaywalking enforcement, shifting blame away from those on foot. She co-sponsored the push for the SAFE Streets Act and called for speed humps, curb extensions, and bollards. She joined the call for the <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/stop-super-speeders-brooklyn-borough-hall/>Stop Super Speeders bill</a> after a mother and her daughters were killed, saying current enforcement is not enough (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/stop-super-speeders-brooklyn-borough-hall/>brooklynpaper.com</a>).</p><p>But the pace is slow. Bills sit in committee. Streets wait for change. The dead do not wait.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every day without action is a choice. Call Council Member Hanif. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighting at every corner. Demand the city use its new power to slow the cars and save the living.</p><p>Do not wait for another child’s name in the news.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The crash happened where the protected bike lane ends and becomes sharrows, leaving riders unprotected. Council Member Shahana Hanif reported the death and said her office is working with NYPD and NYC DOT. Hanif promised to meet with DOT officials, stating, 'We should not have to live this way.' Transportation Alternatives blamed the street design, saying, 'At the location of this crash, the design of Ninth Street creates dangerous conditions for bike riders.' The area west of Third Avenue lacks protection due to DOT’s decision to preserve parking. From 2020 to 2022, eleven cyclists and six pedestrians were injured on this stretch. The crash exposes the deadly cost of prioritizing car volume and parking over safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

White, known for representing victims of traffic violence, was charged with criminal mischief for removing plastic that hid a car’s license plate—a tactic often used to dodge cameras and tolls. The NYPD did not ticket the driver, who had a record of violations, and instead labeled him the 'victim.' Hanif called the arrest 'outrageous' and 'police misconduct,' demanding accountability from precinct leadership. She said, 'It is shocking how the NYPD continues to prioritize unlawful and reckless car owners while harassing cyclists and pedestrians at every opportunity.' Legal experts, including White’s attorney Gideon Oliver, questioned the charges and called for dismissal. The case highlights systemic failures in traffic enforcement and police discretion, with vulnerable road users left exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Community advocates and residents voiced strong support for closing parts of the plaza to traffic and improving infrastructure for people walking and biking. The process includes public meetings, surveys, and a traffic study, with preliminary designs expected in 2024.

The plan, a priority for the Adams administration and MTA, aims to speed up the B41 bus from Downtown Brooklyn to Marine Park. Narcisse and Councilmember Rita Joseph joined Mayor Eric Adams at a press conference, riding the B41 and speaking with riders. Narcisse said, “People are suffering waiting 30 minutes, 40 minutes, it’s unfair to the riders.” She stressed that better bus service could cut down on illegal dollar vans. The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, has started community engagement. Some community boards worry about lost parking, but Rodriguez called their role advisory, saying, “we want to hear what the riders want.” Narcisse acknowledged driver backlash but insisted on the need for faster, reliable transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Park Slope Fifth Avenue BID and Old Stone House plan to apply for permanent plaza status with the Department of Transportation. Advocates like Kathy Park Price cite placard abuse and safety risks, calling for a permanent pedestrian space to expand the park and protect the community.
