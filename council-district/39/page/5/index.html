One was a child. One was a senior. The numbers do not flinch: 676 people injured, 3 killed, 3 seriously hurt in just twelve months (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Each number is a life. Each life, a family left with silence.

In the last three years, cars and SUVs killed 2 people and injured over 300 more. Trucks and buses killed 1, injured 20. Motorcycles and mopeds, 0 deaths, 8 injuries. Bikes, 0 deaths, 20 injuries.

The city moves on.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Council Member Shahana Hanif has backed bills to daylight intersections, expand bike lanes, and legalize safe crossings. She voted to end jaywalking enforcement, shifting blame away from those on foot. She co-sponsored the push for the SAFE Streets Act and called for speed humps, curb extensions, and bollards. She joined the call for the <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/stop-super-speeders-brooklyn-borough-hall/>Stop Super Speeders bill</a> after a mother and her daughters were killed, saying current enforcement is not enough (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/stop-super-speeders-brooklyn-borough-hall/>brooklynpaper.com</a>).</p><p>But the pace is slow. Bills sit in committee. Streets wait for change. The dead do not wait.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every day without action is a choice. Call Council Member Hanif. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighting at every corner. Demand the city use its new power to slow the cars and save the living.</p><p>Do not wait for another child’s name in the news.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The resolution urges the New York State Legislature and Governor to pass A.5001-A/S.2515-B, which would require scramble crosswalks at intersections near schools during student arrival and dismissal. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, A.5001-A/S.2515-B, in relation to establishing scramble crosswalks leading to and from school buildings during times of student arrival and dismissal.' Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary), Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, Lincoln Restler, and Kevin C. Riley sponsored the measure. The bill responds to persistent crashes near schools and the loss of hundreds of crossing guards. Scramble crosswalks, also called Barnes Dances, stop all traffic so pedestrians cross in every direction. The council’s action highlights the ongoing danger children face on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident left Jacob Priley, a cyclist and advocate, critically injured. Hanif highlighted the intersection’s deadly history, referencing the 2021 death of Arcellie Muschamp. She pressed the Department of Transportation for urgent safety upgrades, saying, 'How many more crashes until the DOT pays attention?' Hanif noted the recent completion of a protected bike lane on Ninth Street but stressed that more action is needed. She thanked neighbors for their support and vowed to work with the DOT. So far in 2023, 3,702 cyclists have been injured and 22 killed on New York City streets.
