One was a child. One was old enough to remember the city before seat belts. In twelve months, 673 people were hurt on the streets of District 39. Two were hurt so badly they may never walk the same.

A 16-year-old cyclist crushed by a turning truck at Coney Island and Ditmas. An 83-year-old woman struck by a dump truck on Butler Street. A 74-year-old woman killed by an SUV at 14th Avenue and 39th Street. The details are always the same: a body, a street, a driver who keeps breathing.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Council Member Shahana Hanif has signed her name to bills that could save lives. She co-sponsored laws to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>speed up protected bike lanes</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>add curb extensions</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>. She stood with others to <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/17/seven-brooklyn-electeds-join-growing-calls-for-universal-daylighting>demand physical barriers at corners</a> and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/18/dot-continues-to-ignore-dangers-it-created-on-brooklyns-4th-ave>restore bike lanes erased by city construction</a>. She backed the <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/stop-super-speeders-brooklyn-borough-hall/>Stop Super Speeders bill</a> after a mother and her daughters were killed in Gravesend. She is not silent. But the city moves slow. Paint instead of concrete. Promises instead of barricades. The dead do not wait.</p><h3 id=what-next-the-work-left-undone>What Next: The Work Left Undone</h3><p><strong>The carnage continues.</strong> In the last year, crashes rose. Injuries rose. Deaths doubled. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has the power to daylight every corner. It has the power to build real protection for people on foot and bike. It does not use it fast enough.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand action.</strong> Tell Shahana Hanif and every official: No more delays. No more paint. No more children in the road. The next life lost could be yours. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On February 10, 2023, eighteen Brooklyn lawmakers issued a joint letter demanding New York State Department of Transportation (DOT) participate in comprehensive planning for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens. Jabari Brisport, Julia Salazar, Kristen Gonzalez, Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Members Bobby Carroll, Maritza Davila, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Emily Gallagher, Jo Anne Simon, Marcela Mitaynes, and Council Members Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Lincoln Restler. Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint. Without state action, only city-owned segments see attention. The city’s efforts are limited. The state’s inaction leaves systemic danger unaddressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They say the rule punishes workers and families. E-bikes are legal on city streets. The ban blocks access and forces riders into danger elsewhere.</p><p class=mb3>On December 22, 2022, Councilmember Rita Joseph (District 40) joined Crystal Hudson and Shahana Hanif in urging the Parks Department to repeal the Prospect Park e-bike ban. The matter, titled 'Brooklyn pols call for repeal of Prospect Park e-bike ban,' highlights how the current policy keeps e-bikers out of the park, even after citywide legalization. The councilmembers wrote, 'E-bike users include delivery workers who keep us fed, families on cargo bikes, individuals recovering from surgery, older adults, people who live in areas with fewer public transit options, those who want to limit their carbon footprint by not driving cars, and so many more.' They argue the ban unfairly targets vulnerable riders and blocks access for those who rely on e-bikes for work and daily life. The Parks Department’s stance forces e-bike users onto more dangerous streets, undermining safety and equity. The councilmembers call for a new, inclusive policy shaped by community input.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

White, known for representing victims of traffic violence, was charged with criminal mischief for removing plastic that hid a car’s license plate—a tactic often used to dodge cameras and tolls. The NYPD did not ticket the driver, who had a record of violations, and instead labeled him the 'victim.' Hanif called the arrest 'outrageous' and 'police misconduct,' demanding accountability from precinct leadership. She said, 'It is shocking how the NYPD continues to prioritize unlawful and reckless car owners while harassing cyclists and pedestrians at every opportunity.' Legal experts, including White’s attorney Gideon Oliver, questioned the charges and called for dismissal. The case highlights systemic failures in traffic enforcement and police discretion, with vulnerable road users left exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Members Crystal Hudson and Shahana Hanif previously called for DOT to address 'signal timing and unprotected bike lanes.' Community advocates and residents voiced strong support for closing parts of the plaza to traffic and improving infrastructure for people walking and biking. The process includes public meetings, surveys, and a traffic study, with preliminary designs expected in 2024. While some residents worry about car access, the push is clear: less traffic, more safety for the vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
