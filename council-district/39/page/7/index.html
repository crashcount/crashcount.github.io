One was a child. One was old enough to remember the city before seat belts. In twelve months, 673 people were hurt on the streets of District 39. Two were hurt so badly they may never walk the same. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p><strong>Cars and trucks do most of the killing.</strong> SUVs, sedans, trucks, and taxis. A 16-year-old cyclist crushed by a turning truck at Coney Island and Ditmas. An 83-year-old woman struck by a dump truck on Butler Street. A 74-year-old woman killed by an SUV at 14th Avenue and 39th Street. The details are always the same: a body, a street, a driver who keeps breathing.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Council Member Shahana Hanif has signed her name to bills that could save lives. She co-sponsored laws to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>speed up protected bike lanes</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>add curb extensions</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>. She stood with others to <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/17/seven-brooklyn-electeds-join-growing-calls-for-universal-daylighting>demand physical barriers at corners</a> and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/18/dot-continues-to-ignore-dangers-it-created-on-brooklyns-4th-ave>restore bike lanes erased by city construction</a>. She backed the <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/stop-super-speeders-brooklyn-borough-hall/>Stop Super Speeders bill</a> after a mother and her daughters were killed in Gravesend. She is not silent. But the city moves slow. Paint instead of concrete. Promises instead of barricades. The dead do not wait.</p><h3 id=what-next-the-work-left-undone>What Next: The Work Left Undone</h3><p><strong>The carnage continues.</strong> In the last year, crashes rose. Injuries rose. Deaths doubled. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has the power to daylight every corner. It has the power to build real protection for people on foot and bike. It does not use it fast enough.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand action.</strong> Tell Shahana Hanif and every official: No more delays. No more paint. No more children in the road. The next life lost could be yours. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The move follows a decade-long push to reclaim the block, used as both a play space and a parking lot for placard-holding teachers. The matter, described as 'a fully reimagined pedestrian plaza,' has backing from Hanif, who said, 'It’s going be a plaza. It’ll be closed off and won’t have parking spaces.' The Park Slope Fifth Avenue BID and Old Stone House plan to apply for permanent plaza status with the Department of Transportation. Advocates like Kathy Park Price cite placard abuse and safety risks, calling for a permanent pedestrian space to expand the park and protect the community. The DOT has not committed to a permanent plan.

Restler said, 'Developers need our consent and approval, and we are telling them, plainly, that they have to file for a special permit to end parking requirements.' Reynoso added, 'You don't need to do that anymore.' Avilés called parking mandates a barrier to affordable housing and climate action. The group argues that parking minimums raise construction costs, encourage car use, and block green space. Restler warned he is 'far more likely to vote no' on projects without a parking waiver. Advocates and policy experts back the move, and related state legislation is pending.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Darlene Mealy sponsored the resolution, joined by Brannan, Menin, Louis, Yeger, Hanif, Hudson, Marte, Joseph, Riley, and Brooks-Powers. The resolution was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. Only 117 out of 493 subway stations are accessible.

Brannan led sponsorship, joined by Ayala, Menin, Louis, Hanif, Hudson, Bottcher, Farías, Brooks-Powers, and Brewer. The resolution slams service caps and fare surcharges, calling them 'inequitable and unjust.' It demands that paratransit users get the same fare, hours, and ride freedom as subway and bus riders. The bill would end rationing and financial barriers for disabled New Yorkers who rely on Access-A-Ride.

The incident, covered by Streetsblog, exposed how reporting traffic violations can put New Yorkers at risk. City Hall called the harassment 'extremely disturbing' and promised to review a Department of Investigation probe, but did not commit to changing NYPD’s handling of 311 complaints. Assembly Member Robert Carroll condemned the threats and demanded accountability if city staff leaked Melone’s information. Council Member Shahana Hanif echoed concern, urging that harassment not silence those reporting dangerous driving. The NYPD did not comment. The city’s lack of action leaves vulnerable road users exposed, as illegal parking blocks sightlines, sidewalks, and bike lanes, endangering lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Hanif, representing the district where Muschamp died, pledges to fight for safer streets. She calls for preventive design—daylighting, mid-block chicanes, leading pedestrian intervals, pedestrian-only crossings, and safety islands. Hanif opposes relying on punitive enforcement, saying, 'Planning streets for people means designs that force drivers to drive slowly and carefully.' She urges the Council and new administration to act, stating, 'Our streets are dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists because they are planned for cars, not people.'
