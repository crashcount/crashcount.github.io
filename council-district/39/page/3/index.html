One was a child. One was old enough to remember the city before seat belts. In twelve months, 673 people were hurt on the streets of District 39. Two were hurt so badly they may never walk the same. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p><strong>Cars and trucks do most of the killing.</strong> SUVs, sedans, trucks, and taxis. A 16-year-old cyclist crushed by a turning truck at Coney Island and Ditmas. An 83-year-old woman struck by a dump truck on Butler Street. A 74-year-old woman killed by an SUV at 14th Avenue and 39th Street. The details are always the same: a body, a street, a driver who keeps breathing.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Council Member Shahana Hanif has signed her name to bills that could save lives. She co-sponsored laws to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>speed up protected bike lanes</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>add curb extensions</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>. She stood with others to <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/17/seven-brooklyn-electeds-join-growing-calls-for-universal-daylighting>demand physical barriers at corners</a> and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/18/dot-continues-to-ignore-dangers-it-created-on-brooklyns-4th-ave>restore bike lanes erased by city construction</a>. She backed the <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/stop-super-speeders-brooklyn-borough-hall/>Stop Super Speeders bill</a> after a mother and her daughters were killed in Gravesend. She is not silent. But the city moves slow. Paint instead of concrete. Promises instead of barricades. The dead do not wait.</p><h3 id=what-next-the-work-left-undone>What Next: The Work Left Undone</h3><p><strong>The carnage continues.</strong> In the last year, crashes rose. Injuries rose. Deaths doubled. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has the power to daylight every corner. It has the power to build real protection for people on foot and bike. It does not use it fast enough.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand action.</strong> Tell Shahana Hanif and every official: No more delays. No more paint. No more children in the road. The next life lost could be yours. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

They called for 'universal daylighting with hardened materials such as boulders, planters, and bike corrals' at intersections. The officials cited recent fatal crashes and urged the city to opt into a state law banning parking within 20 feet of corners. They want federal funds used for these changes. The group opposes DOT’s slow pace and reliance on paint, demanding physical barriers. Community board leaders and advocates support the move. DOT says it will review the letter and remains committed to evidence-based daylighting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
