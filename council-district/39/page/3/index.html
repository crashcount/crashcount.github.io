One was a child. One was a senior. The numbers do not flinch: 676 people injured, 3 killed, 3 seriously hurt in just twelve months (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Each number is a life. Each life, a family left with silence.

In the last three years, cars and SUVs killed 2 people and injured over 300 more. Trucks and buses killed 1, injured 20. Motorcycles and mopeds, 0 deaths, 8 injuries. Bikes, 0 deaths, 20 injuries. The pattern is clear. The bigger the vehicle, the greater the risk. The city counts the bodies. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Council Member Shahana Hanif has backed bills to daylight intersections, expand bike lanes, and legalize safe crossings. She voted to end jaywalking enforcement, shifting blame away from those on foot. She co-sponsored the push for the SAFE Streets Act and called for speed humps, curb extensions, and bollards. She joined the call for the <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/stop-super-speeders-brooklyn-borough-hall/>Stop Super Speeders bill</a> after a mother and her daughters were killed, saying current enforcement is not enough (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/stop-super-speeders-brooklyn-borough-hall/>brooklynpaper.com</a>).</p><p>But the pace is slow. Bills sit in committee. Streets wait for change. The dead do not wait.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every day without action is a choice. Call Council Member Hanif. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighting at every corner. Demand the city use its new power to slow the cars and save the living.</p><p>Do not wait for another child’s name in the news.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The letter called the block a 'missing link in Brooklyn’s protected bike lane network.' Brooklyn Community Board 2 backed the demand.

Hanif’s action: gathering input and relaying concerns to the Department of Transportation (DOT) before a final decision. The survey showed strong public support—455 out of 489 respondents favored the program—but merchant opinions split. Some praised increased foot traffic and sales; others reported steep losses. Critics cited business access, traffic, and e-bike safety. Merchants petitioned Hanif and DOT for a thorough review and recovery plan.

These devices cap speed at 5 mph over the limit for those with 11 or more license points in 24 months or six camera tickets in a year. The rally followed a fatal Gravesend crash that killed a mother and her two daughters. Hanif and other lawmakers called current enforcement—ticketing, suspensions, fines, jail—ineffective. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon said, 'The speed limiter technology is available to us. Let’s use it. It will save lives.' The bill is modeled on EU and Virginia laws.
