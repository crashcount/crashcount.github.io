Over 2,300 injured.</strong> These are not just numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. In the last twelve months alone, four lives ended on these streets. Five more suffered injuries so grave they may never recover, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the highest price.</strong> An 83-year-old woman was killed by a turning dump truck at Butler and Bond, as shown in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash records</a>. A 16-year-old cyclist was crushed by a box truck at Ditmas and Coney Island Avenue, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>the same data</a>. The old and the young, both struck down while moving through their own city.</p><h3 id=we-need-political-courage>&ldquo;We Need Political Courage&rdquo;</h3><p>Council Member Shahana Hanif has not been silent. She has called out the mayor for &ldquo;undoing street safety&rdquo; and demanded a city that &ldquo;prioritizes pedestrians, and ends these senseless murders,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/08/18/its-22-another-cyclist-has-been-killed-by-another-driver-who-has-not-been-charged>said Hanif</a>. She has co-sponsored <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>bills to force curb extensions</a> at the most dangerous intersections and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>to ban parking near crosswalks</a>. She joined other Brooklyn leaders to <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/17/seven-brooklyn-electeds-join-growing-calls-for-universal-daylighting>demand universal daylighting with hardened materials</a> at every corner.</p><p>But the pace is slow. Bills sit in committee. Paint fades. The city waits.</p><h3 id=the-system-favors-speed-not-safety>The System Favors Speed, Not Safety</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do most of the harm.</strong> In District 39, they are responsible for the vast majority of deaths and injuries, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. Enforcement often falls hardest on cyclists and delivery workers, not the drivers who kill. Hanif has pushed back, calling it &ldquo;unjust&rdquo; to &ldquo;hold cyclists to a far higher standard than motor vehicle drivers,&rdquo; as <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/12/cyclist-launches-class-action-suit-for-bogus-nypd-red-light-tickets>reported here</a>.</p><h3 id=act-now-demand-action-not-excuses>Act Now: Demand Action, Not Excuses</h3><p><strong>Every day, someone else pays the price for delay.</strong> Call Council Member Hanif. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit, curb extensions, and real protection for people on foot and bike. <strong>Do not wait for another name to become a number.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter summary states: 'A class action lawsuit has been filed in federal court against the NYPD for issuing red light tickets and criminal summonses to cyclists who legally proceed through intersections during the pedestrian 'Walk' signal, as allowed by a law in effect since 2019.' Brooklyn Council Member Shahana Hanif is exploring ways for the City Council to restore civil, not criminal, summonses.

Yarimi told first responders she was 'possessed' at the time. The report highlights her suspended license and excessive speed, both clear driver errors.

The letter called the block a 'missing link in Brooklyn’s protected bike lane network.' Brooklyn Community Board 2 backed the demand. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and Borough Commissioner Keith Bray offered only vague replies. The block’s exclusion traces to a mayoral advisor’s intervention for developer Two Trees. Advocates like Kathy Park Price slammed the city: 'Private interests are able to redesign our streets, prioritizing vehicles over safety at a critical corridor.' Despite unanimous support, DOT keeps the street dangerous. The city’s inaction leaves cyclists exposed and the community frustrated.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'Merchants call for compromise as Park Slope Open Streets program faces scrutiny,' centers on the proposed closure of Fifth Avenue every Saturday from May to October. Hanif’s action: gathering input and relaying concerns to the Department of Transportation (DOT) before a final decision. The survey showed strong public support—455 out of 489 respondents favored the program—but merchant opinions split. Some praised increased foot traffic and sales; others reported steep losses. Critics cited business access, traffic, and e-bike safety. Merchants petitioned Hanif and DOT for a thorough review and recovery plan. Community Board 6’s Mike Racioppo recommended proper funding and expansion. The DOT has not yet ruled.

The bill, sponsored in Albany by State Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, would require drivers with repeated violations to install intelligent speed assistance (ISA) devices. These devices cap speed at 5 mph over the limit for those with 11 or more license points in 24 months or six camera tickets in a year. The rally followed a fatal Gravesend crash that killed a mother and her two daughters. Hanif and other lawmakers called current enforcement—ticketing, suspensions, fines, jail—ineffective. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon said, 'The speed limiter technology is available to us. Let’s use it. It will save lives.' The bill is modeled on EU and Virginia laws.
