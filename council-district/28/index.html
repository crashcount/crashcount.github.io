The article states, "Forcing horses to pound the pavement with heavy carriages in Midtown, where they compete with motor vehicles, bicyclists and pedestrians, is inhumane." Seventeen council members, led by Robert Holden (bill sponsor) and Erik Bottcher (district includes stables), support the ban. Speaker Adrienne Adams has blocked a hearing and vote. The piece highlights recent incidents where bolting horses injured at least four people, including a pedicab driver. Despite the vivid danger, the safety analyst notes: "The event text does not describe any policy or legislative change affecting pedestrians or cyclists, so there is no direct impact on their safety." The bill remains stalled in committee, with no relief for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, described as a 'much-compromised redesign,' keeps two car lanes, scraps a bus lane, and offers no space for cyclists. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called it a 'pedestrian-first corridor,' but critics, including Riders Alliance spokesman Danny Pearlstein, slammed the move as a 'huge corporate giveaway at New Yorkers' expense.' The redesign widens sidewalks and adds planters and seating, but cars still dominate. Council members and advocates oppose the car-first approach. According to safety analysts, the event only mentions the redesign and its cost, without specifying design features or their effects on vulnerable road users; therefore, the safety impact cannot be determined from the information provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Speaker Adrienne Adams and Mayor Adams are starting budget talks. Council spokesperson Julia Agos called Open Streets 'critical components of our city's public realm.' The Department of Transportation said suggestions will be reviewed. Volunteer groups handle most operations, but stalled redesigns and lack of resources threaten the program’s survival.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She blocks bike and bus lanes, backs car interests, and weakens outdoor dining. Under her, the Council ignores reckless drivers and fails to enforce safety laws. Vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>This report examines Council Speaker Adrienne Adams’s record on transportation policy as of March 9, 2025. The Council, under Adams, has passed few street safety bills and instead focused on parking and car-friendly measures. The article states, "Speaker Adams has accomplished far less than her recent predecessors... on expanding bus and bike lanes and making city streets safer for pedestrians and cyclists." Adams has supported e-bike registration, which experts warn would harm delivery workers and street safety. She has not acted to hold reckless drivers accountable after the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program expired and has not used Council powers to lower speed limits. Adams oversaw an outdoor dining law that restricted the program, leading to fewer participating restaurants. She has not enforced the Streets Master Plan benchmarks or sued the mayor for noncompliance. Her actions have left vulnerable road users exposed and slowed the city’s progress on Vision Zero.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states the SUV 'slammed into a sedan’s rear,' crushing the 35-year-old woman driving the sedan. She remained conscious but suffered severe back injuries as her seatbelt held her in place while the force of the crash broke her spine. The police report identifies 'Following Too Closely' as the contributing factor, highlighting the SUV driver's failure to maintain a safe distance. No other contributing factors are cited for the victim. The impact crumpled the sedan’s center back end and the SUV’s front, underscoring the destructive consequences of tailgating on city highways.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
