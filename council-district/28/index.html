Thirty-nine suffered wounds so grave they may never walk the same. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders.

She never made it to the other side. On Rockaway Boulevard, a 23-year-old man died at the intersection. The car was a BMW.

But the carnage continues. <strong>No law has yet slowed the cars or stopped the blood.</strong></p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate.

He slammed into Justin Diaz’s car. Diaz died on his way to work. The driver, high and drunk, now walks free on bail. The street remembers the impact.</p><p class=mb3>ABC7 reported on May 2, 2025, that Michael Peña, a former FDNY probationary firefighter, was released on $75,000 bail after a deadly Queens crash. Police allege Peña was 'drunk and high on cocaine and marijuana' and speeding at 83 mph when he 'ran a red light and T-boned a car driven by 24-year-old Justin Diaz.' The crash happened at Northern Boulevard and East 107th Street as Diaz drove to work. Prosecutors cited Peña’s firing from the FDNY and prior legal issues to argue for remand, but the appellate court released him with minimal bail conditions. Peña faces manslaughter and other charges, with a possible 15-year sentence if convicted. The case highlights the lethal risk of impaired, reckless driving and the limits of pretrial detention policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
