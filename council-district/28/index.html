Sponsored by Queens Councilman Robert Holden, the bill sits in the health committee, chaired by Lynn Schulman. Speaker Adrienne Adams has not stated her position. The bill, described as a push to end the city’s carriage industry, gained attention after the death of a horse named Lady. Animal rights groups rallied, warning, 'Without a ban there will be more crashes in traffic, there will be more injuries and possibly deaths.' TWU Local 100 opposes the ban.
