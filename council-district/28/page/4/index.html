Thirty-six left with serious injuries.</strong> More than 3,300 hurt since 2022. The streets are not safe for the old, the young, or anyone on foot or bike. Linden Boulevard, Belt Parkway, Rockaway, Lefferts—names that echo with sirens and loss.</p><p>A man with a cane tried to cross Linden. He never made it home. &ldquo;Today is a sad day.

The move shifted Restler, known for championing safe streets, to chair the Governmental Operations, State and Federal Legislation Committee. The matter summary notes Restler's intent to remain active: 'I am reintroducing 501, the citizen reporting bill, and will push as hard as I can to get it over the finish line.' Restler has sponsored bills to curb illegal parking, speed up bike lane installations, and fight placard abuse. Despite his removal, advocates and colleagues, including Jon Orcutt, voiced confidence that Restler will continue to fight for pedestrian and cyclist safety. The committee change may slow progress on key safety bills, but Restler's record and resolve remain strong.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets shift, but cars still win cold months.</p><p class=mb3>On August 3, 2023, the New York City Council passed a bill to make outdoor dining permanent, but with limits. The measure, approved 34-11, moves through the Council and awaits Mayor Adams’s signature. The bill states: 'curbside set-ups were designed to be temporary and should not be in the permanent program.' Council Member Marjorie Velázquez, the bill’s sponsor, said, 'We want to strike a chord and a balance and this is it.' Speaker Adrienne Adams backed the winter pause. Council Member Chi Ossé voted yes, but noted hardship for small businesses. The law allows sidewalk seating all year, but curbside dining only from April to November. Fees apply, and old sheds must go by November 2024. The Department of Transportation will set design rules. Advocates call the bill historic but incomplete, as curb space returns to cars in winter, limiting gains for people on foot and bike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, supported by Council Members Tiffany Caban and Shahana Hanif, aims to 'greenlight pedestrians to freely cross streets outside the crosswalk or without obeying traffic signals.' The bill responds to claims of biased enforcement against Black and Latino New Yorkers. Council Majority Leader Joseph Borelli and Councilwoman Joann Ariola oppose the bill, warning it could endanger pedestrians. The bill has not yet advanced to committee or received a hearing. The NYPD and Mayor's office are reviewing the legislation. The debate highlights the tension between enforcement fairness and the ongoing risk to vulnerable road users.

Councilmember Rita C. Joseph, sponsor of the senior zones bill, said, 'It is our duty as this Council to take action to protect our most vulnerable residents.' Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, sponsor of the crash data bill, said the legislation 'would increase transparency, aid collaboration and help prevent traffic violence.'
