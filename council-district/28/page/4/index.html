Thirty-six left with serious injuries.</strong> More than 3,300 hurt since 2022. The streets are not safe for the old, the young, or anyone on foot or bike. Linden Boulevard, Belt Parkway, Rockaway, Lefferts—names that echo with sirens and loss.</p><p>A man with a cane tried to cross Linden. He never made it home. &ldquo;Today is a sad day.

The study, cited by Council Speaker Adrienne Adams (District 28), warns, '2024 is on pace to be the deadliest year for traffic violence in the Vision Zero era, which should alarm all New Yorkers.' Adams expressed deep concern and urged the city to hold the line on past safety gains. The report, from Transportation Alternatives and Families for Safe Streets, blames the spike on policy failures, especially the cancellation of congestion pricing. Advocates demand immediate action: congestion pricing, more bike lanes, and daylighting intersections. The Department of Transportation promises visibility upgrades at 1,000 intersections and speed reductions under Sammy's Law. But the numbers are stark: 127 killed in six months, a record.

The Council and DOT hold the power. Advocates say language matters. Streets remain deadly. Action lags. Lives hang in balance.</p><p class=mb3>On May 8, 2024, Mayor Eric Adams publicly supported lowering speed limits after the passage of 'Sammy’s Law,' which allows New York City to reduce limits to 20 mph on most roads. The law, passed in the state budget, excludes wide, multi-lane roads in the outer boroughs. Adams said, 'I do believe as New Yorkers we need to slow down,' but repeatedly referred to preventable crashes as 'accidents,' a term advocates reject for removing driver responsibility. The City Council must legislate any citywide speed limit change, while the Department of Transportation (DOT) can adjust limits on specific streets after community input. Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers and Speaker Adrienne Adams pledged to 'collaborate and negotiate' with City Hall. Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi stressed the need for street redesign and legal reform, noting, 'This is not a problem that goes away on its own.' Despite new authority, the Adams administration has lagged on safe street infrastructure. The city faces its deadliest start to a year in the Vision Zero era, with 60 killed in the first quarter.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Promises broken.</p><p class=mb3>On April 25, 2024, Streetsblog NYC reported a grim milestone: the first quarter of 2024 saw 60 traffic deaths in New York City, the highest since Vision Zero began in 2014. The report, titled 'Road Violence Hits Record in First Quarter of 2024,' highlights that 'twice as many bike riders were killed compared to the average Vision Zero first quarter, and most were not in protected bike lanes.' Council Speaker Adrienne Adams called for monthly DOT updates to address the shortfall in protected bike and bus lane construction. Transportation Alternatives Executive Director Danny Harris urged the city to meet the legal mandates of the Streets Plan, stating, 'Every single one of these deaths was preventable.' The Adams administration faces criticism for failing to deliver required safety infrastructure, with only 58.2 miles of protected bike lanes and 9.6 miles of bus lanes built, far short of legal mandates. Most cyclist and pedestrian deaths occurred on streets lacking safety measures, and SUVs were involved in the majority of fatalities. The city’s failure to daylight intersections and build protected lanes continues to endanger vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, now before the Council, would replace the current annual reporting—often delayed—with monthly updates on bus lanes, bike lanes, and public space benchmarks. The matter summary states: 'Speaker Adams wants a tracker to make sure Mayor Adams follows the law.' Adams sponsors the bill, citing the DOT’s failure to meet legal mandates for two years running. In 2023, DOT built only 32 of 50 required bike lane miles and 5.2 of the mandated bus lane miles. Advocacy groups Transportation Alternatives and Riders Alliance support the tracker, calling it a tool for accountability and enforcement. DOT objects, citing project pacing. Speaker Adams signals she may pursue legal action if the city fails to comply.

The DOT failed to meet 2023’s legal benchmarks: just 5.2 miles of protected bus lanes built out of 30 required, and 32 miles of protected bike lanes out of 50 mandated by 2019 law. Council Member Chi Ossé (District 36) was mentioned, but only six of 51 council members responded to DOT’s call for safety project suggestions. The matter centers on the DOT’s report and council inaction: 'Out of 51 City Council members, only six responded to a request from DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez for recommended locations where street safety improvements should be made in their districts.' Mayor Adams slashed DOT’s budget and weakened projects, while council leaders deflected responsibility. Advocates like Jon Orcutt and Elizabeth Adams demanded decisive action, warning that delays and excuses cost lives. More than half of New Yorkers remain far from protected bike lanes as daily cycling surges. The city’s vulnerable road users remain at risk while officials pass the buck.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
