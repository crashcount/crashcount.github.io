Harden turns and add leading pedestrian intervals at the crosswalks along Rockaway Boulevard and 111th Avenue.

The city can set safer limits under Sammy’s Law. Make 20 mph the default where people walk. Install intelligent speed controls on cars that rack up tickets and points, as proposed in Albany.
