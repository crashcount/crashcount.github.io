Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>Sammy’s Law, named for 12-year-old Sammy Cohen Eckstein, would let New York City lower speed limits below 25 mph. The bill failed to enter the 2023 state budget, shifting responsibility to the City Council. In 2021, the Council backed a home rule message 42-6, but the Assembly blocked it. Last year, the Council reversed course and failed to pass the message. This session, Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez introduced a resolution urging passage, with 10 sponsors. Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers must hold a hearing before a vote. Speaker Adrienne Adams and Brooks-Powers have not signed on, citing negotiations. The bill’s summary states: 'Life-saving legislation that would allow New York City to set speed limits below 25 miles per hour failed to make it into this year's state budget.' Data show slower speeds save lives. Advocates and victims’ families keep pushing. The Council’s inaction keeps streets dangerous.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The mayor must now sign.</p><p class=mb3>On April 27, 2023, the New York City Council passed a slate of transportation safety bills. The measures, now headed to Mayor Eric Adams, require the Department of Transportation to report on traffic violence more often and to install traffic calming devices in areas with many senior pedestrians. The matter summary reads: 'Traffic calming devices that are designed to slow down traffic will now be mandated in parts of the five boroughs where a large number of senior citizens reside as the city plans to speed up part of its response to serious and fatal car crashes.' Speaker Adrienne Adams voted for the bills, stating, 'It's important that the Council advance equitable policies like the legislation we're voting on today to ensure that all New Yorkers can live, work and commute on safer streets.' Councilmember Rita C. Joseph, sponsor of the senior zones bill, said, 'It is our duty as this Council to take action to protect our most vulnerable residents.' Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, sponsor of the crash data bill, said the legislation 'would increase transparency, aid collaboration and help prevent traffic violence.' Both bills passed unanimously.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, named for Sammy Cohen Eckstein, killed by a reckless driver in 2013, has stalled in Albany despite mounting pressure. Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez introduced a resolution urging passage, co-sponsored by Shahana Hanif and Lincoln Restler. Adams, however, said, 'We’re going to let the state do what the state does in response to Sammy’s Law,' and focused on other budget priorities. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, chair of the Transportation Committee, called for pairing lower speed limits with street redesigns in neglected neighborhoods. As children and cyclists die in record numbers, the council’s inaction leaves vulnerable New Yorkers at risk. The law would not lower limits automatically, but grant the city authority to act.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Council’s $2.7-billion proposal calls for a near-doubling of Fair Fares funding, $3 million for a battery swap and fire outreach program for delivery workers, and $45.1 million more for road paving. The Council also demands increased investment in street safety infrastructure, especially in communities of color facing high crash rates. Brooks-Powers said, 'New Yorkers deserve access to high-quality services and investments in infrastructure citywide.' Council Member Keith Powers called the battery swap program a 'down payment.' The Council’s push aims to restore cuts and address deadly street conditions. City Hall, citing fiscal pressures, remains cautious but open to negotiation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
