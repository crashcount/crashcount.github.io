Thirty-six more are left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, crashes have climbed. Injuries are up by <strong>20%</strong>. Four people have died since January. These are not just numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. The man on Linden Boulevard, crushed by an SUV. The scooter rider on 116th Avenue, thrown to the ground and gone before sunrise. The moped riders in Jamaica, broken in the street. The cyclist, Amanda Servedio, struck and killed while coming home from a ride. She &ldquo;went airborne. She flew like 30 feet. It was a lot of force,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>a witness told the Daily News</a>.</p><h3 id=the-system-fails-the-vulnerable>The System Fails the Vulnerable</h3><p><strong>Most deaths come at the hands of cars and SUVs.</strong> In three years, cars and SUVs killed four, left five with grave wounds, and hurt hundreds. Trucks and buses add to the toll. Motorcycles and mopeds, too. Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price. The city’s own data shows the pattern: drivers turning left, speeding, not yielding, not seeing. The city blames the dead for crossing wrong. But only one person ends up in the morgue.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-silence>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Silence</h3><p>Council Member Adrienne Adams has voted for some safety bills. She backed the law that <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalized jaywalking</a>, ending a policy that punished the vulnerable. She called for more <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-council-passes-bills-on-traffic-crashes-senior-pedestrian-zones>traffic calming in senior zones</a>: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important that the Council advance equitable policies&mldr; to ensure that all New Yorkers can live, work and commute on safer streets.&rdquo; But when it comes to the <strong>citywide 20 mph speed limit</strong>, she has not led. She has called out the city for missing safety targets, but the pace is slow. The blood keeps coming.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day the council delays, another family is broken. <strong>Call Council Member Adrienne Adams. Demand a citywide 20 mph limit. Demand protected bike lanes, daylighted corners, and real enforcement against reckless drivers.</strong> Join with others. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The street will not forgive silence.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable. The law marks a shift: streets are for people, not just cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law.
