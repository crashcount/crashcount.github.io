Thirty-six more are left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, crashes have climbed. Injuries are up by <strong>20%</strong>. Four people have died since January. These are not just numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. The man on Linden Boulevard, crushed by an SUV. The scooter rider on 116th Avenue, thrown to the ground and gone before sunrise. The moped riders in Jamaica, broken in the street. The cyclist, Amanda Servedio, struck and killed while coming home from a ride. She &ldquo;went airborne. She flew like 30 feet. It was a lot of force,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>a witness told the Daily News</a>.</p><h3 id=the-system-fails-the-vulnerable>The System Fails the Vulnerable</h3><p><strong>Most deaths come at the hands of cars and SUVs.</strong> In three years, cars and SUVs killed four, left five with grave wounds, and hurt hundreds. Trucks and buses add to the toll. Motorcycles and mopeds, too. Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price. The city’s own data shows the pattern: drivers turning left, speeding, not yielding, not seeing. The city blames the dead for crossing wrong. But only one person ends up in the morgue.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-silence>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Silence</h3><p>Council Member Adrienne Adams has voted for some safety bills. She backed the law that <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalized jaywalking</a>, ending a policy that punished the vulnerable. She called for more <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-council-passes-bills-on-traffic-crashes-senior-pedestrian-zones>traffic calming in senior zones</a>: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important that the Council advance equitable policies&mldr; to ensure that all New Yorkers can live, work and commute on safer streets.&rdquo; But when it comes to the <strong>citywide 20 mph speed limit</strong>, she has not led. She has called out the city for missing safety targets, but the pace is slow. The blood keeps coming.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day the council delays, another family is broken. <strong>Call Council Member Adrienne Adams. Demand a citywide 20 mph limit. Demand protected bike lanes, daylighted corners, and real enforcement against reckless drivers.</strong> Join with others. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The street will not forgive silence.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The session saw progressives sidelined as the Council prioritized car-centric bills, including Intros 103 and 104 (parking protection) and hearings on Intro 606 (e-bike registration). The Common Sense Caucus, known for opposing bike lanes and congestion pricing, led the charge. Progressive members lost key committee seats. Universal daylighting (Intro 1138) and other safety reforms stalled. Council Member Julie Won continued to push for daylighting but faced resistance. As Streetsblog reported, 'roadway safety is simply not a priority.' Advocates and former members criticized the Council for failing to hold the mayor accountable on the Streets Master Plan and for focusing on parking over safety.

The crash occurred at 21:33. The report states both drivers were inattentive or distracted at the time of the collision. The pedestrian suffered fatal injuries, including a shattered pelvis and internal bleeding, and died at the scene. The police report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor for both vehicles. The victim was crossing without a signal, but this is only mentioned after the drivers' failures. The impact and aftermath are described in stark terms: 'Her pelvis shattered. Internal bleeding. She died on the street. Both drivers were distracted.' The sequence of events and the cited driver errors underscore the systemic danger faced by pedestrians on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The article highlighted both progress and setbacks, stating: 'The 2024 Streetsie Awards by Streetsblog NYC review the year's best and worst in NYC transportation policy, highlighting key events, policies, and political actors.' Key actions included the City Council decriminalizing jaywalking and cutting mandatory parking minimums, though low-density areas were left out. Council Member Lincoln Restler lost his Transportation Committee seat despite pushing for citizen enforcement against illegal parking. Speaker Adrienne Adams, Comptroller Brad Lander, and Mayor Adams were all named for missed promises or weak follow-through. Sanitation Commissioner Jessica Tisch’s crackdown on ghost plates drew praise. The review called out Gov. Hochul for delaying congestion pricing, then reversing course. The NYPD faced criticism for ignoring placard abuse and Vision Zero, and for deadly high-speed chases. The piece underscored the need for accountability and stronger action to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as a demand to 'pause' the program due to 'sidewalks allegedly rendered impassible by the micromobility devices,' reflects Adams's concerns about scooters left on sidewalks and streets. She stated, 'My constituents have consistently raised questions and concerns about the safety hazards created when e-scooters are frequently left on sidewalks and streets, obstructing pedestrians and all road users.' Adams's stance opposes the current e-scooter share and expansion of micromobility options, but supports stronger regulation and enforcement. The Department of Transportation and advocates highlight the program's success, with nearly 500,000 trips since launch, and argue for better infrastructure instead of a ban.

The piece, published by Streetsblog NYC, scrutinizes Adams’s actions and inactions: 'Adams repeatedly failed to meet annual requirements to add new miles of protected bus and bike lanes under the 2019 Streets Master Plan, despite vowing to exceed those benchmarks while campaigning.' Adams supported removing parking mandates through the City of Yes initiative and expanded daylighting at intersections, but fell short on bike and bus lane expansion. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams threatened legal action over unmet safety mandates. Adams’s administration enabled donor-driven sabotage of safety projects, watered down road diets, and ignored placard abuse. His DOT advanced the BQE rebuild against local opposition. Adams’s rhetoric blamed victims and minimized systemic danger. The result: vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, bus riders—face greater risk.
