Thirty-six more are left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, crashes have climbed. Injuries are up by <strong>20%</strong>. Four people have died since January. These are not just numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. The man on Linden Boulevard, crushed by an SUV. The scooter rider on 116th Avenue, thrown to the ground and gone before sunrise. The moped riders in Jamaica, broken in the street. The cyclist, Amanda Servedio, struck and killed while coming home from a ride. She &ldquo;went airborne. She flew like 30 feet. It was a lot of force,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>a witness told the Daily News</a>.</p><h3 id=the-system-fails-the-vulnerable>The System Fails the Vulnerable</h3><p><strong>Most deaths come at the hands of cars and SUVs.</strong> In three years, cars and SUVs killed four, left five with grave wounds, and hurt hundreds. Trucks and buses add to the toll. Motorcycles and mopeds, too. Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price. The city’s own data shows the pattern: drivers turning left, speeding, not yielding, not seeing. The city blames the dead for crossing wrong. But only one person ends up in the morgue.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-silence>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Silence</h3><p>Council Member Adrienne Adams has voted for some safety bills. She backed the law that <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalized jaywalking</a>, ending a policy that punished the vulnerable. She called for more <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-council-passes-bills-on-traffic-crashes-senior-pedestrian-zones>traffic calming in senior zones</a>: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important that the Council advance equitable policies&mldr; to ensure that all New Yorkers can live, work and commute on safer streets.&rdquo; But when it comes to the <strong>citywide 20 mph speed limit</strong>, she has not led. She has called out the city for missing safety targets, but the pace is slow. The blood keeps coming.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day the council delays, another family is broken. <strong>Call Council Member Adrienne Adams. Demand a citywide 20 mph limit. Demand protected bike lanes, daylighted corners, and real enforcement against reckless drivers.</strong> Join with others. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The street will not forgive silence.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The impact killed a 51-year-old woman and left a baby boy with broken legs. Both victims were pedestrians and, as the report states, 'not in the roadway' at the time of the crash. The police report cites 'Traffic Control Disregarded' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as contributing factors for both drivers. The narrative underscores that 'the drivers missed the signs,' highlighting systemic failures in driver compliance with traffic controls. The collision’s violence—'metal screamed'—left one woman dead from crush injuries and a child with severe leg trauma. The report does not list any victim behavior as a contributing factor.

Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers.
