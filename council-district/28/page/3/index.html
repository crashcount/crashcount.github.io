Harden turns and add leading pedestrian intervals at the crosswalks along Rockaway Boulevard and 111th Avenue.

The city can set safer limits under Sammy’s Law. Make 20 mph the default where people walk. Install intelligent speed controls on cars that rack up tickets and points, as proposed in Albany.

Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers.
