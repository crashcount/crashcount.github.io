Since 2022, District 28 logged <strong>12 dead</strong> and 3,850 hurt in 5,932 crashes. Pedestrians took six of those deaths. SUVs and cars did most of the damage. The hours that cut deepest sit at 8 p.m., 9 p.m., and 10 p.m.</p><h3 id=jfks-edge-a-man-down-and-a-driver-gone>JFK’s edge: a man down and a driver gone</h3><p>A 52‑year‑old man tried to cross at 155th Street and South Conduit Avenue at 2:30 a.m. The driver hit him and left. Police said, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/police-investigate-hit-run-death-springfield-gardens-queens-john-kennedy-international-airport/17524816/>“The operator of the vehicle fled the scene after hitting the man.”</a> Detectives searched nearby cameras as the body reached Jamaica Hospital and was pronounced dead. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/13/queens-hit-and-run-driver-kills-52-year-old-man-near-jfk-airport/>“No arrests have been made.”</a></p><p>Queens South has carried a heavy toll this year.

North Conduit Avenue shows another fatal mark and 198 injured. Lefferts Boulevard took a life. The data calls out <strong>unsafe speed</strong>, <strong>inattention</strong>, and <strong>failure to yield</strong> as steady triggers. After dark, the injuries spike; the death count rises at 8, 9, 10, and 11 p.m.</p><p>In April, a 57‑year‑old SUV driver died on the Belt. The record lists <strong>unsafe speed</strong> and an <strong>unsafe lane change</strong>. The airbag went off.

A judge gave him eight years. It happened outside this district, but the lesson runs through every fast lane: the margin is thin, and the body pays.</p><h3 id=simple-fixes-on-deadly-blocks>Simple fixes on deadly blocks</h3><p>Daylight every corner near North Conduit and Lefferts. Harden turns and add leading pedestrian intervals at the crosswalks along Rockaway Boulevard and 111th Avenue. Build raised crossings and speed cushions on approaches to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Belt Parkway</a> service roads. Clear abandoned cars within 72 hours; the Council already voted for it, aiming to open sightlines and crosswalks. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 0857‑2024</a> passed on June 30, 2025.</p><h3 id=slow-every-street-stop-the-worst-repeaters>Slow every street; stop the worst repeaters</h3><p>Lower speeds save lives. The city can set safer limits under Sammy’s Law. Make 20 mph the default where people walk. Install intelligent speed controls on cars that rack up tickets and points, as proposed in Albany. Fewer fast cars. Fewer funerals.</p><p>Take one step now. Tell City Hall and your Council Member to back lower speeds and rein in repeat speeders.
