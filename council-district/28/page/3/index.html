Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals.

Metal twisted. Blood streaked a driver’s arm. The air reeked of alcohol. One man hurt, conscious, bleeding in the dark Queens night. Two cars, one crash, danger unchecked.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a sedan struck the back of a sport utility vehicle on 107th Avenue near 111th Street in Queens at 1:06 a.m. The report notes 'Alcohol Involvement' as a contributing factor in the crash. The sedan’s front end collided with the SUV’s rear, crumpling metal and causing severe bleeding to a 32-year-old male driver, who remained conscious. The narrative describes the scene: 'Metal crumpled. Blood ran down a 32-year-old man’s arm. He stayed conscious. The night smelled of alcohol.' Both vehicles were traveling straight ahead at the time of impact. The data does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor. The focus remains on the presence of alcohol and the violent impact that left one driver injured.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
