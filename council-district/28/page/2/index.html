The session saw progressives sidelined as the Council prioritized car-centric bills, including Intros 103 and 104 (parking protection) and hearings on Intro 606 (e-bike registration). The Common Sense Caucus, known for opposing bike lanes and congestion pricing, led the charge. Progressive members lost key committee seats. Universal daylighting (Intro 1138) and other safety reforms stalled. Council Member Julie Won continued to push for daylighting but faced resistance. As Streetsblog reported, 'roadway safety is simply not a priority.' Advocates and former members criticized the Council for failing to hold the mayor accountable on the Streets Master Plan and for focusing on parking over safety. The Council's actions marked a retreat from previous street safety gains, leaving vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The narrative states: 'A 1996 Honda turned left. A bike came straight. Metal hit bone. The rider, 27, flew. No helmet. His leg crushed.

Critics warn it targets immigrant delivery workers, not reckless drivers. Council debate rages. The bill ignores the real killers: cars. E-bikes cause few deaths. The danger remains unchecked.</p><p class=mb3>Intro 606, now before the City Council, would require all e-bikes to be registered with the Department of Transportation and display license plates. The bill, debated on December 10, 2024, is backed by Council Member Bob Holden and mentioned by Chi Ossé of District 36. The matter summary states: 'A majority of NYC Council members support Intro 606, a bill requiring all e-bikes to be registered with the Department of Transportation and issued license plates.' Speaker Adrienne Adams voiced concern for immigrant communities but did not address the bill's direct impact. Council Member Vickie Paladino dismissed profiling worries, focusing instead on crime. Advocates and experts warn the bill could lead to discriminatory enforcement against immigrant delivery workers, exposing them to policing and immigration risks. Data shows e-bikes cause a tiny fraction of road deaths, while car drivers remain the main threat. The bill, critics say, misses the real danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The impact crushed the rear of the vehicle, injuring four occupants. A 65-year-old woman in the back seat suffered crush injuries, along with three others.

The report states that a westbound sedan struck her head-on as she crossed the intersection. The contributing factor listed is 'Other Lighting Defects,' highlighting poor lighting conditions at the scene. The report notes the sedan was traveling straight ahead and the impact occurred at the center front end of the vehicle. The pedestrian was pronounced dead at the scene with crush injuries. The police report also notes the pedestrian was 'crossing against the signal,' but this is mentioned after the lighting defect cited as a contributing factor.

The plan aims to eliminate mandatory parking requirements citywide, but council members from low-density districts push back, seeking to limit changes to areas near subways. The matter summary states, 'If the Council modifies the plan to eliminate parking requirements only in the transit zone...that would cut the estimated production in about half.' Council Speaker Adrienne Adams has not taken a public stance. Conservative members like Bob Holden oppose the plan, while City Planning Commission Chairman Dan Garodnick urges action: 'Your district needs to be part of the housing solution.' Experts stress that parking mandates have long blocked new housing. The stakes are high—keeping parking requirements means less housing, more driving, and more danger for those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Riders and advocates push back, warning a pause will hurt those who rely on scooters for safe, cheap travel.</p><p class=mb3>On October 10, 2024, City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams called for an 'immediate operational pause' of the e-scooter share program in eastern Queens. The matter, described as a demand to 'pause' the program due to 'sidewalks allegedly rendered impassible by the micromobility devices,' reflects Adams's concerns about scooters left on sidewalks and streets. She stated, 'My constituents have consistently raised questions and concerns about the safety hazards created when e-scooters are frequently left on sidewalks and streets, obstructing pedestrians and all road users.' Adams's stance opposes the current e-scooter share and expansion of micromobility options, but supports stronger regulation and enforcement. The Department of Transportation and advocates highlight the program's success, with nearly 500,000 trips since launch, and argue for better infrastructure instead of a ban. No formal council vote has occurred; this is a public demand from the Speaker.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The piece, published by Streetsblog NYC, scrutinizes Adams’s actions and inactions: 'Adams repeatedly failed to meet annual requirements to add new miles of protected bus and bike lanes under the 2019 Streets Master Plan, despite vowing to exceed those benchmarks while campaigning.' Adams supported removing parking mandates through the City of Yes initiative and expanded daylighting at intersections, but fell short on bike and bus lane expansion. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams threatened legal action over unmet safety mandates. Adams’s administration enabled donor-driven sabotage of safety projects, watered down road diets, and ignored placard abuse. His DOT advanced the BQE rebuild against local opposition. Adams’s rhetoric blamed victims and minimized systemic danger. The result: vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, bus riders—face greater risk. Promises to reclaim streets for people remain largely unfulfilled.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable.
