North Conduit Avenue shows another fatal mark and 198 injured. Lefferts Boulevard took a life. The data calls out <strong>unsafe speed</strong>, <strong>inattention</strong>, and <strong>failure to yield</strong> as steady triggers. After dark, the injuries spike; the death count rises at 8, 9, 10, and 11 p.m.</p><p>In April, a 57‑year‑old SUV driver died on the Belt. The record lists <strong>unsafe speed</strong> and an <strong>unsafe lane change</strong>. The airbag went off.

Harden turns and add leading pedestrian intervals at the crosswalks along Rockaway Boulevard and 111th Avenue.

The city can set safer limits under Sammy’s Law. Make 20 mph the default where people walk. Install intelligent speed controls on cars that rack up tickets and points, as proposed in Albany. Fewer fast cars. Fewer funerals.</p><p>Take one step now. Tell City Hall and your Council Member to back lower speeds and rein in repeat speeders.
