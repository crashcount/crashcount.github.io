In the past year, <strong>10 people died</strong> and <strong>over 1,100 were injured</strong> in crashes here. Eighteen suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same again (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The dead include mothers, sons, and a child. These are not just numbers—they are families left waiting for a door that will never open.</p><p>Just after Christmas, a woman was killed crossing 111th Avenue. The driver kept going. She never made it to the other side (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data CrashID 4781816</a>). On Rockaway Boulevard, a 23-year-old man was struck and killed at the intersection. The car hit him head-on. He did not get up (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data CrashID 4788744</a>).</p><h3 id=the-human-cost-voices-from-the-scene>The Human Cost: Voices from the Scene</h3><p>When a bus jumped the curb in Flushing, eight people were hurt. &ldquo;I was all the way in the back and all of a sudden the bus hit the curb, I guess, jumped the curb, I went this way and that way and banged into the side of the bus,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>said Ken Baur</a>. The driver had fallen asleep at the wheel. The MTA pulled him from service. The investigation continues (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>A chain-reaction crash on the Belt Parkway left two dead. The car lost control, hit the median, and caught fire. There were no arrests. The road was quiet again, but the loss remains (<a href=https://qns.com/2025/07/deadly-belt-parkway-crash-howard-beach/>amny</a>).</p><h3 id=leadership-what-has-been-done-what-must-come-next>Leadership: What Has Been Done, What Must Come Next</h3><p>Council Member Adrienne Adams has <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>voted for bills</a> to clear abandoned vehicles from streets, boost transparency, and decriminalize jaywalking. These steps matter. Removing derelict cars clears sightlines for children and elders crossing the street. But the carnage continues. <strong>Ten dead in a year is not safety.</strong></p><p>The city now has the power to lower speed limits. It can redesign streets. It can end the reign of repeat speeders. But these tools mean nothing if they are not used. Every day of delay is another day a mother does not come home.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand streets where children can cross and live. Do not wait for another name to join the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities.
