Thirty-six more are left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, crashes have climbed. Injuries are up by <strong>20%</strong>. Four people have died since January. These are not just numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. The man on Linden Boulevard, crushed by an SUV. The scooter rider on 116th Avenue, thrown to the ground and gone before sunrise. The moped riders in Jamaica, broken in the street. The cyclist, Amanda Servedio, struck and killed while coming home from a ride. She &ldquo;went airborne. She flew like 30 feet. It was a lot of force,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>a witness told the Daily News</a>.</p><h3 id=the-system-fails-the-vulnerable>The System Fails the Vulnerable</h3><p><strong>Most deaths come at the hands of cars and SUVs.</strong> In three years, cars and SUVs killed four, left five with grave wounds, and hurt hundreds. Trucks and buses add to the toll. Motorcycles and mopeds, too. Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price. The city’s own data shows the pattern: drivers turning left, speeding, not yielding, not seeing. The city blames the dead for crossing wrong. But only one person ends up in the morgue.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-silence>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Silence</h3><p>Council Member Adrienne Adams has voted for some safety bills. She backed the law that <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalized jaywalking</a>, ending a policy that punished the vulnerable. She called for more <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-council-passes-bills-on-traffic-crashes-senior-pedestrian-zones>traffic calming in senior zones</a>: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important that the Council advance equitable policies&mldr; to ensure that all New Yorkers can live, work and commute on safer streets.&rdquo; But when it comes to the <strong>citywide 20 mph speed limit</strong>, she has not led. She has called out the city for missing safety targets, but the pace is slow. The blood keeps coming.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day the council delays, another family is broken. <strong>Call Council Member Adrienne Adams. Demand a citywide 20 mph limit. Demand protected bike lanes, daylighted corners, and real enforcement against reckless drivers.</strong> Join with others. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The street will not forgive silence.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Surveillance and body camera footage show Peña admitting to running the light. Five hours after the crash, tests confirmed intoxication by alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine.

Volunteers warn more cuts loom unless City Hall steps up. Federal relief is gone. Groups want $48 million over three years. Current grants barely keep programs alive. The city’s inaction puts public space and safety at risk.</p><p class=mb3>On March 14, 2025, a coalition of 16 volunteer open street groups sent a letter to City Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers. They warned, 'The limited funding and decreases in funding that have occurred over the years jeopardize the continuity and future of the program—funding pressure is already leading to downsizing and the disappearance of Open Streets programs.' The groups seek $48 million over three years, separate from the city’s $30 million contract with the Horticultural Society. Current grants max out at $20,000 per year, forcing cutbacks. Speaker Adrienne Adams and Mayor Adams are starting budget talks. Council spokesperson Julia Agos called Open Streets 'critical components of our city's public realm.' The Department of Transportation said suggestions will be reviewed. Volunteer groups handle most operations, but stalled redesigns and lack of resources threaten the program’s survival.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Council, under Adams, has passed few street safety bills and instead focused on parking and car-friendly measures. The article states, "Speaker Adams has accomplished far less than her recent predecessors... on expanding bus and bike lanes and making city streets safer for pedestrians and cyclists." Adams has supported e-bike registration, which experts warn would harm delivery workers and street safety. She has not acted to hold reckless drivers accountable after the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program expired and has not used Council powers to lower speed limits. Adams oversaw an outdoor dining law that restricted the program, leading to fewer participating restaurants. She has not enforced the Streets Master Plan benchmarks or sued the mayor for noncompliance. Her actions have left vulnerable road users exposed and slowed the city’s progress on Vision Zero.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The IBO states: 'It will be virtually impossible for the city to meet the City Council's required 150 miles of new bus lanes at the pace Mayor Adams is going.' Mayor Adams, who took office in 2022, has slowed or killed key bus projects, including the Fordham Road busway. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno claims the agency is building protected lanes and using cameras for enforcement, but admits resources are tight. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams has called for compliance but not funded it. Riders Alliance spokesman Danny Pearlstein blames hiring freezes and political interference for 'broken promises and neglected legislation.' The report shows that while DOT’s budget grew, staffing for bus lane expansion fell. Bus speeds remain stuck at 8.1 mph. The city’s inaction leaves millions of bus riders—often the city’s most vulnerable—stranded and exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
