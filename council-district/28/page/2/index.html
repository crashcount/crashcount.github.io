Both bills require the Department of Transportation (DOT) to create public trackers for capital projects tied to the Streets Master Plan. Intro 1105, sponsored by Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, mandates a tracker for projects that count toward safety benchmarks. Intro 1114, sponsored by Council Member Julie Won, calls for a broader capital projects tracker. The bills respond to the Adams administration's failure to meet legal targets for bus and bike lanes. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams said, 'Today’s legislation will advance greater transparency.' DOT officials pushed back, arguing project work is not linear and trackers have limited use. Won countered, 'It is [the DOT's] responsibility to take their capital plan and implement it.' Advocates and council members agree: tracking is only a first step.

The move targets busy pedestrian areas. Advocates and Council Member Restler back the change. Lower speeds mean fewer deadly crashes. Citywide action still stalled.</p><p class=mb3>On March 20, 2025, the NYC Department of Transportation announced four new 20 mph speed limit zones. The agency used powers from Sammy's Law, passed last year, to lower speeds in DUMBO (Brooklyn), City Island (Bronx), Broad Channel (Queens), and New Brighton (Staten Island). DOT chose these areas for their heavy pedestrian traffic and clear boundaries. Council Member Lincoln Restler, representing DUMBO, praised the move, saying, "I'm pleased that DOT will be implementing Brooklyn's first Regional Slow Zone in DUMBO—a neighborhood densely crowded with pedestrian foot traffic." DOT plans to cut speeds on 250 street segments this year, focusing on schools and shared streets. Research shows lower speed limits reduce injury severity in crashes. Despite this progress, Council Speaker Adrienne Adams has not brought a citywide 20 mph limit to a vote. Advocates urge more action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They warned, 'The limited funding and decreases in funding that have occurred over the years jeopardize the continuity and future of the program—funding pressure is already leading to downsizing and the disappearance of Open Streets programs.' The groups seek $48 million over three years, separate from the city’s $30 million contract with the Horticultural Society. Current grants max out at $20,000 per year, forcing cutbacks. Speaker Adrienne Adams and Mayor Adams are starting budget talks. Council spokesperson Julia Agos called Open Streets 'critical components of our city's public realm.' The Department of Transportation said suggestions will be reviewed. Volunteer groups handle most operations, but stalled redesigns and lack of resources threaten the program’s survival.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article states, "Speaker Adams has accomplished far less than her recent predecessors... on expanding bus and bike lanes and making city streets safer for pedestrians and cyclists." Adams has supported e-bike registration, which experts warn would harm delivery workers and street safety. She has not acted to hold reckless drivers accountable after the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program expired and has not used Council powers to lower speed limits. Adams oversaw an outdoor dining law that restricted the program, leading to fewer participating restaurants. She has not enforced the Streets Master Plan benchmarks or sued the mayor for noncompliance.

The IBO states: 'It will be virtually impossible for the city to meet the City Council's required 150 miles of new bus lanes at the pace Mayor Adams is going.' Mayor Adams, who took office in 2022, has slowed or killed key bus projects, including the Fordham Road busway. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno claims the agency is building protected lanes and using cameras for enforcement, but admits resources are tight. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams has called for compliance but not funded it. Riders Alliance spokesman Danny Pearlstein blames hiring freezes and political interference for 'broken promises and neglected legislation.' The report shows that while DOT’s budget grew, staffing for bus lane expansion fell. Bus speeds remain stuck at 8.1 mph.
