Thirty-six left with serious injuries.</strong> More than 3,300 hurt since 2022. The streets are not safe for the old, the young, or anyone on foot or bike. Linden Boulevard, Belt Parkway, Rockaway, Lefferts—names that echo with sirens and loss.</p><p>A man with a cane tried to cross Linden. He never made it home. &ldquo;Today is a sad day.

Assembly Member Khaleel Anderson warns 24/7 cameras could hit Black and brown communities hardest. Assembly Member Dick Gottfried supports cameras and home rule, but many lawmakers hesitate.

Restler emphasized that the funding will harden bike lanes, replacing paint with physical barriers to keep cars out and protect cyclists.

Speaker Adrienne Adams leads the call. The plan promises hundreds of miles of new bus lanes, protected bike paths, and vast pedestrian zones. The mayor weighs the proposal. The city’s future hangs in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On April 4, 2022, the City Council, led by Speaker Adrienne Adams (District 28), called for a $3.1 billion investment in the city’s Streets Master Plan. The proposal, now under budget review, seeks to fund at least 500 miles of new bus lanes, 500 miles of protected bike lanes, 38 million square feet of pedestrian space, and 40 miles of car-free busways. The Council’s action responds to the mayor’s $98.5 billion budget and aims to surpass the targets set by the Department of Transportation’s NYC Streets Plan. Adams stated, “To secure an equitable recovery for our city and improve public safety, we must focus on robust investments that strengthen our communities.” The Council’s push highlights the urgent need for safe, accessible streets and addresses the city’s funding gap for critical infrastructure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal, responding to Mayor Eric Adams’s $98.5 billion budget, seeks 'robust investments that strengthen our communities and deliver opportunities for all New Yorkers.' The Council wants at least 500 miles of new bus lanes, 500 miles of protected bike lanes, 40 miles of busways, and 38 million square feet of pedestrian space. Adams’s advocacy comes as the Department of Transportation admits it lacks resources to meet even current targets, and the Mayor calls for agency cuts. The proposal remains under negotiation before the July 1 budget deadline. The Council’s plan centers vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, and bus riders—by demanding more space and protection from cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The council’s plan also introduces 40 miles of car-free busways, a benchmark not found in the mayor’s plan or previous legislation. Adams and other council leaders argue this funding is vital, stating, 'To secure an equitable recovery for our city and improve public safety, we must focus on robust investments.' Transit advocates back the plan, urging the mayor to support safer, more accessible streets for all New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She echoed a caller’s claim that cameras are 'a money-making operation and not really as a safety situation,' and suggested cameras may not be near schools as required. Adams said, 'Speed cameras, we’re gonna talk about that because we happen to be sharing the same concerns here in southeast Queens.' Her stance contrasts with former Speaker Corey Johnson’s support for speed cameras. Advocates and families of crash victims responded, citing data that cameras reduce speeding and collisions. Evidence shows cameras are placed in high-speed areas and only ticket drivers exceeding the limit by 11 mph or more. The Department of Transportation did not comment, and Adams did not clarify her remarks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
