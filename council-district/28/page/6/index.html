Streets still wait for real protection.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13, 2022, the City Council and Mayor Adams reached a budget agreement, allocating $53 million in operating funds for the Department of Transportation for the fiscal year starting July 1. This is a down payment on the mayor's promised $904 million for the Streets Master Plan, but falls short of the Council's $3.1 billion ask to double the plan's targets. The plan mandates 250 miles of protected bike lanes, 150 miles of dedicated bus lanes, and new public plazas. The official matter summary notes, 'the agreement provided far less for street safety projects than the Council originally sought.' Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and Mayor Adams announced the deal, but neither mentioned street safety in their press conference. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, chair of the Transportation Committee, did not comment. Advocates praised the funding as a significant step, but stressed the need for strong implementation to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers backs home rule and cameras but questions where the money goes: 'Does DOT receive back any revenue?' Council Member Charles Barron supports cameras near schools but is noncommittal on home rule, noting, 'We have some of the highest fatalities and accidents, yet we don't see the highest amount of resources.' Speaker Adrienne Adams has voiced skepticism, calling cameras a way to 'nickel and dime' New Yorkers. Assembly Member Khaleel Anderson warns 24/7 cameras could hit Black and brown communities hardest. Assembly Member Dick Gottfried supports cameras and home rule, but many lawmakers hesitate. Advocates urge using revenue for street redesigns in underinvested areas. The debate exposes deep divides over equity, enforcement, and the city’s duty to protect its most vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The study is not a council bill, but it shapes policy debate. It found that support for automated enforcement—like speed and red-light cameras—increased from 57% to 71% when survey participants were told about racial bias in police traffic stops and the potential for cameras to reduce violent encounters. The study's summary states: 'An interpersonal racial justice frame increases support for traffic safety cameras.' The research follows scrutiny of camera enforcement in New York City and Chicago. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams has echoed concerns about equity, noting speed cameras may disproportionately impact communities of color. The study highlights that framing enforcement as a racial justice issue can shift public opinion and may help reduce police encounters that endanger Black and Latino New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary states, 'Most Americans support traffic safety cameras, especially when framed in the context of racial justice.' Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, District 28, was mentioned in the report, expressing concern that speed cameras may disproportionately burden communities of color. The study underscores that police are 40 percent more likely to stop Black drivers, and 88 percent of suspended license arrests in NYC last year were people of color. The findings suggest that racial justice framing can shift public opinion and may help replace police stops with automated enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal supports the Streets Master Plan, which mandates 250 miles of protected bike lanes and 150 miles of protected bus lanes in five years. Restler emphasized that the funding will harden bike lanes, replacing paint with physical barriers to keep cars out and protect cyclists.

She echoed claims they are cash grabs, not safety tools. Her words clashed with data and advocates. Victims’ families pushed back. The city’s record shows cameras cut speeding and crashes.</p><p class=mb3>On January 21, 2022, Council Speaker Adrienne Adams made public statements on WNYC questioning New York City’s speed camera program. She echoed a caller’s claim that cameras are 'a money-making operation and not really as a safety situation,' and suggested cameras may not be near schools as required. Adams said, 'Speed cameras, we’re gonna talk about that because we happen to be sharing the same concerns here in southeast Queens.' Her stance contrasts with former Speaker Corey Johnson’s support for speed cameras. Advocates and families of crash victims responded, citing data that cameras reduce speeding and collisions. Evidence shows cameras are placed in high-speed areas and only ticket drivers exceeding the limit by 11 mph or more. The Department of Transportation did not comment, and Adams did not clarify her remarks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
