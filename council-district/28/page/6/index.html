Thirty-six left with serious injuries.</strong> More than 3,300 hurt since 2022. The streets are not safe for the old, the young, or anyone on foot or bike. Linden Boulevard, Belt Parkway, Rockaway, Lefferts—names that echo with sirens and loss.</p><p>A man with a cane tried to cross Linden. He never made it home. &ldquo;Today is a sad day.

These measures ban uncertified batteries, require fireproof charging containers, mandate public education, and order FDNY reporting on battery fires. Speaker Adrienne Adams clarified the bills target commercial sellers, not workers. Shahana Hanif urged that policy must "keep workers" at the center. The Council and delivery workers’ union stressed that tech companies, not workers, should bear costs. The FDNY opposed the reporting bill over resource concerns.

Adams stated, 'The increase in traffic fatalities since 2018 is alarming, particularly the rise in children killed by traffic violence.' The report highlights that the city is not on pace to meet the 2019 Streets Plan, which mandates 250 miles of protected bike lanes and 150 miles of bus lanes in five years. Disparities in hit-and-run arrests remain stark between white neighborhoods and neighborhoods of color.

Sponsored by Council Member Lincoln Restler, the bill is advancing in the City Council with 24 out of 51 members signed on as of November 7, 2022. It sits with the Transportation Committee, chaired by Selvena Brooks-Powers, who is working with Restler to streamline the complaint process. The bill’s summary: it allows residents to ticket drivers who block bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or fire hydrants within 1,320 feet of a school, creating a $175 fine and a civilian complaint protocol. Restler and Brooks-Powers are refining the process to avoid the pitfalls of the city’s anti-idling law, which discourages participation. The NYPD and DOT oppose the bill, citing concerns about neighbor conflict. Advocates support it, highlighting NYPD’s failure to protect vulnerable road users. The bill is seen as a major improvement over the ineffective 311 system.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to a citywide greenway plan.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors including Rivera, Hudson, and others. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor on October 27, 2022. The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law. The measure compels the city to plan and maintain safe routes for non-drivers, with regular public reporting and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, worked with Bloomberg Associates and NYC Finance to analyze business growth. The report states, 'business is booming along streets converted to outdoor dining strips or car-free open streets.' Rodriguez supports curbside dining, declaring, 'the future of New York City is going car free.' Council Speaker Adrienne Adams disagrees, saying outdoor dining should stay on the sidewalk. Mayor Adams promises to keep the program as a 'critical driver of recovery.' The report found more business growth on open streets than on similar corridors, with gains in Astoria, Prospect Heights, and Chinatown. The council remains divided on the program’s permanent form.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The street extensions were designed to be temporary." The City Council is currently developing legislation to allow restaurants to use parking lanes, but Adams’s comments signal resistance. Council Member Erik Bottcher countered, calling the use of road space for dining "an overall positive development." Adams’s stance ignores the reality that most city sidewalks are too narrow for sidewalk-only dining, squeezing pedestrians and limiting restaurant survival.
