Thirty-six more are left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, crashes have climbed. Injuries are up by <strong>20%</strong>. Four people have died since January. These are not just numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. The man on Linden Boulevard, crushed by an SUV. The scooter rider on 116th Avenue, thrown to the ground and gone before sunrise. The moped riders in Jamaica, broken in the street. The cyclist, Amanda Servedio, struck and killed while coming home from a ride. She &ldquo;went airborne. She flew like 30 feet. It was a lot of force,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>a witness told the Daily News</a>.</p><h3 id=the-system-fails-the-vulnerable>The System Fails the Vulnerable</h3><p><strong>Most deaths come at the hands of cars and SUVs.</strong> In three years, cars and SUVs killed four, left five with grave wounds, and hurt hundreds. Trucks and buses add to the toll. Motorcycles and mopeds, too. Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price. The city’s own data shows the pattern: drivers turning left, speeding, not yielding, not seeing. The city blames the dead for crossing wrong. But only one person ends up in the morgue.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-silence>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Silence</h3><p>Council Member Adrienne Adams has voted for some safety bills. She backed the law that <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalized jaywalking</a>, ending a policy that punished the vulnerable. She called for more <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-council-passes-bills-on-traffic-crashes-senior-pedestrian-zones>traffic calming in senior zones</a>: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important that the Council advance equitable policies&mldr; to ensure that all New Yorkers can live, work and commute on safer streets.&rdquo; But when it comes to the <strong>citywide 20 mph speed limit</strong>, she has not led. She has called out the city for missing safety targets, but the pace is slow. The blood keeps coming.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day the council delays, another family is broken. <strong>Call Council Member Adrienne Adams. Demand a citywide 20 mph limit. Demand protected bike lanes, daylighted corners, and real enforcement against reckless drivers.</strong> Join with others. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The street will not forgive silence.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill’s summary states: 'Life-saving legislation that would allow New York City to set speed limits below 25 miles per hour failed to make it into this year's state budget.' Data show slower speeds save lives. Advocates and victims’ families keep pushing.

The measures, now headed to Mayor Eric Adams, require the Department of Transportation to report on traffic violence more often and to install traffic calming devices in areas with many senior pedestrians. The matter summary reads: 'Traffic calming devices that are designed to slow down traffic will now be mandated in parts of the five boroughs where a large number of senior citizens reside as the city plans to speed up part of its response to serious and fatal car crashes.' Speaker Adrienne Adams voted for the bills, stating, 'It's important that the Council advance equitable policies like the legislation we're voting on today to ensure that all New Yorkers can live, work and commute on safer streets.' Councilmember Rita C. Joseph, sponsor of the senior zones bill, said, 'It is our duty as this Council to take action to protect our most vulnerable residents.' Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, sponsor of the crash data bill, said the legislation 'would increase transparency, aid collaboration and help prevent traffic violence.'

Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, chair of the Transportation Committee, called for pairing lower speed limits with street redesigns in neglected neighborhoods. As children and cyclists die in record numbers, the council’s inaction leaves vulnerable New Yorkers at risk.

Council Member Keith Powers introduced the buy-back bill, which creates a citywide program for defective or uncertified batteries. Powers said, "We don't want to penalize businesses and workers without thinking about this strategically." The Council also moved bills from Oswald Feliz, Gale Brewer, Alexa Avilés, and Robert Holden. These measures ban uncertified batteries, require fireproof charging containers, mandate public education, and order FDNY reporting on battery fires. Speaker Adrienne Adams clarified the bills target commercial sellers, not workers. Shahana Hanif urged that policy must "keep workers" at the center. The Council and delivery workers’ union stressed that tech companies, not workers, should bear costs. The FDNY opposed the reporting bill over resource concerns. The legislation aims to curb battery fires while protecting delivery workers who depend on e-bikes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The hearing, set for February, follows a grim analysis: 'More children were killed last year by vehicles in New York City than any year since the launch of the street safety initiative Vision Zero.' Adams stated, 'The increase in traffic fatalities since 2018 is alarming, particularly the rise in children killed by traffic violence.' The report highlights that the city is not on pace to meet the 2019 Streets Plan, which mandates 250 miles of protected bike lanes and 150 miles of bus lanes in five years. Disparities in hit-and-run arrests remain stark between white neighborhoods and neighborhoods of color.

Restler and Brooks-Powers are refining the process to avoid the pitfalls of the city’s anti-idling law, which discourages participation.
