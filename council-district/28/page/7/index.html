Thirty-six more are left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, crashes have climbed. Injuries are up by <strong>20%</strong>. Four people have died since January. These are not just numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. The man on Linden Boulevard, crushed by an SUV. The scooter rider on 116th Avenue, thrown to the ground and gone before sunrise. The moped riders in Jamaica, broken in the street. The cyclist, Amanda Servedio, struck and killed while coming home from a ride. She &ldquo;went airborne. She flew like 30 feet. It was a lot of force,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>a witness told the Daily News</a>.</p><h3 id=the-system-fails-the-vulnerable>The System Fails the Vulnerable</h3><p><strong>Most deaths come at the hands of cars and SUVs.</strong> In three years, cars and SUVs killed four, left five with grave wounds, and hurt hundreds. Trucks and buses add to the toll. Motorcycles and mopeds, too. Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price. The city’s own data shows the pattern: drivers turning left, speeding, not yielding, not seeing. The city blames the dead for crossing wrong. But only one person ends up in the morgue.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-silence>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Silence</h3><p>Council Member Adrienne Adams has voted for some safety bills. She backed the law that <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalized jaywalking</a>, ending a policy that punished the vulnerable. She called for more <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-council-passes-bills-on-traffic-crashes-senior-pedestrian-zones>traffic calming in senior zones</a>: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important that the Council advance equitable policies&mldr; to ensure that all New Yorkers can live, work and commute on safer streets.&rdquo; But when it comes to the <strong>citywide 20 mph speed limit</strong>, she has not led. She has called out the city for missing safety targets, but the pace is slow. The blood keeps coming.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day the council delays, another family is broken. <strong>Call Council Member Adrienne Adams. Demand a citywide 20 mph limit. Demand protected bike lanes, daylighted corners, and real enforcement against reckless drivers.</strong> Join with others. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The street will not forgive silence.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Other bills to count camera tickets toward license penalties also failed due to lack of Council support. Assembly Member Bill Magnarelli supported cameras and future escalating fines, while Council Speaker Adrienne Adams declined comment.

Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and Mayor Adams announced the deal, but neither mentioned street safety in their press conference.

Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers backs home rule and cameras but questions where the money goes: 'Does DOT receive back any revenue?' Council Member Charles Barron supports cameras near schools but is noncommittal on home rule, noting, 'We have some of the highest fatalities and accidents, yet we don't see the highest amount of resources.' Speaker Adrienne Adams has voiced skepticism, calling cameras a way to 'nickel and dime' New Yorkers. Assembly Member Khaleel Anderson warns 24/7 cameras could hit Black and brown communities hardest. Assembly Member Dick Gottfried supports cameras and home rule, but many lawmakers hesitate.

The study's summary states: 'An interpersonal racial justice frame increases support for traffic safety cameras.' The research follows scrutiny of camera enforcement in New York City and Chicago.

The matter summary states, 'Most Americans support traffic safety cameras, especially when framed in the context of racial justice.' Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, District 28, was mentioned in the report, expressing concern that speed cameras may disproportionately burden communities of color. The study underscores that police are 40 percent more likely to stop Black drivers, and 88 percent of suspended license arrests in NYC last year were people of color.

The mayor’s plan is less ambitious than the Council’s $3.1 billion proposal, which would add 500 miles of bike lanes and more pedestrian plazas. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez admitted delays in upgrading bike lane barriers. The announcement comes as fatal crashes surge—traffic deaths rose 44% in early 2022.

The plan, part of ongoing budget talks, aims to fund hundreds of miles of protected bike and bus lanes, plus concrete barriers. Council Member Lincoln Restler of District 33, a member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, praised the move as 'a very clear commitment to addressing street safety across the five boroughs.' The proposal supports the Streets Master Plan, which mandates 250 miles of protected bike lanes and 150 miles of protected bus lanes in five years. Restler emphasized that the funding will harden bike lanes, replacing paint with physical barriers to keep cars out and protect cyclists. The Council had requested $3.1 billion, but Restler called the $900 million a dramatic investment. The budget must be finalized by June 30.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal fulfills a 2019 law mandating a citywide streets master plan but offers less than the $3.1 billion the Council sought.

The program, funded with a $1.3 million citywide budget, installs curbside trash enclosures to reduce sidewalk garbage. The first bins appeared at Seventh Avenue and W. 41st Street in Manhattan, with Brooklyn next. Speaker Adrienne Adams praised the pilot, saying, 'New Yorkers deserve to live in communities that are safe and clean.' The Council prioritized this effort in its Preliminary Budget Response. Business Improvement Districts (BIDs) are key partners, though some worry about privatizing public space. The program faces logistical and political hurdles, including site plans and maintenance agreements. Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi called it 'a new vision' for safer, cleaner public spaces. The expansion aims to clear sidewalks, making streets safer for pedestrians and all vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
