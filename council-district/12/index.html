Thirty-six left with serious injuries.</strong> In just the last twelve months, five more dead, seven more lives changed forever. The numbers are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors. A 71-year-old woman died in Co-op City when a 79-year-old driver crashed into two cars and a pole. &ldquo;I saw one lady was out on the ground. They was giving her medical attention, checking her body. She was laid out,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/op-city-crash-multiple-people-injured-including-1-critically-bronx/17075710/>said Samuel Cherry</a>. No arrests. No answers. Just another family left with a hole that will never close.</p><h3 id=patterns-that-dont-change>Patterns That Don’t Change</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> Out of all pedestrian injuries and deaths, SUVs and sedans are behind the wheel in the vast majority of cases. Trucks, mopeds, and bikes trail far behind. The street is a gauntlet. In the last year, children under 18 were hurt 59 times. Two people over 75 did not survive. The old and the young, the ones who walk, pay the price.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn’t</h3><p>Council Member Kevin C. Riley has voted for some safety bills. He backed laws to clear abandoned vehicles from streets within 72 hours, to boost transparency on safety projects, and to decriminalize jaywalking. He co-sponsored bills for speed humps near parks and better lighting for pedestrians. But the carnage continues. <strong>No law yet has slowed the cars enough or stopped the repeat offenders.</strong></p><h3 id=the-call-that-cant-wait>The Call That Can’t Wait</h3><p>The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has the power to end the blood on the asphalt. But power unused is no power at all. <strong>Call Council Member Riley. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit and real action against repeat speeders.</strong> The dead cannot call. The living must.</p><p><a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
