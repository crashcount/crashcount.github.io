The driver of a Mercedes struck them after changing lanes and hitting another car. Police <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/bronx-river-parkway-accident-east-gun-hill-road/>said the men were ejected from their scooters and fatally injured in the collision</a>. The driver faces charges of vehicular manslaughter and driving while intoxicated. The crash closed the highway for hours. The road was quiet except for sirens and the scrape of tow trucks.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h3><p><strong>In the last twelve months, District 12 saw 8 deaths and 741 injuries from crashes.</strong> Two of the dead were over 75. Five were between 55 and 64. Children were hurt, too—64 injured, none killed, but luck is not a policy. Most of the blood comes from cars and SUVs, but trucks, motorcycles, and mopeds all leave their mark. <strong>SUVs alone were involved in 143 pedestrian injuries and 4 deaths.</strong></p><h3 id=council-member-riley-action-and-silence>Council Member Riley: Action and Silence</h3><p>Council Member Kevin C. Riley has voted for some safety bills. He backed the law to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>remove abandoned vehicles</a>, clearing blocked sightlines and crosswalks. He voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>decriminalize jaywalking</a>, a move that ends the old game of blaming the dead for their own deaths. He co-sponsored bills for more speed humps near parks and better lighting. But the carnage continues. The council has the power to push for a citywide 20 mph speed limit. They have not done it. The streets are still fast, still wide, still deadly.</p><h3 id=the-work-ahead>The Work Ahead</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a failure. As one official <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/driver-arrested-in-bronx-river-parkway-fatal-crash/>said a Mercedes sedan driver struck two men on scooters, who then suffered fatal injuries</a>. The words are cold. The loss is not.</p><p><strong>Call Council Member Riley. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand action before another family gets the call.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
