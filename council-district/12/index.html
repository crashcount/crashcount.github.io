Nearly 600 injured.</strong> In the last year, District 12 has seen the slow grind of traffic violence. The dead are not numbers. A 78-year-old woman, crossing White Plains Road at night, was struck by a Toyota SUV. She died at Jacobi Medical Center. The driver stayed. No charges filed. The street stayed the same. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/25/woman-78-fatally-struck-by-bronx-suv-driver/>NY Daily News report</a></p><p>A beloved football coach, Dwight Downer, stood near his home. A BMW, a pickup, a chain of metal and speed. Downer was crushed. His mother, Norma Downer, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/08/bronx-bmw-driver-arrested-for-manslaughter-in-crash-that-killed-beloved-coach/>said, &ldquo;These arrests cannot bring back my child.

All were vulnerable.</p><h3 id=council-member-riley-progress-and-gaps>Council Member Riley: Progress and Gaps</h3><p>Council Member Kevin C. Riley has voted for and co-sponsored bills that matter. He backed the law that ended jaywalking enforcement, shifting blame away from those on foot. He co-sponsored bills for speed humps near parks, better lighting, and more school safety signs. He called out the <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-bronx-traffic-deaths-report-20220719-ji4e6lpi6je3xleslqxmwevgi4-story.html#ed=rss_www.nydailynews.com/arcio/rss/category/new-york/">&ldquo;immense work that still must be done to ensure all New York City streets are safe for all.&rdquo;</a></p><p>But the pace is slow. Many bills sit in committee. Signs and studies do not stop cars. The streets remain wide, fast, and deadly. The Bronx still waits for real protection.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-demand-more-than-words>What Comes Next: Demand More Than Words</h3><p><strong>Every death is preventable.</strong> The city can lower speed limits. It can harden crosswalks. It can build real protection. Riley has shown he will act when pushed. He has also let bills stall. <strong>Call him. Demand speed humps, protected bike lanes, and lower speed limits.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another obituary.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The collision occurred as the taxi was traveling straight ahead and hit the pedestrian head-on, causing severe bleeding from her head. The report notes the cab’s front end was crumpled and its tinted windows obscured the driver’s face. According to the police report, 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' and 'Tinted Windows' were listed as contributing factors. The pedestrian was crossing against the signal and was not at an intersection, as documented in the report, but the presence of tinted windows is also cited as a factor. The focus remains on the driver’s visibility and the systemic risks posed by vehicle design and street conditions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Danger drops for those on foot and bike.</p><p class=mb3>Bill Int 0857-2024, now laid over in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, was introduced April 18, 2024. The bill reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to towing vehicles that are an encumbrance on the street.' It requires the Department of Sanitation to remove vehicles blocking the street within 72 hours of notice. The NYPD must tow cars with missing, obscured, or improper plates and stickers. Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers leads as primary sponsor, joined by Salamanca, Brannan, Feliz, Ayala, Louis, Brewer, Avilés, Mealy, Ung, Restler, Farías, Hudson, Riley, and Schulman. The bill targets vehicles that endanger pedestrians and cyclists by blocking sightlines and crossings.
