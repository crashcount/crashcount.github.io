She died at Jacobi Hospital. The driver stayed. The street stayed the same. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/25/woman-78-fatally-struck-by-bronx-suv-driver/>A 78-year-old woman was fatally struck by a Bronx SUV driver, police said Sunday.</a></p><p>A beloved football coach, Dwight Downer, was killed outside his home.

Riley has voted for and co-sponsored a string of bills. He backed the law that ended jaywalking tickets, giving walkers the right to cross where they need. He co-sponsored bills for more school signs, speed humps near parks, better lighting, and curb extensions. He voted for a citywide greenway plan. He called out the surge in Bronx deaths, <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-bronx-traffic-deaths-report-20220719-ji4e6lpi6je3xleslqxmwevgi4-story.html#ed=rss_www.nydailynews.com/arcio/rss/category/new-york/">saying, &ldquo;The tragic increase of fatal traffic violence in the Bronx so far this year is a testament to the immense work that still must be done to ensure all New York City streets are safe for all.&rdquo;</a></p><p>But most bills are still in committee.

Every crash is a choice made by the city, by its leaders, by those who design and police the streets. <strong>Contact Council Member Riley.

The bus crashed into the wall, breaking through and leaving debris below. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz said, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." No injuries were reported, but the crash caused structural damage. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz noted, "That’s a very big bus, so even going very slowly, it can do a lot of damage," highlighting the risk of lax parking enforcement. The incident underscores systemic issues: double-parking and weak infrastructure can combine to threaten lives, even when no one is hurt.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
