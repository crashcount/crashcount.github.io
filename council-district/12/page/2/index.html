Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds killed none, but left a trail of broken bodies. Bikes injured four. The violence is relentless. It does not care about age. Children, elders, and everyone in between have been hit.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Council Member Kevin C. Riley has voted for bills to clear abandoned cars, mark pavement, and boost crash investigations. He backed laws to decriminalize jaywalking and require speed humps near parks. He co-sponsored a bill to remove derelict vehicles within 72 hours, aiming to clear blocked sightlines and crosswalks. But some bills focus on parking or data, not on stopping the next crash. <strong>The street is still a battlefield.</strong></p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another family broken.</strong> Call Council Member Riley.
