Nearly 600 injured.</strong> In the last year, District 12 has seen the slow grind of traffic violence. The dead are not numbers. A 78-year-old woman, crossing White Plains Road at night, was struck by a Toyota SUV. She died at Jacobi Medical Center. The driver stayed. No charges filed. The street stayed the same. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/25/woman-78-fatally-struck-by-bronx-suv-driver/>NY Daily News report</a></p><p>A beloved football coach, Dwight Downer, stood near his home. A BMW, a pickup, a chain of metal and speed. Downer was crushed. His mother, Norma Downer, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/08/bronx-bmw-driver-arrested-for-manslaughter-in-crash-that-killed-beloved-coach/>said, &ldquo;These arrests cannot bring back my child. Still, something has to be done.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>SUVs, sedans, trucks, mopeds.</strong> The machines keep moving. The bodies do not. In the last 12 months: 4 deaths, 8 serious injuries, 598 hurt. Most were walking. Some were children. Some were old. All were vulnerable.</p><h3 id=council-member-riley-progress-and-gaps>Council Member Riley: Progress and Gaps</h3><p>Council Member Kevin C. Riley has voted for and co-sponsored bills that matter. He backed the law that ended jaywalking enforcement, shifting blame away from those on foot. He co-sponsored bills for speed humps near parks, better lighting, and more school safety signs. He called out the <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-bronx-traffic-deaths-report-20220719-ji4e6lpi6je3xleslqxmwevgi4-story.html#ed=rss_www.nydailynews.com/arcio/rss/category/new-york/">&ldquo;immense work that still must be done to ensure all New York City streets are safe for all.&rdquo;</a></p><p>But the pace is slow. Many bills sit in committee. Signs and studies do not stop cars. The streets remain wide, fast, and deadly. The Bronx still waits for real protection.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-demand-more-than-words>What Comes Next: Demand More Than Words</h3><p><strong>Every death is preventable.</strong> The city can lower speed limits. It can harden crosswalks. It can build real protection. Riley has shown he will act when pushed. He has also let bills stall. <strong>Call him. Demand speed humps, protected bike lanes, and lower speed limits.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another obituary.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Introduced March 19, 2024, the bill would require the Department of Transportation to paint and install overhead school safety signs on every street with a school entrance. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to installing safety signs near schools.' Council Member Susan Zhuang leads as primary sponsor, joined by Rivera, Gennaro, Won, Hanif, Gutiérrez, Louis, Cabán, Restler, Farías, Banks, and Riley as co-sponsors. The bill aims to alert drivers to the presence of school-aged children and pedestrians. It remains in committee, with no vote or enactment date set. The measure targets a simple truth: children cross streets, drivers often do not see them. Signs alone will not stop cars, but they mark danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move aims to cut deadly conflict between cars and kids. Filed at session’s end, the resolution targets peak arrival and dismissal. Sponsors push Albany to act. Streets remain risky.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0792-2023 was filed by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on September 28, 2023, and closed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. The resolution urges the New York State Legislature and Governor to pass A.5001-A/S.2515-B, which would require scramble crosswalks at intersections near schools during student arrival and dismissal. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, A.5001-A/S.2515-B, in relation to establishing scramble crosswalks leading to and from school buildings during times of student arrival and dismissal.' Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary), Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, Lincoln Restler, and Kevin C. Riley sponsored the measure. The bill responds to persistent crashes near schools and the loss of hundreds of crossing guards. Scramble crosswalks, also called Barnes Dances, stop all traffic so pedestrians cross in every direction. The council’s action highlights the ongoing danger children face on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
