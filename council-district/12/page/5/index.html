She died at Jacobi Hospital. The driver stayed. The street stayed the same. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/25/woman-78-fatally-struck-by-bronx-suv-driver/>A 78-year-old woman was fatally struck by a Bronx SUV driver, police said Sunday.</a></p><p>A beloved football coach, Dwight Downer, was killed outside his home. The BMW that hit him had racked up speeding tickets even after the crash. His mother <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/08/bronx-bmw-driver-arrested-for-manslaughter-in-crash-that-killed-beloved-coach/>said, &ldquo;These arrests cannot bring back my child. Still, something has to be done.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>Most victims are not in cars.</strong> In the last three years, 10 people have died and nearly 2,000 have been injured on these streets.

Riley has voted for and co-sponsored a string of bills. He backed the law that ended jaywalking tickets, giving walkers the right to cross where they need. He co-sponsored bills for more school signs, speed humps near parks, better lighting, and curb extensions. He voted for a citywide greenway plan. He called out the surge in Bronx deaths, <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-bronx-traffic-deaths-report-20220719-ji4e6lpi6je3xleslqxmwevgi4-story.html#ed=rss_www.nydailynews.com/arcio/rss/category/new-york/">saying, &ldquo;The tragic increase of fatal traffic violence in the Bronx so far this year is a testament to the immense work that still must be done to ensure all New York City streets are safe for all.&rdquo;</a></p><p>But most bills are still in committee. Signs and studies do not slow cars. <strong>The deaths keep coming.</strong></p><h3 id=the-road-ahead-demand-more-than-promises>The Road Ahead: Demand More Than Promises</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. Every crash is a choice made by the city, by its leaders, by those who design and police the streets. <strong>Contact Council Member Riley. Demand real change: slower speeds, protected crossings, enforcement against repeat speeders.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.

Five intersections per borough, every year. The aim: block cars from parking near crosswalks, boost pedestrian sightlines, and cut crashes where people walk.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0261-2022 was introduced on April 28, 2022, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring curb extensions at certain dangerous intersections,' was sponsored by Council Members Hanif (primary), Menin, Hudson, Stevens, Ayala, Abreu, Krishnan, Nurse, and Riley. The bill required the Department of Transportation to identify intersections with high pedestrian crash rates and install curb extensions—prohibiting parking within 15 feet of crosswalks—at a minimum of five such intersections in each borough per year. The measure was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. Curb extensions are designed to increase pedestrian visibility and reduce deadly conflicts at crossings, directly targeting systemic dangers faced by people on foot.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It called on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to ensure any subway station undergoing enhancement or renovation becomes fully accessible to people with disabilities. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling upon the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to make any subway stations undergoing enhancement or renovation fully accessible to people with disabilities.' Council Member Darlene Mealy sponsored the resolution, joined by Brannan, Menin, Louis, Yeger, Hanif, Hudson, Marte, Joseph, Riley, and Brooks-Powers. The resolution was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. Only 117 out of 493 subway stations are accessible. The Council’s action highlights the city’s failure to guarantee safe, equal passage for all riders. Elevators and upgrades are overdue. The bill’s filing leaves vulnerable New Yorkers waiting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
