Nearly 600 injured.</strong> In the last year, District 12 has seen the slow grind of traffic violence. The dead are not numbers. A 78-year-old woman, crossing White Plains Road at night, was struck by a Toyota SUV. She died at Jacobi Medical Center. The driver stayed. No charges filed. The street stayed the same. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/25/woman-78-fatally-struck-by-bronx-suv-driver/>NY Daily News report</a></p><p>A beloved football coach, Dwight Downer, stood near his home. A BMW, a pickup, a chain of metal and speed. Downer was crushed. His mother, Norma Downer, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/08/bronx-bmw-driver-arrested-for-manslaughter-in-crash-that-killed-beloved-coach/>said, &ldquo;These arrests cannot bring back my child. Still, something has to be done.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>SUVs, sedans, trucks, mopeds.</strong> The machines keep moving. The bodies do not. In the last 12 months: 4 deaths, 8 serious injuries, 598 hurt. Most were walking. Some were children. Some were old. All were vulnerable.</p><h3 id=council-member-riley-progress-and-gaps>Council Member Riley: Progress and Gaps</h3><p>Council Member Kevin C. Riley has voted for and co-sponsored bills that matter. He backed the law that ended jaywalking enforcement, shifting blame away from those on foot. He co-sponsored bills for speed humps near parks, better lighting, and more school safety signs. He called out the <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-bronx-traffic-deaths-report-20220719-ji4e6lpi6je3xleslqxmwevgi4-story.html#ed=rss_www.nydailynews.com/arcio/rss/category/new-york/">&ldquo;immense work that still must be done to ensure all New York City streets are safe for all.&rdquo;</a></p><p>But the pace is slow. Many bills sit in committee. Signs and studies do not stop cars. The streets remain wide, fast, and deadly. The Bronx still waits for real protection.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-demand-more-than-words>What Comes Next: Demand More Than Words</h3><p><strong>Every death is preventable.</strong> The city can lower speed limits. It can harden crosswalks. It can build real protection. Riley has shown he will act when pushed. He has also let bills stall. <strong>Call him. Demand speed humps, protected bike lanes, and lower speed limits.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another obituary.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill also ordered a study comparing these devices to unlit signs, probing their power to deter traffic violations and mapping out logistical hurdles. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the installation of solar-powered crosswalks.' Council Member Lincoln Restler led as primary sponsor, joined by Menin, Brooks-Powers, Rivera, and over thirty others. The bill was filed at session’s end on December 31, 2023.

The bill’s summary states: “The department shall conduct and submit to the mayor and the speaker of the council and post conspicuously on the department's website an annual study on bicycle activity.” Council Members Amanda Farías, Selvena N. Brooks-Powers (primary sponsor), Lincoln Restler, Tiffany Cabán, Crystal Hudson, Kevin C. Riley, and Lynn C. Schulman sponsored the measure. The bill would have identified the most biked streets and bridges, noted which lacked protected lanes, and demanded safety recommendations. The council filed the bill at session’s end on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst note was provided. The bill’s failure leaves cyclists exposed, with no citywide data push to guide urgent fixes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Public Advocate Jumaane Williams and Council Member Alexa Avilés, with over thirty co-sponsors, sought a city study on the impact of truck and delivery traffic from last mile facilities. The official summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to conducting a study of the impact that truck and delivery traffic generated by last mile facilities have on local communities and infrastructure.' The bill required the Department of Transportation to report on delivery vehicle volumes, parking, congestion, collisions, and pedestrian injuries near these hubs. It called for identifying the most affected streets and estimating the costs and possible fixes. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without passage.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter’s title reads: 'A Local Law in relation to requiring the department of transportation to study street design as a means to limit or reduce the use by commercial vehicles of streets in residential neighborhoods.' Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez sponsored the bill, joined by Avilés, the Public Advocate, and others. The report was due by December 31, 2023. The bill was filed at the end of session with no report issued. The measure aimed to examine street redesign, traffic calming, and camera enforcement to keep trucks out of residential areas, but it stalled before any impact reached the street.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
