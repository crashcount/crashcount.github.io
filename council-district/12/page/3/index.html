Thirty-six left with serious injuries. Nearly two thousand hurt.</strong> These are not just numbers. They are mothers, fathers, children. In the last twelve months alone, four people died and 589 were injured in 819 crashes. The dead include a 76-year-old woman struck by an SUV on White Plains Road, a 60-year-old man crushed on Givan Avenue, and a 64-year-old man killed crossing at Bronxwood Avenue. Each one gone in a moment. Each one leaves a hole that never heals.</p><h3 id=the-vehicles-steel-against-flesh>The Vehicles: Steel Against Flesh</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars did most of the killing.</strong> Five deaths, seventy-seven moderate injuries, seven serious injuries. Trucks and buses took another life. Motorcycles and mopeds left more bodies broken. The street is a gauntlet. The sidewalk is no refuge. The numbers are clear: the bigger the vehicle, the greater the harm.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Council Member Kevin C. Riley has taken steps. He voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable and did nothing to stop the carnage. He co-sponsored bills for more school safety signs, speed humps near parks, better lighting, and safer crosswalks. He called out the crisis: “The tragic increase of fatal traffic violence in the Bronx so far this year is a testament to the immense work that still must be done to ensure all New York City streets are safe for all” <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-bronx-traffic-deaths-report-20220719-ji4e6lpi6je3xleslqxmwevgi4-story.html#ed=rss_www.nydailynews.com/arcio/rss/category/new-york/">said Riley</a>.</p><p>But bills for signs and studies do not slow a speeding car. <strong>Speed kills.</strong> A pedestrian hit at 30 mph is five times more likely to die than at 20 mph. The city now has the power to lower speed limits. Every day of delay is another risk, another family shattered.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-demand-more>The Next Step: Demand More</h3><p><strong>Call Council Member Riley. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit on every street. Demand real protection for walkers and cyclists.</strong> Join <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> and <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>.

The bill required the Department of Transportation to post details of all traffic control device and speed reducer requests on a public website. The matter summary reads: 'The required website would include, but need not be limited to, the following information: case number, general topic, issue, status, resolution, reason for approval or denial of traffic control device, and if approved, the timeline for completion.' Council Member Farah N. Louis sponsored the bill, joined by 21 co-sponsors including Williams, Hanif, and Yeger. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst note was provided, but the measure aimed to end secrecy around life-saving street changes. Public access to this data could expose delays and denials that keep streets deadly.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The official summary read: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to reporting data about electric bicycles and electric scooters.' Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary sponsor), Marjorie Velázquez, Sandy Nurse, Kevin C. Riley, and Gale A. Brewer backed the measure. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote. If passed, it would have forced the city to break out crash data by vehicle type, borough, and precinct—shining a light on the toll for riders and pedestrians.
