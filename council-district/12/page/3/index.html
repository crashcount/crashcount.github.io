Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds killed none, but left a trail of broken bodies. Bikes injured four. The violence is relentless. It does not care about age. Children, elders, and everyone in between have been hit.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Council Member Kevin C. Riley has voted for bills to clear abandoned cars, mark pavement, and boost crash investigations. He backed laws to decriminalize jaywalking and require speed humps near parks. He co-sponsored a bill to remove derelict vehicles within 72 hours, aiming to clear blocked sightlines and crosswalks. But some bills focus on parking or data, not on stopping the next crash. <strong>The street is still a battlefield.</strong></p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another family broken.</strong> Call Council Member Riley.

The collision occurred as the taxi was traveling straight ahead and hit the pedestrian head-on, causing severe bleeding from her head. The report notes the cab’s front end was crumpled and its tinted windows obscured the driver’s face. According to the police report, 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' and 'Tinted Windows' were listed as contributing factors. The pedestrian was crossing against the signal and was not at an intersection, as documented in the report, but the presence of tinted windows is also cited as a factor. The focus remains on the driver’s visibility and the systemic risks posed by vehicle design and street conditions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The report states both vehicles were involved in 'Turning Improperly.' One SUV, traveling east, was going straight ahead, while the other, traveling southwest, was making a left turn. The impact crushed the front ends of both vehicles. A 44-year-old male driver suffered severe lacerations to his lower arm and hand but remained conscious, as detailed in the police narrative: 'A 44-year-old man clutched the wheel, blood streaming from his arm. He did not lose consciousness.' The police report explicitly lists 'Turning Improperly' as the contributing factor for both drivers, underscoring driver error as the cause of the crash. No mention is made of any victim behavior contributing to the collision. The crash highlights the ongoing danger at intersections where driver actions can have immediate, violent consequences.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
