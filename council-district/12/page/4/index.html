Nearly 600 injured.</strong> In the last year, District 12 has seen the slow grind of traffic violence. The dead are not numbers. A 78-year-old woman, crossing White Plains Road at night, was struck by a Toyota SUV. She died at Jacobi Medical Center. The driver stayed. No charges filed. The street stayed the same. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/25/woman-78-fatally-struck-by-bronx-suv-driver/>NY Daily News report</a></p><p>A beloved football coach, Dwight Downer, stood near his home. A BMW, a pickup, a chain of metal and speed. Downer was crushed. His mother, Norma Downer, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/08/bronx-bmw-driver-arrested-for-manslaughter-in-crash-that-killed-beloved-coach/>said, &ldquo;These arrests cannot bring back my child. Still, something has to be done.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>SUVs, sedans, trucks, mopeds.</strong> The machines keep moving. The bodies do not. In the last 12 months: 4 deaths, 8 serious injuries, 598 hurt. Most were walking. Some were children. Some were old. All were vulnerable.</p><h3 id=council-member-riley-progress-and-gaps>Council Member Riley: Progress and Gaps</h3><p>Council Member Kevin C. Riley has voted for and co-sponsored bills that matter. He backed the law that ended jaywalking enforcement, shifting blame away from those on foot. He co-sponsored bills for speed humps near parks, better lighting, and more school safety signs. He called out the <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-bronx-traffic-deaths-report-20220719-ji4e6lpi6je3xleslqxmwevgi4-story.html#ed=rss_www.nydailynews.com/arcio/rss/category/new-york/">&ldquo;immense work that still must be done to ensure all New York City streets are safe for all.&rdquo;</a></p><p>But the pace is slow. Many bills sit in committee. Signs and studies do not stop cars. The streets remain wide, fast, and deadly. The Bronx still waits for real protection.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-demand-more-than-words>What Comes Next: Demand More Than Words</h3><p><strong>Every death is preventable.</strong> The city can lower speed limits. It can harden crosswalks. It can build real protection. Riley has shown he will act when pushed. He has also let bills stall. <strong>Call him. Demand speed humps, protected bike lanes, and lower speed limits.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another obituary.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill aimed to require leading pedestrian interval signals at intersections next to hospitals, libraries, schools, and senior centers. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring leading pedestrian interval signals at intersections adjacent to hospitals, libraries, schools, and senior centers.' Council Member Lynn C. Schulman sponsored the bill, joined by Kagan, Hudson, Hanif, Abreu, Restler, Riley, and Sanchez. The bill would have forced the city to install these signals at no fewer than 400 intersections each year. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. No law passed. The city’s most vulnerable—kids, elders, patients—remain at risk at crossings meant to protect them.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
