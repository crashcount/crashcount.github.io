She died at Jacobi Hospital. The driver stayed. The street stayed the same. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/25/woman-78-fatally-struck-by-bronx-suv-driver/>A 78-year-old woman was fatally struck by a Bronx SUV driver, police said Sunday.</a></p><p>A beloved football coach, Dwight Downer, was killed outside his home. The BMW that hit him had racked up speeding tickets even after the crash. His mother <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/08/bronx-bmw-driver-arrested-for-manslaughter-in-crash-that-killed-beloved-coach/>said, &ldquo;These arrests cannot bring back my child. Still, something has to be done.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>Most victims are not in cars.</strong> In the last three years, 10 people have died and nearly 2,000 have been injured on these streets.

Riley has voted for and co-sponsored a string of bills. He backed the law that ended jaywalking tickets, giving walkers the right to cross where they need. He co-sponsored bills for more school signs, speed humps near parks, better lighting, and curb extensions. He voted for a citywide greenway plan. He called out the surge in Bronx deaths, <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-bronx-traffic-deaths-report-20220719-ji4e6lpi6je3xleslqxmwevgi4-story.html#ed=rss_www.nydailynews.com/arcio/rss/category/new-york/">saying, &ldquo;The tragic increase of fatal traffic violence in the Bronx so far this year is a testament to the immense work that still must be done to ensure all New York City streets are safe for all.&rdquo;</a></p><p>But most bills are still in committee. Signs and studies do not slow cars. <strong>The deaths keep coming.</strong></p><h3 id=the-road-ahead-demand-more-than-promises>The Road Ahead: Demand More Than Promises</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. Every crash is a choice made by the city, by its leaders, by those who design and police the streets. <strong>Contact Council Member Riley. Demand real change: slower speeds, protected crossings, enforcement against repeat speeders.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.
