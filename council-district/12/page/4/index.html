Over 2,000 injured.</strong> In District 12, these are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors. Since 2022, there have been <strong>3,357 crashes</strong>. <strong>Thirty-six people suffered serious injuries.</strong> Eleven never made it home. Most of the dead and wounded were walking or riding. The street did not forgive them.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-no-end-in-sight>Recent Crashes: No End in Sight</h3><p>The violence does not stop. On July 11, a 79-year-old driver crashed into two cars and a pole in Co-op City. His 71-year-old passenger, Stella Nyarko-Dei, died. Six others were hurt. A witness <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/op-city-crash-multiple-people-injured-including-1-critically-bronx/17075710/>described the scene</a>: &ldquo;I saw one lady was out on the ground. They was giving her medical attention, checking her body. She was laid out.&rdquo;</p><p>Just days before, a driver in a Ford Mustang <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/driver-plows-into-six-people-after-botching-left-turn-in-the-bronx/>rammed into six people after botching a turn at an intersection in the Bronx</a>. The driver fled. The victims were left on the sidewalk, waiting for help.</p><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the harm.</strong> In the last three years, they killed six, seriously hurt seven, and injured hundreds more. Trucks, mopeds, and bikes also left their mark, but the biggest threat rolls on four wheels.</p><h3 id=what-has-council-member-riley-done>What Has Council Member Riley Done?</h3><p>Council Member Kevin C. Riley has voted for some safety bills. He backed laws to remove abandoned vehicles, improve street safety transparency, and add pavement markings. He co-sponsored a bill to require speed humps near parks. He voted to decriminalize jaywalking, a move that <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>boosts pedestrian safety citywide</a>.</p><p>But some actions miss the mark. Riley co-sponsored an e-bike registration bill that shifts the burden to riders, not drivers. He voted for taxi dooring decals—small steps, not real change. The streets remain dangerous. The dead cannot speak for themselves.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-demand-more>The Next Step: Demand More</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by the city. <strong>Call Council Member Riley. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people walking and biking.</strong> Do not wait for the next siren.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
