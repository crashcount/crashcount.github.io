She died at Jacobi Hospital. The driver stayed. The street stayed the same. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/25/woman-78-fatally-struck-by-bronx-suv-driver/>A 78-year-old woman was fatally struck by a Bronx SUV driver, police said Sunday.</a></p><p>A beloved football coach, Dwight Downer, was killed outside his home. The BMW that hit him had racked up speeding tickets even after the crash. His mother <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/08/bronx-bmw-driver-arrested-for-manslaughter-in-crash-that-killed-beloved-coach/>said, &ldquo;These arrests cannot bring back my child. Still, something has to be done.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>Most victims are not in cars.</strong> In the last three years, 10 people have died and nearly 2,000 have been injured on these streets. The old, the young, the ones on foot. SUVs and trucks do the most harm.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-taken-steps-delayed>Leadership: Steps Taken, Steps Delayed</h3><p>Council Member Kevin C. Riley has voted for and co-sponsored a string of bills. He backed the law that ended jaywalking tickets, giving walkers the right to cross where they need. He co-sponsored bills for more school signs, speed humps near parks, better lighting, and curb extensions. He voted for a citywide greenway plan. He called out the surge in Bronx deaths, <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-bronx-traffic-deaths-report-20220719-ji4e6lpi6je3xleslqxmwevgi4-story.html#ed=rss_www.nydailynews.com/arcio/rss/category/new-york/">saying, &ldquo;The tragic increase of fatal traffic violence in the Bronx so far this year is a testament to the immense work that still must be done to ensure all New York City streets are safe for all.&rdquo;</a></p><p>But most bills are still in committee. Signs and studies do not slow cars. <strong>The deaths keep coming.</strong></p><h3 id=the-road-ahead-demand-more-than-promises>The Road Ahead: Demand More Than Promises</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These are not accidents. Every crash is a choice made by the city, by its leaders, by those who design and police the streets. <strong>Contact Council Member Riley. Demand real change: slower speeds, protected crossings, enforcement against repeat speeders.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The street will not change itself.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report, titled 'Report finds traffic deaths on the rise in the Bronx, ‘immense work’ needed to ensure safety, pol urges,' highlights 28 deaths in the first half of 2022—up from 23 the previous year. Riley stated, 'The tragic increase of fatal traffic violence in the Bronx so far this year is a testament to the immense work that still must be done to ensure all New York City streets are safe for all.' Of those killed, seven were pedestrians and four were cyclists or scooter riders. Advocates and Riley point to a lack of protected bike lanes and street upgrades as key dangers. The Department of Transportation claims new projects are underway, but the Bronx remains underserved. Riley’s call underscores the urgent need for systemic change to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
