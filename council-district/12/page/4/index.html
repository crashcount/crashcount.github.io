The bill required the Department of Sanitation and NYPD to tow vehicles that block streets or lack visible, valid license plates, registration, or inspection stickers. The matter summary reads: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code...in relation to towing vehicles that are an encumbrance on the street or that lack, improperly display, or obscure valid license plates, registration stickers, inspection stickers, or vehicle identification numbers.” Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by Salamanca, Brannan, Feliz, Stevens, Ung, Riley, and Schulman. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, with no further action. Removing untraceable or abandoned vehicles could have reduced street dangers for pedestrians and cyclists, but the measure stalled.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
