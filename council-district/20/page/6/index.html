Fifty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 2,300 hurt since 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The dead are not numbers. They are elders crossing Main Street, children on bikes, mothers waiting for the light. The violence is steady, not sudden. It comes in the form of SUVs, sedans, trucks—steel against flesh.</p><p>Just last month, a speeding crash on Main Street sent passengers to the hospital. Days before, an SUV rear-ended a taxi on the expressway. A child was hurt when two SUVs collided on College Point Boulevard. Two boys were struck by a driver who failed to yield. The list goes on. The pain does not end.</p><h3 id=i-have-a-baby-with-me-that-would-be-scary>&ldquo;I Have a Baby With Me. That Would Be Scary.&rdquo;</h3><p>On July 11, an MTA bus in Flushing jumped the curb and smashed into a pole. <strong>Eight people were injured.</strong> <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>&ldquo;I have a baby with me. That would be scary. I&rsquo;ll be more cautious of my surroundings,&rdquo;</a> said Samantha Hart, a bystander. The bus nearly hit two people waiting at the stop. The driver, just 25, was pulled from service after officials believed he had fallen asleep at the wheel (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>The violence is not always loud. Sometimes it is a silent swerve, a moment of inattention. But the result is the same. <strong>A 78-year-old woman killed crossing Parsons Boulevard. A 63-year-old cyclist struck down by an SUV on Bowne Street.</strong></p><h3 id=leadership-small-steps-long-delays>Leadership: Small Steps, Long Delays</h3><p>Council Member Sandra Ung has signed on to bills for more lighting, speed humps, and safer street designs. She backed the citywide greenway plan. She co-sponsored a bill to require DOT approval for sidewalk stands, aiming to keep paths clear. But when the Council <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>voted to end jaywalking enforcement</a>—a law that protects pedestrians from being blamed for their own deaths—Ung was absent. When e-scooter share came to Queens, Ung <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/17/queens-pols-have-lots-of-claims-about-the-evils-of-scooter-share-but-few-facts>led the charge to ban it</a>, ignoring data showing no serious injuries or deaths and thousands of safe rides.</p><p>Ung says she is proud that the Eastern Queens Greenway is funded in her district, but the path remains unfinished. The city moves slow. The danger moves fast.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Ung. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes and sidewalks that put people first. Demand action, not delay. Every day without change is another day someone does not come home.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Adams made them permanent, but cut enforcement hours. Illegal parking still chokes lanes. Riders wait. Drivers fume. Cameras catch some, but not all. Streets stay dangerous. The city drags its feet.</p><p class=mb3>This report examines four busways implemented in 2020 and 2021 during Mayor de Blasio’s final years. The projects—Jay Street, West 181st Street, Flushing Main Street, and Archer/Jamaica avenues—were made permanent by Mayor Adams, though enforcement hours were reduced on most. The article notes: “Four busways announced and implemented in 2020 and 2021 during the latter days of the de Blasio administration appear to have sped up service for transit riders, according to official MTA bus speed data.” Bus operators like Orlando Tejeda and Anita Mealy describe persistent illegal parking and double-parking, which slows buses and endangers riders. Despite camera enforcement, violations remain rampant. Council Member Peter Koo opposed the Flushing busway, but it survived legal and political attacks. Riders and drivers report faster trips, but the city’s weak enforcement leaves vulnerable road users at risk. The city’s promise of safer, faster streets is only half-kept.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
