The hours after dark hit hardest.</p><h3 id=where-the-street-breaks-people>Where the street breaks people</h3><ul><li>The <a href=#>Long Island Expressway</a> leads the harm ledger here: two deaths and 341 injuries tied to its reach in this district, according to city data (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li><a href=#>Northern Boulevard</a> shows two deaths and 128 injuries. <a href=#>College Point Boulevard</a> adds one death and 100 injuries. <a href=#>Main Street</a> holds 46 injury cases and six serious injuries (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li></ul><p>Night pushes the odds. From 8 p.m. to 11 p.m., the ledger spikes: 2 deaths at 8, 4 at 9, and 1 at 11, with steady serious injuries throughout the evening (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Most crashes cite “other” or inattention. Failure to yield still kills.</p><h3 id=names-corners-and-the-last-minute>Names, corners, and the last minute</h3><ul><li>June 10, 2024, Bowne Street at 41st Avenue: a 63‑year‑old woman on a bike was struck by a left‑turning SUV and died at the scene. City records list her as ejected, with head trauma (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4731666</a>).</li><li>March 14, 2025, Northern Boulevard at Parsons: a 78‑year‑old woman walking outside a crosswalk was hit by a westbound SUV and killed. The record is bare and cold: “Apparent Death” (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4799008</a>).</li><li>July 31, 2025, Hollis Court Boulevard at 50th Avenue: a 55‑year‑old woman on an e‑bike going straight.

But much comes after the harm. In 2023, a man drove the wrong way on the Clearview and smashed into five cars. “Joseph Lee terrorized other drivers,” Queens DA Melinda Katz said. A jury convicted him. He got eight years. Lee told police he entered the expressway “in the wrong direction because I wanted to hurt people” (<a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY</a>).</p><p>On the streets here, SUVs and sedans dominate pedestrian injuries: 287 tied to SUVs and 196 to sedans, with most of the deaths among those modes. Trucks and buses add to the count, but they are not the main share (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=what-would-stop-the-bleeding-at-these-corners>What would stop the bleeding at these corners?</h3><ul><li>Hardened left turns and daylighting at Bowne/41st and Northern/Parsons.

Clear the sightlines (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>Nighttime fixes at the late‑hour peaks: lighting, signal timing, and focused enforcement where the 8–11 p.m. deaths stack up (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>Finish the Eastern Queens Greenway gaps that force people into traffic. Funding is there; timelines are not. “Nearly the entire greenway through District 20 is fully funded,” Council Member Sandra Ung said. Advocates warn delays leave people exposed (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/07/19/city-must-finally-fill-eastern-queens-greenway-gaps-advocates>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</li></ul><h3 id=citywide-levers-that-save-lives-here>Citywide levers that save lives here</h3><p>Speed still decides who lives. The city can lower its residential limit under Sammy’s Law. Our own reporting lays out the path and the stakes, including speed cameras renewed and a bill to force repeat speeders to use limiters. The math is stark: small drops in speed mean survival. Read the plan and act (<a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>).</p><p>Police chases add danger. The NYPD tightened pursuit rules in 2025 after crashes and deaths tied to chases; state officials called for change, noting the risks to everyone on the road (<a href=https://apnews.com/article/9aa3cc475f278beed3ba1ecd02d444f7>AP</a>).</p><p>This district cannot carry more names. Lower speeds. Safer turns. Finished paths. The numbers are already written. What comes next is choice.</p><p>—</p><p>If you want slower streets and fewer funerals, take one step today.

No greenway. Queens waits as city stalls. Parks and DOT talk, but no cash. Council Member Sandra Ung vows to fight for funding. Cyclists and families left exposed. The path remains a promise. Danger and delay linger.</p><p class=mb3>This action concerns the long-delayed Queens Greenway, discussed in a public statement on February 17, 2022. The project, first planned in 1977 and 1988, would connect Flushing Meadows Corona Park to Fort Totten with a safe route for pedestrians and cyclists. The Parks Department and DOT presented a new vision but admitted that none of the $105 million needed is funded. Council Member Sandra Ung, representing parts of the greenway, said, 'I want to finally see it become a reality,' and stressed the need for accessible open spaces. Still, she could not commit any specific funding. Cycling advocates criticized the city for asking residents to pick favorite sub-projects, calling it a tactic to lower expectations. The city offered no timeline. Vulnerable road users remain at risk as the greenway languishes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
