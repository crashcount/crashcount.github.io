Twenty-one left with serious injuries.</strong> In the past year, District 20 saw 1,181 crashes. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about age. Two of the dead were over 75. One was a woman, 78, crossing Northern Boulevard at night. The driver did not stop. Police said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/woman-78-killed-queens-hit-and-run-driver/>&ldquo;A 78-year-old woman was fatally struck by a hit-and-run driver as she crossed a Queens street.&rdquo;</a> Her name was not released. The street remembers her.</p><p>Children are not spared. In March, a car struck a man and a child at 32nd Avenue and 138th Street. The man was pinned under the car. The child, between eight and ten, was also hit. Police found them both. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-pedestrians-hit-man-pinned-vehicle-child-injured-being-car/16014608/>&ldquo;Police responded&mldr;and found an adult man pinned under a vehicle.&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=who-bears-the-weight>Who Bears the Weight</h3><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the killing.</strong> Seven deaths and 19 serious injuries came from cars and SUVs. Trucks and buses hurt more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll. The street is a gauntlet for anyone not behind a wheel.</p><h3 id=sandra-ung-steps-and-silences>Sandra Ung: Steps and Silences</h3><p>Council Member Sandra Ung has signed on to bills for more lighting, speed humps, and safer crosswalks. She voted for a citywide greenway plan. She co-sponsored a study for tactile paving to help the blind. But when the Council voted to end jaywalking enforcement—a law that stops blaming the victim—Ung was absent. She backed a bill to ban e-scooter share, despite no deaths or serious injuries from the program, and despite city data showing <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/17/queens-pols-have-lots-of-claims-about-the-evils-of-scooter-share-but-few-facts>tens of thousands of safe rides</a>.</p><h3 id=the-road-ahead>The Road Ahead</h3><p><strong>The crisis is not random. It is built into the street.</strong> Residents must demand more. Call for a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings and real accountability for drivers. Contact Council Member Ung. Call the Mayor.
