A minivan hit her and kept going. She died at the hospital. Police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/woman-78-killed-queens-hit-and-run-driver/>reported</a> that &ldquo;a 78-year-old woman was fatally struck by a hit-and-run driver as she crossed a Queens street.&rdquo; The street was wet with rain. The driver did not stop. No arrest. No justice.</p><p>Two days earlier, a man and a child stood at 32nd Avenue and 138th Street. A car hit them. The man was pinned under the car. The child, maybe eight or ten, was hurt too. Police <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-pedestrians-hit-man-pinned-vehicle-child-injured-being-car/16014608/>responded</a> and found an adult man pinned under a vehicle. Both went to the hospital. The driver stayed. The street stayed the same.</p><p><strong>In the last 12 months, District 20 saw 4 deaths, 18 serious injuries, and 664 people hurt in 1,175 crashes.</strong> The old, the young, the ones just trying to get home. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.</p><h2 id=leadership-small-steps-slow-change>Leadership: Small Steps, Slow Change</h2><p>Council Member Sandra Ung has signed her name to bills for more lighting on step streets, speed humps near parks, and solar crosswalks. She voted yes on a citywide greenway plan. She co-sponsored a bill to require DOT approval for sidewalk stands, aiming to keep sidewalks clear for people, not commerce. But when the Council voted to end jaywalking enforcement—a law that blamed the walker, not the driver—Ung was absent. She also backed a bill to ban e-scooter share, despite no deaths or serious injuries from the program, and strong safety records (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/17/queens-pols-have-lots-of-claims-about-the-evils-of-scooter-share-but-few-facts>safety records</a>).</p><p><strong>Some bills help. Some just study. Some shift blame.</strong> The greenway is funded, but not built. The step streets may get lights, but the main roads stay dark.</p><h2 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Every day, the street takes another.</strong> The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. It can fill the greenway gaps. It can redesign deadly crossings. But it will not, unless you force it. Call your council member. Demand action. Do not wait for the next siren.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The official summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to conducting a study of the impact that truck and delivery traffic generated by last mile facilities have on local communities and infrastructure.' The bill required the Department of Transportation to report on delivery vehicle volumes, parking, congestion, collisions, and pedestrian injuries near these hubs.

No greenway. Queens waits as city stalls. Parks and DOT talk, but no cash. Council Member Sandra Ung vows to fight for funding. Cyclists and families left exposed. The path remains a promise. Danger and delay linger.</p><p class=mb3>This action concerns the long-delayed Queens Greenway, discussed in a public statement on February 17, 2022. The project, first planned in 1977 and 1988, would connect Flushing Meadows Corona Park to Fort Totten with a safe route for pedestrians and cyclists. The Parks Department and DOT presented a new vision but admitted that none of the $105 million needed is funded. Council Member Sandra Ung, representing parts of the greenway, said, 'I want to finally see it become a reality,' and stressed the need for accessible open spaces. Still, she could not commit any specific funding. Cycling advocates criticized the city for asking residents to pick favorite sub-projects, calling it a tactic to lower expectations. The city offered no timeline. Vulnerable road users remain at risk as the greenway languishes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
