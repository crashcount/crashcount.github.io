Two hundred thirty-three were hurt. The dead include the old and the young. A 78-year-old woman killed by an SUV on Parsons Boulevard. A 68-year-old pedestrian struck down by a sedan on Main Street. A 63-year-old cyclist, hit and killed by a left-turning SUV on Bowne Street. The list goes on. Each one had a name. Each one is gone.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>The pain does not fade. &ldquo;I was holding on for my life back there,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bus-crane-collide-queens-village-4-people-injured/17016760/>said Emily McKinnon</a> after a crane slammed into her bus. She ran to help others, saw them crying, shaken. &ldquo;Even now I&rsquo;m scared to go on the bus again, but I have to take the bus to get to work.&rdquo; The street does not care. The next crash is always waiting.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h3><p>Council Member Sandra Ung has signed on to bills for <strong>speed humps</strong> and <strong>raised crosswalks</strong>, and backed a citywide greenway plan. She co-sponsored a bill to add lighting to step streets, and another to require DOT approval for sidewalk stands. These are steps, but small ones. When the Council voted to end jaywalking enforcement—a law that put blame on the victim—Ung was absent. She also backed a bill to ban e-scooter share, despite <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/17/queens-pols-have-lots-of-claims-about-the-evils-of-scooter-share-but-few-facts>data showing no serious injuries or deaths</a> and high ridership. The fight for the Eastern Queens Greenway drags on, fully funded but unfinished. The pavement cracks. Cyclists and walkers are forced into traffic. The promise of safety is still just a promise.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. It can finish the greenway. It can build real protection for people outside cars. <strong>Call Council Member Ung. Demand action.</strong> Demand streets where you do not have to hold on for your life. Demand that every name lost is the last.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Adams made them permanent, but cut enforcement hours. Illegal parking still chokes lanes. Riders wait. Drivers fume. Cameras catch some, but not all. Streets stay dangerous. The city drags its feet.</p><p class=mb3>This report examines four busways implemented in 2020 and 2021 during Mayor de Blasio’s final years. The projects—Jay Street, West 181st Street, Flushing Main Street, and Archer/Jamaica avenues—were made permanent by Mayor Adams, though enforcement hours were reduced on most. The article notes: “Four busways announced and implemented in 2020 and 2021 during the latter days of the de Blasio administration appear to have sped up service for transit riders, according to official MTA bus speed data.” Bus operators like Orlando Tejeda and Anita Mealy describe persistent illegal parking and double-parking, which slows buses and endangers riders. Despite camera enforcement, violations remain rampant. Council Member Peter Koo opposed the Flushing busway, but it survived legal and political attacks. Riders and drivers report faster trips, but the city’s weak enforcement leaves vulnerable road users at risk. The city’s promise of safer, faster streets is only half-kept.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
