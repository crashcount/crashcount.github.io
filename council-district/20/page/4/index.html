Fifty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 2,300 hurt since 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The dead are not numbers. They are elders crossing Main Street, children on bikes, mothers waiting for the light. The violence is steady, not sudden. It comes in the form of SUVs, sedans, trucks—steel against flesh.</p><p>Just last month, a speeding crash on Main Street sent passengers to the hospital. Days before, an SUV rear-ended a taxi on the expressway. A child was hurt when two SUVs collided on College Point Boulevard. Two boys were struck by a driver who failed to yield. The list goes on. The pain does not end.</p><h3 id=i-have-a-baby-with-me-that-would-be-scary>&ldquo;I Have a Baby With Me. That Would Be Scary.&rdquo;</h3><p>On July 11, an MTA bus in Flushing jumped the curb and smashed into a pole. <strong>Eight people were injured.</strong> <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>&ldquo;I have a baby with me. That would be scary. I&rsquo;ll be more cautious of my surroundings,&rdquo;</a> said Samantha Hart, a bystander. The bus nearly hit two people waiting at the stop. The driver, just 25, was pulled from service after officials believed he had fallen asleep at the wheel (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>ABC7</a>).</p><p>The violence is not always loud. Sometimes it is a silent swerve, a moment of inattention. But the result is the same. <strong>A 78-year-old woman killed crossing Parsons Boulevard. A 63-year-old cyclist struck down by an SUV on Bowne Street.</strong></p><h3 id=leadership-small-steps-long-delays>Leadership: Small Steps, Long Delays</h3><p>Council Member Sandra Ung has signed on to bills for more lighting, speed humps, and safer street designs. She backed the citywide greenway plan. She co-sponsored a bill to require DOT approval for sidewalk stands, aiming to keep paths clear. But when the Council <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>voted to end jaywalking enforcement</a>—a law that protects pedestrians from being blamed for their own deaths—Ung was absent. When e-scooter share came to Queens, Ung <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/17/queens-pols-have-lots-of-claims-about-the-evils-of-scooter-share-but-few-facts>led the charge to ban it</a>, ignoring data showing no serious injuries or deaths and thousands of safe rides.</p><p>Ung says she is proud that the Eastern Queens Greenway is funded in her district, but the path remains unfinished. The city moves slow. The danger moves fast.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Ung. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes and sidewalks that put people first. Demand action, not delay. Every day without change is another day someone does not come home.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Introduced May 16, 2024, it commands the Department of Transportation to install pedestrian lighting on at least 25 step streets each year. The bill’s matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring the installation of pedestrian lighting on step streets.' Prime sponsor Joann Ariola leads, joined by Council Members Hanks, Ayala, Salaam, Brooks-Powers, Banks, Restler, Brannan, Ung, Gutiérrez, Louis, Hudson, Schulman, Ossé, Krishnan, Nurse, Moya, and Marmorato. Step streets are public staircases linking streets at different heights. The bill aims to ensure these stairs are well-lit, reducing risk for walkers. Once all step streets are lit, the mandate ends.

The bill states: "requiring the installation of speed humps on roadways adjacent to any park equal or greater than one acre." Lincoln Restler leads as primary sponsor, joined by seventeen co-sponsors including Joseph, Feliz, Louis, Marte, and others. The Department of Transportation must install speed humps on qualifying streets unless the commissioner finds it unsafe or inconsistent with DOT guidelines. The bill remains in committee. If passed, it would take effect 180 days after becoming law. The measure aims to slow traffic near parks, where walkers and children cross.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lives may change.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0161-2024 sits in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced February 28, 2024, it commands the Department of Transportation to assess at least 100 speed camera locations each year for raised speed reducer feasibility. The bill reads: 'requiring a raised speed reducer feasibility assessment at speed camera locations.' Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary), David M. Carr, Sandra Ung, Robert F. Holden, Joann Ariola, and Vickie Paladino sponsor the measure. If DOT finds a location suitable, it must install a raised speed reducer within a year. DOT must also report annually, track changes in dangerous driving, and recommend if cameras are still needed. The bill aims to force physical changes where drivers speed, not just rely on cameras. No safety analyst note was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
