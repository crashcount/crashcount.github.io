SUVs and sedans did most of the hurting to people on foot. The hours after dark hit hardest.</p><h3 id=where-the-street-breaks-people>Where the street breaks people</h3><ul><li>The <a href=#>Long Island Expressway</a> leads the harm ledger here: two deaths and 341 injuries tied to its reach in this district, according to city data (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li><a href=#>Northern Boulevard</a> shows two deaths and 128 injuries. <a href=#>College Point Boulevard</a> adds one death and 100 injuries. <a href=#>Main Street</a> holds 46 injury cases and six serious injuries (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li></ul><p>Night pushes the odds. From 8 p.m. to 11 p.m., the ledger spikes: 2 deaths at 8, 4 at 9, and 1 at 11, with steady serious injuries throughout the evening (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Most crashes cite “other” or inattention. Failure to yield still kills.</p><h3 id=names-corners-and-the-last-minute>Names, corners, and the last minute</h3><ul><li>June 10, 2024, Bowne Street at 41st Avenue: a 63‑year‑old woman on a bike was struck by a left‑turning SUV and died at the scene. City records list her as ejected, with head trauma (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4731666</a>).</li><li>March 14, 2025, Northern Boulevard at Parsons: a 78‑year‑old woman walking outside a crosswalk was hit by a westbound SUV and killed. The record is bare and cold: “Apparent Death” (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4799008</a>).</li><li>July 31, 2025, Hollis Court Boulevard at 50th Avenue: a 55‑year‑old woman on an e‑bike going straight. An SUV turned left. She died of chest injuries (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4832001</a>).</li></ul><p>A left turn.

The form letters do not say who waited with them.</p><h3 id=the-system-that-looks-away>The system that looks away</h3><p>Police and courts sometimes catch the worst of it. But much comes after the harm. In 2023, a man drove the wrong way on the Clearview and smashed into five cars. “Joseph Lee terrorized other drivers,” Queens DA Melinda Katz said. A jury convicted him. He got eight years. Lee told police he entered the expressway “in the wrong direction because I wanted to hurt people” (<a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY</a>).</p><p>On the streets here, SUVs and sedans dominate pedestrian injuries: 287 tied to SUVs and 196 to sedans, with most of the deaths among those modes. Trucks and buses add to the count, but they are not the main share (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=what-would-stop-the-bleeding-at-these-corners>What would stop the bleeding at these corners?</h3><ul><li>Hardened left turns and daylighting at Bowne/41st and Northern/Parsons. Failure to yield is a listed killer here. Cut the angles. Clear the sightlines (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>Nighttime fixes at the late‑hour peaks: lighting, signal timing, and focused enforcement where the 8–11 p.m. deaths stack up (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>Finish the Eastern Queens Greenway gaps that force people into traffic. Funding is there; timelines are not. “Nearly the entire greenway through District 20 is fully funded,” Council Member Sandra Ung said. Advocates warn delays leave people exposed (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/07/19/city-must-finally-fill-eastern-queens-greenway-gaps-advocates>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</li></ul><h3 id=citywide-levers-that-save-lives-here>Citywide levers that save lives here</h3><p>Speed still decides who lives. The city can lower its residential limit under Sammy’s Law. Our own reporting lays out the path and the stakes, including speed cameras renewed and a bill to force repeat speeders to use limiters. The math is stark: small drops in speed mean survival. Read the plan and act (<a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>).</p><p>Police chases add danger. The NYPD tightened pursuit rules in 2025 after crashes and deaths tied to chases; state officials called for change, noting the risks to everyone on the road (<a href=https://apnews.com/article/9aa3cc475f278beed3ba1ecd02d444f7>AP</a>).</p><p>This district cannot carry more names. Lower speeds. Safer turns. Finished paths. The numbers are already written. What comes next is choice.</p><p>—</p><p>If you want slower streets and fewer funerals, take one step today. Tell City Hall to drop the default limit and rein in repeat speeders.

The bill, co-sponsored by Council Members James Gennaro and Lynn Schulman, follows a press conference where lawmakers denounced the program as hazardous. Gennaro said, "The program, as designed, leads to chaos." Ung called her bill a last resort. Assembly Members Sam Berger and David Weprin, and Community Board 8 Chair Martha Taylor, joined the opposition, citing sidewalk clutter and lack of outreach. However, DOT data contradicts their claims: since the program's June launch, 37,000 riders have taken 290,000 trips with no reported serious injuries or deaths. DOT says it held 35 briefings and implemented parking corrals in dense areas. Despite high ridership and safety records, the bill seeks to end the program, centering political frustration over proven outcomes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

In a letter to MTA CEO Janno Lieber, Liu wrote, 'I demand the MTA explain how this plan is overall an increase and expansion of bus service in Queens as opposed to an actually disguised cost reduction measure.' Liu highlighted the planned elimination of the QM3 bus and reductions to the QM5, warning of increased wait times and higher fares for commuters. He argued that rerouting and service cuts would isolate seniors, strand students, and hurt businesses. Liu’s stance: the redesign prioritizes cost-cutting over real improvements. The MTA insists the plan means more and faster service, but Liu and local riders remain unconvinced.

The incident, reported by Streetsblog NYC, left the area between Four Winds Playground and the Kissena Velodrome stripped and scarred. The Kissena Park Connector, part of the Destination Greenways plan, is a vital east-west bike route. Volunteers, who planted the saplings since 2022, found ATV tracks at the scene. Council Member Sandra Ung, a supporter of the greenway and volunteer efforts, urged witnesses to report vandalism. She told NY1, 'Anyone witnessing any vandalism should report it.' The NYPD and Parks Department have investigated but offered no comment. The destruction leaves greenway users—cyclists and pedestrians—more exposed, stripping away natural protection and undermining years of community effort.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
