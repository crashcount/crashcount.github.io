Twenty-one left with serious injuries.</strong> In the past year, District 20 saw 1,181 crashes. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about age. Two of the dead were over 75. One was a woman, 78, crossing Northern Boulevard at night. The driver did not stop. Police said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/woman-78-killed-queens-hit-and-run-driver/>&ldquo;A 78-year-old woman was fatally struck by a hit-and-run driver as she crossed a Queens street.&rdquo;</a> Her name was not released. The street remembers her.</p><p>Children are not spared. In March, a car struck a man and a child at 32nd Avenue and 138th Street. The man was pinned under the car. The child, between eight and ten, was also hit. Police found them both. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-pedestrians-hit-man-pinned-vehicle-child-injured-being-car/16014608/>&ldquo;Police responded&mldr;and found an adult man pinned under a vehicle.&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=who-bears-the-weight>Who Bears the Weight</h3><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the killing.</strong> Seven deaths and 19 serious injuries came from cars and SUVs.

The street is a gauntlet for anyone not behind a wheel.</p><h3 id=sandra-ung-steps-and-silences>Sandra Ung: Steps and Silences</h3><p>Council Member Sandra Ung has signed on to bills for more lighting, speed humps, and safer crosswalks. She voted for a citywide greenway plan. She co-sponsored a study for tactile paving to help the blind. But when the Council voted to end jaywalking enforcement—a law that stops blaming the victim—Ung was absent. She backed a bill to ban e-scooter share, despite no deaths or serious injuries from the program, and despite city data showing <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/17/queens-pols-have-lots-of-claims-about-the-evils-of-scooter-share-but-few-facts>tens of thousands of safe rides</a>.</p><h3 id=the-road-ahead>The Road Ahead</h3><p><strong>The crisis is not random. It is built into the street.</strong> Residents must demand more. Call for a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings and real accountability for drivers. Contact Council Member Ung. Call the Mayor.

The report states the e-bike rider 'slammed into the back of a parked SUV,' resulting in the rider being ejected and landing face-first on the pavement. The report describes 'blood pooled on the pavement' and notes the rider was 'conscious' but suffering from 'severe bleeding.' The police report lists 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Reaction to Uninvolved Vehicle' as contributing factors to the crash. The SUV was parked and unoccupied at the time of the collision. The rider was not wearing a helmet, as noted in the report, but this is mentioned after the driver errors. The crash underscores the lethal mix of speed, steel, and inattention on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Step streets are public staircases linking streets at different heights. The bill aims to ensure these stairs are well-lit, reducing risk for walkers. Once all step streets are lit, the mandate ends.

Introduced February 28, 2024, the bill commands the Department of Transportation and Parks to post signs warning cyclists, e-bike, and e-scooter riders: stay off sidewalks, park walkways, and boardwalks, or face fines. The matter title reads, 'A Local Law...notifying operators...of the prohibition against operating such devices on sidewalks, park walkways, and boardwalks, and of related fines and penalties.' Lincoln Restler sponsors, joined by Hudson, Brewer, Hanif, Gennaro, Abreu, Ung, and Schulman. The bill aims to keep vulnerable pedestrians safe by making the rules clear at every crossing and path. No safety analyst has weighed in yet. The measure waits in committee. The city’s warning signs may soon rise.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to limiting the parking of motor vehicles by dealers.' Council Members Francisco P.

It bans dealers from parking, storing, or displaying cars for sale or repair on city streets, except for emergencies. Dealers must display placards on cars awaiting repair or return. Each violation brings fines and possible impoundment. Owners get an affirmative defense if ticketed while their car is with a dealer.
