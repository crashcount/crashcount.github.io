A minivan hit her and kept going. She died at the hospital. Police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/woman-78-killed-queens-hit-and-run-driver/>reported</a> that &ldquo;a 78-year-old woman was fatally struck by a hit-and-run driver as she crossed a Queens street.&rdquo; The street was wet with rain. The driver did not stop. No arrest. No justice.</p><p>Two days earlier, a man and a child stood at 32nd Avenue and 138th Street. A car hit them. The man was pinned under the car. The child, maybe eight or ten, was hurt too. Police <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-pedestrians-hit-man-pinned-vehicle-child-injured-being-car/16014608/>responded</a> and found an adult man pinned under a vehicle. Both went to the hospital. The driver stayed. The street stayed the same.</p><p><strong>In the last 12 months, District 20 saw 4 deaths, 18 serious injuries, and 664 people hurt in 1,175 crashes.</strong> The old, the young, the ones just trying to get home. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.</p><h2 id=leadership-small-steps-slow-change>Leadership: Small Steps, Slow Change</h2><p>Council Member Sandra Ung has signed her name to bills for more lighting on step streets, speed humps near parks, and solar crosswalks. She voted yes on a citywide greenway plan. She co-sponsored a bill to require DOT approval for sidewalk stands, aiming to keep sidewalks clear for people, not commerce. But when the Council voted to end jaywalking enforcement—a law that blamed the walker, not the driver—Ung was absent. She also backed a bill to ban e-scooter share, despite no deaths or serious injuries from the program, and strong safety records (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/17/queens-pols-have-lots-of-claims-about-the-evils-of-scooter-share-but-few-facts>safety records</a>).</p><p><strong>Some bills help. Some just study. Some shift blame.</strong> The greenway is funded, but not built. The step streets may get lights, but the main roads stay dark.</p><h2 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Every day, the street takes another.</strong> The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. It can fill the greenway gaps. It can redesign deadly crossings. But it will not, unless you force it. Call your council member. Demand action. Do not wait for the next siren.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, co-sponsored by Council Members James Gennaro and Lynn Schulman, follows a press conference where lawmakers denounced the program as hazardous. Gennaro said, "The program, as designed, leads to chaos." Ung called her bill a last resort. Assembly Members Sam Berger and David Weprin, and Community Board 8 Chair Martha Taylor, joined the opposition, citing sidewalk clutter and lack of outreach. However, DOT data contradicts their claims: since the program's June launch, 37,000 riders have taken 290,000 trips with no reported serious injuries or deaths. DOT says it held 35 briefings and implemented parking corrals in dense areas. Despite high ridership and safety records, the bill seeks to end the program, centering political frustration over proven outcomes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill was introduced on September 12, 2024, and referred to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure the same day. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting the operation of shared electric scooter systems on certain streets in the Borough of Queens.' Council Members Lynn C. Schulman (District 29, primary sponsor) and Sandra Ung (District 20, co-sponsor) back the measure. The bill would stop shared e-scooter organizations from operating in a dense, contested part of Queens. No safety analysis was provided. The legislation draws a hard line on who can move—and how—on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Parks Department has not started work on nine segments, despite six being fully funded. Council Member Sandra Ung has prioritized funding for her district’s portion, stating, 'I am proud that today nearly the entire greenway through District 20 is fully funded.' Advocates like John Kelly and Joby Jacob push for transparency and urgency, warning, 'Now is the time to ensure that this great work isn't watered down or indefinitely delayed.' The Parks Department cites multi-agency involvement for the holdup. Meanwhile, existing paths crumble, forcing cyclists and pedestrians into traffic. The lack of progress leaves vulnerable road users exposed and the promise of safe passage unfulfilled.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
