Two hundred thirty-three were hurt. The dead include the old and the young. A 78-year-old woman killed by an SUV on Parsons Boulevard. A 68-year-old pedestrian struck down by a sedan on Main Street. A 63-year-old cyclist, hit and killed by a left-turning SUV on Bowne Street. The list goes on. Each one had a name. Each one is gone.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>The pain does not fade. &ldquo;I was holding on for my life back there,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bus-crane-collide-queens-village-4-people-injured/17016760/>said Emily McKinnon</a> after a crane slammed into her bus. She ran to help others, saw them crying, shaken. &ldquo;Even now I&rsquo;m scared to go on the bus again, but I have to take the bus to get to work.&rdquo; The street does not care. The next crash is always waiting.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h3><p>Council Member Sandra Ung has signed on to bills for <strong>speed humps</strong> and <strong>raised crosswalks</strong>, and backed a citywide greenway plan. She co-sponsored a bill to add lighting to step streets, and another to require DOT approval for sidewalk stands. These are steps, but small ones. When the Council voted to end jaywalking enforcement—a law that put blame on the victim—Ung was absent. She also backed a bill to ban e-scooter share, despite <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/17/queens-pols-have-lots-of-claims-about-the-evils-of-scooter-share-but-few-facts>data showing no serious injuries or deaths</a> and high ridership. The fight for the Eastern Queens Greenway drags on, fully funded but unfinished. The pavement cracks. Cyclists and walkers are forced into traffic. The promise of safety is still just a promise.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. It can finish the greenway. It can build real protection for people outside cars. <strong>Call Council Member Ung. Demand action.</strong> Demand streets where you do not have to hold on for your life. Demand that every name lost is the last.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Pena's blood-alcohol content was 0.156%, nearly twice the legal limit, and he tested positive for cocaine and marijuana.

The report states, 'A 2007 Honda backed into him. The bumper was clean. His head was not. He stayed conscious. The car kept moving. He was crushed.' The pedestrian suffered head and crush injuries but remained conscious at the scene. The vehicle showed no damage, according to the report. The driver’s actions—backing without apparent awareness of a person behind—created a lethal hazard for the man on foot. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified,' but the narrative centers the impact and ongoing movement of the sedan as the source of harm. The pedestrian’s crossing without a signal is noted only after the vehicle’s actions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Prosecutors said Pena was drunk, high on cocaine and marijuana, and driving 83 mph in a 25 mph zone when he ran a red light and struck Diaz’s BMW. Surveillance footage showed the Mercedes 'barreled through an East Elmhurst intersection' at 4:15 a.m. Diaz, headed to work at LaGuardia, died at the scene. Pena refused a breath test; a blood draw later confirmed drug use. He was charged with vehicular manslaughter, DWI, and refusal to submit to testing, but posted $50,000 bail. The article highlights family grief and outrage at bail laws, quoting Diaz’s brother: 'Pena will walk the streets for a $50,000 bail...

The report, from Riders Alliance and Pratt Center, surveyed 1,800 riders. It found nearly 70 percent use the bus to shop, eat, or seek entertainment. The matter highlights that 'bus service is a boon for business.' Council Member actions are not directly cited, but Mayor Adams faces criticism for failing to deliver on bus lane promises. DOT spokesperson Vin Barone said redesigning Flatbush could 'speed up bus service...while also enhancing pedestrian safety.' The report exposes how slow buses hurt working-class, Black, and female riders—many lose pay or jobs due to delays. Business opposition to bus lanes remains, despite evidence that most shoppers arrive by transit or foot.
