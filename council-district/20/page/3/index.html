Twenty-one left with serious injuries.</strong> In the past year, District 20 saw 1,181 crashes. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about age. Two of the dead were over 75. One was a woman, 78, crossing Northern Boulevard at night. The driver did not stop. Police said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/woman-78-killed-queens-hit-and-run-driver/>&ldquo;A 78-year-old woman was fatally struck by a hit-and-run driver as she crossed a Queens street.&rdquo;</a> Her name was not released. The street remembers her.</p><p>Children are not spared. In March, a car struck a man and a child at 32nd Avenue and 138th Street. The man was pinned under the car. The child, between eight and ten, was also hit. Police found them both. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-pedestrians-hit-man-pinned-vehicle-child-injured-being-car/16014608/>&ldquo;Police responded&mldr;and found an adult man pinned under a vehicle.&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=who-bears-the-weight>Who Bears the Weight</h3><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the killing.</strong> Seven deaths and 19 serious injuries came from cars and SUVs. Trucks and buses hurt more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll. The street is a gauntlet for anyone not behind a wheel.</p><h3 id=sandra-ung-steps-and-silences>Sandra Ung: Steps and Silences</h3><p>Council Member Sandra Ung has signed on to bills for more lighting, speed humps, and safer crosswalks. She voted for a citywide greenway plan. She co-sponsored a study for tactile paving to help the blind. But when the Council voted to end jaywalking enforcement—a law that stops blaming the victim—Ung was absent. She backed a bill to ban e-scooter share, despite no deaths or serious injuries from the program, and despite city data showing <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/17/queens-pols-have-lots-of-claims-about-the-evils-of-scooter-share-but-few-facts>tens of thousands of safe rides</a>.</p><h3 id=the-road-ahead>The Road Ahead</h3><p><strong>The crisis is not random. It is built into the street.</strong> Residents must demand more. Call for a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings and real accountability for drivers. Contact Council Member Ung. Call the Mayor. Join <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a> and <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a>. <strong>Do not wait for another name to become a number.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, co-sponsored by Council Members James Gennaro and Lynn Schulman, follows a press conference where lawmakers denounced the program as hazardous. Gennaro said, "The program, as designed, leads to chaos." Ung called her bill a last resort. Assembly Members Sam Berger and David Weprin, and Community Board 8 Chair Martha Taylor, joined the opposition, citing sidewalk clutter and lack of outreach. However, DOT data contradicts their claims: since the program's June launch, 37,000 riders have taken 290,000 trips with no reported serious injuries or deaths. DOT says it held 35 briefings and implemented parking corrals in dense areas. Despite high ridership and safety records, the bill seeks to end the program, centering political frustration over proven outcomes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Introduced May 16, 2024, it commands the Department of Transportation to install pedestrian lighting on at least 25 step streets each year.

Prime sponsor Joann Ariola leads, joined by Council Members Hanks, Ayala, Salaam, Brooks-Powers, Banks, Restler, Brannan, Ung, Gutiérrez, Louis, Hudson, Schulman, Ossé, Krishnan, Nurse, Moya, and Marmorato. Step streets are public staircases linking streets at different heights. The bill aims to ensure these stairs are well-lit, reducing risk for walkers. Once all step streets are lit, the mandate ends. The measure targets a clear hazard: darkness on city stairs.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
