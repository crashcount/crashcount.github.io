Two hundred thirty-three were hurt. The dead include the old and the young. A 78-year-old woman killed by an SUV on Parsons Boulevard. A 68-year-old pedestrian struck down by a sedan on Main Street. A 63-year-old cyclist, hit and killed by a left-turning SUV on Bowne Street. The list goes on. Each one had a name. Each one is gone.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>The pain does not fade. &ldquo;I was holding on for my life back there,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bus-crane-collide-queens-village-4-people-injured/17016760/>said Emily McKinnon</a> after a crane slammed into her bus. She ran to help others, saw them crying, shaken. &ldquo;Even now I&rsquo;m scared to go on the bus again, but I have to take the bus to get to work.&rdquo; The street does not care. The next crash is always waiting.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h3><p>Council Member Sandra Ung has signed on to bills for <strong>speed humps</strong> and <strong>raised crosswalks</strong>, and backed a citywide greenway plan. She co-sponsored a bill to add lighting to step streets, and another to require DOT approval for sidewalk stands. These are steps, but small ones. When the Council voted to end jaywalking enforcement—a law that put blame on the victim—Ung was absent. She also backed a bill to ban e-scooter share, despite <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/17/queens-pols-have-lots-of-claims-about-the-evils-of-scooter-share-but-few-facts>data showing no serious injuries or deaths</a> and high ridership. The fight for the Eastern Queens Greenway drags on, fully funded but unfinished. The pavement cracks. Cyclists and walkers are forced into traffic. The promise of safety is still just a promise.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. It can finish the greenway. It can build real protection for people outside cars. <strong>Call Council Member Ung. Demand action.</strong> Demand streets where you do not have to hold on for your life. Demand that every name lost is the last.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The woman died at Long Island Jewish Hospital-Valley Stream; the man was expected to survive.

The matter highlights that 'bus service is a boon for business.' Council Member actions are not directly cited, but Mayor Adams faces criticism for failing to deliver on bus lane promises. DOT spokesperson Vin Barone said redesigning Flatbush could 'speed up bus service...while also enhancing pedestrian safety.' The report exposes how slow buses hurt working-class, Black, and female riders—many lose pay or jobs due to delays. Business opposition to bus lanes remains, despite evidence that most shoppers arrive by transit or foot.

However, DOT data contradicts their claims: since the program's June launch, 37,000 riders have taken 290,000 trips with no reported serious injuries or deaths.

Six are fully funded. Three lack $25 million. The Parks Department blames slow progress on agency overlap. Cyclists and walkers face broken paths and car danger. Advocates and Council Member Ung demand action, not excuses.</p><p class=mb3>This report covers the ongoing delay in completing the Eastern Queens Greenway, a project with $40 million allocated but no construction timeline. The Parks Department has not started work on nine segments, despite six being fully funded. Council Member Sandra Ung has prioritized funding for her district’s portion, stating, 'I am proud that today nearly the entire greenway through District 20 is fully funded.' Advocates like John Kelly and Joby Jacob push for transparency and urgency, warning, 'Now is the time to ensure that this great work isn't watered down or indefinitely delayed.' The Parks Department cites multi-agency involvement for the holdup. Meanwhile, existing paths crumble, forcing cyclists and pedestrians into traffic. The lack of progress leaves vulnerable road users exposed and the promise of safe passage unfulfilled.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The police report lists 'Following Too Closely' and 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' as contributing factors, both attributed to the SUV driver. The bus, a 2016 New Flyer, showed no damage and its driver was uninjured. The report makes no mention of any victim behavior contributing to the crash.

The narrative states he suffered crush injuries to his entire body yet remained conscious at the scene. The vehicle involved fled, leaving the man behind, his injuries described as 'entire body' and 'crush injuries.' The police report does not specify the type of vehicle, the direction of travel, or any contributing factors from the driver, but it makes clear the driver left the scene without stopping. No driver errors are explicitly listed in the data, but the act of fleeing after a collision is a grave systemic failure. No contributing factors are attributed to the pedestrian.
