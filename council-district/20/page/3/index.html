Twenty-one left with serious injuries.</strong> In the past year, District 20 saw 1,181 crashes. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about age. Two of the dead were over 75. One was a woman, 78, crossing Northern Boulevard at night. The driver did not stop. Police said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/woman-78-killed-queens-hit-and-run-driver/>&ldquo;A 78-year-old woman was fatally struck by a hit-and-run driver as she crossed a Queens street.&rdquo;</a> Her name was not released. The street remembers her.</p><p>Children are not spared. In March, a car struck a man and a child at 32nd Avenue and 138th Street. The man was pinned under the car. The child, between eight and ten, was also hit. Police found them both. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-pedestrians-hit-man-pinned-vehicle-child-injured-being-car/16014608/>&ldquo;Police responded&mldr;and found an adult man pinned under a vehicle.&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=who-bears-the-weight>Who Bears the Weight</h3><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the killing.</strong> Seven deaths and 19 serious injuries came from cars and SUVs. Trucks and buses hurt more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll. The street is a gauntlet for anyone not behind a wheel.</p><h3 id=sandra-ung-steps-and-silences>Sandra Ung: Steps and Silences</h3><p>Council Member Sandra Ung has signed on to bills for more lighting, speed humps, and safer crosswalks. She voted for a citywide greenway plan. She co-sponsored a study for tactile paving to help the blind. But when the Council voted to end jaywalking enforcement—a law that stops blaming the victim—Ung was absent. She backed a bill to ban e-scooter share, despite no deaths or serious injuries from the program, and despite city data showing <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/17/queens-pols-have-lots-of-claims-about-the-evils-of-scooter-share-but-few-facts>tens of thousands of safe rides</a>.</p><h3 id=the-road-ahead>The Road Ahead</h3><p><strong>The crisis is not random. It is built into the street.</strong> Residents must demand more. Call for a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings and real accountability for drivers. Contact Council Member Ung. Call the Mayor. Join <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a> and <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a>. <strong>Do not wait for another name to become a number.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The measure urges the New York State Legislature and Governor to require inspectors to fail any vehicle with a damaged or obstructed license plate. The resolution states: 'Obstructed and defaced license plates prevent cameras and law enforcement from identifying traffic offenders and impedes safe operating conditions on the road.' Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary sponsor), Lynn C. Schulman, Sandra Ung, Crystal Hudson, and Selvena N. Brooks-Powers back the bill. They want to close a gap that lets drivers dodge red light and speed cameras. The bill aims to stop offenders from hiding behind unreadable plates. It remains in committee, awaiting further action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the incident occurred near dusk as the man was 'working in the roadway' and 'stood upright.' The Infiniti, operated by a licensed male driver, moved in reverse and collided with the stationary SUV. The report lists 'Backing Unsafely' as the contributing factor, directly implicating the driver’s maneuver. The impact forced the SUV’s bumper against the man’s knee and lower leg, causing crush injuries. The police narrative notes the victim did not fall and remained conscious at the scene.
