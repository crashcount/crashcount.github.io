A minivan hit her and kept going. She died at the hospital. Police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/woman-78-killed-queens-hit-and-run-driver/>reported</a> that &ldquo;a 78-year-old woman was fatally struck by a hit-and-run driver as she crossed a Queens street.&rdquo; The street was wet with rain. The driver did not stop. No arrest. No justice.</p><p>Two days earlier, a man and a child stood at 32nd Avenue and 138th Street. A car hit them. The man was pinned under the car. The child, maybe eight or ten, was hurt too. Police <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-pedestrians-hit-man-pinned-vehicle-child-injured-being-car/16014608/>responded</a> and found an adult man pinned under a vehicle. Both went to the hospital. The driver stayed. The street stayed the same.</p><p><strong>In the last 12 months, District 20 saw 4 deaths, 19 serious injuries, and 656 people hurt in 1,166 crashes.</strong> The old, the young, the ones just trying to get home. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.</p><h2 id=leadership-small-steps-slow-change>Leadership: Small Steps, Slow Change</h2><p>Council Member Sandra Ung has signed her name to bills for more lighting on step streets, speed humps near parks, and solar crosswalks. She voted yes on a citywide greenway plan. She co-sponsored a bill to require DOT approval for sidewalk stands, aiming to keep sidewalks clear for people, not commerce. But when the Council voted to end jaywalking enforcement—a law that blamed the walker, not the driver—Ung was absent. She also backed a bill to ban e-scooter share, despite no deaths or serious injuries from the program, and strong safety records (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/17/queens-pols-have-lots-of-claims-about-the-evils-of-scooter-share-but-few-facts>cited here</a>).</p><p><strong>Some bills help. Some just study. Some shift blame.</strong> The greenway is funded, but not built. The step streets may get lights, but the main roads stay dark.</p><h2 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Every day, the street takes another.</strong> The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. It can fill the greenway gaps. It can redesign deadly crossings. But it will not, unless you force it. Call your council member. Demand action. Do not wait for the next siren.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Pedestrian flow comes first.</p><p class=mb3>Int 1272-2023, introduced by Council Member Sandra Ung and filed at session's end, landed in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on December 6, 2023. The bill reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to department of transportation approval prior to issuing or renewing a stoop line stand license.' Ung's bill would force the Department of Transportation to sign off before any stoop line stand gets a license or renewal. DOT must check for sidewalk blockages, consider pedestrian volume, and conduct site visits if a stand sits near a narrowing structure. If a stand is too wide and blocks the way, DOT can shrink it to four feet. The law puts the burden on businesses, not walkers. It aims to keep sidewalks open for people, not cluttered by commerce.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
