A minivan hit her and kept going. She died at the hospital. Police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/woman-78-killed-queens-hit-and-run-driver/>reported</a> that &ldquo;a 78-year-old woman was fatally struck by a hit-and-run driver as she crossed a Queens street.&rdquo; The street was wet with rain. The driver did not stop. No arrest. No justice.</p><p>Two days earlier, a man and a child stood at 32nd Avenue and 138th Street. A car hit them. The man was pinned under the car. The child, maybe eight or ten, was hurt too. Police <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-pedestrians-hit-man-pinned-vehicle-child-injured-being-car/16014608/>responded</a> and found an adult man pinned under a vehicle. Both went to the hospital. The driver stayed. The street stayed the same.</p><p><strong>In the last 12 months, District 20 saw 4 deaths, 19 serious injuries, and 656 people hurt in 1,166 crashes.</strong> The old, the young, the ones just trying to get home. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.</p><h2 id=leadership-small-steps-slow-change>Leadership: Small Steps, Slow Change</h2><p>Council Member Sandra Ung has signed her name to bills for more lighting on step streets, speed humps near parks, and solar crosswalks. She voted yes on a citywide greenway plan. She co-sponsored a bill to require DOT approval for sidewalk stands, aiming to keep sidewalks clear for people, not commerce. But when the Council voted to end jaywalking enforcement—a law that blamed the walker, not the driver—Ung was absent. She also backed a bill to ban e-scooter share, despite no deaths or serious injuries from the program, and strong safety records (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/17/queens-pols-have-lots-of-claims-about-the-evils-of-scooter-share-but-few-facts>cited here</a>).</p><p><strong>Some bills help. Some just study. Some shift blame.</strong> The greenway is funded, but not built. The step streets may get lights, but the main roads stay dark.</p><h2 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Every day, the street takes another.</strong> The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. It can fill the greenway gaps. It can redesign deadly crossings. But it will not, unless you force it. Call your council member. Demand action. Do not wait for the next siren.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report states she died of crush injuries and was not ejected from the vehicle. The narrative notes, 'No ejection. No skid marks. The car showed no damage. The road was silent. The body stayed where the night left it.' Police list the contributing factor as 'Unspecified.' No driver errors such as speeding, distraction, or failure to yield are cited in the available data. The vehicle, a 2019 Volkswagen sedan, had no visible damage and was reported to be going straight ahead at the time of the crash. The report does not mention any victim behavior as a contributing factor. The cause of the fatal crush injuries remains unexplained in the official account, leaving only the stark facts of loss and unanswered danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable. The law marks a shift: streets are for people, not just cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, co-sponsored by Council Members James Gennaro and Lynn Schulman, follows a press conference where lawmakers denounced the program as hazardous. Gennaro said, "The program, as designed, leads to chaos." Ung called her bill a last resort. Assembly Members Sam Berger and David Weprin, and Community Board 8 Chair Martha Taylor, joined the opposition, citing sidewalk clutter and lack of outreach. However, DOT data contradicts their claims: since the program's June launch, 37,000 riders have taken 290,000 trips with no reported serious injuries or deaths. DOT says it held 35 briefings and implemented parking corrals in dense areas. Despite high ridership and safety records, the bill seeks to end the program, centering political frustration over proven outcomes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
