Twenty-one left with serious injuries.</strong> In the past year, District 20 saw 1,181 crashes. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about age. Two of the dead were over 75. One was a woman, 78, crossing Northern Boulevard at night. The driver did not stop. Police said, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/15/woman-78-killed-queens-hit-and-run-driver/>&ldquo;A 78-year-old woman was fatally struck by a hit-and-run driver as she crossed a Queens street.&rdquo;</a> Her name was not released. The street remembers her.</p><p>Children are not spared. In March, a car struck a man and a child at 32nd Avenue and 138th Street. The man was pinned under the car. The child, between eight and ten, was also hit. Police found them both. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-pedestrians-hit-man-pinned-vehicle-child-injured-being-car/16014608/>&ldquo;Police responded&mldr;and found an adult man pinned under a vehicle.&rdquo;</a></p><h3 id=who-bears-the-weight>Who Bears the Weight</h3><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the killing.</strong> Seven deaths and 19 serious injuries came from cars and SUVs. Trucks and buses hurt more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll. The street is a gauntlet for anyone not behind a wheel.</p><h3 id=sandra-ung-steps-and-silences>Sandra Ung: Steps and Silences</h3><p>Council Member Sandra Ung has signed on to bills for more lighting, speed humps, and safer crosswalks. She voted for a citywide greenway plan. She co-sponsored a study for tactile paving to help the blind. But when the Council voted to end jaywalking enforcement—a law that stops blaming the victim—Ung was absent. She backed a bill to ban e-scooter share, despite no deaths or serious injuries from the program, and despite city data showing <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/17/queens-pols-have-lots-of-claims-about-the-evils-of-scooter-share-but-few-facts>tens of thousands of safe rides</a>.</p><h3 id=the-road-ahead>The Road Ahead</h3><p><strong>The crisis is not random. It is built into the street.</strong> Residents must demand more. Call for a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings and real accountability for drivers. Contact Council Member Ung. Call the Mayor.

Passenger Malnick described, "A bolt hit and then right away just the sound of glass exploding and glass all over me." The incident echoes previous cases: in 2019, falling debris from elevated tracks struck vehicles three times in a month. The MTA responded then by intensifying inspections, but the problem persists. The agency now says it is investigating and will inspect the area. The repeated incidents highlight ongoing risks from aging infrastructure above city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
