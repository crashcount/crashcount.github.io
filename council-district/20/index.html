The hours after dark hit hardest.</p><h3 id=where-the-street-breaks-people>Where the street breaks people</h3><ul><li>The <a href=#>Long Island Expressway</a> leads the harm ledger here: two deaths and 341 injuries tied to its reach in this district, according to city data (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li><a href=#>Northern Boulevard</a> shows two deaths and 128 injuries. <a href=#>College Point Boulevard</a> adds one death and 100 injuries. <a href=#>Main Street</a> holds 46 injury cases and six serious injuries (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li></ul><p>Night pushes the odds. From 8 p.m. to 11 p.m., the ledger spikes: 2 deaths at 8, 4 at 9, and 1 at 11, with steady serious injuries throughout the evening (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Most crashes cite “other” or inattention. Failure to yield still kills.</p><h3 id=names-corners-and-the-last-minute>Names, corners, and the last minute</h3><ul><li>June 10, 2024, Bowne Street at 41st Avenue: a 63‑year‑old woman on a bike was struck by a left‑turning SUV and died at the scene. City records list her as ejected, with head trauma (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4731666</a>).</li><li>March 14, 2025, Northern Boulevard at Parsons: a 78‑year‑old woman walking outside a crosswalk was hit by a westbound SUV and killed. The record is bare and cold: “Apparent Death” (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4799008</a>).</li><li>July 31, 2025, Hollis Court Boulevard at 50th Avenue: a 55‑year‑old woman on an e‑bike going straight.

But much comes after the harm. In 2023, a man drove the wrong way on the Clearview and smashed into five cars. “Joseph Lee terrorized other drivers,” Queens DA Melinda Katz said. A jury convicted him. He got eight years. Lee told police he entered the expressway “in the wrong direction because I wanted to hurt people” (<a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY</a>).</p><p>On the streets here, SUVs and sedans dominate pedestrian injuries: 287 tied to SUVs and 196 to sedans, with most of the deaths among those modes. Trucks and buses add to the count, but they are not the main share (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=what-would-stop-the-bleeding-at-these-corners>What would stop the bleeding at these corners?</h3><ul><li>Hardened left turns and daylighting at Bowne/41st and Northern/Parsons.

Clear the sightlines (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>Nighttime fixes at the late‑hour peaks: lighting, signal timing, and focused enforcement where the 8–11 p.m. deaths stack up (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>Finish the Eastern Queens Greenway gaps that force people into traffic. Funding is there; timelines are not. “Nearly the entire greenway through District 20 is fully funded,” Council Member Sandra Ung said. Advocates warn delays leave people exposed (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/07/19/city-must-finally-fill-eastern-queens-greenway-gaps-advocates>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</li></ul><h3 id=citywide-levers-that-save-lives-here>Citywide levers that save lives here</h3><p>Speed still decides who lives. The city can lower its residential limit under Sammy’s Law. Our own reporting lays out the path and the stakes, including speed cameras renewed and a bill to force repeat speeders to use limiters. The math is stark: small drops in speed mean survival. Read the plan and act (<a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>).</p><p>Police chases add danger. The NYPD tightened pursuit rules in 2025 after crashes and deaths tied to chases; state officials called for change, noting the risks to everyone on the road (<a href=https://apnews.com/article/9aa3cc475f278beed3ba1ecd02d444f7>AP</a>).</p><p>This district cannot carry more names. Lower speeds. Safer turns. Finished paths. The numbers are already written. What comes next is choice.</p><p>—</p><p>If you want slower streets and fewer funerals, take one step today.
