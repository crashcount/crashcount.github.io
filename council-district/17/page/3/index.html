Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz stated, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." The crash damaged the overpass wall and scattered debris onto the street below. No injuries were reported, though conflicting accounts left passenger presence unclear. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz highlighted the broader issue: "We’re seeing all over the city parking regulations not being enforced." The incident underscores the risks posed by illegal parking and the need for stricter enforcement and infrastructure checks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Council’s action, described as 'watering down' the mayor’s plan, keeps mandatory parking in low-density neighborhoods while ending it in central areas. The matter summary states: 'ending mandatory parking in areas with the best transit while keeping the costly mandate in low-density neighborhoods where it most hinders development.' Council Member Crystal Hudson voted yes, urging all neighborhoods to share the housing burden. Council Member Kevin Riley defended single-family zones. Council Member Rafael Salamanca cited balancing concerns and securing $5 billion for affordable housing. Borough President Antonio Reynoso warned of increased housing pressure elsewhere. The Council’s changes preserve car-centric zoning, leaving vulnerable road users exposed and limiting progress on safer, less car-dependent streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities.

Council Members Amanda Faris, Kevin C. Riley, Rafael Salamanca, and Kristy Marmorato all pressed for developers to include parking, despite the city's move to waive mandates. Riley called parking 'a huge issue.' Developers, including Baker Development, promised up to 200 spaces per project. Bronx City Planning Director Paul Philips said, 'We certainly expect developers to provide parking.' The debate ignored the danger more parking brings: more cars, more conflict, more risk for people walking and biking.

Seven bills target reckless e-bike riding, battery fires, and low pay. Lawmakers want apps to answer for worker traffic violations and vehicle safety. Pedestrians and cyclists face daily danger. Councilmember Schulman called for accountability.</p><p class=mb3>On June 21, 2024, the NYC Council's Committee on Consumer and Worker Protection held a hearing on seven bills regulating delivery apps. The bills aim to address 'myriad health and safety concerns' from e-bike crashes, battery fires, and low pay. Councilmember Lynn Schulman, District 29, spoke out: 'Right now, delivery workers are essentially incentivized for speed... This often results in driving recklessly, often putting the lives of pedestrians at risk.' Three bills would make apps like Uber Eats and DoorDash responsible for vehicle safety and compliance, require them to provide safety-compliant e-bikes, and ensure mopeds are registered. Other bills target pay transparency and tip protections. Councilmembers Shaun Abreu and Rafael Salamanca also spoke in support. The measures seek to hold companies accountable for dangers faced by vulnerable road users and delivery workers alike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
