Police say a 21‑year‑old in a Mercedes tried to pass, hit a Volkswagen, then struck two bikes. Both riders, Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19, and Enrique Martinez, 21, died. Prosecutors charged the driver with vehicular manslaughter and DWI. “He was drunk,” a sister said in court. “Two people were killed.” <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Gothamist</a>. “How could they let him go?” their mother asked. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>NY Daily News</a>.</p><p>The highway closed near Gun Hill.

The matter summary states: 'ending mandatory parking in areas with the best transit while keeping the costly mandate in low-density neighborhoods where it most hinders development.' Council Member Crystal Hudson voted yes, urging all neighborhoods to share the housing burden. Council Member Kevin Riley defended single-family zones. Council Member Rafael Salamanca cited balancing concerns and securing $5 billion for affordable housing. Borough President Antonio Reynoso warned of increased housing pressure elsewhere. The Council’s changes preserve car-centric zoning, leaving vulnerable road users exposed and limiting progress on safer, less car-dependent streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
