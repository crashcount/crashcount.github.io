Police say a 21‑year‑old in a Mercedes tried to pass a Volkswagen, hit it, then struck two motorcycles. Both riders, Manuel Amarante Penalo, 19, and Enrique Martinez, 21, were thrown and died at the hospital. The driver was arrested and charged with vehicular manslaughter and DWI, according to the Bronx DA’s complaint. He refused a chemical test. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Police told reporters</a> the southbound lanes near E. 223rd St. shut down for hours.</p><p>“<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>Two people were killed. He was drunk</a>,” the sister said in court. “He’s just walking freely?” The lawyer said, “<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>My client is prepared to contest these charges</a>.”</p><p>CBS said the car “struck two men on scooters,” and both died. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/driver-arrested-in-bronx-river-parkway-fatal-crash/>Police arrested the driver</a>.</p><p><strong>District 17’s body count</strong></p><p>In Council District 17 since 2022, at least 30 people have been killed and 3,686 injured in 6,319 crashes. Heavy hours stack up at night. From 9 p.m. to midnight, deaths hit hard, with spikes at 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. Serious injuries peak from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City data shows the pattern</a>.</p><p>The toll falls heaviest on people outside the car. Pedestrians: 10 dead, 653 hurt. Cyclists: 5 dead, 288 hurt. Another two people on mopeds and motorcycles died, with 116 injured. Cars and SUVs do most of the harm. Trucks and buses add weight. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The dataset records the modes</a>.</p><p>Top danger blocks sit on <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Westchester Avenue</a> and <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>East 163rd Street</a>. One man, 56, died at East 163rd and Westchester in 2024. A Ford SUV going straight struck him in the crosswalk, the record says. The plates were from Texas. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The crash file is public</a>.</p><p><strong>Night streets, hard edges</strong></p><p>The hours between 9 p.m. and 3 a.m. draw blood. At 11 p.m., injuries peak; serious injuries climb. After midnight, the deaths do not stop. District data flags “nighttime conditions” and “repeat hotspots.” The map does not lie. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>It’s in the city ledger</a>.</p><p>Reported contributing factors stack this way: “other” leads the count with 13 deaths; “vulnerable road user error” shows 6; “disregarded traffic control” adds another death. Speed shows up less in reports than it does on the pavement. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Those categories come from the city files</a>.</p><p><strong>What the Bronx has heard, and what it hasn’t</strong></p><p>DOT leadership in the Bronx has wobbled. At a 2023 hearing, Council Member Rafael Salamanca pressed DOT: “<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/13/amid-rash-of-crashes-theres-no-bronx-borough-commissioner-for-dot>There is no borough commissioner in the borough of the Bronx</a>. Please speed it up.” He has also backed street safety bills, including fast removal of abandoned cars that block sightlines and crosswalks. He voted yes. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>The bill passed the Council</a>.</p><p>At another hearing, Council leaders attacked proven redesigns, despite data showing fewer crashes and injuries. Salamanca warned about congestion from a Bronx project. DOT said the projects save lives. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/03/19/cycle-of-rage-council-members-slam-dot-for-successful-safety-projects>The exchange is on the record</a>.</p><p><strong>Fix the blocks that keep killing</strong></p><p>The tools are basic. Daylight the corners at Westchester and East 163rd. Harden the turns on Southern Boulevard. Add leading pedestrian intervals and give walkers the head start. Mark and protect bike space where the injuries pile up. Target the late‑night hours on the repeat corridors with enforcement that sticks. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>District 17’s own hotspot list points the way</a>.</p><p>Citywide, the road is clear too. <strong>Lower the default speed limit</strong>. Albany gave the city that power. The city has not used it fully. <strong>Force repeat speeders to slow down</strong> with intelligent speed assistance for the worst plates. The bills exist. The victims do too. <a href=../../take_action/>Here’s how to push it</a>.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report states the woman driving the sedan did not stop after the collision. The infant suffered crush injuries to his entire body and was conscious but injured. Police cite 'Aggressive Driving/Road Rage' and 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as contributing factors in the crash. The report notes the child was a pedestrian not at an intersection, engaged in 'Other Actions in Roadway,' but lists driver errors first and foremost. The sedan sustained no damage, and the driver was licensed. The incident underscores the lethal consequences of aggressive driving and a driver’s failure to yield, with a vulnerable child left injured in the street.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The man suffered severe crush injuries to his neck and was found conscious but gravely hurt in the street. The police report lists 'Pavement Slippery' and 'Brakes Defective' as contributing factors to the crash.

The bus crashed into the wall, breaking through and leaving debris below. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz said, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." No injuries were reported, but the crash caused structural damage. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz noted, "That’s a very big bus, so even going very slowly, it can do a lot of damage," highlighting the risk of lax parking enforcement. The incident underscores systemic issues: double-parking and weak infrastructure can combine to threaten lives, even when no one is hurt.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The police report lists 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as the primary contributing factor, highlighting the driver's failure to obey the traffic signal. The impact crushed the girl's leg beneath the vehicle's front end. The report notes she remained conscious at the scene. No victim behavior is cited as a contributing factor.

The impact crushed a 32-year-old man working in the street, breaking his leg. The report states the man remained conscious after suffering severe crush injuries to his lower leg and foot.

The matter summary states: 'ending mandatory parking in areas with the best transit while keeping the costly mandate in low-density neighborhoods where it most hinders development.' Council Member Crystal Hudson voted yes, urging all neighborhoods to share the housing burden. Council Member Kevin Riley defended single-family zones. Council Member Rafael Salamanca cited balancing concerns and securing $5 billion for affordable housing. Borough President Antonio Reynoso warned of increased housing pressure elsewhere.

Council Members Amanda Faris, Kevin C. Riley, Rafael Salamanca, and Kristy Marmorato all pressed for developers to include parking, despite the city's move to waive mandates. Riley called parking 'a huge issue.' Developers, including Baker Development, promised up to 200 spaces per project. Bronx City Planning Director Paul Philips said, 'We certainly expect developers to provide parking.' The debate ignored the danger more parking brings: more cars, more conflict, more risk for people walking and biking.
