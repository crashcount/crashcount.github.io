The curb is not safe.</p><p>A man named Melvin Pemberton heard the crash and turned. &ldquo;Once I heard the noise I turned around and it was already on the curb. It immediately backed up and fled.

He co-sponsored bills to tow abandoned cars and target fake plates. He pushed for NYCHA sidewalk repairs. But when the city redesigned Bronx streets to slow cars and protect people, Salamanca <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/03/19/cycle-of-rage-council-members-slam-dot-for-successful-safety-projects>complained about congestion</a>—even as crash rates fell.</p><p>He demanded more accountability from DOT, but missed a key vote on the citywide greenway plan.

The contributing factor listed is 'Traffic Control Disregarded.' This means a driver ignored a traffic signal, a critical error that led to the crash. The impact was severe: a 21-year-old woman, riding as a front passenger, was killed. Her injuries were described as affecting her entire body, and she was pronounced dead at the scene. The report notes a parked box truck was present but was not involved in the collision. No driver or vehicle errors are attributed to the victim. The fatal outcome stemmed from a driver’s failure to obey traffic controls, as documented by police.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'Transit-Oriented Bronx Developments Will Have Ample Parking, Developers Tell Council,' focused on whether to require parking in new residential and commercial projects. Council Members Amanda Faris, Kevin C. Riley, Rafael Salamanca, and Kristy Marmorato all pressed for developers to include parking, despite the city's move to waive mandates. Riley called parking 'a huge issue.' Developers, including Baker Development, promised up to 200 spaces per project. Bronx City Planning Director Paul Philips said, 'We certainly expect developers to provide parking.' The debate ignored the danger more parking brings: more cars, more conflict, more risk for people walking and biking. No safety analyst weighed in, but the outcome is clear—transit-oriented in name, car-centric in practice.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Both the right rear passenger and the driver, men aged 50 and 37, were conscious but suffered crush injuries to their entire bodies and required extrication. Airbags deployed, but the force of the impact left both men trapped in the twisted metal. The police report does not list any victim behavior as a contributing factor.

The bills aim to address 'myriad health and safety concerns' from e-bike crashes, battery fires, and low pay. Councilmember Lynn Schulman, District 29, spoke out: 'Right now, delivery workers are essentially incentivized for speed... This often results in driving recklessly, often putting the lives of pedestrians at risk.' Three bills would make apps like Uber Eats and DoorDash responsible for vehicle safety and compliance, require them to provide safety-compliant e-bikes, and ensure mopeds are registered. Other bills target pay transparency and tip protections. Councilmembers Shaun Abreu and Rafael Salamanca also spoke in support. The measures seek to hold companies accountable for dangers faced by vulnerable road users and delivery workers alike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The deal emerged during negotiations over the 'City of Yes for Economic Opportunity' zoning plan, which the Council approved. The matter summary notes, 'the administration has pledged to support future legislation to cut pollution from these warehouses and propose rules to restrict new facilities.' Councilmember Alexa Avilés (District 38) and 28 colleagues sent a letter demanding stricter oversight. Avilés and advocates want special permits and environmental reviews to protect neighborhoods from traffic, pollution, and safety hazards. Deputy Mayor Maria Torres-Springer promised a bill empowering the Department of Environmental Protection to regulate warehouse vehicle emissions. Councilmember Rafael Salamanca Jr. stressed the Council’s leverage: 'It gets to a point where you have to use your power of voting to get the attention of the city.' The City Planning Commission and Council must vote again before rules take effect.

The hearing, led by Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers (D-Queens), Christopher Banks (D-Brooklyn), and Rafael Salamanca Jr. (D-Bronx), focused on the DOT's progress under the Streets Plan, which mandates annual targets for protected bike lanes and bus lanes. Brooks-Powers objected to the Seagirt Boulevard bike lane, claiming DOT ignored community wishes, despite previously calling for more investment. Banks demanded removal of new protected bike lanes in East New York, citing parking and safety issues, though data showed fewer crashes and injuries. Salamanca criticized a Bronx street redesign for congestion, despite lower crash rates. He also accused DOT of neglecting communities of color, though data shows these areas receive more redesigns. DOT officials defended their process, emphasizing community engagement and prioritizing high-need areas. The council's opposition stands in stark contrast to the projects' proven safety benefits for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
