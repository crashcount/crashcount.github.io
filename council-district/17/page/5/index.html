The clock ticks.</p><p class=mb3>On September 13, 2023, the City Council held an oversight hearing on the Department of Transportation’s leadership and street safety in the Bronx. Council Member Rafael Salamanca (D-Concourse Village) pressed DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, stating, "There is no borough commissioner in the borough of the Bronx." The Bronx has lacked a permanent commissioner since November 2021. Salamanca demanded a timeline for filling the role, arguing, "There needs to be a level of accountability and our level of accountability is reaching out to that borough commissioner. Please speed it up." DOT responded that street safety projects are not planned or implemented by borough commissioners, but Salamanca insisted the vacancy leaves the Bronx exposed as crashes and injuries rise. All other boroughs have commissioners. The Bronx waits for leadership as danger mounts.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill slaps heavy fines on dealers selling sham tags. Lawmakers say ghost cars dodge cameras, endanger streets, and let reckless drivers vanish. The crackdown aims to stop the chaos.</p><p class=mb3>Intro 988, introduced on April 11, 2023, targets the sale of fake license plates in New York City. The bill, sponsored by Oswald Feliz, Marjorie Velázquez, and Lincoln Restler, amends laws to ban selling counterfeit tags, with fines starting at $1,000 for first offenses and $2,000 for repeat violations. The measure was brought before the City Council and discussed at a City Hall press conference. The matter summary states the bill 'goes after the unscrupulous used car dealers profiting considerably off a huge black market for phony tags.' Restler, as a sponsor, joins efforts to curb the spread of ghost cars, which evade speed cameras and tolls, making streets more dangerous for everyone. Lawmakers stress that the goal is deterrence, not revenue, and call for further action from online marketplaces and federal agencies.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
