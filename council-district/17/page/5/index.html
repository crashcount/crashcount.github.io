Sixteen left with injuries so grave they may never walk right again.</strong> In the last year alone, over a thousand hurt. The dead are not numbers. They are fathers, mothers, workers, neighbors. A 43-year-old man, struck and left to die on Webster Avenue. His friend <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/bronx-fatal-accident-43-year-old-man-killed-hit-run-morrisania/16375922/>remembered</a>, &ldquo;That was like my brother. He remember he was a good guy, a family guy. A whole father.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists bear the brunt.</strong> Trucks, SUVs, sedans—they kill and maim. The street does not care if you are crossing at the light or in the dark. In April, a hospital worker was hit and killed after his shift. His family <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/06/bronx-hospital-worker-buy-socks-van-driver-struck-him/>pleaded</a>, &ldquo;There has to be a cross guard over there for the pedestrian to cross the street safely and for the loved one of everybody to get home with no problem, for something like Inza to never happen again.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=salamancas-record-steps-and-stalls>Salamanca’s Record: Steps and Stalls</h3><p><strong>Council Member Rafael Salamanca Jr. has taken some steps.</strong> He co-sponsored bills to tow abandoned and unregistered vehicles, and to speed up sidewalk repairs at NYCHA sites—moves that could clear hazards for walkers. He voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that too often punished the vulnerable instead of protecting them. But he missed the vote on the citywide greenway plan, a key measure for safe routes for those outside a car.</p><p><strong>He has also backed bills that target e-bike riders and raise fines for dirt bikes and ATVs.</strong> These may sound tough, but they do little to stop the real killers—cars and trucks. The street remains deadly for those on foot and bike. The most dangerous vehicles still rule the road.</p><h3 id=the-call-demand-more-than-words>The Call: Demand More Than Words</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay, every missed vote, every half-measure costs lives. The council member has shown he can act. Now he must do more.</p><p><strong>Call Rafael Salamanca Jr. Demand he fight for lower speed limits, protected crossings, and real accountability for reckless drivers.</strong> Do not wait for another name on the list. Do not let the street take another father, sister, or child.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
