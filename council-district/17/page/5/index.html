Six people, ages 30 to 79, were crossing with the light. The car hit one, then plowed through scaffolding, striking five more. The driver and passenger ran. The street was left with pain and panic. “People were yelling, were in pain, so yelling, crying, it was very upsetting,” <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>said Vivian Cole</a>. All six went to Lincoln Hospital. None died this time. But the scars remain.</p><p>This is not rare. In the last twelve months, District 17 saw <strong>8 deaths and 1,003 injuries</strong> from crashes. Nineteen people were seriously hurt. Most were walking or biking. The numbers do not heal. They only grow.</p><h3 id=trucks-suvs-and-the-weight-of-policy>Trucks, SUVs, and the Weight of Policy</h3><p>Trucks and SUVs do the most harm. In three years, cars and SUVs killed seven, trucks and buses killed one, motorcycles and mopeds killed one, and bikes killed none. The city’s streets are not safe for the unprotected. The data is clear. The pain is real.</p><h3 id=salamanca-votes-silence-and-the-need-for-action>Salamanca: Votes, Silence, and the Need for Action</h3><p>Council Member Rafael Salamanca Jr. has taken some steps. He voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the desperate and the poor. He co-sponsored bills to tow abandoned cars and target fake plates. He pushed for sidewalk repairs at NYCHA sites. But when the city mapped new greenways, he was absent. When DOT redesigned Bronx streets to save lives, he <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/03/19/cycle-of-rage-council-members-slam-dot-for-successful-safety-projects>complained about congestion</a>, not danger. He called for a Bronx DOT commissioner, but the streets stayed deadly. The work is not done.</p><h3 id=the-call-demand-more-demand-now>The Call: Demand More, Demand Now</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable. Every death is a failure.</strong> Call Salamanca. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit, real protected bike lanes, and enforcement that targets the reckless, not the vulnerable. “We thought it was a bomb or something, because we are all panicking around here,” <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>said Christina Sieh</a>. The panic will not end until the killing does. <strong>Act now.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Council Member Carmen N. De La Rosa led as primary sponsor, joined by Salamanca, Louis, Brewer, Joseph, Yeger, Dinowitz, and Sanchez.
