On June 27, a driver ran a red light, crashed into another car, and plowed into pedestrians. One man, 33, is fighting for his life. The driver ran. Police caught him. He faces charges for vehicular assault and fleeing. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/driver-flees-bronx-car-stop-crash/>&ldquo;Jenkins slammed on the gas and sped off east on Hunts Point Ave., blowing through a red light,&rdquo; police said.</a></p><p>This is not rare. In the last year, District 17 saw 8 deaths and 983 injuries from crashes. Nineteen people were seriously hurt. Most victims were on foot or riding bikes. The numbers do not heal. They do not bury the dead.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-broken-promises>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and Broken Promises</h3><p>Cars and SUVs do the most harm. In three years, they killed 7 people and injured hundreds more. Trucks and buses killed at least one. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll, but the weight of death comes on four wheels.</p><p>The pattern is old. A man was crushed by a truck on Oak Point Avenue in April. A 52-year-old was killed by SUVs on Morris Avenue. A cyclist died under a bus at East 149th. The sidewalk is not safe. The crosswalk is not safe. The numbers keep rising.</p><h3 id=salamanca-some-steps-too-much-silence>Salamanca: Some Steps, Too Much Silence</h3><p>Council Member Rafael Salamanca Jr. has taken some steps. He voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that blamed victims and targeted the poor. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>He voted yes to &ldquo;legalize jaywalking, improving overall pedestrian safety.&rdquo;</a> He co-sponsored bills to fix NYCHA sidewalks and tow abandoned cars. But he missed the vote on the citywide greenway plan. He backed bills to license e-bikes and scooters—measures that risk shifting blame to the most vulnerable.</p><p>The streets are still killing. The bills are not enough. The dead cannot wait for another study or another press release.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</h3><p>Call Salamanca. Call the Mayor. Call DOT. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes and safe crossings. Demand action for the living, not excuses for the dead. The next victim is already walking your street.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
