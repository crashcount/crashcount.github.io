The curb is not safe.</p><p>A man named Melvin Pemberton heard the crash and turned. &ldquo;Once I heard the noise I turned around and it was already on the curb. It immediately backed up and fled.

He co-sponsored bills to tow abandoned cars and target fake plates. He pushed for NYCHA sidewalk repairs. But when the city redesigned Bronx streets to slow cars and protect people, Salamanca <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/03/19/cycle-of-rage-council-members-slam-dot-for-successful-safety-projects>complained about congestion</a>—even as crash rates fell.</p><p>He demanded more accountability from DOT, but missed a key vote on the citywide greenway plan.
