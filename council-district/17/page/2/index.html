Trucks and buses add to the toll (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Vehicles/bm4k-52h4>NYC Open Data</a>). Nights are rough. The small‑hours show repeated deaths around 1–6 AM, with more again late at night (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=bruckner-westchester-163rd-danger-you-can-map>Bruckner, Westchester, 163rd: danger you can map</h3><p>The hit‑and‑run that killed Lopez de Rodriguez happened at Bruckner and Leggett. Other hot spots stack up: Westchester Avenue and East 163rd Street both show heavy injury counts in this district (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The patterns repeat. The bodies do not.</p><p>Targeted fixes are not exotic: daylight the corners, give pedestrians a head start, harden turns, slow the turns, and tame truck movements on Bruckner‑adjacent streets. Nighttime enforcement where the deaths cluster would meet the problem where it lives. These are standard tools; the question is will they be used here.</p><h3 id=the-record-says-urgency-the-street-says-wait>The record says urgency. The street says wait.</h3><p>Since 2024, year‑to‑date crashes in this district are rising against last year’s pace, with injuries and serious injuries also higher (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). That is the backdrop to a mother dying in a crosswalk on Bruckner Boulevard.</p><p>Even at safer‑street hearings, Bronx leaders have had to beg for basic attention. “There is no borough commissioner in the borough of the Bronx… Please speed it up,” Council Member Rafael Salamanca Jr. told DOT at a 2023 oversight hearing (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/13/amid-rash-of-crashes-theres-no-bronx-borough-commissioner-for-dot>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>Salamanca has backed some steps at City Hall, like clearing abandoned cars that block sightlines and put people at risk, which the Council passed in 2025 (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council Legistar</a>). But Bruckner and Westchester still chew people up. Nights still take them.</p><h3 id=slow-the-cars-stop-the-worst>Slow the cars. Stop the worst.</h3><p>District 17’s harm concentrates after dark and on fast, wide roads. That points to citywide fixes as well as corner work. Lower speeds save lives. Reining in repeat speeders does too. New York has the tools on the table; New Yorkers can demand they get used. Our guide to next steps is <a href=/take_action/>here</a>.</p><p>Council Member <a href=/council-district/17/>Rafael Salamanca Jr.</a> represents this area. In Albany, the district’s lawmakers are Assembly Member Chantel Jackson and State Senator Jose Serrano. They know these streets. They know these names. The ask is simple and public: slow the cars, and stop the drivers who will not slow down. Start where people keep dying. Start on Bruckner.</p><p>One woman tried to cross the road.

The project, backed by the Economic Development Corporation and Council Member Rafael Salamanca, aims to move food by boat and e-cargo trike instead of trucks. The matter summary states: 'Replacing truck trips with boat trips and cargo bikes is a key feature of the city's urgent push to shift cargo trips out of big trucks.' EDC President Andrew Kimball said, 'The goal is, over time, to move more and more of this food out of Hunts Point not by truck, but by water with e-cargo trikes.' The dock will remove one thousand trucks per month from South Bronx streets. Officials plan to expand docks citywide. The bill’s status is an active infrastructure rollout, not a legislative vote.

The street bore the scars.</p><p class=mb3>ABC7 reported on April 16, 2025, that a stolen car, pursued by police, slammed into three parked cars on Seward Avenue in the Bronx. The impact hospitalized two people, including Robert Perez, who said, "It pushed me six feet. I hit my leg and my back." Another victim described being "more in shock" than pain. The driver, identified as Angel Colon, fled on foot but was arrested nearby. The crash damaged several vehicles and disrupted a quiet afternoon. Police charged Colon with grand larceny and criminal possession of stolen property. The incident highlights the risks posed by high-speed chases and the vulnerability of people simply sitting in parked cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
