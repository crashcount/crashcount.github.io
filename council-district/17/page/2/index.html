One thousand trucks a month will vanish from Bronx streets. Boats and cargo bikes will haul food across the city. Less diesel. Fewer big rigs. The city shifts freight off the road, onto water.</p><p class=mb3>On April 23, 2025, city officials and Con Agg Global announced a new floating freight dock at the Hunts Point Food Distribution Center. The project, backed by the Economic Development Corporation and Council Member Rafael Salamanca, aims to move food by boat and e-cargo trike instead of trucks. The matter summary states: 'Replacing truck trips with boat trips and cargo bikes is a key feature of the city's urgent push to shift cargo trips out of big trucks.' EDC President Andrew Kimball said, 'The goal is, over time, to move more and more of this food out of Hunts Point not by truck, but by water with e-cargo trikes.' The dock will remove one thousand trucks per month from South Bronx streets. Officials plan to expand docks citywide. The bill’s status is an active infrastructure rollout, not a legislative vote. No direct safety analyst assessment was provided, but the shift promises fewer trucks where people walk and ride.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The truck was undamaged.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a flatbed truck made a right turn at the corner of Franklin Avenue and East 169th Street. The truck’s right front bumper struck a 65-year-old woman as she crossed the intersection. The impact knocked her down, and the truck continued forward, rolling over her legs and causing fatal crush injuries. The report states the truck sustained no damage. The driver’s actions are listed as 'unspecified' in the contributing factors, but the narrative details the truck’s movement and its direct role in the fatal outcome. The report notes the woman was 'crossing against the light,' but this is mentioned after describing the truck’s maneuver and impact. The focus remains on the truck’s turn and the systemic danger posed by large vehicles at intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
