The project, backed by the Economic Development Corporation and Council Member Rafael Salamanca, aims to move food by boat and e-cargo trike instead of trucks. The matter summary states: 'Replacing truck trips with boat trips and cargo bikes is a key feature of the city's urgent push to shift cargo trips out of big trucks.' EDC President Andrew Kimball said, 'The goal is, over time, to move more and more of this food out of Hunts Point not by truck, but by water with e-cargo trikes.' The dock will remove one thousand trucks per month from South Bronx streets. Officials plan to expand docks citywide. The bill’s status is an active infrastructure rollout, not a legislative vote.

The report states the cyclist, age 57, was struck mid-frame by the bus, ejected, and suffered fatal pelvic injuries, dying at the scene. The police report lists 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' as a contributing factor, highlighting a critical driver error in the crash. The cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this detail is mentioned only after the primary fault attributed to improper lane usage by the vehicle operator. The collision underscores the lethal consequences of driver mistakes and the vulnerability of those outside steel and glass.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
