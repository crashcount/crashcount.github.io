Twenty-five suffered injuries so severe they changed lives. The numbers do not rest. They climb, year after year.</p><p>Just last week, a 44-year-old woman was killed crossing West 174th Street in Morris Heights. The driver did not stop. Police are still searching for the car. A <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/woman-killed-in-bronx-hit-and-run/>Bronx woman is dead after a hit-and-run in Morris Heights</a>. The story is old, but the pain is fresh. Another neighbor gone. Another family left behind.</p><p>On the same night, another woman was struck and killed by an SUV turning into a driveway. A witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/07/suv-driver-turning-into-driveway-of-bronx-apartment-building-fatally-strikes-woman/>said the driver &ldquo;just rolled over that woman and killed her.&rdquo;</a> The driver left through a back exit. No arrest. No answers.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-behind-the-names>The Numbers Behind the Names</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the killing.</strong> In District 17, they caused 7 deaths and 13 serious injuries to pedestrians and cyclists since 2022. Trucks and buses added another death and six serious injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds killed one, seriously injuring one more. Bikes hurt, but they did not kill.</p><p>The pain is not spread evenly. Children, elders, workers—all are at risk. In the last year, 127 people under 18 were injured. Four people over 55 died. The streets are not safe for anyone who walks, rides, or waits at the curb.</p><h3 id=salamancas-record-some-steps-not-enough>Salamanca’s Record: Some Steps, Not Enough</h3><p>Council Member Rafael Salamanca Jr. has voted for bills to clear abandoned cars and improve street markings. He pressed the city to fill the Bronx DOT commissioner vacancy, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/13/amid-rash-of-crashes-theres-no-bronx-borough-commissioner-for-dot>saying there needs to be a level of accountability and urging the city to speed it up</a>. He backed new fines for illegal ATVs and supported regulating last-mile warehouses to cut truck traffic. But when the city redesigned streets to slow cars and save lives, Salamanca warned about congestion and pushed back, even as crash rates fell.</p><p><strong>The councilmember has taken some steps. But the blood on the street says it is not enough.</strong></p><h3 id=the-call-demand-action-now>The Call: Demand Action Now</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay means another life at risk.</strong> Call Council Member Salamanca. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand action, not excuses. The dead cannot speak.

The project, backed by the Economic Development Corporation and Council Member Rafael Salamanca, aims to move food by boat and e-cargo trike instead of trucks. The matter summary states: 'Replacing truck trips with boat trips and cargo bikes is a key feature of the city's urgent push to shift cargo trips out of big trucks.' EDC President Andrew Kimball said, 'The goal is, over time, to move more and more of this food out of Hunts Point not by truck, but by water with e-cargo trikes.' The dock will remove one thousand trucks per month from South Bronx streets. Officials plan to expand docks citywide. The bill’s status is an active infrastructure rollout, not a legislative vote.
