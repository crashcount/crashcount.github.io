Six people, ages 30 to 79, were crossing with the light. The car hit one, then plowed through scaffolding, striking five more. The driver and passenger ran. The street was left with pain and panic. “People were yelling, were in pain, so yelling, crying, it was very upsetting,” <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>said Vivian Cole</a>. All six went to Lincoln Hospital. None died this time. But the scars remain.</p><p>This is not rare. In the last twelve months, District 17 saw <strong>8 deaths and 1,003 injuries</strong> from crashes. Nineteen people were seriously hurt. Most were walking or biking. The numbers do not heal. They only grow.</p><h3 id=trucks-suvs-and-the-weight-of-policy>Trucks, SUVs, and the Weight of Policy</h3><p>Trucks and SUVs do the most harm. In three years, cars and SUVs killed seven, trucks and buses killed one, motorcycles and mopeds killed one, and bikes killed none. The city’s streets are not safe for the unprotected. The data is clear. The pain is real.</p><h3 id=salamanca-votes-silence-and-the-need-for-action>Salamanca: Votes, Silence, and the Need for Action</h3><p>Council Member Rafael Salamanca Jr. has taken some steps. He voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the desperate and the poor. He co-sponsored bills to tow abandoned cars and target fake plates. He pushed for sidewalk repairs at NYCHA sites. But when the city mapped new greenways, he was absent. When DOT redesigned Bronx streets to save lives, he <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/03/19/cycle-of-rage-council-members-slam-dot-for-successful-safety-projects>complained about congestion</a>, not danger. He called for a Bronx DOT commissioner, but the streets stayed deadly. The work is not done.</p><h3 id=the-call-demand-more-demand-now>The Call: Demand More, Demand Now</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable. Every death is a failure.</strong> Call Salamanca. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit, real protected bike lanes, and enforcement that targets the reckless, not the vulnerable. “We thought it was a bomb or something, because we are all panicking around here,” <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>said Christina Sieh</a>. The panic will not end until the killing does. <strong>Act now.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bus crashed into the wall, breaking through and leaving debris below. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz said, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." No injuries were reported, but the crash caused structural damage. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz noted, "That’s a very big bus, so even going very slowly, it can do a lot of damage," highlighting the risk of lax parking enforcement.

According to the police report, the collision occurred as the bus was merging and the pedestrian was in the roadway. The report lists 'View Obstructed/Limited' as a contributing factor, highlighting a failure in visibility or driver awareness. The bus sustained no damage and continued on, while the pedestrian remained conscious despite severe injuries. The police narrative states, 'Steel met flesh. His shoulder crushed beneath the weight. He stayed awake. The bus rolled on, unmarked.' The data does not cite any pedestrian behavior as a contributing factor. The focus remains on the systemic danger posed by limited visibility and the actions of the bus driver in a merging maneuver.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable. The law marks a shift: streets are for people, not just cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
