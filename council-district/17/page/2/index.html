The driver and passenger ran. The street was left with blood and broken glass. &ldquo;People were yelling, were in pain, so yelling, crying, it was very upsetting,&rdquo; a witness <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/03/us-news/6-pedestrians-struck-by-ford-mustang-that-crashed-into-nyc-scaffolding-before-driver-passenger-flee/>told the New York Post</a>. The youngest victim was 30. The oldest, 79. All survived, but the fear lingers, as <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/bronx-sidewalk-shed-crash-melrose/>reported by CBS New York</a>.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>eight people died</strong> on District 17 streets. <strong>Twenty more suffered serious injuries</strong>. Over a thousand were hurt. These are not just numbers—they are lives cut short, families changed, futures lost. <strong>SUVs and cars did most of the damage</strong>. Trucks, buses, motorcycles, and bikes all played their part, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-and-stalls>Leadership: Steps and Stalls</h3><p>Council Member Rafael Salamanca Jr. has taken some steps. He co-sponsored bills to tow abandoned and unregistered vehicles, crack down on fake plates, and prioritize sidewalk repairs at NYCHA sites. He voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable for crossing the street, as shown in <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council Legistar</a>. He demanded the city fill the vacant Bronx DOT commissioner post, stating, &ldquo;There needs to be a level of accountability and our level of accountability is reaching out to that borough commissioner. Please speed it up,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/13/amid-rash-of-crashes-theres-no-bronx-borough-commissioner-for-dot>he told Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p><p>But Salamanca has also slowed safety projects, warning against redesigns that might cause congestion—even as crash rates fall. He missed a key vote on the citywide greenway plan. He has not led on lowering speed limits or expanding protected bike lanes—measures proven to save lives.</p><h3 id=the-next-fight-action-not-excuses>The Next Fight: Action, Not Excuses</h3><p><strong>The crisis is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every delay means another family waits for the call. <strong>Call Council Member Salamanca. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit.

The 35-year-old driver remained and was not charged. NYPD’s Collision Investigation Squad is investigating.

The bus crashed into the wall, leaving it hanging over the edge. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz said, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." No injuries were reported, but the crash caused structural damage and scattered debris below. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz noted, "It speaks to the importance of enforcing our parking rules because it was going around a double-parked car." The incident highlights the danger posed by lax parking enforcement and infrastructure vulnerable to impact.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The impact crushed the girl's leg beneath the vehicle's front end. The report notes she remained conscious at the scene. No victim behavior is cited as a contributing factor.

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable.
