The project, backed by the Economic Development Corporation and Council Member Rafael Salamanca, aims to move food by boat and e-cargo trike instead of trucks. The matter summary states: 'Replacing truck trips with boat trips and cargo bikes is a key feature of the city's urgent push to shift cargo trips out of big trucks.' EDC President Andrew Kimball said, 'The goal is, over time, to move more and more of this food out of Hunts Point not by truck, but by water with e-cargo trikes.' The dock will remove one thousand trucks per month from South Bronx streets. Officials plan to expand docks citywide. The bill’s status is an active infrastructure rollout, not a legislative vote.

The law demands the Department of Transportation install pavement markings or temporary lines within five business days after any street resurfacing. If DOT misses the deadline, it must notify the public and explain the delay. The bill’s matter title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to installing pavement markings.' Council Member Farah N. Louis led as primary sponsor, joined by Brannan, Schulman, Banks, Farías, Carr, and Ariola. The law took effect March 15, 2025. Timely markings close the deadly window when streets lack crosswalks and lanes, protecting people on foot and bike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
