The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code...prohibiting the operation of a motor vehicle with fraudulent or expired license plates,' makes it illegal to drive with fake or expired plates, including temporary ones. Civil penalties apply, but drivers with expired plates get a 10-day cure period. Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers leads as primary sponsor, joined by Feliz, Salamanca, Powers, Restler, Won, Brewer, Schulman, Ung, Marte, Hudson, Avilés, De La Rosa, and the Brooklyn Borough President. The bill targets drivers who hide behind illegal plates, a tactic often linked to hit-and-runs and reckless driving.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The narrative details that the rider 'hit a parked Jeep at speed,' was 'ejected,' and 'died before dawn.' The police report notes the victim was wearing a helmet. The Jeep, registered in Pennsylvania, was parked and unoccupied at the time of the crash. The e-bike was described as 'demolished.' The police report centers contributing factors on 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Traffic Control Disregarded.' No driver error from the SUV is cited, as the vehicle was stationary.

The report explicitly lists 'Alcohol Involvement' as a contributing factor in the crash. The impact was severe: a 36-year-old woman, driving one of the vehicles, was ejected and suffered severe lacerations to her leg. She remained conscious at the scene, with blood visible on the street and her airbag deployed. The police report does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor.

Council Member Rafael Salamanca (D-Concourse Village) pressed DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, stating, "There is no borough commissioner in the borough of the Bronx." The Bronx has lacked a permanent commissioner since November 2021. Salamanca demanded a timeline for filling the role, arguing, "There needs to be a level of accountability and our level of accountability is reaching out to that borough commissioner. Please speed it up." DOT responded that street safety projects are not planned or implemented by borough commissioners, but Salamanca insisted the vacancy leaves the Bronx exposed as crashes and injuries rise. All other boroughs have commissioners. The Bronx waits for leadership as danger mounts.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
