Police say a 21‑year‑old in a Mercedes tried to pass a Volkswagen, hit it, then struck two motorcycles. Both riders, Manuel Amarante Penalo, 19, and Enrique Martinez, 21, were thrown and died at the hospital. The driver was arrested and charged with vehicular manslaughter and DWI, according to the Bronx DA’s complaint. He refused a chemical test. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Police told reporters</a> the southbound lanes near E. 223rd St. shut down for hours.</p><p>“<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>Two people were killed. He was drunk</a>,” the sister said in court. “He’s just walking freely?” The lawyer said, “<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>My client is prepared to contest these charges</a>.”</p><p>CBS said the car “struck two men on scooters,” and both died. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/driver-arrested-in-bronx-river-parkway-fatal-crash/>Police arrested the driver</a>.</p><p><strong>District 17’s body count</strong></p><p>In Council District 17 since 2022, at least 30 people have been killed and 3,686 injured in 6,319 crashes. Heavy hours stack up at night. From 9 p.m. to midnight, deaths hit hard, with spikes at 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. Serious injuries peak from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City data shows the pattern</a>.</p><p>The toll falls heaviest on people outside the car. Pedestrians: 10 dead, 653 hurt. Cyclists: 5 dead, 288 hurt. Another two people on mopeds and motorcycles died, with 116 injured. Cars and SUVs do most of the harm. Trucks and buses add weight. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The dataset records the modes</a>.</p><p>Top danger blocks sit on <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Westchester Avenue</a> and <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>East 163rd Street</a>. One man, 56, died at East 163rd and Westchester in 2024. A Ford SUV going straight struck him in the crosswalk, the record says. The plates were from Texas. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The crash file is public</a>.</p><p><strong>Night streets, hard edges</strong></p><p>The hours between 9 p.m. and 3 a.m. draw blood. At 11 p.m., injuries peak; serious injuries climb. After midnight, the deaths do not stop. District data flags “nighttime conditions” and “repeat hotspots.” The map does not lie. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>It’s in the city ledger</a>.</p><p>Reported contributing factors stack this way: “other” leads the count with 13 deaths; “vulnerable road user error” shows 6; “disregarded traffic control” adds another death. Speed shows up less in reports than it does on the pavement. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Those categories come from the city files</a>.</p><p><strong>What the Bronx has heard, and what it hasn’t</strong></p><p>DOT leadership in the Bronx has wobbled. At a 2023 hearing, Council Member Rafael Salamanca pressed DOT: “<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/13/amid-rash-of-crashes-theres-no-bronx-borough-commissioner-for-dot>There is no borough commissioner in the borough of the Bronx</a>. Please speed it up.” He has also backed street safety bills, including fast removal of abandoned cars that block sightlines and crosswalks. He voted yes. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>The bill passed the Council</a>.</p><p>At another hearing, Council leaders attacked proven redesigns, despite data showing fewer crashes and injuries. Salamanca warned about congestion from a Bronx project. DOT said the projects save lives. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/03/19/cycle-of-rage-council-members-slam-dot-for-successful-safety-projects>The exchange is on the record</a>.</p><p><strong>Fix the blocks that keep killing</strong></p><p>The tools are basic. Daylight the corners at Westchester and East 163rd. Harden the turns on Southern Boulevard. Add leading pedestrian intervals and give walkers the head start. Mark and protect bike space where the injuries pile up. Target the late‑night hours on the repeat corridors with enforcement that sticks. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>District 17’s own hotspot list points the way</a>.</p><p>Citywide, the road is clear too. <strong>Lower the default speed limit</strong>. Albany gave the city that power. The city has not used it fully. <strong>Force repeat speeders to slow down</strong> with intelligent speed assistance for the worst plates. The bills exist. The victims do too. <a href=../../take_action/>Here’s how to push it</a>.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Councilmember Schulman called for accountability.</p><p class=mb3>On June 21, 2024, the NYC Council's Committee on Consumer and Worker Protection held a hearing on seven bills regulating delivery apps. The bills aim to address 'myriad health and safety concerns' from e-bike crashes, battery fires, and low pay. Councilmember Lynn Schulman, District 29, spoke out: 'Right now, delivery workers are essentially incentivized for speed... This often results in driving recklessly, often putting the lives of pedestrians at risk.' Three bills would make apps like Uber Eats and DoorDash responsible for vehicle safety and compliance, require them to provide safety-compliant e-bikes, and ensure mopeds are registered. Other bills target pay transparency and tip protections. Councilmembers Shaun Abreu and Rafael Salamanca also spoke in support. The measures seek to hold companies accountable for dangers faced by vulnerable road users and delivery workers alike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The deal emerged during negotiations over the 'City of Yes for Economic Opportunity' zoning plan, which the Council approved. The matter summary notes, 'the administration has pledged to support future legislation to cut pollution from these warehouses and propose rules to restrict new facilities.' Councilmember Alexa Avilés (District 38) and 28 colleagues sent a letter demanding stricter oversight. Avilés and advocates want special permits and environmental reviews to protect neighborhoods from traffic, pollution, and safety hazards. Deputy Mayor Maria Torres-Springer promised a bill empowering the Department of Environmental Protection to regulate warehouse vehicle emissions. Councilmember Rafael Salamanca Jr. stressed the Council’s leverage: 'It gets to a point where you have to use your power of voting to get the attention of the city.' The City Planning Commission and Council must vote again before rules take effect.

Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary sponsor), Amanda Farías, and Rafael Salamanca, Jr. back the measure. The teams must respond to traffic requests within three months.

They claimed community harm, ignoring hard data. Bike lanes and safer streets faced political fire. DOT stood firm, citing lives saved and broad support. Vulnerable road users caught in the crossfire.</p><p class=mb3>On March 19, 2024, the City Council held an oversight hearing on DOT street safety projects and Streets Plan implementation. The hearing, led by Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers (D-Queens), Christopher Banks (D-Brooklyn), and Rafael Salamanca Jr. (D-Bronx), focused on the DOT's progress under the Streets Plan, which mandates annual targets for protected bike lanes and bus lanes. Brooks-Powers objected to the Seagirt Boulevard bike lane, claiming DOT ignored community wishes, despite previously calling for more investment. Banks demanded removal of new protected bike lanes in East New York, citing parking and safety issues, though data showed fewer crashes and injuries. Salamanca criticized a Bronx street redesign for congestion, despite lower crash rates. He also accused DOT of neglecting communities of color, though data shows these areas receive more redesigns. DOT officials defended their process, emphasizing community engagement and prioritizing high-need areas. The council's opposition stands in stark contrast to the projects' proven safety benefits for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
