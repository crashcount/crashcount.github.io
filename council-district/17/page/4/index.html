Twenty-five suffered injuries so severe they changed lives. The numbers do not rest. They climb, year after year.</p><p>Just last week, a 44-year-old woman was killed crossing West 174th Street in Morris Heights. The driver did not stop. Police are still searching for the car. A <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/woman-killed-in-bronx-hit-and-run/>Bronx woman is dead after a hit-and-run in Morris Heights</a>. The story is old, but the pain is fresh. Another neighbor gone. Another family left behind.</p><p>On the same night, another woman was struck and killed by an SUV turning into a driveway. A witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/07/suv-driver-turning-into-driveway-of-bronx-apartment-building-fatally-strikes-woman/>said the driver &ldquo;just rolled over that woman and killed her.&rdquo;</a> The driver left through a back exit. No arrest. No answers.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-behind-the-names>The Numbers Behind the Names</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the killing.</strong> In District 17, they caused 7 deaths and 13 serious injuries to pedestrians and cyclists since 2022. Trucks and buses added another death and six serious injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds killed one, seriously injuring one more. Bikes hurt, but they did not kill.</p><p>The pain is not spread evenly. Children, elders, workers—all are at risk. In the last year, 127 people under 18 were injured. Four people over 55 died. The streets are not safe for anyone who walks, rides, or waits at the curb.</p><h3 id=salamancas-record-some-steps-not-enough>Salamanca’s Record: Some Steps, Not Enough</h3><p>Council Member Rafael Salamanca Jr. has voted for bills to clear abandoned cars and improve street markings. He pressed the city to fill the Bronx DOT commissioner vacancy, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/13/amid-rash-of-crashes-theres-no-bronx-borough-commissioner-for-dot>saying there needs to be a level of accountability and urging the city to speed it up</a>. He backed new fines for illegal ATVs and supported regulating last-mile warehouses to cut truck traffic. But when the city redesigned streets to slow cars and save lives, Salamanca warned about congestion and pushed back, even as crash rates fell.</p><p><strong>The councilmember has taken some steps. But the blood on the street says it is not enough.</strong></p><h3 id=the-call-demand-action-now>The Call: Demand Action Now</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay means another life at risk.</strong> Call Council Member Salamanca. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand action, not excuses. The dead cannot speak. The living must.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter, titled 'Transit-Oriented Bronx Developments Will Have Ample Parking, Developers Tell Council,' focused on whether to require parking in new residential and commercial projects. Council Members Amanda Faris, Kevin C. Riley, Rafael Salamanca, and Kristy Marmorato all pressed for developers to include parking, despite the city's move to waive mandates. Riley called parking 'a huge issue.' Developers, including Baker Development, promised up to 200 spaces per project. Bronx City Planning Director Paul Philips said, 'We certainly expect developers to provide parking.' The debate ignored the danger more parking brings: more cars, more conflict, more risk for people walking and biking. No safety analyst weighed in, but the outcome is clear—transit-oriented in name, car-centric in practice.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Councilmember Schulman called for accountability.</p><p class=mb3>On June 21, 2024, the NYC Council's Committee on Consumer and Worker Protection held a hearing on seven bills regulating delivery apps. The bills aim to address 'myriad health and safety concerns' from e-bike crashes, battery fires, and low pay. Councilmember Lynn Schulman, District 29, spoke out: 'Right now, delivery workers are essentially incentivized for speed... This often results in driving recklessly, often putting the lives of pedestrians at risk.' Three bills would make apps like Uber Eats and DoorDash responsible for vehicle safety and compliance, require them to provide safety-compliant e-bikes, and ensure mopeds are registered. Other bills target pay transparency and tip protections. Councilmembers Shaun Abreu and Rafael Salamanca also spoke in support. The measures seek to hold companies accountable for dangers faced by vulnerable road users and delivery workers alike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates vow to watch.</p><p class=mb3>On May 30, 2024, the New York City Council and Mayor Adams' administration agreed to pursue regulation of last-mile delivery warehouses. The deal emerged during negotiations over the 'City of Yes for Economic Opportunity' zoning plan, which the Council approved. The matter summary notes, 'the administration has pledged to support future legislation to cut pollution from these warehouses and propose rules to restrict new facilities.' Councilmember Alexa Avilés (District 38) and 28 colleagues sent a letter demanding stricter oversight. Avilés and advocates want special permits and environmental reviews to protect neighborhoods from traffic, pollution, and safety hazards. Deputy Mayor Maria Torres-Springer promised a bill empowering the Department of Environmental Protection to regulate warehouse vehicle emissions. Councilmember Rafael Salamanca Jr. stressed the Council’s leverage: 'It gets to a point where you have to use your power of voting to get the attention of the city.' The City Planning Commission and Council must vote again before rules take effect. Advocates and councilmembers will monitor the administration’s follow-through.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brooks-Powers objected to the Seagirt Boulevard bike lane, claiming DOT ignored community wishes, despite previously calling for more investment. Banks demanded removal of new protected bike lanes in East New York, citing parking and safety issues, though data showed fewer crashes and injuries. Salamanca criticized a Bronx street redesign for congestion, despite lower crash rates. He also accused DOT of neglecting communities of color, though data shows these areas receive more redesigns. DOT officials defended their process, emphasizing community engagement and prioritizing high-need areas.
