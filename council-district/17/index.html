Nineteen left with injuries so grave they may never walk right again.</strong> In the last twelve months, nearly a thousand people have been hurt—pedestrians, cyclists, children. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old.</p><p>Just days ago, the pavement at Hunts Point ran red. A driver ran a red light, plowed onto the sidewalk, and struck three people. One man, 33, now fights for his life. The driver ran. Police caught him. The charges: vehicular assault, reckless endangerment, fleeing police. &ldquo;Jenkins slammed on the gas and sped off east on Hunts Point Ave., blowing through a red light,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/driver-flees-bronx-car-stop-crash/>police said</a>. The street remembers. The scars stay.</p><h3 id=the-deadly-routine>The Deadly Routine</h3><p>This is not rare. In the last year, <strong>District 17 has seen 749 crashes, five deaths, and nine serious injuries</strong>—a rise in deaths even as crashes fell. The victims are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. The most vulnerable pay the price. Cars and SUVs do most of the killing, but trucks, motorcycles, and even buses leave bodies behind. &ldquo;A man is facing charges after a multivehicle crash in the Bronx late Friday sent five people to the hospital,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/bronx-man-arrested-after-allegedly-fleeing-multivehicle-crash-that-injured-pedestrians/>reported CBS New York</a>.</p><h3 id=salamanca-steps-forward-steps-missed>Salamanca: Steps Forward, Steps Missed</h3><p>Council Member <strong>Rafael Salamanca Jr.</strong> has taken some steps. He voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable for crossing the street and shifting the focus to drivers and street design. He co-sponsored bills to tow abandoned and unregistered vehicles, and to prioritize sidewalk repairs at NYCHA senior housing—moves that could clear paths for those on foot. But he missed the vote on the citywide greenway plan, a key measure for safe routes. Some bills he backs, like e-bike registration, risk burdening those who have the least.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This crisis is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by leaders, by laws, by silence. Call Salamanca. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand street redesigns that put people first. <strong>Do not wait for another name to become a number.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
