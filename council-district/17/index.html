Twenty-five suffered injuries so severe they changed lives. The numbers do not rest. They climb, year after year.</p><p>Just last week, a 44-year-old woman was killed crossing West 174th Street in Morris Heights. The driver did not stop. Police are still searching for the car. A <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/woman-killed-in-bronx-hit-and-run/>Bronx woman is dead after a hit-and-run in Morris Heights</a>. The story is old, but the pain is fresh. Another neighbor gone. Another family left behind.</p><p>On the same night, another woman was struck and killed by an SUV turning into a driveway. A witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/07/suv-driver-turning-into-driveway-of-bronx-apartment-building-fatally-strikes-woman/>said the driver &ldquo;just rolled over that woman and killed her.&rdquo;</a> The driver left through a back exit. No arrest. No answers.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-behind-the-names>The Numbers Behind the Names</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the killing.</strong> In District 17, they caused 7 deaths and 13 serious injuries to pedestrians and cyclists since 2022. Trucks and buses added another death and six serious injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds killed one, seriously injuring one more. Bikes hurt, but they did not kill.</p><p>The pain is not spread evenly. Children, elders, workers—all are at risk. In the last year, 127 people under 18 were injured. Four people over 55 died. The streets are not safe for anyone who walks, rides, or waits at the curb.</p><h3 id=salamancas-record-some-steps-not-enough>Salamanca’s Record: Some Steps, Not Enough</h3><p>Council Member Rafael Salamanca Jr. has voted for bills to clear abandoned cars and improve street markings. He pressed the city to fill the Bronx DOT commissioner vacancy, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/13/amid-rash-of-crashes-theres-no-bronx-borough-commissioner-for-dot>saying there needs to be a level of accountability and urging the city to speed it up</a>. He backed new fines for illegal ATVs and supported regulating last-mile warehouses to cut truck traffic. But when the city redesigned streets to slow cars and save lives, Salamanca warned about congestion and pushed back, even as crash rates fell.</p><p><strong>The councilmember has taken some steps. But the blood on the street says it is not enough.</strong></p><h3 id=the-call-demand-action-now>The Call: Demand Action Now</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay means another life at risk.</strong> Call Council Member Salamanca. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand action, not excuses. The dead cannot speak. The living must.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
