A 21-year-old, unlicensed driver in a Nissan Rogue struck him and fled. The cyclist was left with severe head trauma, unconscious as paramedics worked to save him. The street shut down, red lights flashing, a crumpled bike in the road. Police arrested the driver two hours later. The charge: leaving the scene, driving without a license. The investigation continues. <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/driver-arrested-after-collision-with-e-biker-on-second-ave-XF4896347>&ldquo;The biker was rushed by EMS to Bellevue Hospital in critical condition.&rdquo;</a></p><p>This is not rare. In the last twelve months, District 4 saw <strong>7 deaths and 16 serious injuries</strong> from crashes. Cyclists, pedestrians, elders, children. The numbers do not flinch. <strong>Over 1,000 injuries. Nearly 1,900 crashes.</strong></p><h2 id=patterns-of-harm-who-pays-the-price>Patterns of Harm: Who Pays the Price</h2><p>The violence does not choose at random. <strong>SUVs and cars killed three people and injured hundreds</strong>. Trucks and buses took another life and left dozens more hurt. Even bikes and mopeds, often the last resort for workers, add to the toll. The old and the young are not spared. Three people over 65 killed this year alone. Two more over 75. The city keeps counting. The bodies keep coming.</p><h2 id=council-member-keith-powers-action-and-inaction>Council Member Keith Powers: Action and Inaction</h2><p>Council Member Keith Powers has spoken for safer streets. He backed the repeal of a law that delayed bike lane construction, saying, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/12/07/council-votes-to-repeal-decade-old-law-expedite-bike-lane-installation>&ldquo;2023 is sadly on track to be the deadliest year in decades for cyclists, underscoring the need for a cohesive network of bike lanes across New York City.&rdquo;</a> He co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, to clear sightlines and protect those on foot. But the bill sits, waiting. The dead do not wait.</p><p>Powers has also pushed for safer e-bike batteries, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/14/council-passes-battery-buy-back-program-and-other-bills-to-curb-lithium-ion-fires>&ldquo;We know there are folks who can&rsquo;t afford high-priced batteries and bikes, and we will provide them the opportunity to surrender that unsafe equipment and receive a safe replacement.&rdquo;</a> He has supported busways and protected bike lanes. But the pace is slow. The streets are not safe.</p><h2 id=what-now-the-cost-of-delay>What Now: The Cost of Delay</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay means another life at risk.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits, clear crosswalks, and build real protection for those outside a car. The council can act. The mayor can act. You can act.</p><p><strong>Call Council Member Powers. Demand the citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighting at every intersection. Demand protected bike lanes, not just promises.</strong></p><p>The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice. Make them choose safety.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On January 28, 2025, the Department of Transportation launched New York City's e-bike and moped trade-in program, born from a 2023 law introduced by Council Member Keith Powers. The program, praised by Council Member Oswald Feliz, allows 400 delivery workers to exchange uncertified, fire-prone bikes for certified, street-legal models. The law followed a spike in lithium-ion battery fires—277 in 2024, killing six. The $2 million program offers bikes and spare batteries, but only scratches the surface for the city’s estimated 80,000 delivery workers. Ligia Guallpa of the Worker’s Justice Project called the effort a step toward safer, cleaner mobility. Applications close February 17. The program’s reach is small, leaving most workers exposed to the same deadly risks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
