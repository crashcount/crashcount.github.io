Since 2022, eight people have died and 47 have been seriously injured in crashes. The wounded are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. In the last twelve months alone, four more lives ended. Three of them were over 65. The old do not move fast enough for the city’s machines.</p><p>A child struck on East 14th Street. An elderly pedestrian knocked down by a reversing SUV on Lexington. A cyclist crushed on Fifth Avenue. The blood dries, but the pain does not leave. 904 people have been hurt in the last year. The city keeps moving. The bodies are cleared. The danger remains.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>Cars and trucks did the most harm. They killed at least one person and injured over 400 more. Motorcycles and mopeds left dozens hurt. Bikes, too, have drawn blood, but the numbers are smaller. The street is a battlefield. The weapons are heavy and fast.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h3><p>Council Member Keith Powers has spoken for safety. He backed the repeal of a law that stalled bike lanes, saying, &ldquo;2023 is sadly on track to be the deadliest year in decades for cyclists, underscoring the need for a cohesive network of bike lanes across New York City&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/12/07/council-votes-to-repeal-decade-old-law-expedite-bike-lane-installation>said Powers</a>). He co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, to clear sightlines and protect people on foot. He led on battery buy-backs for delivery workers, saying, &ldquo;We will provide them the opportunity to surrender that unsafe equipment and receive a safe replacement&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/14/council-passes-battery-buy-back-program-and-other-bills-to-curb-lithium-ion-fires>said Powers</a>).</p><p>But the street does not wait for laws to pass. Projects stall. Promises linger. The city paused the 34th Street busway (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/03/anti-miracle-on-34th-street-adams-administration-pauses-work-on-34th-street-busway>paused the 34th Street busway</a>). Fifth Avenue’s redesign cut out protected bike lanes (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/14/civic-panel-dings-adams-for-cutting-bike-and-bus-lanes-out-of-fifth-av-redesign>cut out protected bike lanes</a>). The old dangers remain. The new ones grow.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Every crash is a choice made by the city. Every delay is a risk paid in flesh. Call Council Member Powers. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes, daylighted intersections, and busways that do not vanish at the last minute. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The cyclist suffered severe bleeding and a broken bone but remained conscious at the scene. The police narrative describes, 'Steel strikes leg. Bone breaks. Blood spills.' The only contributing factor cited is 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' by the SUV driver. No victim behavior is listed as a contributing factor.

Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers.

The lot, closed for years during flood wall construction, reopened for parking despite calls for change. The matter summary reads: 'An underused parking lot below the FDR Drive should finally turn into a community space instead of car storage, according to residents and politicians.' Sandy McKee, CB6 chair, said, 'If we took away the cars, it would be a visible connection through to the waterfront.' Powers backed the move, stressing the need for public access. The board sent a resolution to the Economic Development Corporation. The city claims it still needs the space for construction and right-of-way management. No formal bill number or committee is listed.

No more hiding the facts.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0745-2024, now enacted, came through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. It was introduced April 11, 2024, and passed on August 15, 2024. The law orders the Department of Transportation to post current bicycle and micromobility ridership data online, updated monthly or at least yearly. The matter summary reads: 'requiring the department of transportation to provide information about bicycle and other micromobility device activity.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers led as primary sponsor, joined by Farías, Restler, Hudson, Schulman, and others. The law demands transparency on where riders travel and what DOT does to keep them safe. This opens the books on bike movement and exposes gaps in protection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move aims to stop deadly basement charging and bring safety to delivery workers. A new battery trade-in program will target dangerous lithium-ion batteries and mopeds. Community resistance remains.</p><p class=mb3>On July 23, 2024, the Department of Transportation announced a new initiative to permit private sidewalk e-bike and moped charging stations. The program, previewed at a press conference with Mayor Adams, will open for applications by year’s end after a public hearing on August 21. The matter, described as making it 'easier and faster for property owners to install public battery charging and swapping cabinets,' seeks to replace illegal, hazardous charging hubs with regulated infrastructure. Council Member Keith Powers, who sponsored last year’s battery trade-in law, said, 'No one wants to use—or be anywhere near—batteries that aren't safe to charge.' Fire Commissioner Laura Kavanagh called current illegal charging 'effectively death traps.' The city will also fund a $2 million battery and moped trade-in program. Delivery worker advocates want the new stations to be free or low-cost. Community board opposition has slowed previous efforts. The mayor remains neutral on state e-bike registration proposals.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report lists the cyclist as injured, suffering 'severe lacerations,' and notes that the SUV sustained no damage. Both vehicles were traveling straight ahead at the time of the crash. The police report does not specify any driver errors or contributing factors beyond 'Unspecified.' The only detail about the cyclist’s behavior is the absence of a helmet, which is mentioned in the narrative but not cited as a contributing factor.
