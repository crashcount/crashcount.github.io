Pedestrians took 806 injuries and 4 deaths; cyclists 694 injuries and 5 deaths. SUVs and cars led the harm to people on foot. Trucks and buses added their share. These are city records, not rumors.</li><li>The pain spikes in the afternoon. At 3 p.m., three people died. At 5 p.m., one more. Injuries peak from 2 to 6 p.m. The count does not slow at night; deaths also hit at 10 p.m., 9 p.m., and 10–11 p.m. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data shows each hour</a>.</li></ul><p>Sixth Avenue, First Avenue, the Drive</p><ul><li>The corner of <a href=#>Avenue of the Americas</a> is the district’s worst hotspot: 1 death, 63 injuries, 6 serious. <a href=#>Park Avenue</a> isn’t far behind. <a href=#>First Avenue</a> adds another death and 67 injuries. The <a href=#>FDR Drive</a> records 1 death and 232 injuries. These are not surprises; they are patterns in the city’s own files.</li><li>A left turn took an 83‑year‑old woman in a crosswalk on Sixth at West 58th. She had the signal. She died. The SUV was turning left. That is all we need to know. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City crash report</a> (CrashID 4792095).</li><li>On West 51st by Fifth, a parked SUV and an e‑bike collided. A 67‑year‑old cyclist was killed.

The calendar is not. <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/15/redesign-of-14th-street-to-kick-off-next-year>NY1 report</a>.</li><li>After two people were killed at Canal and Bowery by a 100‑mph driver, the city promised barriers, lower limits, and narrower lanes. “We are taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection,” said the transportation commissioner. Advocates warned the rest of the corridor “will remain deadly.” The promise came after the bodies. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Gothamist</a>, <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/07/chinatown-deadly-crash-safety-upgrades-canal-street>NY1</a>.</li></ul><p>Fix what is killing people here</p><ul><li>Daylight the corners. A Council bill would ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and force at least 1,000 intersections a year to get barriers. It has broad support. It is sitting. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Council file</a> (Int 1138‑2024).</li><li>Harden the turns on Sixth, First, Park, and Lexington. Give leading pedestrian intervals. Protect the bike lanes across the crosstown grid. These tools are standard. The map tells you where to start: <a href=#>Sixth Avenue</a>, <a href=#>First Avenue</a>, <a href=#>Park Avenue</a>, <a href=#>Lexington</a>, the <a href=#>FDR</a>.</li><li>Target the hours that kill: 2–6 p.m., then 9–11 p.m. Prioritize trucks and buses on corridors with high pedestrian harm. The city’s own roll‑up shows the weight of large vehicles. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Vehicle roll‑up</a>.</li></ul><p>Slow every street; stop the worst</p><ul><li>Albany passed the tool to cut speeds. The city can set safer limits. Use it. Make 20 mph the rule where people walk and bike. Then go after repeat speeders. The Stop Super Speeders Act would force the heaviest offenders to install speed limiters after 11 DMV points in 18 months or 16 camera tickets in a year. One driver with 29 camera tickets killed a mother and two daughters in April.

The danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On January 28, 2025, the Department of Transportation launched New York City's e-bike and moped trade-in program, born from a 2023 law introduced by Council Member Keith Powers. The program, praised by Council Member Oswald Feliz, allows 400 delivery workers to exchange uncertified, fire-prone bikes for certified, street-legal models. The law followed a spike in lithium-ion battery fires—277 in 2024, killing six. The $2 million program offers bikes and spare batteries, but only scratches the surface for the city’s estimated 80,000 delivery workers. Ligia Guallpa of the Worker’s Justice Project called the effort a step toward safer, cleaner mobility. Applications close February 17.
