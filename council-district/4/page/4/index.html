Nearly 900 injured. That is the toll in District 4 over the last year. These are not just numbers—they are bodies on Lexington, 1st Avenue, 47th Street. Children, elders, cyclists, workers. Twelve suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same again.</p><p>Just last week, a city worker was slashed by an e-bike rider after a near collision at Broadway and Cedar. The worker was fixing a street sign. The cyclist nearly hit his truck. Words were exchanged. The blade came out. The worker bled. The cyclist fled. The DOT called it an <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/dot-worker-slashed-by-e-biker-manhattan/>&ldquo;abhorrent assault of a NYC DOT employee who performs critical work to keep our city moving&rdquo;</a>. No arrests have been made.</p><p>On July 15, a van towing a food cart broke loose near 42nd and 10th. The cart slammed into a parked car with a woman and a child inside. Police found 76 propane tanks and 75 gallons of gasoline in the van. The driver was charged with reckless endangerment. The victims survived. The city did not explode—this time. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/cops-bust-minivan-driver-in-manhattan-for-carrying-propane-tanks/>&ldquo;Firefighters forced entry into the van, removing 76 20-pound propane cylinders and 15 five-gallon fuel containers.&rdquo;</a></p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p>The old, the young, the ones on foot or bike pay most. In the last year, three people aged 65–74 died. Thirty children were hurt. Cyclists and pedestrians keep getting hit. Taxis, SUVs, trucks, bikes—all play their part. But the street is not level. The bigger the vehicle, the harder the blow.</p><h2 id=council-member-powers-action-and-silence>Council Member Powers: Action and Silence</h2><p>Council Member Keith Powers has backed some safety bills. He co-sponsored a law to ban parking near crosswalks and clear sightlines for people walking and biking. He supported the repeal of a law that delayed bike lane construction, saying, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/12/07/council-votes-to-repeal-decade-old-law-expedite-bike-lane-installation>&ldquo;2023 is sadly on track to be the deadliest year in decades for cyclists, underscoring the need for a cohesive network of bike lanes across New York City.&rdquo;</a></p><p>But progress is slow. The 34th Street busway, which would have made streets safer for everyone, is on hold. Powers opposed the pause, but the cars keep coming. The city keeps waiting. The dead keep piling up.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call Council Member Powers. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people on foot and bike. Every day you wait is another day someone does not come home.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The SUV’s right front bumper struck the Vespa’s front quarter, confirming the impact location. The Vespa rider was wearing a helmet, as noted in the report, but helmet use is not cited as a contributing factor. The focus remains on the Jeep driver’s failure to yield, which led directly to the violent collision and resulting injuries.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers.

The lot, closed for years during flood wall construction, reopened for parking despite calls for change. The matter summary reads: 'An underused parking lot below the FDR Drive should finally turn into a community space instead of car storage, according to residents and politicians.' Sandy McKee, CB6 chair, said, 'If we took away the cars, it would be a visible connection through to the waterfront.' Powers backed the move, stressing the need for public access. The board sent a resolution to the Economic Development Corporation. The city claims it still needs the space for construction and right-of-way management. No formal bill number or committee is listed. The push echoes similar highway conversions in Toronto and Brooklyn.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Community resistance remains.</p><p class=mb3>On July 23, 2024, the Department of Transportation announced a new initiative to permit private sidewalk e-bike and moped charging stations. The program, previewed at a press conference with Mayor Adams, will open for applications by year’s end after a public hearing on August 21. The matter, described as making it 'easier and faster for property owners to install public battery charging and swapping cabinets,' seeks to replace illegal, hazardous charging hubs with regulated infrastructure. Council Member Keith Powers, who sponsored last year’s battery trade-in law, said, 'No one wants to use—or be anywhere near—batteries that aren't safe to charge.' Fire Commissioner Laura Kavanagh called current illegal charging 'effectively death traps.' The city will also fund a $2 million battery and moped trade-in program. Delivery worker advocates want the new stations to be free or low-cost. Community board opposition has slowed previous efforts. The mayor remains neutral on state e-bike registration proposals.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The police report does not specify any driver errors or contributing factors beyond 'Unspecified.' The only detail about the cyclist’s behavior is the absence of a helmet, which is mentioned in the narrative but not cited as a contributing factor.

The crash underscores the ongoing danger vulnerable road users face from improper vehicle maneuvers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The narrative describes the scene as the e-scooter 'tore through the night,' leaving both victims injured in its wake. The police report highlights that the driver was unlicensed, a critical factor in the crash. No driver errors beyond the lack of a license are specified in the report. The victims’ actions are listed only as 'other actions in roadway,' with no indication from the report that these contributed to the collision.

Critics, including Vito Fosella and Joe Borelli, questioned the process and future use of the equipment.

The incident highlights the vulnerability of pedestrians at busy intersections and the dangers present when vehicles and people intersect outside of designated crossing signals.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Restler led the charge. The vote was 32 to 15. Now, bike lanes face just 14 days of delay, not months. DOT and advocates cheered. Cyclists need protection. The city moves faster.</p><p class=mb3>""2023 is sadly on track to be the deadliest year in decades for cyclists, underscoring the need for a cohesive network of bike lanes across New York City. Unfortunately, current rules mean that bike lanes are often stuck in unnecessary red tape that delays their construction by months or even years. Intro. 417 will significantly streamline the approval process and I am happy to support its passage."" -- Keith Powers</p><p class=mb3>On December 7, 2023, the City Council passed Bill 417, repealing a law that delayed bike lane construction. The bill, sponsored by Council Member Lincoln Restler, cleared the Council with a 32-15 vote. It reduces the waiting period after community board notification from 90 days plus 45 after a hearing, to just 14 days. The matter summary reads: 'The City Council repealed a decade-old law that imposed lengthy delays on the city before it could break ground on new bike lanes.' Restler said, 'No other transportation project in New York City...requires this type of extended dead period.' Council Member Keith Powers backed the bill, citing rising cyclist deaths. The Department of Transportation called bike lanes 'life-saving infrastructure.' The amended bill now covers all bike lanes, regardless of length. Advocates say this will help install more lanes and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
