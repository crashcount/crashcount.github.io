Forty-three left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 2,500 hurt. The dead include a 22-year-old man crushed by an SUV at a Midtown intersection, a 39-year-old pedestrian struck by a bus, and a 46-year-old cyclist who never made it home. These are not just numbers. They are broken bodies, families waiting by hospital beds, shoes left on the curb.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the highest price.</strong> In the last year alone, three people over 65 died. One cyclist was killed by an SUV. A bus ended another life. Taxis, trucks, bikes, and cars all left their mark. Midtown sidewalks are not safe. The curb is no shield. A taxi jumped it and plowed into a crowd, sending a nine-year-old boy and two women to the hospital. Police said the driver had a medical episode. No charges filed. The street swallowed the pain and moved on. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/young-boy-two-women-hospitalized-after-taxi-hits-pedestrians-in-midtown-manhattan>Gothamist reported</a>: &ldquo;Four people, including a 9-year-old boy and two women, were hospitalized with injuries; all were in stable condition.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-laws-and-the-slow-grind>Leadership: Promises, Laws, and the Slow Grind</h3><p>Council Member <strong>Keith Powers has backed safety bills</strong>. He voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished people for crossing the street while drivers kept killing with impunity. He supported the <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/12/07/council-votes-to-repeal-decade-old-law-expedite-bike-lane-installation>repeal of a law that stalled bike lane construction</a>, cutting red tape so the city can build faster. He co-sponsored a <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>bill to ban parking near crosswalks</a>, aiming to clear sightlines for those on foot. He pushed for a citywide greenway plan, more protected bike lanes, and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/14/council-passes-battery-buy-back-program-and-other-bills-to-curb-lithium-ion-fires>safer batteries for delivery workers</a>. But the pace is slow. The blood dries before the paint hits the street.</p><p><strong>Big plans are coming.</strong> Fifth Avenue will get wider sidewalks, but no new bike or bus lanes. Advocates <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/21/us-news/nycs-fifth-avenue-getting-400m-pedestrian-centered-makeover-that-drivers-and-cyclists-are-sure-to-hate/>call it a failure</a>. &ldquo;This plan entirely fails to meet the moment,&rdquo; said <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/21/us-news/nycs-fifth-avenue-getting-400m-pedestrian-centered-makeover-that-drivers-and-cyclists-are-sure-to-hate/>Transportation Alternatives</a>.

The move aims to stop deadly basement charging and bring safety to delivery workers. A new battery trade-in program will target dangerous lithium-ion batteries and mopeds. Community resistance remains.</p><p class=mb3>On July 23, 2024, the Department of Transportation announced a new initiative to permit private sidewalk e-bike and moped charging stations. The program, previewed at a press conference with Mayor Adams, will open for applications by year’s end after a public hearing on August 21. The matter, described as making it 'easier and faster for property owners to install public battery charging and swapping cabinets,' seeks to replace illegal, hazardous charging hubs with regulated infrastructure. Council Member Keith Powers, who sponsored last year’s battery trade-in law, said, 'No one wants to use—or be anywhere near—batteries that aren't safe to charge.' Fire Commissioner Laura Kavanagh called current illegal charging 'effectively death traps.' The city will also fund a $2 million battery and moped trade-in program. Delivery worker advocates want the new stations to be free or low-cost. Community board opposition has slowed previous efforts. The mayor remains neutral on state e-bike registration proposals.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The only detail about the cyclist’s behavior is the absence of a helmet, which is mentioned in the narrative but not cited as a contributing factor.

Advocacy groups, including Danny Harris, called for expanded safe bike parking and charging, stressing that e-bikes are a lifeline for many New Yorkers.
