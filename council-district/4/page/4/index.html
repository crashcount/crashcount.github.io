Six people killed and over a thousand injured in the last year alone. The dead include a cyclist, a child, and three people over 65. The wounded are everywhere—on bikes, on foot, at the crosswalk, on the curb.</p><p>Just last month, a sedan turned left and crushed a cyclist on East 41st. A week before, a convertible struck a child on East 14th. The blood dries, but the street remembers.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>Cars and SUVs did the most harm. In three years, they killed 4 people and injured over 550. Taxis, trucks, and buses followed. Bikes and mopeds hurt dozens, but the deadliest force is always the car.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h3><p>Council Member Keith Powers has spoken for safer streets. He backed the repeal of a law that delayed bike lanes, saying, &ldquo;2023 is sadly on track to be the deadliest year in decades for cyclists, underscoring the need for a cohesive network of bike lanes across New York City&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/12/07/council-votes-to-repeal-decade-old-law-expedite-bike-lane-installation>repeal of a law that delayed bike lanes</a>). He co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, to keep sightlines clear for people on foot and bike. But the bill sits in committee, waiting.</p><p>Powers also led on battery safety for delivery workers, saying, &ldquo;We will provide them the opportunity to surrender that unsafe equipment and receive a safe replacement&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/14/council-passes-battery-buy-back-program-and-other-bills-to-curb-lithium-ion-fires>battery safety for delivery workers</a>).</p><p>But the streets are not safe.

Demand the citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighting at every crosswalk. Demand protected bike lanes, not just promises.</p><p>Every day of delay is another name on the list.

Williams was struck, thrown, and died from his injuries. The article states, “An officer pursuing dirt bikers suddenly crossed the double yellow line into Williams' path, causing a collision.” Another NYPD vehicle attempted a similar maneuver. The family’s attorney called it a “deadly maneuver” for a minor violation. The city later billed Williams’ family for police vehicle damages. The NYPD has not commented, citing litigation.

The $150 million plan, as described by Madelyn Wils, will reduce traffic lanes from five to three and widen sidewalks between Bryant Park and Central Park. Powers and other officials voiced strong support for prioritizing pedestrians, echoing Levine’s call to 'do better here' and make Fifth Avenue a true pedestrian destination.

Council Member Keith Powers called the move 'surprising' and urged a full return next year. Advocates called it 'frustrating and disappointing.' Mayor Adams had previously praised the program, which boosted sales by $3 million in 2023. The Department of Transportation now touts sidewalk expansion, but the new redesign drops a planned bike lane and may slow buses. Pedestrians and cyclists lose space.

The matter, described as making it 'easier and faster for property owners to install public battery charging and swapping cabinets,' seeks to replace illegal, hazardous charging hubs with regulated infrastructure. Council Member Keith Powers, who sponsored last year’s battery trade-in law, said, 'No one wants to use—or be anywhere near—batteries that aren't safe to charge.' Fire Commissioner Laura Kavanagh called current illegal charging 'effectively death traps.' The city will also fund a $2 million battery and moped trade-in program. Delivery worker advocates want the new stations to be free or low-cost. Community board opposition has slowed previous efforts.

The police report does not specify any driver errors or contributing factors beyond 'Unspecified.' The only detail about the cyclist’s behavior is the absence of a helmet, which is mentioned in the narrative but not cited as a contributing factor. The crash underscores the vulnerability of cyclists on city streets amid heavy vehicle traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
