Forty-three left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 2,500 hurt. The dead include a 22-year-old man crushed by an SUV at a Midtown intersection, a 39-year-old pedestrian struck by a bus, and a 46-year-old cyclist who never made it home. These are not just numbers. They are broken bodies, families waiting by hospital beds, shoes left on the curb.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the highest price.</strong> In the last year alone, three people over 65 died. One cyclist was killed by an SUV. A bus ended another life. Taxis, trucks, bikes, and cars all left their mark. Midtown sidewalks are not safe. The curb is no shield. A taxi jumped it and plowed into a crowd, sending a nine-year-old boy and two women to the hospital. Police said the driver had a medical episode. No charges filed. The street swallowed the pain and moved on. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/young-boy-two-women-hospitalized-after-taxi-hits-pedestrians-in-midtown-manhattan>Gothamist reported</a>: &ldquo;Four people, including a 9-year-old boy and two women, were hospitalized with injuries; all were in stable condition.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-laws-and-the-slow-grind>Leadership: Promises, Laws, and the Slow Grind</h3><p>Council Member <strong>Keith Powers has backed safety bills</strong>. He voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished people for crossing the street while drivers kept killing with impunity. He supported the <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/12/07/council-votes-to-repeal-decade-old-law-expedite-bike-lane-installation>repeal of a law that stalled bike lane construction</a>, cutting red tape so the city can build faster. He co-sponsored a <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>bill to ban parking near crosswalks</a>, aiming to clear sightlines for those on foot. He pushed for a citywide greenway plan, more protected bike lanes, and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/14/council-passes-battery-buy-back-program-and-other-bills-to-curb-lithium-ion-fires>safer batteries for delivery workers</a>. But the pace is slow. The blood dries before the paint hits the street.</p><p><strong>Big plans are coming.</strong> Fifth Avenue will get wider sidewalks, but no new bike or bus lanes. Advocates <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/21/us-news/nycs-fifth-avenue-getting-400m-pedestrian-centered-makeover-that-drivers-and-cyclists-are-sure-to-hate/>call it a failure</a>. &ldquo;This plan entirely fails to meet the moment,&rdquo; said <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/21/us-news/nycs-fifth-avenue-getting-400m-pedestrian-centered-makeover-that-drivers-and-cyclists-are-sure-to-hate/>Transportation Alternatives</a>. The city promises a <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/dot-proposes-transforming-34th-st-into-mostly-car-free-busway-much-like-14th-st-AY4607640>car-free 34th Street busway</a>, but the cars still run. The danger remains.</p><h3 id=what-next-the-fight-is-not-over>What Next: The Fight Is Not Over</h3><p><strong>Every delay costs lives.</strong> Every watered-down bill, every unbuilt lane, every curb left unprotected is a choice. The crisis is not fate. It is policy. <strong>Call Council Member Powers. Demand faster action.</strong> Demand real protection for people on foot and bike. Join with others. Do not wait for the next siren.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, claimed, "the future of New York City is reimagining the use of public space." Mayor Eric Adams said he was open to plazas, bike racks, or curb extensions—anything but more car storage. Despite these statements, the site became street parking. Council Member Keith Powers, representing the district, said, "I would love something more interesting here than parking," and called for renewed discussion on a permanent outdoor dining program.

The Department of Transportation aims to cut vehicle lanes and expand the median between East 46th and 57th streets. The proposal, discussed in the council and supported by Powers, seeks to create more open, accessible public space. The matter summary calls it a 'shift toward a more pedestrian-friendly experience.' Advocates like Jon Orcutt (Bike New York) and Danny Harris (Transportation Alternatives) urge the city to add a median-side bikeway and maximize pedestrian and green space. The project aligns with the NYC 25x25 plan to convert 25 percent of car space for people by 2025. Private interests, including the local Business Improvement District and Fisher Brothers, are helping fund the effort. The plan’s final shape remains undecided, but the push for safer, people-first streets is clear.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Final design still unknown.</p><p class=mb3>On January 25, 2022, the city Department of Transportation advanced a proposal to reclaim car space on Park Avenue. The plan, discussed in committee and supported by Council Member Keith Powers, aims to expand the median from 20 to 48 feet by removing one of three vehicle lanes. The project, described as a 'once-in-a-lifetime opportunity' by Alfred Cerullo of the Grand Central Partnership, seeks to create more open, accessible public space for people and businesses in East Midtown. Advocates like Jon Orcutt (Bike New York) and Danny Harris (Transportation Alternatives) urge the city to maximize space for people, calling for fully car-free stretches and a bike lane, since Park Avenue has no bus routes. The plan aligns with the NYC 25x25 initiative to convert 25% of car space to people space by 2025. Private commercial interests, including the local Business Improvement District and Fisher Brothers, are supporting and funding the project. The final design will be set by a landscape architect’s master plan.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Transportation Alternatives’ Cory Epstein says, 'Busways and bike lanes are good for the economy, good for our climate, and good for our Vision Zero goals.' Since the project’s announcement, crashes and injuries continue on the corridor.
