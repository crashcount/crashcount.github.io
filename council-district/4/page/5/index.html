Since 2022, eight people have died and 47 have been seriously injured in crashes. The wounded are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. In the last twelve months alone, four more lives ended. Three of them were over 65. The old do not move fast enough for the city’s machines.</p><p>A child struck on East 14th Street. An elderly pedestrian knocked down by a reversing SUV on Lexington. A cyclist crushed on Fifth Avenue. The blood dries, but the pain does not leave. 904 people have been hurt in the last year. The city keeps moving. The bodies are cleared. The danger remains.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>Cars and trucks did the most harm. They killed at least one person and injured over 400 more. Motorcycles and mopeds left dozens hurt. Bikes, too, have drawn blood, but the numbers are smaller. The street is a battlefield. The weapons are heavy and fast.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h3><p>Council Member Keith Powers has spoken for safety. He backed the repeal of a law that stalled bike lanes, saying, &ldquo;2023 is sadly on track to be the deadliest year in decades for cyclists, underscoring the need for a cohesive network of bike lanes across New York City&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/12/07/council-votes-to-repeal-decade-old-law-expedite-bike-lane-installation>said Powers</a>). He co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, to clear sightlines and protect people on foot. He led on battery buy-backs for delivery workers, saying, &ldquo;We will provide them the opportunity to surrender that unsafe equipment and receive a safe replacement&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/14/council-passes-battery-buy-back-program-and-other-bills-to-curb-lithium-ion-fires>said Powers</a>).</p><p>But the street does not wait for laws to pass. Projects stall. Promises linger. The city paused the 34th Street busway (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/03/anti-miracle-on-34th-street-adams-administration-pauses-work-on-34th-street-busway>paused the 34th Street busway</a>). Fifth Avenue’s redesign cut out protected bike lanes (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/14/civic-panel-dings-adams-for-cutting-bike-and-bus-lanes-out-of-fifth-av-redesign>cut out protected bike lanes</a>). The old dangers remain. The new ones grow.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Every crash is a choice made by the city. Every delay is a risk paid in flesh. Call Council Member Powers. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes, daylighted intersections, and busways that do not vanish at the last minute. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, sponsored by Council Member Lincoln Restler, cleared the Council with a 32-15 vote. It reduces the waiting period after community board notification from 90 days plus 45 after a hearing, to just 14 days. The matter summary reads: 'The City Council repealed a decade-old law that imposed lengthy delays on the city before it could break ground on new bike lanes.' Restler said, 'No other transportation project in New York City...requires this type of extended dead period.' Council Member Keith Powers backed the bill, citing rising cyclist deaths. The Department of Transportation called bike lanes 'life-saving infrastructure.' The amended bill now covers all bike lanes, regardless of length.

The Council passed laws banning uncertified lithium-ion batteries and launched a trade-in program for unsafe batteries. The matter, titled 'NYC e-bike owners wonder where to store them as landlords fear battery fires,' highlights the tension: 'We're going to get into the business of getting the dangerous equipment off the street and set up a fund to do that,' Powers said. Advocacy groups, including Danny Harris, called for expanded safe bike parking and charging, stressing that e-bikes are a lifeline for many New Yorkers. The crackdown has led to stricter landlord policies, increased enforcement, and declining bike shop sales. The Council aims to improve safety without cutting off access for vulnerable road users who depend on e-bikes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) will start enforcing the ban on uncertified lithium-ion battery sales. Inspectors will also check for illegal mopeds, issuing summonses and referring cases to NYPD and FDNY. DCWP spokesperson Michael Lanza said, 'While inspecting retailers for compliance with LL39, we will also check for illegal motorized scooters [mopeds], issue summonses and refer issues to NYPD and FDNY as appropriate.' Two days earlier, the City Council passed Council Member Keith Powers's bill for a citywide battery buyback program, letting delivery workers swap faulty batteries for certified ones. Powers acknowledged the ongoing problem of illegal mopeds, stating, 'We recognize that problem. We've been talking to the deputy mayor's office about further measures ahead.' The new law targets fire risk and unregulated vehicles, but loopholes in moped sales and enforcement persist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The main bill, introduced by Council Member Keith Powers, creates a city-funded buy-back program for delivery workers to exchange faulty batteries and devices for safe, certified ones. The matter summary states the program aims to address the high cost of certified batteries, which can be prohibitive for low-paid workers. Council Members Oswald Feliz and Gale Brewer sponsored additional bills: Feliz's requires safe bikes and batteries for deliveries, while Brewer's mandates delivery apps provide safety training and equipment. Brewer also called for the Department of Transportation to update its safety course. Powers said, "We will provide them the opportunity to surrender that unsafe equipment and receive a safe replacement." The Council's action follows 180 battery fire incidents, 14 deaths, and over 100 injuries this year. Lawmakers push for delivery companies to take responsibility for worker safety and equipment standards. Enforcement against uncertified battery sales will begin soon.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
