Six left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong> In the last year and a half, District 4 has seen 891 crashes—nearly three a day. These are not just numbers. They are people: a cyclist crushed by a turning sedan on East 41st, an elderly pedestrian struck by a reversing SUV on Lexington, a woman bleeding in the crosswalk after a taxi failed to yield. The city records the date and the wound. The street keeps moving.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p><strong>The old, the young, the ones on foot or bike.</strong> Three people over 65 killed in the last twelve months. Nineteen children hurt. The city’s own data shows the killers: cars, SUVs, trucks, taxis. <strong>&ldquo;2023 is sadly on track to be the deadliest year in decades for cyclists,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/12/07/council-votes-to-repeal-decade-old-law-expedite-bike-lane-installation>said Council Member Keith Powers</a>. He called for faster bike lane construction. But the lanes come slow. The injuries come fast.</p><h2 id=leadership-progress-and-delay>Leadership: Progress and Delay</h2><p>Council Member Powers has backed bills to speed up bike lane installation, legalize jaywalking, and ban parking near crosswalks. He pushed for a battery buy-back to protect delivery workers. <strong>&ldquo;We will provide them the opportunity to surrender that unsafe equipment and receive a safe replacement,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/14/council-passes-battery-buy-back-program-and-other-bills-to-curb-lithium-ion-fires>he said</a>. He supported the 34th Street busway, then watched as the city paused it. He called for using idle congestion pricing cameras for enforcement, but the equipment sits unused. Each delay is another day of risk for people walking, biking, or waiting for the bus.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>The deaths are not fate. They are policy.</strong> Every crash that kills a child or an elder is a choice made by leaders who move too slow. Call Council Member Powers. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes on every avenue. Demand the busway. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) will start enforcing the ban on uncertified lithium-ion battery sales. Inspectors will also check for illegal mopeds, issuing summonses and referring cases to NYPD and FDNY. DCWP spokesperson Michael Lanza said, 'While inspecting retailers for compliance with LL39, we will also check for illegal motorized scooters [mopeds], issue summonses and refer issues to NYPD and FDNY as appropriate.' Two days earlier, the City Council passed Council Member Keith Powers's bill for a citywide battery buyback program, letting delivery workers swap faulty batteries for certified ones. Powers acknowledged the ongoing problem of illegal mopeds, stating, 'We recognize that problem. We've been talking to the deputy mayor's office about further measures ahead.' The new law targets fire risk and unregulated vehicles, but loopholes in moped sales and enforcement persist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The main bill, introduced by Council Member Keith Powers, creates a city-funded buy-back program for delivery workers to exchange faulty batteries and devices for safe, certified ones. The matter summary states the program aims to address the high cost of certified batteries, which can be prohibitive for low-paid workers. Council Members Oswald Feliz and Gale Brewer sponsored additional bills: Feliz's requires safe bikes and batteries for deliveries, while Brewer's mandates delivery apps provide safety training and equipment. Brewer also called for the Department of Transportation to update its safety course. Powers said, "We will provide them the opportunity to surrender that unsafe equipment and receive a safe replacement." The Council's action follows 180 battery fire incidents, 14 deaths, and over 100 injuries this year. Lawmakers push for delivery companies to take responsibility for worker safety and equipment standards. Enforcement against uncertified battery sales will begin soon.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill is in committee, with Powers urging Mayor Adams and the FDNY to support it, stating, 'There is a clear consensus that a battery swap program will save lives.' Mayor Adams questioned the program's cost and called for federal, state, and Council funding. FDNY Commissioner Laura Kavanagh backed the need for safe batteries for delivery workers. The Council's push comes as battery fires rise, endangering workers and residents.

The matter title calls on delivery app companies to 'step up' and protect workers from deadly battery fires. Powers declared, 'We're failing as policy makers if we're not protecting folks from that.' Assistant Commissioner Carlos Ortiz and FDNY Code Counsel Julian Bazel testified in support. Both bills have majority Council backing. The Adams administration supports the spirit of the buyback. Delivery workers, mostly low-income immigrants, face high costs for safe batteries and deadly risk from unsafe ones. In 2023 alone, 63 lithium-ion fires caused 52 injuries and five deaths.

The effort comes as New York City faces a surge in deadly fires caused by uncertified lithium-ion batteries used by delivery workers. The initiative, supported by Mayor Adams and Council Member Keith Powers, aims to get safer, certified batteries into the hands of low-income delivery workers. Powers introduced legislation for a citywide buy-back program, stressing, 'we have to make sure that alongside shutting down the market for unsafe batteries, we remember that there are people affected by this.' Uber will also donate $100,000 to the FDNY Foundation for e-bike safety education. The city’s recent plan to combat battery fires highlights the need for private companies to take responsibility.
