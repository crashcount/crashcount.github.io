Twelve left with injuries that will never heal.</strong> In the last year and a half, District 4 has seen 1,603 crashes. Eight children struck. Three seniors killed. The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>A woman crossing 1st Avenue, struck by a taxi. A cyclist crushed by a turning sedan. A child hit by a convertible on East 14th. These are not accidents. They are the price of delay, the cost of inaction. The street remembers every name, even when the city forgets.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Council Member Keith Powers has stood up for some safety bills. He backed the repeal of a law that stalled bike lanes, saying, <strong>&ldquo;2023 is sadly on track to be the deadliest year in decades for cyclists, underscoring the need for a cohesive network of bike lanes across New York City.&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/12/07/council-votes-to-repeal-decade-old-law-expedite-bike-lane-installation>Council repeals decade-old law</a></p><p>He co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, pushing for daylight at a thousand intersections a year. He led on battery safety for delivery workers, saying, <strong>&ldquo;We know there are folks who can&rsquo;t afford high-priced batteries and bikes, and we will provide them the opportunity to surrender that unsafe equipment and receive a safe replacement.&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/14/council-passes-battery-buy-back-program-and-other-bills-to-curb-lithium-ion-fires>Council passes battery buy-back program</a></p><p>But the blood keeps coming. The 34th Street busway, a lifeline for bus riders and walkers, was paused. Powers slammed the reversal, but the street stayed the same. Congestion pricing sits in limbo. The city moves slow. The dead do not wait.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every delay is a choice. Call Council Member Powers. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people on foot and bike. Do not wait for another child’s shoe in the crosswalk. <strong>Act now.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bills—Intro. 393-A, 391-A, 394-A (sponsored by Council Member Keith Powers), and Intro. 660-A, 661-A (sponsored by Council Member Erik Bottcher)—cut shed permit durations from one year to three months, double required lighting, and impose new penalties for delays. The matter summary states: 'New laws are set to finally tackle the scourge of unsightly sidewalk construction sheds and scaffolding structures around the city.' Powers said, 'This package of legislation puts forward reforms to fundamentally change our approach to scaffolding while ensuring safety is still the top priority.' Bottcher added, 'It’s time we cut back the endless sidewalk sheds that block our light.' The reforms target over 400 miles of lingering scaffolding, aiming to restore light and space to city sidewalks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
