Seventeen suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. The dead include elders, cyclists, and people just crossing the street. A 67-year-old cyclist killed on Fifth Avenue. An 83-year-old woman struck while crossing with the light. A man crushed by a bus, far from any intersection. These are not numbers. They are lives ended, families broken.</p><h2 id=the-policy-response-promises-and-delays>The Policy Response: Promises and Delays</h2><p>Council Member Keith Powers has spoken up for safer streets. When the Council repealed a law that delayed bike lanes, Powers said, <strong>&ldquo;2023 is sadly on track to be the deadliest year in decades for cyclists, underscoring the need for a cohesive network of bike lanes across New York City.&rdquo;</strong> Powers <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/12/07/council-votes-to-repeal-decade-old-law-expedite-bike-lane-installation>backed the bill to speed up bike lane construction</a>. Powers also co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, forcing the city to clear 1,000 intersections a year. He pushed for the 34th Street busway, saying, <strong>&ldquo;It’s time to get buses moving faster, and the busway will do just that.&rdquo;</strong> He <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/34th-street-buses-midtown-manhattan/>called for faster service and safer streets</a>.</p><p>But the carnage continues. Cars, trucks, and taxis still rule the avenue. The city moves slow. Each delay means another name on the list.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars killed three.</strong> Trucks and buses killed one. Bikes and motorcycles left dozens more hurt. The old, the young, the ones on foot or two wheels—they pay the price for every blind corner and every unchecked driver. The street does not forgive.</p><h2 id=what-now-demand-action>What Now? Demand Action</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call Council Member Powers. Demand faster action: more daylighted corners, more protected bike lanes, a 20 mph speed limit, and real enforcement against reckless drivers. <strong>Do not wait for another obituary.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The article details a standoff between the MTA, New York State, and U.S. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy, who demands the tolls be taken down, threatening to withhold highway funds. The MTA argues the legality of the tolls and seeks a court injunction, stating, 'congestion pricing is legal and proper.' The system, operational since January 2025, has reduced daily vehicle entries into Manhattan’s core by 76,000 in April and raised $159 million in the first quarter. The dispute highlights tensions over funding priorities and the impact on lower-income drivers, but the courts, not drivers or pedestrians, will decide the fate of the tolls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, to be presented to community boards, would restrict through car traffic between Third and Ninth avenues, forcing cars to turn off at the first opportunity. The matter aims to address congestion and slow bus speeds on the M34, where buses average five to seven miles per hour. Council Member Keith Powers, who rides the route daily, said, "If you dedicate a big chunk of a corridor to bus service, you will see strong results." Powers and community leaders support the move, citing the 14th Street busway’s success: a 24 percent speed boost and 30 percent ridership jump. The proposal follows years of planning and comes as congestion pricing looms. Some advocates remain wary, recalling Mayor Adams’s past delays and reduced busway hours. The city faces pressure to make the busway permanent and effective for all vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article states: 'forcing pedestrians and cyclists in both directions to share a single lane on a bridge with nine lanes for car drivers was unsafe.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, Queens Borough President Donovan Richards, and Council Member Julie Won attended the opening. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative change, so there is no direct impact on pedestrian or cyclist safety to assess.'

Advocates like Transportation Alternatives call the new policy 'a dangerous escalation.' The NYC E-Vehicle Safety Alliance urges lawmakers to require license plates for e-bikes and scooters. The article notes, 'Under the new policy, a person issued a criminal summons must turn up in person in criminal court.' The shift highlights growing tension over enforcement and the push for stricter regulation after high-profile crashes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
