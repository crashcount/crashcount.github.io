Over a thousand are hurt.</strong> In the last twelve months, District 4 saw 1,046 injuries and 16 serious injuries from 1,883 crashes. The dead include the old and the young. Three people over 65 lost their lives. Two more over 75. One in the prime of life, age 35 to 44, did not make it home (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Just last week, a firefighter died on the FDR Drive. He fell from his motorcycle. A car hit him and kept going. Police said, <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/31-year-old-firefighter-matthew-goicochea-killed-overnight-motorcycle-crash-fdr-drive-fdny-says/17279439/>&ldquo;he was struck by an unknown vehicle that did not remain on the scene.&rdquo;</a> His family will bury him. The driver is still out there.</p><p>On Canal Street, a hit-and-run killed a pedestrian and a cyclist. The community gathered to mourn. The crash, a reporter said, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/vigil-held-for-pedestrian-cyclist-killed-in-chinatown-hit-and-run/>&ldquo;is raising questions about a bigger safety problem at an intersection of Canal Street.&rdquo;</a></p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists bleed most.</strong> In the last year, cars and SUVs killed three people and injured hundreds more. Trucks and buses added to the toll. Bikes and mopeds, too, but the numbers are dwarfed by the carnage from cars (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The stories repeat. A woman crossing with the light, struck by a box truck. A cyclist crushed by a turning sedan. Blood on the crosswalk. Names fade. The pain remains.</p><h2 id=what-has-keith-powers-done>What Has Keith Powers Done?</h2><p>Council Member Keith Powers has backed some safety bills. He co-sponsored a law to ban parking near crosswalks, to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>&ldquo;keep crosswalks clear, improve visibility, and protect people on foot and bike.&rdquo;</a> He supported repealing a law that delayed bike lanes, saying, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/12/07/council-votes-to-repeal-decade-old-law-expedite-bike-lane-installation>&ldquo;2023 is sadly on track to be the deadliest year in decades for cyclists, underscoring the need for a cohesive network of bike lanes across New York City.&rdquo;</a></p><p>He pushed for a city-funded buy-back program so delivery workers could trade unsafe e-bike batteries for safe ones: <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/14/council-passes-battery-buy-back-program-and-other-bills-to-curb-lithium-ion-fires>&ldquo;We will provide them the opportunity to surrender that unsafe equipment and receive a safe replacement.&rdquo;</a></p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The bills move slow. The streets stay deadly.</p><h2 id=what-next>What Next?</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Powers. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand protected bike lanes, not promises. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Patrick Hendry of the Police Benevolent Association claimed officers "lost sight of the car and did not know it crashed," but the family's attorney, Jeremy Feigenbaum, said their investigation "has not corroborated the officers' claim."

Powers said, 'This package of legislation puts forward reforms to fundamentally change our approach to scaffolding while ensuring safety is still the top priority.'

The article notes the police are investigating if officers left the scene without reporting the crash. The incident came three months after NYPD restricted car chases for low-level offenses. Commissioner Tisch said, “Our officers deserve clear guidance and smart protocols when determining whether to engage in a vehicle pursuit on our streets.” The pursuit was reportedly justified under new policy, which still allows chases for serious crimes.
