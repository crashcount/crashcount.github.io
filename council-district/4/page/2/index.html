Since 2022, eight people have died and 47 have been seriously injured in crashes. The wounded are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. In the last twelve months alone, four more lives ended. Three of them were over 65. The old do not move fast enough for the city’s machines.</p><p>A child struck on East 14th Street. An elderly pedestrian knocked down by a reversing SUV on Lexington. A cyclist crushed on Fifth Avenue. The blood dries, but the pain does not leave. 904 people have been hurt in the last year. The city keeps moving. The bodies are cleared. The danger remains.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>Cars and trucks did the most harm. They killed at least one person and injured over 400 more. Motorcycles and mopeds left dozens hurt. Bikes, too, have drawn blood, but the numbers are smaller. The street is a battlefield. The weapons are heavy and fast.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h3><p>Council Member Keith Powers has spoken for safety. He backed the repeal of a law that stalled bike lanes, saying, &ldquo;2023 is sadly on track to be the deadliest year in decades for cyclists, underscoring the need for a cohesive network of bike lanes across New York City&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/12/07/council-votes-to-repeal-decade-old-law-expedite-bike-lane-installation>said Powers</a>). He co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, to clear sightlines and protect people on foot. He led on battery buy-backs for delivery workers, saying, &ldquo;We will provide them the opportunity to surrender that unsafe equipment and receive a safe replacement&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/14/council-passes-battery-buy-back-program-and-other-bills-to-curb-lithium-ion-fires>said Powers</a>).</p><p>But the street does not wait for laws to pass. Projects stall. Promises linger. The city paused the 34th Street busway (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/03/anti-miracle-on-34th-street-adams-administration-pauses-work-on-34th-street-busway>paused the 34th Street busway</a>). Fifth Avenue’s redesign cut out protected bike lanes (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/14/civic-panel-dings-adams-for-cutting-bike-and-bus-lanes-out-of-fifth-av-redesign>cut out protected bike lanes</a>). The old dangers remain. The new ones grow.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Every crash is a choice made by the city. Every delay is a risk paid in flesh. Call Council Member Powers. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes, daylighted intersections, and busways that do not vanish at the last minute. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Cyclists and advocates argue the penalties are harsher than those faced by drivers for similar actions. As one protester said, “It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.” Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the crackdown, citing the lack of licensing for e-bikes as a challenge for enforcement, but acknowledged the need for legislative reform. The article highlights inconsistent enforcement and the risks faced by vulnerable road users, especially delivery workers.

The Department of Transportation aims to allow only buses and trucks, forcing cars to turn off quickly. The M34 bus, used by 28,000 daily riders, currently averages just 3 mph during rush hour. Officials cite the 2019 14th Street busway, which increased bus speeds by 24% and reduced crash injuries. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'The vast majority of commuters in Midtown are traveling by transit and they deserve world-class, fast, and reliable buses.' The plan includes pedestrian improvements like shorter intersections and brighter crosswalks. The move follows previous controversies over similar projects but reflects a push for safer, more efficient streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Keith Powers, who rides the M34, voiced strong support: 'If you dedicate a big chunk of a corridor to bus service, you will see strong results.' The proposal is not yet a formal bill and has not reached any council committee. Activists and elected officials with experience on 14th Street back the move, citing faster buses and higher ridership. However, the event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative action, so no assessment of safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists can be made.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, to be presented to community boards, would restrict through car traffic between Third and Ninth avenues, forcing cars to turn off at the first opportunity. The matter aims to address congestion and slow bus speeds on the M34, where buses average five to seven miles per hour. Council Member Keith Powers, who rides the route daily, said, "If you dedicate a big chunk of a corridor to bus service, you will see strong results." Powers and community leaders support the move, citing the 14th Street busway’s success: a 24 percent speed boost and 30 percent ridership jump. The proposal follows years of planning and comes as congestion pricing looms. Some advocates remain wary, recalling Mayor Adams’s past delays and reduced busway hours. The city faces pressure to make the busway permanent and effective for all vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, not a council bill but a city action, drew sharp criticism from U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, who opposed removing a vehicle lane for pedestrians and cyclists. The article states: 'forcing pedestrians and cyclists in both directions to share a single lane on a bridge with nine lanes for car drivers was unsafe.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, Queens Borough President Donovan Richards, and Council Member Julie Won attended the opening. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative change, so there is no direct impact on pedestrian or cyclist safety to assess.' Still, the move restores space to those on foot and bike, challenging car dominance and federal resistance.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
