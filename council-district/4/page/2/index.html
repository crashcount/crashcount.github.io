A 21-year-old, unlicensed driver in a Nissan Rogue struck him and fled. The cyclist was left with severe head trauma, unconscious as paramedics worked to save him. The street shut down, red lights flashing, a crumpled bike in the road. Police arrested the driver two hours later. The charge: leaving the scene, driving without a license. The investigation continues. <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/driver-arrested-after-collision-with-e-biker-on-second-ave-XF4896347>&ldquo;The biker was rushed by EMS to Bellevue Hospital in critical condition.&rdquo;</a></p><p>This is not rare. In the last twelve months, District 4 saw <strong>7 deaths and 16 serious injuries</strong> from crashes. Cyclists, pedestrians, elders, children. The numbers do not flinch. <strong>Over 1,000 injuries. Nearly 1,900 crashes.</strong></p><h2 id=patterns-of-harm-who-pays-the-price>Patterns of Harm: Who Pays the Price</h2><p>The violence does not choose at random. <strong>SUVs and cars killed three people and injured hundreds</strong>. Trucks and buses took another life and left dozens more hurt. Even bikes and mopeds, often the last resort for workers, add to the toll. The old and the young are not spared. Three people over 65 killed this year alone. Two more over 75. The city keeps counting. The bodies keep coming.</p><h2 id=council-member-keith-powers-action-and-inaction>Council Member Keith Powers: Action and Inaction</h2><p>Council Member Keith Powers has spoken for safer streets. He backed the repeal of a law that delayed bike lane construction, saying, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/12/07/council-votes-to-repeal-decade-old-law-expedite-bike-lane-installation>&ldquo;2023 is sadly on track to be the deadliest year in decades for cyclists, underscoring the need for a cohesive network of bike lanes across New York City.&rdquo;</a> He co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, to clear sightlines and protect those on foot. But the bill sits, waiting. The dead do not wait.</p><p>Powers has also pushed for safer e-bike batteries, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/14/council-passes-battery-buy-back-program-and-other-bills-to-curb-lithium-ion-fires>&ldquo;We know there are folks who can&rsquo;t afford high-priced batteries and bikes, and we will provide them the opportunity to surrender that unsafe equipment and receive a safe replacement.&rdquo;</a> He has supported busways and protected bike lanes. But the pace is slow. The streets are not safe.</p><h2 id=what-now-the-cost-of-delay>What Now: The Cost of Delay</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay means another life at risk.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits, clear crosswalks, and build real protection for those outside a car. The council can act. The mayor can act. You can act.</p><p><strong>Call Council Member Powers. Demand the citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighting at every intersection. Demand protected bike lanes, not just promises.</strong></p><p>The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice. Make them choose safety.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Systemic danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13, 2025, the Adams administration launched the NYC e-bike trade-in program. No bill number or committee is listed, but the $2-million program stems from a 2023 bill by Council Member Keith Powers. Streetsblog NYC reports: 'The Adams administration is both cracking down on e-bikes and providing safer e-bikes to workers.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'This is not just about protecting delivery workers. It’s about protecting them, their families, their neighbors, and all New Yorkers from deadly fires.' Delivery worker William Medina praised the program, but called for expansion. The program lets workers trade uncertified bikes or illegal mopeds for certified e-bikes, but covers only a fraction of the city’s 80,000 delivery workers. The safety analyst notes: Cracking down may burden vulnerable users, while safer bikes help; mixed signals mean no clear safety gain. The city’s approach leaves vulnerable road users in limbo.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article notes, 'Fires from unregulated e-bike batteries have already caused too much harm, including tragic loss of life.' The city’s $2 million pilot lets delivery workers exchange uncertified e-bikes and batteries for certified, UL-standard models. The program also requires a safety course. While battery-related fires rose slightly from 268 in 2023 to 277 in 2024, fatalities fell from 18 to 6.

Council Members Erik Bottcher and Keith Powers, who represent the corridor, both support the measure. The resolution urges the city to prioritize the busway, which would ban through traffic by private cars between Third and Ninth avenues. Leadership from Community Boards 4 and 5 also joined the call.

Lander promised more protected bike lanes, a citywide Bus Rapid Transit network, and using congestion pricing revenue for busways and bikeways. He pledged six-minute service on subways and buses and action on street homelessness. StreetsPAC’s endorsement signals strong support for policies that prioritize vulnerable road users.

The measure, discussed in the Council but not yet assigned a bill number or committee, comes as Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch launches a crackdown on cyclists. Powers said, "I am interested in all measures that might address keeping our street experience here in the city feeling much safer and slowing down any vehicle or device or instrument that could hurt someone." Despite state authority to lower car speed limits, neither the mayor nor the Council act to curb car speeds citywide. Advocates and some officials slam the focus on e-bikes, pointing to data: cars and trucks cause nearly all pedestrian injuries. The safety analyst notes no direct safety impact for vulnerable users, as no specific policy change is enacted.

Tension rises between speed, safety, and neighborhood calm.</p><p class=mb3>The New York Post (2025-06-08) reports that the city proposes restricting cars on 34th Street to create a busway between 3rd and 9th Avenues. Residents worry rerouted vehicles will jam local streets and worsen safety. Jessica Lavoie of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association warns, "diverting traffic from this critical corridor onto narrow residential streets would lead to increased congestion, safety hazards, and diminished quality of life." The Department of Transportation aims to replicate the 14th Street busway, which "reduced congestion, sped up bus travel and curbed accidents." The article highlights the ongoing struggle to balance efficient transit, tunnel access, and neighborhood safety. No specific driver errors are cited, but the plan underscores the systemic risks of shifting car traffic onto residential blocks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

After hitting Esiyok, Ali continued, injuring a cyclist, two more pedestrians, and crashing into a van.

The bill, not yet numbered or assigned to committee, follows Mayor Adams's push to address what he calls street 'chaos.' Powers said, 'Biking is a crucial tool to tackle the climate crisis... but we also must address the well-documented concerns about safety.' He proposes a $50 penalty for violations. Critics, including Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives, call the measure 'half-baked and ill-conceived,' warning it escalates the city's 'misguided war on biking.' Safety analyst notes show the policy may discourage cycling, reducing mode shift from cars and undermining safety in numbers. Enforcement has historically targeted Black and brown cyclists, while drivers—responsible for most deaths—face lighter penalties. The bill risks making streets less safe for those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
