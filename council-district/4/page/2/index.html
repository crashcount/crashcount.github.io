Seventeen suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. The dead include elders, cyclists, and people just crossing the street. A 67-year-old cyclist killed on Fifth Avenue. An 83-year-old woman struck while crossing with the light. A man crushed by a bus, far from any intersection. These are not numbers. They are lives ended, families broken.</p><h2 id=the-policy-response-promises-and-delays>The Policy Response: Promises and Delays</h2><p>Council Member Keith Powers has spoken up for safer streets. When the Council repealed a law that delayed bike lanes, Powers said, <strong>&ldquo;2023 is sadly on track to be the deadliest year in decades for cyclists, underscoring the need for a cohesive network of bike lanes across New York City.&rdquo;</strong> Powers <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/12/07/council-votes-to-repeal-decade-old-law-expedite-bike-lane-installation>backed the bill to speed up bike lane construction</a>. Powers also co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, forcing the city to clear 1,000 intersections a year. He pushed for the 34th Street busway, saying, <strong>&ldquo;It’s time to get buses moving faster, and the busway will do just that.&rdquo;</strong> He <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/34th-street-buses-midtown-manhattan/>called for faster service and safer streets</a>.</p><p>But the carnage continues. Cars, trucks, and taxis still rule the avenue. The city moves slow. Each delay means another name on the list.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars killed three.</strong> Trucks and buses killed one. Bikes and motorcycles left dozens more hurt. The old, the young, the ones on foot or two wheels—they pay the price for every blind corner and every unchecked driver. The street does not forgive.</p><h2 id=what-now-demand-action>What Now? Demand Action</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call Council Member Powers. Demand faster action: more daylighted corners, more protected bike lanes, a 20 mph speed limit, and real enforcement against reckless drivers. <strong>Do not wait for another obituary.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

No bill number or committee is listed, but the $2-million program stems from a 2023 bill by Council Member Keith Powers. Streetsblog NYC reports: 'The Adams administration is both cracking down on e-bikes and providing safer e-bikes to workers.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'This is not just about protecting delivery workers. It’s about protecting them, their families, their neighbors, and all New Yorkers from deadly fires.' Delivery worker William Medina praised the program, but called for expansion. The program lets workers trade uncertified bikes or illegal mopeds for certified e-bikes, but covers only a fraction of the city’s 80,000 delivery workers. The safety analyst notes: Cracking down may burden vulnerable users, while safer bikes help; mixed signals mean no clear safety gain.

The measure, discussed in the Council but not yet assigned a bill number or committee, comes as Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch launches a crackdown on cyclists. Powers said, "I am interested in all measures that might address keeping our street experience here in the city feeling much safer and slowing down any vehicle or device or instrument that could hurt someone." Despite state authority to lower car speed limits, neither the mayor nor the Council act to curb car speeds citywide. Advocates and some officials slam the focus on e-bikes, pointing to data: cars and trucks cause nearly all pedestrian injuries. The safety analyst notes no direct safety impact for vulnerable users, as no specific policy change is enacted.

Streets stay deadly for the most vulnerable.</p><p class=mb3>On June 6, 2025, Manhattan Council Member Keith Powers announced plans to introduce legislation lowering e-bike speed limits to 15 miles per hour. The bill, not yet numbered or assigned to committee, follows Mayor Adams's push to address what he calls street 'chaos.' Powers said, 'Biking is a crucial tool to tackle the climate crisis... but we also must address the well-documented concerns about safety.' He proposes a $50 penalty for violations. Critics, including Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives, call the measure 'half-baked and ill-conceived,' warning it escalates the city's 'misguided war on biking.' Safety analyst notes show the policy may discourage cycling, reducing mode shift from cars and undermining safety in numbers. Enforcement has historically targeted Black and brown cyclists, while drivers—responsible for most deaths—face lighter penalties. The bill risks making streets less safe for those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crackdown targets delivery workers, especially undocumented riders, for offenses like sidewalk riding and nonstandard bike setups. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the move, stating, 'When it comes to traffic safety, compliance is not optional.' Protesters and advocates argue the policy is discriminatory and escalates minor violations, risking severe consequences for vulnerable workers. Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives called it 'really inappropriate escalation.'

As one protester said, “It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.” Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the crackdown, citing the lack of licensing for e-bikes as a challenge for enforcement, but acknowledged the need for legislative reform.
