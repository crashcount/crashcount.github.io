Twelve left with injuries that will never heal.</strong> In the last year and a half, District 4 has seen 1,603 crashes. Eight children struck. Three seniors killed. The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>A woman crossing 1st Avenue, struck by a taxi. A cyclist crushed by a turning sedan. A child hit by a convertible on East 14th. These are not accidents. They are the price of delay, the cost of inaction. The street remembers every name, even when the city forgets.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Council Member Keith Powers has stood up for some safety bills. He backed the repeal of a law that stalled bike lanes, saying, <strong>&ldquo;2023 is sadly on track to be the deadliest year in decades for cyclists, underscoring the need for a cohesive network of bike lanes across New York City.&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/12/07/council-votes-to-repeal-decade-old-law-expedite-bike-lane-installation>Council repeals decade-old law</a></p><p>He co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, pushing for daylight at a thousand intersections a year. He led on battery safety for delivery workers, saying, <strong>&ldquo;We know there are folks who can&rsquo;t afford high-priced batteries and bikes, and we will provide them the opportunity to surrender that unsafe equipment and receive a safe replacement.&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/14/council-passes-battery-buy-back-program-and-other-bills-to-curb-lithium-ion-fires>Council passes battery buy-back program</a></p><p>But the blood keeps coming. The 34th Street busway, a lifeline for bus riders and walkers, was paused. Powers slammed the reversal, but the street stayed the same. Congestion pricing sits in limbo. The city moves slow. The dead do not wait.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every delay is a choice. Call Council Member Powers. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people on foot and bike. Do not wait for another child’s shoe in the crosswalk. <strong>Act now.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

As one protester said, “It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.” Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the crackdown, citing the lack of licensing for e-bikes as a challenge for enforcement, but acknowledged the need for legislative reform.

The MTA and state officials dismissed Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy’s threats to withdraw funding as a 'sham,' arguing that the dispute is already in court. Attorney Roberta Kaplan wrote, 'Secretary Duffy did not afford the Project Sponsors any notice or due process before that alleged termination.' The state’s response called the deadlines 'procedurally improper.'

The plan nearly doubles sidewalk widths and expands pedestrian zones, cutting space for vehicles. The redesign adds tree buffers, benches, and stormwater upgrades.

The plan, to be presented to community boards, would restrict through car traffic between Third and Ninth avenues, forcing cars to turn off at the first opportunity. The matter aims to address congestion and slow bus speeds on the M34, where buses average five to seven miles per hour. Council Member Keith Powers, who rides the route daily, said, "If you dedicate a big chunk of a corridor to bus service, you will see strong results." Powers and community leaders support the move, citing the 14th Street busway’s success: a 24 percent speed boost and 30 percent ridership jump. The proposal follows years of planning and comes as congestion pricing looms. Some advocates remain wary, recalling Mayor Adams’s past delays and reduced busway hours.

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, Queens Borough President Donovan Richards, and Council Member Julie Won attended the opening. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative change, so there is no direct impact on pedestrian or cyclist safety to assess.'

Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing.
