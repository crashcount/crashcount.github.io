Forty-three left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 2,500 hurt. The dead include a 22-year-old man crushed by an SUV at a Midtown intersection, a 39-year-old pedestrian struck by a bus, and a 46-year-old cyclist who never made it home. These are not just numbers. They are broken bodies, families waiting by hospital beds, shoes left on the curb.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the highest price.</strong> In the last year alone, three people over 65 died. One cyclist was killed by an SUV. A bus ended another life. Taxis, trucks, bikes, and cars all left their mark. Midtown sidewalks are not safe. The curb is no shield. A taxi jumped it and plowed into a crowd, sending a nine-year-old boy and two women to the hospital. Police said the driver had a medical episode. No charges filed. The street swallowed the pain and moved on. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/young-boy-two-women-hospitalized-after-taxi-hits-pedestrians-in-midtown-manhattan>Gothamist reported</a>: &ldquo;Four people, including a 9-year-old boy and two women, were hospitalized with injuries; all were in stable condition.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-laws-and-the-slow-grind>Leadership: Promises, Laws, and the Slow Grind</h3><p>Council Member <strong>Keith Powers has backed safety bills</strong>. He voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished people for crossing the street while drivers kept killing with impunity. He supported the <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/12/07/council-votes-to-repeal-decade-old-law-expedite-bike-lane-installation>repeal of a law that stalled bike lane construction</a>, cutting red tape so the city can build faster. He co-sponsored a <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>bill to ban parking near crosswalks</a>, aiming to clear sightlines for those on foot. He pushed for a citywide greenway plan, more protected bike lanes, and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/14/council-passes-battery-buy-back-program-and-other-bills-to-curb-lithium-ion-fires>safer batteries for delivery workers</a>. But the pace is slow. The blood dries before the paint hits the street.</p><p><strong>Big plans are coming.</strong> Fifth Avenue will get wider sidewalks, but no new bike or bus lanes. Advocates <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/21/us-news/nycs-fifth-avenue-getting-400m-pedestrian-centered-makeover-that-drivers-and-cyclists-are-sure-to-hate/>call it a failure</a>. &ldquo;This plan entirely fails to meet the moment,&rdquo; said <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/21/us-news/nycs-fifth-avenue-getting-400m-pedestrian-centered-makeover-that-drivers-and-cyclists-are-sure-to-hate/>Transportation Alternatives</a>.

Council Member Keith Powers pressed DOT for updates, saying, 'we shouldn’t miss a big opportunity to transform Fifth Avenue.' Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance called it 'one of the most important busways in the City.' Despite proven success elsewhere, business interests stalled progress. The current plan offers a protected bike lane and pedestrian improvements, but no dedicated bus lane. DOT has not provided a timeline. Advocates and local officials remain frustrated.

The Department of Transportation aims to cut vehicle lanes and expand the median between East 46th and 57th streets. The proposal, discussed in the council and supported by Powers, seeks to create more open, accessible public space. The matter summary calls it a 'shift toward a more pedestrian-friendly experience.' Advocates like Jon Orcutt (Bike New York) and Danny Harris (Transportation Alternatives) urge the city to add a median-side bikeway and maximize pedestrian and green space. The project aligns with the NYC 25x25 plan to convert 25 percent of car space for people by 2025. Private interests, including the local Business Improvement District and Fisher Brothers, are helping fund the effort.

Final design still unknown.</p><p class=mb3>On January 25, 2022, the city Department of Transportation advanced a proposal to reclaim car space on Park Avenue. The plan, discussed in committee and supported by Council Member Keith Powers, aims to expand the median from 20 to 48 feet by removing one of three vehicle lanes. The project, described as a 'once-in-a-lifetime opportunity' by Alfred Cerullo of the Grand Central Partnership, seeks to create more open, accessible public space for people and businesses in East Midtown. Advocates like Jon Orcutt (Bike New York) and Danny Harris (Transportation Alternatives) urge the city to maximize space for people, calling for fully car-free stretches and a bike lane, since Park Avenue has no bus routes. The plan aligns with the NYC 25x25 initiative to convert 25% of car space to people space by 2025. Private commercial interests, including the local Business Improvement District and Fisher Brothers, are supporting and funding the project. The final design will be set by a landscape architect’s master plan.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
