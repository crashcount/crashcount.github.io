Six people killed and over a thousand injured in the last year alone. The dead include a cyclist, a child, and three people over 65. The wounded are everywhere—on bikes, on foot, at the crosswalk, on the curb.</p><p>Just last month, a sedan turned left and crushed a cyclist on East 41st. A week before, a convertible struck a child on East 14th. The blood dries, but the street remembers.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>Cars and SUVs did the most harm. In three years, they killed 4 people and injured over 550. Taxis, trucks, and buses followed. Bikes and mopeds hurt dozens, but the deadliest force is always the car.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h3><p>Council Member Keith Powers has spoken for safer streets. He backed the repeal of a law that delayed bike lanes, saying, &ldquo;2023 is sadly on track to be the deadliest year in decades for cyclists, underscoring the need for a cohesive network of bike lanes across New York City&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/12/07/council-votes-to-repeal-decade-old-law-expedite-bike-lane-installation>repeal of a law that delayed bike lanes</a>). He co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, to keep sightlines clear for people on foot and bike. But the bill sits in committee, waiting.</p><p>Powers also led on battery safety for delivery workers, saying, &ldquo;We will provide them the opportunity to surrender that unsafe equipment and receive a safe replacement&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/14/council-passes-battery-buy-back-program-and-other-bills-to-curb-lithium-ion-fires>battery safety for delivery workers</a>).</p><p>But the streets are not safe.

Demand the citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighting at every crosswalk. Demand protected bike lanes, not just promises.</p><p>Every day of delay is another name on the list.

The plan, echoing a 2010 First Avenue project, repurposes 23 feet for cyclists and bus riders between E. 59th and E. 96th streets. Council Member Keith Powers and Borough President Mark Levine endorsed the proposal, with Levine stating, 'The redesign’s commitment to expanded protected bike lanes and dedicated bus lanes will turn this particularly dangerous stretch of the roadway into a safer, more efficient, and forward-thinking artery.' Still, Levine and advocates like Anna Melendez (Transportation Alternatives) pressed for more: wider sidewalks, hardened pedestrian islands, and real physical protection. The plan uses only paint and plastic, leaving pedestrians exposed. The proposal faces a full board vote on October 19, 2022. The city calls it a start, but the danger remains.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, discussed in the Board’s Transportation Committee, would convert two of five northbound car lanes into a dedicated bus lane and a parking-protected bike lane, with new pedestrian islands and signal priority. The committee voted 12-1 in favor. Councilmember Keith Powers, representing District 4, supports the overhaul. A spokesperson said, 'This project will expedite commute times, improve pedestrian safety, increase spaces for bikes, and ensure that cars, buses, and bikes can share the road in harmony.' Third Avenue is a Vision Zero priority corridor, scarred by six pedestrian and one cyclist death since 2016. Hundreds of cyclists ride here daily, despite no bike lane.

The resolution had earlier cleared the Transportation Committee 12-2. The measure follows the killing of cyclist Carling Mott by a truck driver on E. 85th Street, where a bike lane had been rejected in 2016. Council Members Julie Menin and Keith Powers, along with Borough President Mark Levine, backed the push. Advocates, including Mott’s boyfriend and parents of student cyclists, spoke out for safety, condemning the board’s past inaction. Only one board member, Marco Tamayo, opposed the resolution. The vote marks a sharp turn for CB8, which had long resisted protected lanes, citing security fears and local opposition.

Activists from StreetsPAC and Transportation Alternatives criticized the delay, noting that streets near schools are especially dangerous for children, particularly in Black and brown neighborhoods. Evidence from other cities shows stop-arm cameras catch hundreds of violations quickly. The law leaves the program to mayoral discretion. City Hall supports speed cameras but has not acted on stop-arm enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She lay bleeding, silent, in shock.' The police report lists 'Accelerator Defective' as the primary contributing factor. The pedestrian suffered severe head lacerations and was in shock. The bus driver, a 45-year-old woman, also reported pain in her arm. No other injuries were specified.

Council Member Keith Powers, representing the district, said, "I would love something more interesting here than parking," and called for renewed discussion on a permanent outdoor dining program.
