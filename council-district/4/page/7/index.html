Pedestrians took 806 injuries and 4 deaths; cyclists 694 injuries and 5 deaths. SUVs and cars led the harm to people on foot. Trucks and buses added their share. These are city records, not rumors.</li><li>The pain spikes in the afternoon. At 3 p.m., three people died. At 5 p.m., one more. Injuries peak from 2 to 6 p.m. The count does not slow at night; deaths also hit at 10 p.m., 9 p.m., and 10–11 p.m. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data shows each hour</a>.</li></ul><p>Sixth Avenue, First Avenue, the Drive</p><ul><li>The corner of <a href=#>Avenue of the Americas</a> is the district’s worst hotspot: 1 death, 63 injuries, 6 serious. <a href=#>Park Avenue</a> isn’t far behind. <a href=#>First Avenue</a> adds another death and 67 injuries. The <a href=#>FDR Drive</a> records 1 death and 232 injuries. These are not surprises; they are patterns in the city’s own files.</li><li>A left turn took an 83‑year‑old woman in a crosswalk on Sixth at West 58th. She had the signal. She died. The SUV was turning left. That is all we need to know. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City crash report</a> (CrashID 4792095).</li><li>On West 51st by Fifth, a parked SUV and an e‑bike collided. A 67‑year‑old cyclist was killed.

Advocates warned the rest of the corridor “will remain deadly.” The promise came after the bodies. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Gothamist</a>, <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/07/chinatown-deadly-crash-safety-upgrades-canal-street>NY1</a>.</li></ul><p>Fix what is killing people here</p><ul><li>Daylight the corners. A Council bill would ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and force at least 1,000 intersections a year to get barriers. It has broad support. It is sitting. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Council file</a> (Int 1138‑2024).</li><li>Harden the turns on Sixth, First, Park, and Lexington. Give leading pedestrian intervals. Protect the bike lanes across the crosstown grid. These tools are standard. The map tells you where to start: <a href=#>Sixth Avenue</a>, <a href=#>First Avenue</a>, <a href=#>Park Avenue</a>, <a href=#>Lexington</a>, the <a href=#>FDR</a>.</li><li>Target the hours that kill: 2–6 p.m., then 9–11 p.m. Prioritize trucks and buses on corridors with high pedestrian harm. The city’s own roll‑up shows the weight of large vehicles. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Vehicle roll‑up</a>.</li></ul><p>Slow every street; stop the worst</p><ul><li>Albany passed the tool to cut speeds. The city can set safer limits. Use it. Make 20 mph the rule where people walk and bike. Then go after repeat speeders. The Stop Super Speeders Act would force the heaviest offenders to install speed limiters after 11 DMV points in 18 months or 16 camera tickets in a year. One driver with 29 camera tickets killed a mother and two daughters in April.

The bill, sponsored by Oswald Feliz, Marjorie Velázquez, and Lincoln Restler, amends laws to ban selling counterfeit tags, with fines starting at $1,000 for first offenses and $2,000 for repeat violations. The measure was brought before the City Council and discussed at a City Hall press conference. The matter summary states the bill 'goes after the unscrupulous used car dealers profiting considerably off a huge black market for phony tags.' Restler, as a sponsor, joins efforts to curb the spread of ghost cars, which evade speed cameras and tolls, making streets more dangerous for everyone. Lawmakers stress that the goal is deterrence, not revenue, and call for further action from online marketplaces and federal agencies.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Council’s $2.7-billion proposal calls for a near-doubling of Fair Fares funding, $3 million for a battery swap and fire outreach program for delivery workers, and $45.1 million more for road paving. The Council also demands increased investment in street safety infrastructure, especially in communities of color facing high crash rates. Brooks-Powers said, 'New Yorkers deserve access to high-quality services and investments in infrastructure citywide.' Council Member Keith Powers called the battery swap program a 'down payment.' The Council’s push aims to restore cuts and address deadly street conditions.

Council Member Keith Powers introduced the buy-back bill, which creates a citywide program for defective or uncertified batteries. Powers said, "We don't want to penalize businesses and workers without thinking about this strategically." The Council also moved bills from Oswald Feliz, Gale Brewer, Alexa Avilés, and Robert Holden. These measures ban uncertified batteries, require fireproof charging containers, mandate public education, and order FDNY reporting on battery fires. Speaker Adrienne Adams clarified the bills target commercial sellers, not workers. Shahana Hanif urged that policy must "keep workers" at the center. The Council and delivery workers’ union stressed that tech companies, not workers, should bear costs. The FDNY opposed the reporting bill over resource concerns.

Council Member Keith Powers and Borough President Mark Levine endorsed the proposal, with Levine stating, 'The redesign’s commitment to expanded protected bike lanes and dedicated bus lanes will turn this particularly dangerous stretch of the roadway into a safer, more efficient, and forward-thinking artery.' Still, Levine and advocates like Anna Melendez (Transportation Alternatives) pressed for more: wider sidewalks, hardened pedestrian islands, and real physical protection. The plan uses only paint and plastic, leaving pedestrians exposed. The proposal faces a full board vote on October 19, 2022.

The board, once resistant, now shifts toward safety for riders.</p><p class=mb3>On September 22, 2022, Manhattan Community Board 8 (CB8) voted 38-3 to request 'fully protected crosstown bike lanes approximately every 10 blocks between 60th and 110th streets on both sides of Central Park, and a two-way protected bikeway around Central Park.' The resolution had earlier cleared the Transportation Committee 12-2. The measure follows the killing of cyclist Carling Mott by a truck driver on E. 85th Street, where a bike lane had been rejected in 2016. Council Members Julie Menin and Keith Powers, along with Borough President Mark Levine, backed the push. Advocates, including Mott’s boyfriend and parents of student cyclists, spoke out for safety, condemning the board’s past inaction. Only one board member, Marco Tamayo, opposed the resolution. The vote marks a sharp turn for CB8, which had long resisted protected lanes, citing security fears and local opposition. Now, the board calls for comprehensive, protected infrastructure to shield vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
