Pedestrians took 806 injuries and 4 deaths; cyclists 694 injuries and 5 deaths. SUVs and cars led the harm to people on foot. Trucks and buses added their share. These are city records, not rumors.</li><li>The pain spikes in the afternoon. At 3 p.m., three people died. At 5 p.m., one more. Injuries peak from 2 to 6 p.m. The count does not slow at night; deaths also hit at 10 p.m., 9 p.m., and 10–11 p.m. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data shows each hour</a>.</li></ul><p>Sixth Avenue, First Avenue, the Drive</p><ul><li>The corner of <a href=#>Avenue of the Americas</a> is the district’s worst hotspot: 1 death, 63 injuries, 6 serious. <a href=#>Park Avenue</a> isn’t far behind. <a href=#>First Avenue</a> adds another death and 67 injuries. The <a href=#>FDR Drive</a> records 1 death and 232 injuries. These are not surprises; they are patterns in the city’s own files.</li><li>A left turn took an 83‑year‑old woman in a crosswalk on Sixth at West 58th. She had the signal. She died. The SUV was turning left. That is all we need to know. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City crash report</a> (CrashID 4792095).</li><li>On West 51st by Fifth, a parked SUV and an e‑bike collided. A 67‑year‑old cyclist was killed.

The calendar is not. <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/15/redesign-of-14th-street-to-kick-off-next-year>NY1 report</a>.</li><li>After two people were killed at Canal and Bowery by a 100‑mph driver, the city promised barriers, lower limits, and narrower lanes. “We are taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection,” said the transportation commissioner. Advocates warned the rest of the corridor “will remain deadly.” The promise came after the bodies. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Gothamist</a>, <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/07/chinatown-deadly-crash-safety-upgrades-canal-street>NY1</a>.</li></ul><p>Fix what is killing people here</p><ul><li>Daylight the corners. A Council bill would ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and force at least 1,000 intersections a year to get barriers. It has broad support. It is sitting. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Council file</a> (Int 1138‑2024).</li><li>Harden the turns on Sixth, First, Park, and Lexington. Give leading pedestrian intervals. Protect the bike lanes across the crosstown grid. These tools are standard. The map tells you where to start: <a href=#>Sixth Avenue</a>, <a href=#>First Avenue</a>, <a href=#>Park Avenue</a>, <a href=#>Lexington</a>, the <a href=#>FDR</a>.</li><li>Target the hours that kill: 2–6 p.m., then 9–11 p.m. Prioritize trucks and buses on corridors with high pedestrian harm. The city’s own roll‑up shows the weight of large vehicles. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Vehicle roll‑up</a>.</li></ul><p>Slow every street; stop the worst</p><ul><li>Albany passed the tool to cut speeds. The city can set safer limits. Use it. Make 20 mph the rule where people walk and bike. Then go after repeat speeders. The Stop Super Speeders Act would force the heaviest offenders to install speed limiters after 11 DMV points in 18 months or 16 camera tickets in a year. One driver with 29 camera tickets killed a mother and two daughters in April.

The mayor called both topics 'off topic' at a press conference. City Hall later said it is reviewing the Rajkumar bill and that the Department of Transportation would oversee the battery swap program, but provided no timeline. The bill, based on disputed injury statistics, has drawn criticism from street safety advocates who argue registration would suppress cycling and sustainable transit. Local Law 131, sponsored by Council Member Keith Powers, requires the battery swap program, but the city has not acted. Powers voiced frustration, noting the Council plans to allocate $3 million for the program. Vulnerable road users remain at risk as city action stalls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Council Member Lincoln Restler, cleared the Council with a 32-15 vote. It reduces the waiting period after community board notification from 90 days plus 45 after a hearing, to just 14 days. The matter summary reads: 'The City Council repealed a decade-old law that imposed lengthy delays on the city before it could break ground on new bike lanes.' Restler said, 'No other transportation project in New York City...requires this type of extended dead period.' Council Member Keith Powers backed the bill, citing rising cyclist deaths. The Department of Transportation called bike lanes 'life-saving infrastructure.' The amended bill now covers all bike lanes, regardless of length.

The Council passed laws banning uncertified lithium-ion batteries and launched a trade-in program for unsafe batteries. The matter, titled 'NYC e-bike owners wonder where to store them as landlords fear battery fires,' highlights the tension: 'We're going to get into the business of getting the dangerous equipment off the street and set up a fund to do that,' Powers said. Advocacy groups, including Danny Harris, called for expanded safe bike parking and charging, stressing that e-bikes are a lifeline for many New Yorkers. The crackdown has led to stricter landlord policies, increased enforcement, and declining bike shop sales. The Council aims to improve safety without cutting off access for vulnerable road users who depend on e-bikes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The main bill, introduced by Council Member Keith Powers, creates a city-funded buy-back program for delivery workers to exchange faulty batteries and devices for safe, certified ones. The matter summary states the program aims to address the high cost of certified batteries, which can be prohibitive for low-paid workers. Council Members Oswald Feliz and Gale Brewer sponsored additional bills: Feliz's requires safe bikes and batteries for deliveries, while Brewer's mandates delivery apps provide safety training and equipment. Brewer also called for the Department of Transportation to update its safety course. Powers said, "We will provide them the opportunity to surrender that unsafe equipment and receive a safe replacement." The Council's action follows 180 battery fire incidents, 14 deaths, and over 100 injuries this year. Lawmakers push for delivery companies to take responsibility for worker safety and equipment standards. Enforcement against uncertified battery sales will begin soon.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
