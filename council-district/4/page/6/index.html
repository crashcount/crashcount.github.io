Forty-three left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 2,500 hurt. The dead include a 22-year-old man crushed by an SUV at a Midtown intersection, a 39-year-old pedestrian struck by a bus, and a 46-year-old cyclist who never made it home. These are not just numbers. They are broken bodies, families waiting by hospital beds, shoes left on the curb.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the highest price.</strong> In the last year alone, three people over 65 died. One cyclist was killed by an SUV. A bus ended another life. Taxis, trucks, bikes, and cars all left their mark. Midtown sidewalks are not safe. The curb is no shield. A taxi jumped it and plowed into a crowd, sending a nine-year-old boy and two women to the hospital. Police said the driver had a medical episode. No charges filed. The street swallowed the pain and moved on. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/young-boy-two-women-hospitalized-after-taxi-hits-pedestrians-in-midtown-manhattan>Gothamist reported</a>: &ldquo;Four people, including a 9-year-old boy and two women, were hospitalized with injuries; all were in stable condition.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-laws-and-the-slow-grind>Leadership: Promises, Laws, and the Slow Grind</h3><p>Council Member <strong>Keith Powers has backed safety bills</strong>. He voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished people for crossing the street while drivers kept killing with impunity. He supported the <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/12/07/council-votes-to-repeal-decade-old-law-expedite-bike-lane-installation>repeal of a law that stalled bike lane construction</a>, cutting red tape so the city can build faster. He co-sponsored a <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>bill to ban parking near crosswalks</a>, aiming to clear sightlines for those on foot. He pushed for a citywide greenway plan, more protected bike lanes, and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/14/council-passes-battery-buy-back-program-and-other-bills-to-curb-lithium-ion-fires>safer batteries for delivery workers</a>. But the pace is slow. The blood dries before the paint hits the street.</p><p><strong>Big plans are coming.</strong> Fifth Avenue will get wider sidewalks, but no new bike or bus lanes. Advocates <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/21/us-news/nycs-fifth-avenue-getting-400m-pedestrian-centered-makeover-that-drivers-and-cyclists-are-sure-to-hate/>call it a failure</a>. &ldquo;This plan entirely fails to meet the moment,&rdquo; said <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/21/us-news/nycs-fifth-avenue-getting-400m-pedestrian-centered-makeover-that-drivers-and-cyclists-are-sure-to-hate/>Transportation Alternatives</a>.

Council Member Keith Powers introduced the buy-back bill, which creates a citywide program for defective or uncertified batteries. Powers said, "We don't want to penalize businesses and workers without thinking about this strategically." The Council also moved bills from Oswald Feliz, Gale Brewer, Alexa Avilés, and Robert Holden. These measures ban uncertified batteries, require fireproof charging containers, mandate public education, and order FDNY reporting on battery fires. Speaker Adrienne Adams clarified the bills target commercial sellers, not workers. Shahana Hanif urged that policy must "keep workers" at the center. The Council and delivery workers’ union stressed that tech companies, not workers, should bear costs. The FDNY opposed the reporting bill over resource concerns. The legislation aims to curb battery fires while protecting delivery workers who depend on e-bikes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Still, Levine and advocates like Anna Melendez (Transportation Alternatives) pressed for more: wider sidewalks, hardened pedestrian islands, and real physical protection. The plan uses only paint and plastic, leaving pedestrians exposed. The proposal faces a full board vote on October 19, 2022.

The board, once resistant, now shifts toward safety for riders.</p><p class=mb3>On September 22, 2022, Manhattan Community Board 8 (CB8) voted 38-3 to request 'fully protected crosstown bike lanes approximately every 10 blocks between 60th and 110th streets on both sides of Central Park, and a two-way protected bikeway around Central Park.' The resolution had earlier cleared the Transportation Committee 12-2. The measure follows the killing of cyclist Carling Mott by a truck driver on E. 85th Street, where a bike lane had been rejected in 2016. Council Members Julie Menin and Keith Powers, along with Borough President Mark Levine, backed the push. Advocates, including Mott’s boyfriend and parents of student cyclists, spoke out for safety, condemning the board’s past inaction. Only one board member, Marco Tamayo, opposed the resolution. The vote marks a sharp turn for CB8, which had long resisted protected lanes, citing security fears and local opposition.

The resolution followed the death of 28-year-old cyclist Carling Mott, killed by a truck driver on E. 85th Street. The matter, described as a push to 'bring safe bike routes to the neighborhood,' saw support from councilmembers Keith Powers and Julie Menin, who called on DOT to revisit the 85th Street lane and improve safety infrastructure. Advocates and residents backed the plan, demanding action to prevent more deaths. DOT is reviewing the location for possible upgrades. The board's vote renews a fight stalled since 2016 by political opposition.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
