Seventeen suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. The dead include elders, cyclists, and people just crossing the street. A 67-year-old cyclist killed on Fifth Avenue. An 83-year-old woman struck while crossing with the light. A man crushed by a bus, far from any intersection. These are not numbers. They are lives ended, families broken.</p><h2 id=the-policy-response-promises-and-delays>The Policy Response: Promises and Delays</h2><p>Council Member Keith Powers has spoken up for safer streets. When the Council repealed a law that delayed bike lanes, Powers said, <strong>&ldquo;2023 is sadly on track to be the deadliest year in decades for cyclists, underscoring the need for a cohesive network of bike lanes across New York City.&rdquo;</strong> Powers <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/12/07/council-votes-to-repeal-decade-old-law-expedite-bike-lane-installation>backed the bill to speed up bike lane construction</a>. Powers also co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, forcing the city to clear 1,000 intersections a year. He pushed for the 34th Street busway, saying, <strong>&ldquo;It’s time to get buses moving faster, and the busway will do just that.&rdquo;</strong> He <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/34th-street-buses-midtown-manhattan/>called for faster service and safer streets</a>.</p><p>But the carnage continues. Cars, trucks, and taxis still rule the avenue. The city moves slow. Each delay means another name on the list.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars killed three.</strong> Trucks and buses killed one. Bikes and motorcycles left dozens more hurt. The old, the young, the ones on foot or two wheels—they pay the price for every blind corner and every unchecked driver. The street does not forgive.</p><h2 id=what-now-demand-action>What Now? Demand Action</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call Council Member Powers. Demand faster action: more daylighted corners, more protected bike lanes, a 20 mph speed limit, and real enforcement against reckless drivers. <strong>Do not wait for another obituary.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Citi Bike rider failed to yield the right-of-way and disregarded traffic control, as cited in both the narrative and the contributing factors.

No driver errors such as failure to yield or speeding are cited; contributing factors are listed as 'Unspecified.' The incident highlights the systemic danger of rear seat injuries even when occupants are restrained.

The mayor called both topics 'off topic' at a press conference. City Hall later said it is reviewing the Rajkumar bill and that the Department of Transportation would oversee the battery swap program, but provided no timeline. The bill, based on disputed injury statistics, has drawn criticism from street safety advocates who argue registration would suppress cycling and sustainable transit. Local Law 131, sponsored by Council Member Keith Powers, requires the battery swap program, but the city has not acted. Powers voiced frustration, noting the Council plans to allocate $3 million for the program. Vulnerable road users remain at risk as city action stalls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The collision caused severe lacerations to the pedestrian's head, leaving him conscious but bleeding on the roadway. The report notes the pedestrian was crossing without a signal or crosswalk, listing 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a contributing factor. The One Wheel's point of impact was the center front end, and the vehicle sustained no damage. The incident highlights the vulnerability of pedestrians at busy intersections and the dangers present when vehicles and people intersect outside of designated crossing signals.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Council Member Lincoln Restler, cleared the Council with a 32-15 vote. It reduces the waiting period after community board notification from 90 days plus 45 after a hearing, to just 14 days. The matter summary reads: 'The City Council repealed a decade-old law that imposed lengthy delays on the city before it could break ground on new bike lanes.' Restler said, 'No other transportation project in New York City...requires this type of extended dead period.' Council Member Keith Powers backed the bill, citing rising cyclist deaths. The Department of Transportation called bike lanes 'life-saving infrastructure.' The amended bill now covers all bike lanes, regardless of length. Advocates say this will help install more lanes and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Council passed laws banning uncertified lithium-ion batteries and launched a trade-in program for unsafe batteries. The matter, titled 'NYC e-bike owners wonder where to store them as landlords fear battery fires,' highlights the tension: 'We're going to get into the business of getting the dangerous equipment off the street and set up a fund to do that,' Powers said. Advocacy groups, including Danny Harris, called for expanded safe bike parking and charging, stressing that e-bikes are a lifeline for many New Yorkers. The crackdown has led to stricter landlord policies, increased enforcement, and declining bike shop sales. The Council aims to improve safety without cutting off access for vulnerable road users who depend on e-bikes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) will start enforcing the ban on uncertified lithium-ion battery sales. Inspectors will also check for illegal mopeds, issuing summonses and referring cases to NYPD and FDNY. DCWP spokesperson Michael Lanza said, 'While inspecting retailers for compliance with LL39, we will also check for illegal motorized scooters [mopeds], issue summonses and refer issues to NYPD and FDNY as appropriate.' Two days earlier, the City Council passed Council Member Keith Powers's bill for a citywide battery buyback program, letting delivery workers swap faulty batteries for certified ones. Powers acknowledged the ongoing problem of illegal mopeds, stating, 'We recognize that problem. We've been talking to the deputy mayor's office about further measures ahead.' The new law targets fire risk and unregulated vehicles, but loopholes in moped sales and enforcement persist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
