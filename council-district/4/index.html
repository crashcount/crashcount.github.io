Seventeen suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. The dead include elders, cyclists, and people just crossing the street. A 67-year-old cyclist killed on Fifth Avenue. An 83-year-old woman struck while crossing with the light. A man crushed by a bus, far from any intersection. These are not numbers. They are lives ended, families broken.</p><h2 id=the-policy-response-promises-and-delays>The Policy Response: Promises and Delays</h2><p>Council Member Keith Powers has spoken up for safer streets. When the Council repealed a law that delayed bike lanes, Powers said, <strong>&ldquo;2023 is sadly on track to be the deadliest year in decades for cyclists, underscoring the need for a cohesive network of bike lanes across New York City.&rdquo;</strong> Powers <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/12/07/council-votes-to-repeal-decade-old-law-expedite-bike-lane-installation>backed the bill to speed up bike lane construction</a>. Powers also co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, forcing the city to clear 1,000 intersections a year. He pushed for the 34th Street busway, saying, <strong>&ldquo;It’s time to get buses moving faster, and the busway will do just that.&rdquo;</strong> He <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/34th-street-buses-midtown-manhattan/>called for faster service and safer streets</a>.</p><p>But the carnage continues. Cars, trucks, and taxis still rule the avenue. The city moves slow. Each delay means another name on the list.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars killed three.</strong> Trucks and buses killed one. Bikes and motorcycles left dozens more hurt. The old, the young, the ones on foot or two wheels—they pay the price for every blind corner and every unchecked driver. The street does not forgive.</p><h2 id=what-now-demand-action>What Now? Demand Action</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call Council Member Powers. Demand faster action: more daylighted corners, more protected bike lanes, a 20 mph speed limit, and real enforcement against reckless drivers. <strong>Do not wait for another obituary.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Russo-Lennon and others backed bus improvements, highlighting how cars choke streets and trap riders.
