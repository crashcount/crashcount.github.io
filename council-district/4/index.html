Forty-three left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 2,500 hurt. The dead include a 22-year-old man crushed by an SUV at a Midtown intersection, a 39-year-old pedestrian struck by a bus, and a 46-year-old cyclist who never made it home. These are not just numbers. They are broken bodies, families waiting by hospital beds, shoes left on the curb.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the highest price.</strong> In the last year alone, three people over 65 died. One cyclist was killed by an SUV. A bus ended another life. Taxis, trucks, bikes, and cars all left their mark. Midtown sidewalks are not safe. The curb is no shield. A taxi jumped it and plowed into a crowd, sending a nine-year-old boy and two women to the hospital. Police said the driver had a medical episode. No charges filed. The street swallowed the pain and moved on. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/young-boy-two-women-hospitalized-after-taxi-hits-pedestrians-in-midtown-manhattan>Gothamist reported</a>: &ldquo;Four people, including a 9-year-old boy and two women, were hospitalized with injuries; all were in stable condition.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-laws-and-the-slow-grind>Leadership: Promises, Laws, and the Slow Grind</h3><p>Council Member <strong>Keith Powers has backed safety bills</strong>. He voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished people for crossing the street while drivers kept killing with impunity. He supported the <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/12/07/council-votes-to-repeal-decade-old-law-expedite-bike-lane-installation>repeal of a law that stalled bike lane construction</a>, cutting red tape so the city can build faster. He co-sponsored a <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>bill to ban parking near crosswalks</a>, aiming to clear sightlines for those on foot. He pushed for a citywide greenway plan, more protected bike lanes, and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/14/council-passes-battery-buy-back-program-and-other-bills-to-curb-lithium-ion-fires>safer batteries for delivery workers</a>. But the pace is slow. The blood dries before the paint hits the street.</p><p><strong>Big plans are coming.</strong> Fifth Avenue will get wider sidewalks, but no new bike or bus lanes. Advocates <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/21/us-news/nycs-fifth-avenue-getting-400m-pedestrian-centered-makeover-that-drivers-and-cyclists-are-sure-to-hate/>call it a failure</a>. &ldquo;This plan entirely fails to meet the moment,&rdquo; said <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/05/21/us-news/nycs-fifth-avenue-getting-400m-pedestrian-centered-makeover-that-drivers-and-cyclists-are-sure-to-hate/>Transportation Alternatives</a>. The city promises a <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/dot-proposes-transforming-34th-st-into-mostly-car-free-busway-much-like-14th-st-AY4607640>car-free 34th Street busway</a>, but the cars still run. The danger remains.</p><h3 id=what-next-the-fight-is-not-over>What Next: The Fight Is Not Over</h3><p><strong>Every delay costs lives.</strong> Every watered-down bill, every unbuilt lane, every curb left unprotected is a choice. The crisis is not fate. It is policy. <strong>Call Council Member Powers. Demand faster action.</strong> Demand real protection for people on foot and bike. Join with others. Do not wait for the next siren.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, not yet numbered or assigned to committee, follows Mayor Adams's push to address what he calls street 'chaos.' Powers said, 'Biking is a crucial tool to tackle the climate crisis... but we also must address the well-documented concerns about safety.' He proposes a $50 penalty for violations. Critics, including Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives, call the measure 'half-baked and ill-conceived,' warning it escalates the city's 'misguided war on biking.' Safety analyst notes show the policy may discourage cycling, reducing mode shift from cars and undermining safety in numbers. Enforcement has historically targeted Black and brown cyclists, while drivers—responsible for most deaths—face lighter penalties. The bill risks making streets less safe for those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, to be presented to community boards, would restrict through car traffic between Third and Ninth avenues, forcing cars to turn off at the first opportunity. The matter aims to address congestion and slow bus speeds on the M34, where buses average five to seven miles per hour. Council Member Keith Powers, who rides the route daily, said, "If you dedicate a big chunk of a corridor to bus service, you will see strong results." Powers and community leaders support the move, citing the 14th Street busway’s success: a 24 percent speed boost and 30 percent ridership jump. The proposal follows years of planning and comes as congestion pricing looms. Some advocates remain wary, recalling Mayor Adams’s past delays and reduced busway hours.

Powers and other officials voiced strong support for prioritizing pedestrians, echoing Levine’s call to 'do better here' and make Fifth Avenue a true pedestrian destination. The redesign aims to reclaim space for people, not cars, and signals a shift toward safer, more vibrant streets for all vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill is 'Laid Over in Committee.' Its title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting standing or parking a vehicle within 20 feet of a crosswalk at an intersection.' Council Member Erik D. Bottcher is the primary sponsor, joined by Julie Won, Jumaane Williams, and others. The bill prohibits standing or parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and mandates the Department of Transportation to install daylighting barriers at a minimum of 1,000 intersections per year. The law also requires citywide outreach and reporting. This measure aims to keep sightlines clear at crossings, a known danger zone for people on foot and bike. The bill has not yet received a vote.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On December 4, 2024, the Adams administration cut the Fifth Avenue holiday Open Street program in Midtown from three Sundays to just one, shrinking the car-free zone to December 8 between 48th and 55th streets. The Fifth Avenue Association blamed security around Trump Tower. The matter summary reads: 'City scales back hugely popular Fifth Ave. Holiday Open Street despite sales boosts.' Council Member Keith Powers called the move 'surprising' and urged a full return next year. Advocates called it 'frustrating and disappointing.' Mayor Adams had previously praised the program, which boosted sales by $3 million in 2023. The Department of Transportation now touts sidewalk expansion, but the new redesign drops a planned bike lane and may slow buses. Pedestrians and cyclists lose space. The city’s retreat keeps vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
