A taxi stands. A woman, 61, crosses with the signal. The data lists “Driver Inexperience.” One person dies in that crash record; the pedestrian survives with a hip bruise. The driver does not. It is all in the city file <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>for April 22, 2024</a>.</p><p>First Avenue. West 51st Street. Two 67‑year‑old cyclists are listed as killed at 3:05 p.m. The SUV is parked. The city log shows two deaths and little else. It is bare and cold, like a tag on a toe. The record sits in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4796322</a>.</p><p>On the FDR, northbound, 3:48 a.m. A 31‑year‑old motorcyclist is marked “Apparent Death.” Helmet noted. Ejected. The file is short. The life was not. See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4830014</a>.</p><p>District 4 has logged 5,531 crashes since 2022. <strong>Eleven people are dead.</strong> 2,995 are hurt. The city’s rollup shows SUVs and cars tied to three pedestrian deaths; buses and trucks to one more. These counts come straight from the district stats.</p><h3 id=corners-that-dont-forgive>Corners that don’t forgive</h3><p>The map shows pain on the avenues. <a href=#>Avenue of the Americas</a> leads the list with one death and 63 injuries. <a href=#>Park Avenue</a> follows with 55 wounded. First Avenue adds another death and 67 injuries. The <a href=#>FDR Drive</a> shows a death and 232 injuries. Lexington logs 58 more. These are the top intersections in the district data.</p><p>The clock tells its own story. Injuries rise through the afternoon. The worst hour is 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. with three deaths and 180 injuries. Five p.m. shows one more death and 198 injuries. Late night is not spared: deaths appear at 1 a.m., 3 a.m., 10 a.m., 9 p.m., and 10 p.m. The harm does not sleep.</p><p>The causes list is blunt. “Other” leads, with six deaths and 1,266 injuries. “Vulnerable road user error” appears in two deaths and 149 injuries. Distraction shows 90 injuries. Alcohol is present in 13 injuries. “Failure to yield” and “disregarded traffic control” each stack dozens more. The labels are dry. The outcomes are not.</p><h3 id=pedestrians-and-cyclists-take-the-hit>Pedestrians and cyclists take the hit</h3><p>Pedestrians: four dead, 806 injured. Cyclists: five dead, 694 injured. The city’s “causes of pedestrian injuries” ledger points to SUVs and cars first (195 cases, three deaths), then taxis (118 injuries), then trucks (56 injuries, five serious). Bikes strike 95. Buses, 19, with one death.</p><p>At Sixth Avenue and West 58th, 10:22 p.m., an 83‑year‑old woman crossing with the signal is hit by a left‑turning SUV. “Apparent Death,” the file says. The driver is licensed. The vehicle damage: left front bumper. It is all there in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4792095</a>.</p><p>At East 51st off Fifth, 9:34 p.m., a pedestrian not in the roadway is listed as killed. A southbound bus shows right‑front bumper impact. A parked boom lift is in the record. The dead man is 39. See <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4788709</a>.</p><h3 id=promises-and-pressure>Promises and pressure</h3><p>When the city moves, it is after blood. After two people were killed at Bowery and Canal by a car allegedly doing over 100 mph, the transportation chief said, <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>“we are taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection”</a>. Advocates answered that “the vast majority of the corridor will remain deadly.” The words are on <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Gothamist</a> and <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/07/chinatown-deadly-crash-safety-upgrades-canal-street>NY1</a>.</p><p>Here in District 4, the council member backed a bill to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks</a>. Daylighting keeps people alive where drivers turn blind. He also pushed to <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/12/07/council-votes-to-repeal-decade-old-law-expedite-bike-lane-installation>cut bike lane red tape</a>, calling lanes “life‑saving infrastructure.”</p><h3 id=what-would-fix-these-blocks-now>What would fix these blocks now</h3><p>Start with the corners. Daylight every approach at Sixth, Park, First, Lexington. Harden the turns. Add leading walk signals. The bill on daylighting sets a pace citywide; the need on these avenues is plain in the crash counts <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>for Avenue of the Americas</a> and <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Park Avenue</a>.</p><p>Target the hours where bodies fall. Mid‑afternoon into the rush. Put enforcement where the deaths are: left turns at crosswalks, red lights at wide avenues, speed on the FDR.</p><p>Then go bigger. <strong>Lower the default speed limit</strong> using city authority cited in our action guide. And fit repeat speeders with controls. The state bill would require an intelligent speed device after 11 points in 18 months or 16 camera tickets in a year. This is laid out in our <a href=/take_action/>Take Action page</a>, with sources for the risk posed by repeat offenders.</p><h3 id=the-toll-of-waiting>The toll of waiting</h3><p>In the last 12 months, seven died here. Year‑to‑date deaths are up six‑fold over last year. The numbers sit there, heavy. The streets keep moving.</p><p>One last fact: at 3 p.m., this district has three deaths and 180 injuries. School lets out. Offices break. The light turns green. The counting continues.</p><p>For ways to press City Hall and Albany to act, see our <a href=/take_action/>action guide</a>.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Please don't ride." and PETA spokesperson Ashley Byrne: "How many overworked horses need to suffer and drop dead on the streets of New York before this shameful cruelty is banned?" It cites preliminary necropsy findings of an aortic rupture tied to a tumor.

Russo-Lennon and others backed bus improvements, highlighting how cars choke streets and trap riders. The demonstration drew support from Council Members Erik Bottcher and Keith Powers, and city officials.
