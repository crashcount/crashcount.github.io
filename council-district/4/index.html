Pedestrians took 806 injuries and 4 deaths; cyclists 694 injuries and 5 deaths. SUVs and cars led the harm to people on foot. Trucks and buses added their share. These are city records, not rumors.</li><li>The pain spikes in the afternoon. At 3 p.m., three people died. At 5 p.m., one more. Injuries peak from 2 to 6 p.m. The count does not slow at night; deaths also hit at 10 p.m., 9 p.m., and 10–11 p.m. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data shows each hour</a>.</li></ul><p>Sixth Avenue, First Avenue, the Drive</p><ul><li>The corner of <a href=#>Avenue of the Americas</a> is the district’s worst hotspot: 1 death, 63 injuries, 6 serious. <a href=#>Park Avenue</a> isn’t far behind. <a href=#>First Avenue</a> adds another death and 67 injuries. The <a href=#>FDR Drive</a> records 1 death and 232 injuries. These are not surprises; they are patterns in the city’s own files.</li><li>A left turn took an 83‑year‑old woman in a crosswalk on Sixth at West 58th. She had the signal. She died. The SUV was turning left. That is all we need to know. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City crash report</a> (CrashID 4792095).</li><li>On West 51st by Fifth, a parked SUV and an e‑bike collided. A 67‑year‑old cyclist was killed.

Advocates warned the rest of the corridor “will remain deadly.” The promise came after the bodies. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Gothamist</a>, <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/07/chinatown-deadly-crash-safety-upgrades-canal-street>NY1</a>.</li></ul><p>Fix what is killing people here</p><ul><li>Daylight the corners. A Council bill would ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and force at least 1,000 intersections a year to get barriers. It has broad support. It is sitting. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Council file</a> (Int 1138‑2024).</li><li>Harden the turns on Sixth, First, Park, and Lexington. Give leading pedestrian intervals. Protect the bike lanes across the crosstown grid. These tools are standard. The map tells you where to start: <a href=#>Sixth Avenue</a>, <a href=#>First Avenue</a>, <a href=#>Park Avenue</a>, <a href=#>Lexington</a>, the <a href=#>FDR</a>.</li><li>Target the hours that kill: 2–6 p.m., then 9–11 p.m. Prioritize trucks and buses on corridors with high pedestrian harm. The city’s own roll‑up shows the weight of large vehicles. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Vehicle roll‑up</a>.</li></ul><p>Slow every street; stop the worst</p><ul><li>Albany passed the tool to cut speeds. The city can set safer limits. Use it. Make 20 mph the rule where people walk and bike. Then go after repeat speeders. The Stop Super Speeders Act would force the heaviest offenders to install speed limiters after 11 DMV points in 18 months or 16 camera tickets in a year. One driver with 29 camera tickets killed a mother and two daughters in April.

Russo-Lennon and others backed bus improvements, highlighting how cars choke streets and trap riders. The demonstration drew support from Council Members Erik Bottcher and Keith Powers, and city officials. The safety analyst notes this was a demonstration, not a policy change, so it does not directly affect pedestrian or cyclist safety or system-wide outcomes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
