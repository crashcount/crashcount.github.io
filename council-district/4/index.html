In the last twelve months, four people died and thirteen suffered serious injuries in District 4. The dead include a 65-year-old, a cyclist, a pedestrian, and a man crushed by a bus. Over 900 were hurt—most of them walking, biking, or just trying to cross the street (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a>).</p><p>On January 26, a 39-year-old man was killed by a bus on East 51st. On February 18, two cyclists, both 67, died at Fifth Avenue and 51st. In June, an SUV reversed and struck an elderly pedestrian on Lexington. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not. A life ends. A family waits for a call that never comes.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p>Cars and trucks did the most harm—one killed, twelve seriously hurt. Motorcycles and mopeds left two with grave injuries. Bikes, too, took their toll: two deaths, two serious injuries. No one is safe, but the most vulnerable bleed the most (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a>).</p><h2 id=council-member-keith-powers-action-and-silence>Council Member Keith Powers: Action and Silence</h2><p>Council Member Keith Powers has backed some measures for safety. He co-sponsored the bill to ban parking near crosswalks, forcing daylight at intersections. He voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the desperate and the poor. He pushed for a buy-back program for unsafe e-bike batteries, saying, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/14/council-passes-battery-buy-back-program-and-other-bills-to-curb-lithium-ion-fires>&ldquo;We will provide them the opportunity to surrender that unsafe equipment and receive a safe replacement.&rdquo;</a></p><p>But Powers has also supported misguided e-bike crackdowns and speed limits that target delivery workers, not the drivers who kill. He called for using congestion pricing cameras for enforcement after the program was paused, but the streets remain clogged and dangerous (<a href=https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/us-news/gov-hochul-mta-lack-plan-b-for-nyc-congestion-pricing-infrastructure/>congestion pricing stalled</a>).</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p>The carnage will not stop until the city lowers speed limits, redesigns streets, and ends the reign of cars over people. Call Council Member Powers. Demand a 20 mph citywide speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes and daylight at every crossing. Demand enforcement that targets the real killers—reckless drivers, not the people trying to survive.</p><p>Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Bottcher called it 'transformative,' promising fewer crashes and faster buses. Powers slammed the last-minute reversal.

The board voted 31-5 in favor. Supporters called current bus speeds 'painfully slow' and urged the city to 'prioritize pedestrians and transit users.' Critics worried about diverted car traffic clogging residential streets, with one resident calling for a 'traffic study' and 'action plan.' The DOT says the busway could boost bus speeds by 15 percent. The proposal would force cars to exit 34th Street quickly or face tickets, echoing rules on 14th Street.

Systemic danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13, 2025, the Adams administration launched the NYC e-bike trade-in program. No bill number or committee is listed, but the $2-million program stems from a 2023 bill by Council Member Keith Powers. Streetsblog NYC reports: 'The Adams administration is both cracking down on e-bikes and providing safer e-bikes to workers.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'This is not just about protecting delivery workers. It’s about protecting them, their families, their neighbors, and all New Yorkers from deadly fires.' Delivery worker William Medina praised the program, but called for expansion. The program lets workers trade uncertified bikes or illegal mopeds for certified e-bikes, but covers only a fraction of the city’s 80,000 delivery workers. The safety analyst notes: Cracking down may burden vulnerable users, while safer bikes help; mixed signals mean no clear safety gain. The city’s approach leaves vulnerable road users in limbo.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, as reported by Streetsblog NYC, reads: 'Manhattan Community Board 6 overwhelmingly supported by a vote of 31-5 the DOT's plans to install a busway on 34th Street, passing a resolution that urged the city to prioritize its installation.' Council Members Erik Bottcher and Keith Powers, who represent the corridor, both support the measure. The resolution urges the city to prioritize the busway, which would ban through traffic by private cars between Third and Ninth avenues. Leadership from Community Boards 4 and 5 also joined the call. DOT plans to implement the busway in summer or fall 2025.

StreetsPAC called Lander’s proposal 'by far the most comprehensive blueprint ... we've ever seen from a candidate for any office.' Lander promised more protected bike lanes, a citywide Bus Rapid Transit network, and using congestion pricing revenue for busways and bikeways. He pledged six-minute service on subways and buses and action on street homelessness. StreetsPAC’s endorsement signals strong support for policies that prioritize vulnerable road users.

The measure, discussed in the Council but not yet assigned a bill number or committee, comes as Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch launches a crackdown on cyclists. Powers said, "I am interested in all measures that might address keeping our street experience here in the city feeling much safer and slowing down any vehicle or device or instrument that could hurt someone." Despite state authority to lower car speed limits, neither the mayor nor the Council act to curb car speeds citywide. Advocates and some officials slam the focus on e-bikes, pointing to data: cars and trucks cause nearly all pedestrian injuries. The safety analyst notes no direct safety impact for vulnerable users, as no specific policy change is enacted.

Residents worry rerouted vehicles will jam local streets and worsen safety. Jessica Lavoie of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association warns, "diverting traffic from this critical corridor onto narrow residential streets would lead to increased congestion, safety hazards, and diminished quality of life." The Department of Transportation aims to replicate the 14th Street busway, which "reduced congestion, sped up bus travel and curbed accidents."

After hitting Esiyok, Ali continued, injuring a cyclist, two more pedestrians, and crashing into a van.

Critics, including Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives, call the measure 'half-baked and ill-conceived,' warning it escalates the city's 'misguided war on biking.'
