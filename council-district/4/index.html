Since 2022, eight people have died and 47 have been seriously injured in crashes. The wounded are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. In the last twelve months alone, four more lives ended. Three of them were over 65. The old do not move fast enough for the city’s machines.</p><p>A child struck on East 14th Street. An elderly pedestrian knocked down by a reversing SUV on Lexington. A cyclist crushed on Fifth Avenue. The blood dries, but the pain does not leave. 904 people have been hurt in the last year. The city keeps moving. The bodies are cleared. The danger remains.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>Cars and trucks did the most harm. They killed at least one person and injured over 400 more. Motorcycles and mopeds left dozens hurt. Bikes, too, have drawn blood, but the numbers are smaller. The street is a battlefield. The weapons are heavy and fast.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Waiting</h3><p>Council Member Keith Powers has spoken for safety. He backed the repeal of a law that stalled bike lanes, saying, &ldquo;2023 is sadly on track to be the deadliest year in decades for cyclists, underscoring the need for a cohesive network of bike lanes across New York City&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/12/07/council-votes-to-repeal-decade-old-law-expedite-bike-lane-installation>said Powers</a>). He co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, to clear sightlines and protect people on foot. He led on battery buy-backs for delivery workers, saying, &ldquo;We will provide them the opportunity to surrender that unsafe equipment and receive a safe replacement&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/14/council-passes-battery-buy-back-program-and-other-bills-to-curb-lithium-ion-fires>said Powers</a>).</p><p>But the street does not wait for laws to pass. Projects stall. Promises linger. The city paused the 34th Street busway (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/03/anti-miracle-on-34th-street-adams-administration-pauses-work-on-34th-street-busway>paused the 34th Street busway</a>). Fifth Avenue’s redesign cut out protected bike lanes (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/14/civic-panel-dings-adams-for-cutting-bike-and-bus-lanes-out-of-fifth-av-redesign>cut out protected bike lanes</a>). The old dangers remain. The new ones grow.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Every crash is a choice made by the city. Every delay is a risk paid in flesh. Call Council Member Powers. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes, daylighted intersections, and busways that do not vanish at the last minute. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Manhattan Community Board 5 called this move not a "real solution" to safety, urging a return to the 2021 plan with protected bike lanes and faster bus service. "We want a real solution to the bike and pedestrian safety issue," said CB 5 Vice Chair Samir Lavingia. The board warns that without bike lanes, cyclists will ride sidewalks, risking conflict. The plan, shaped with business interests, leaves vulnerable road users exposed and delays safer changes until at least 2028.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Systemic danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13, 2025, the Adams administration launched the NYC e-bike trade-in program. No bill number or committee is listed, but the $2-million program stems from a 2023 bill by Council Member Keith Powers. Streetsblog NYC reports: 'The Adams administration is both cracking down on e-bikes and providing safer e-bikes to workers.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'This is not just about protecting delivery workers. It’s about protecting them, their families, their neighbors, and all New Yorkers from deadly fires.' Delivery worker William Medina praised the program, but called for expansion. The program lets workers trade uncertified bikes or illegal mopeds for certified e-bikes, but covers only a fraction of the city’s 80,000 delivery workers. The safety analyst notes: Cracking down may burden vulnerable users, while safer bikes help; mixed signals mean no clear safety gain. The city’s approach leaves vulnerable road users in limbo.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

In February 2024, journalist Fazil Khan died in a Harlem apartment fire started by a charging battery; 22 others were injured. The article notes, 'Fires from unregulated e-bike batteries have already caused too much harm, including tragic loss of life.' The city’s $2 million pilot lets delivery workers exchange uncertified e-bikes and batteries for certified, UL-standard models. The program also requires a safety course. While battery-related fires rose slightly from 268 in 2023 to 277 in 2024, fatalities fell from 18 to 6.

Council Members Erik Bottcher and Keith Powers, who represent the corridor, both support the measure. The resolution urges the city to prioritize the busway, which would ban through traffic by private cars between Third and Ninth avenues. Leadership from Community Boards 4 and 5 also joined the call. DOT plans to implement the busway in summer or fall 2025.

The measure, discussed in the Council but not yet assigned a bill number or committee, comes as Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch launches a crackdown on cyclists. Powers said, "I am interested in all measures that might address keeping our street experience here in the city feeling much safer and slowing down any vehicle or device or instrument that could hurt someone." Despite state authority to lower car speed limits, neither the mayor nor the Council act to curb car speeds citywide. Advocates and some officials slam the focus on e-bikes, pointing to data: cars and trucks cause nearly all pedestrian injuries. The safety analyst notes no direct safety impact for vulnerable users, as no specific policy change is enacted.
