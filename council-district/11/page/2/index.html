Their request, sent to the Department of Transportation before the crash, was denied due to low car volumes and insufficient crash history. The lawmakers, at a press conference, supported speed humps and stop signs but opposed road diets and universal daylighting. Eric Dinowitz argued, 'If you walked down any of these streets, they are far too narrow to narrow any more.' He also rejected citywide daylighting, insisting, 'Daylighting has to be done corner by corner.' The council member has criticized DOT’s safety efforts before, framing the agency as unresponsive.

The sole occupant, a 35-year-old male, was driving southbound when the crash occurred. The report states the rider was unlicensed and wore no helmet. He was ejected from the moped, landed on the pavement, and suffered a severe head injury, described as 'head bleeding' and 'semiconscious.' The police narrative notes the crash ended in 'silence, sirens, and blood.' While the report lists the contributing factors as 'unspecified,' it explicitly documents the rider's lack of a license and helmet. No other vehicles or road users were involved, and no victim behaviors are cited as contributing factors after the driver errors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
