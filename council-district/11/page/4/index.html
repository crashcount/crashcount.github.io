I think it speaks to the importance of enforcing our parking rules because it was going around a double-parked car. And we’re seeing all over the city parking regulations not being enforced.&rdquo;</a></p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>The crisis is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice made by leaders, or a choice they refused to make. Residents must demand more. Call for a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes and safer crossings. Tell Council Member Dinowitz: the time for half-measures is over. The street remembers every name.</p><p><strong>Act now.

The plan, described as a '.75-mile-long road diet,' aimed to reduce lanes, add traffic calming, and install bike lanes. Council Member Eric Dinowitz and Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz opposed the DOT's turning bays, pushing instead for left-turn signals at two intersections. The committee echoed their stance, citing concerns about traffic and parking. The matter title: 'Riverdale Rumble: Bronx Panel Rejects DOT Road Diet Plan for Super-Wide Avenue.' DOT officials stressed the area's high rate of crashes, especially harming seniors and children, but the board's advisory vote leaves the avenue wide and perilous for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, discussed before Community Board 8 or Dinowitz himself, drew fire for what Dinowitz called 'unacceptable' and lacking transparency. The matter, titled 'Riverdale Avenue Rumble: Bronx Pol Dinowitz Objects to DOT’s Move on ‘Road Diet’,' centers on a traffic-calming redesign to address frequent crashes. Dinowitz stated, 'I'm not against the plan, because I don't know what it is,' but demanded better outreach. Christian Amato, another local politician, voiced strong support, referencing positive results from Morris Park Avenue. The DOT confirmed the proposal includes a bike lane and seeks community feedback. No formal council vote has occurred.

The plan, aimed at a crash-prone Bronx corridor, was criticized by Dinowitz for a lack of transparency: 'A city agency should not be run this way.' He insisted he is not against the plan itself, but objects to DOT’s process, which bypassed him and Community Board 8. Dinowitz’s stance echoes his past opposition to bus lanes that reduce parking, though he supports bike lanes that do not remove vehicle lanes. The proposal, which includes a bike lane, remains under review. No formal safety analyst assessment was provided for this action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
