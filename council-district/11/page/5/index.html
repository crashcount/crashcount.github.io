The living limp on.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price.</strong> SUVs and sedans do the damage. In the last three years, SUVs killed four, left thirteen with serious wounds. Trucks and buses killed two. Bikes and mopeds, none.

It is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice made by leaders, or a choice they refused to make. Residents must demand more. Call for a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes and safer crossings. Tell Council Member Dinowitz: the time for half-measures is over. The street remembers every name.</p><p><strong>Act now.

The plan, described as a '.75-mile-long road diet,' aimed to reduce lanes, add traffic calming, and install bike lanes. Council Member Eric Dinowitz and Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz opposed the DOT's turning bays, pushing instead for left-turn signals at two intersections. The committee echoed their stance, citing concerns about traffic and parking. The matter title: 'Riverdale Rumble: Bronx Panel Rejects DOT Road Diet Plan for Super-Wide Avenue.' DOT officials stressed the area's high rate of crashes, especially harming seniors and children, but the board's advisory vote leaves the avenue wide and perilous for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'Riverdale Avenue Rumble: Bronx Pol Dinowitz Objects to DOT’s Move on ‘Road Diet’,' centers on a traffic-calming redesign to address frequent crashes. Dinowitz stated, 'I'm not against the plan, because I don't know what it is,' but demanded better outreach. Christian Amato, another local politician, voiced strong support, referencing positive results from Morris Park Avenue. The DOT confirmed the proposal includes a bike lane and seeks community feedback. No formal council vote has occurred.

He insisted he is not against the plan itself, but objects to DOT’s process, which bypassed him and Community Board 8. Dinowitz’s stance echoes his past opposition to bus lanes that reduce parking, though he supports bike lanes that do not remove vehicle lanes.
