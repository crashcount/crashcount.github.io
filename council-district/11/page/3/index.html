It is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice made by leaders, or a choice they refused to make. Residents must demand more. Call for a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes and safer crossings. Tell Council Member Dinowitz: the time for half-measures is over. The street remembers every name.</p><p><strong>Act now.

The intersection sits in Councilmember Eric Dinowitz’s district. Dinowitz recently opposed a proposal to make Riverdale Avenue safer. The article states, 'Council District 11, which is represented by Eric Dinowitz, who recently opposed an effort to make Riverdale Avenue in his district safer.' The Department of Transportation installed safety measures north of Van Cortlandt Park, but not at the site of Rivera’s death. In 2022, Dinowitz’s district saw 1,659 reported crashes, injuring 135 pedestrians and 27 cyclists. The city’s inaction left a deadly gap. Rivera is the latest victim.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to a citywide greenway plan.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors including Rivera, Hudson, and others. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor on October 27, 2022. The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law. The measure compels the city to plan and maintain safe routes for non-drivers, with regular public reporting and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, presented to Bronx Community Board 8’s Transportation Committee, was rejected in a close vote. Council Member Eric Dinowitz voiced strong opposition to the DOT’s process, calling it 'undemocratic' and criticizing the lack of community input, though he did not oppose the road diet itself. The DOT justified the changes by citing significant crash and injury data, and pointed to successful safety improvements from similar projects elsewhere in the Bronx. Dinowitz stated, 'I have been deeply troubled throughout this process due to the constant misrepresentation of facts and the lack of responsiveness to the community.'
