Same ending.</p><p>Early on Aug. 11, two young men on mopeds were thrown onto the Bronx River Parkway and died. Police say a 21‑year‑old in a Mercedes tried to pass a Volkswagen, hit it, then struck both riders near E. 223rd St. The DA charged him with vehicular manslaughter and DWI. Their names: Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19. Enrique Martinez, 21. <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/multi-vehicle-crash-on-the-bronx-river-parkway/>“Neyra Yuyes was arrested… He faces a list of charges including vehicular manslaughter, driving while intoxicated and driving while ability impaired,”</a> amNY reported. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Gothamist</a> said he smelled of alcohol and stood unsteady by his car after the crash. A sister asked the thing no family should have to ask: <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>“Two people were killed. He was drunk,”</a> she said.</p><p>The highway closed for hours. Two families got the call.</p><h3 id=nights-are-bloody-here>Nights are bloody here</h3><p>District 11’s danger peaks in the dark. Midnight to 5 a.m. is a wall of pain: 3 deaths at 12 a.m., 1 at 1 a.m., 1 at 3 a.m., 3 at 4 a.m., 1 at 5 a.m. Injuries stack up with them. That’s from the city’s own data covering 2022 to now. See the hours, feel the pattern in the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a>.</p><p>Speed is the thread. “Unsafe speed” shows up in fatal files here, including an 83‑year‑old driver killed at W 230th St and Broadway in 2023, with speed and a blown signal listed on the ticket. It’s written plain in the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash record</a>.</p><p>SUVs and cars do most of the harm to people on foot. They account for the bulk of pedestrian injuries and deaths in this district, far more than bikes or mopeds, per the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>vehicle rollup</a>.</p><h3 id=three-corners-same-pain>Three corners. Same pain.</h3><ul><li>Bronx River Parkway. At least two deaths and 249 injuries tie back to this corridor. It’s flagged as a top hot spot in the data. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a></li><li>Broadway. Three deaths. 76 injuries. It cuts through homes and shops and still reads like a speedway. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a></li><li>Major Deegan Expressway. Three deaths. 283 injuries. It hums day and night. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a></li></ul><p>On Webster and E 233rd, a 24‑year‑old cyclist was crushed last winter. The record lists “crush injuries.” He died there. That is all the database says. It is enough. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data</a></p><h3 id=what-officials-know--and-what-they-do>What officials know — and what they do</h3><p>Speed cameras work. The Council voted in 2022 to back Albany’s 24/7 expansion. One Bronx lawmaker put it blunt: <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/05/26/amid-epic-crisis-of-road-deaths-some-members-of-the-city-council-still-oppose-speed-cameras>“If you don’t want a speeding ticket, don’t speed,”</a> Eric Dinowitz said.</p><p>But fights stall fixes. Riverdale Avenue’s road diet drew pushback from local power even as DOT cited crash data. The city moved ahead anyway over complaints about process. The record is here: <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/04/01/riverdale-rumble-bronx-panel-rejects-dot-road-diet-plan-for-super-wide-avenue>April 2022</a>, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/08/04/bronx-pol-loses-fight-against-street-safety-as-dot-moves-ahead-on-riverdale-ave>August 2022</a>, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/01/04/pedestrian-killed-at-a-dangerous-bronx-intersection-that-city-has-failed-to-make-safe>January 2023</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, the carnage climbs. Year‑to‑date, crashes are up about 12% over last year in this district, injuries up too. Deaths doubled from 1 to 2 in the comparable period. That’s in the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>period stats</a>.</p><h3 id=the-small-fixes-are-obvious>The small fixes are obvious</h3><ul><li>Daylight corners on Broadway and along the Deegan service roads. Clear sightlines save walkers. Target the listed hot spots.</li><li>Harden left turns at W 230th and similar crossings where failure to yield shows up. Pair with leading pedestrian intervals.</li><li>Night patrols and automated enforcement on the Bronx River Parkway approaches. The hours don’t lie. The bodies come after midnight.</li></ul><p>The city knows bigger levers. Lower the default speed. Hold the worst repeat speeders to machines that won’t let them break the limit. These aren’t theories. They are the next steps after cameras. Our own reporting lays it out and shows how to press your reps. Start here: <strong><a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a></strong>.</p><h3 id=the-names-we-have>The names we have</h3><ul><li>Enrique Martinez, 21.
