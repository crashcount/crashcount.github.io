The living limp on.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price.</strong> SUVs and sedans do the damage. In the last three years, SUVs killed four, left thirteen with serious wounds.

It is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice made by leaders, or a choice they refused to make. Residents must demand more. Call for a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes and safer crossings. Tell Council Member Dinowitz: the time for half-measures is over. The street remembers every name.</p><p><strong>Act now.

DOT and local advocates argue the project will cut injuries and deaths, citing crash data. A safety analyst notes the Greenway will create safe, separated space for pedestrians and cyclists, reducing harm and boosting active travel.
