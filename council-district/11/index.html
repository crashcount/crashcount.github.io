The state may build a connecting road across the Bronx River to keep traffic moving during bridge repairs. Critics, including environmental and transit groups, say this would widen the expressway, bringing more traffic and pollution. The officials' letter asks the state to 'fully consider' options without the new road. DOT spokesman Rolando Infante said no decision has been made. The $900 million project includes capping sections with parks and green space.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as an 'anti-car crusade,' centers on the removal of 46 parking spots. The Dinowitzes claim the redesign ignores community voices. DOT and local advocates argue the project will cut injuries and deaths, citing crash data. A safety analyst notes the Greenway will create safe, separated space for pedestrians and cyclists, reducing harm and boosting active travel. The Dinowitzes support bike lanes in principle but resist changes that reduce parking.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
