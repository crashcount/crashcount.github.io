Thirty-four left with serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, two more lives lost, eleven more bodies broken. Seven hundred sixty injured. The dead do not speak. The living limp on.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price.</strong> SUVs and sedans do the damage. In the last three years, SUVs killed four, left thirteen with serious wounds. Trucks and buses killed two. Bikes and mopeds, none. The street is not a fair fight (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h2 id=leadership-action-and-silence>Leadership: Action and Silence</h2><p>Council Member Eric Dinowitz has stood on both sides of the line. He voted to expand speed cameras, saying, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/05/26/amid-epic-crisis-of-road-deaths-some-members-of-the-city-council-still-oppose-speed-cameras>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t want a speeding ticket, don&rsquo;t speed.&rdquo;</a> He backed bills for safer crosswalks, greenways, and covered bike parking. He voted to end jaywalking tickets, shifting blame away from the vulnerable.</p><p>But when the city tried to narrow Riverdale Avenue—a street where people die—Dinowitz called the process <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/08/04/bronx-pol-loses-fight-against-street-safety-as-dot-moves-ahead-on-riverdale-ave>&ldquo;undemocratic&rdquo;</a>. He pushed for left-turn signals, not lane reductions. The avenue stayed wide. The danger stayed with it.</p><p>After a bus nearly plunged from an overpass, Dinowitz said, <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/public-safety/2025/01/17/mta-bus-rescued-after-partially-driving-off-bronx-overpass->&ldquo;That’s a very big bus, so even going very slowly, it can do a lot of damage. I think it speaks to the importance of enforcing our parking rules because it was going around a double-parked car. And we’re seeing all over the city parking regulations not being enforced.&rdquo;</a></p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>The crisis is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice made by leaders, or a choice they refused to make. Residents must demand more. Call for a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes and safer crossings. Tell Council Member Dinowitz: the time for half-measures is over. The street remembers every name.</p><p><strong>Act now. The next victim is only a day away.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

It limits parking for tractor-trailer combinations, tractors, truck trailers, and semi-trailers to 90 minutes, down from three hours. Council Member Kevin C. Riley leads as primary sponsor, joined by Nantasha M. Williams, Darlene Mealy, Sandy Nurse, and others. The bill was referred to committee the day it was introduced. No safety analyst has yet assessed the direct impact on vulnerable road users, but the measure aims to keep large trucks from blocking curbs and crosswalks, where they threaten pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Jaywalking is now legal. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks or against signals. The law shifts blame from walkers to drivers. Streets belong to people again.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0346-2024, now Local Law 98 of 2024, was enacted by the City Council on October 26, 2024, after passing the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable. The law marks a shift: streets are for people, not just cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, co-sponsored by Council Member Eric Dinowitz, is under committee review. The legislation states, 'the city would have to install between one and five weather-proof enclosures with six to eight spaces apiece, depending on the size of the park.' Parks over 2.5 acres must have at least one shelter; parks over 250 acres need five. City buildings over 10,000 square feet, including public schools, must provide bike storage for workers and visitors. Marte said, 'If we want to get off the reliance of people commuting by car, we have to offer them alternative ways to get there.' The Parks Department and city agencies must report on implementation or explain impracticality. This bill targets safer, more accessible bike infrastructure for New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
