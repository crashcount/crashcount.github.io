He does not make it to the other side. In the last twelve months, <strong>five people have died</strong> on the streets of District 46. <strong>979 more have been injured</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>official crash data</a>). The numbers do not tell you about the shoes left behind, or the silence after sirens fade. They do not tell you about the families who wait for someone who will not come home.</p><p>A 30-year-old motorcyclist was killed at Flatbush Avenue and Avenue U, struck by a fire truck with lights and sirens blaring. The FDNY said the <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/motorcyclist-killed-crash-fire-truck-marine-park-brooklyn/16551852/>&ldquo;incident is under investigation&rdquo;</a>. The driver of the fire truck stayed at the scene. The victim did not leave the hospital alive.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Children, the elderly, and working people are the ones who bleed.</strong> In the past year, 97 children were hurt. Four seniors died. Cars and SUVs did most of the killing—<strong>nine deaths</strong>—but trucks, buses, and motorcycles also took lives (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>official crash data</a>). The city calls these &ldquo;accidents.&rdquo; The bodies say otherwise.</p><p>SUVs struck down six. Sedans killed three. Trucks took one more. The numbers rise. 1,265 crashes. 979 injuries. The pain spreads across every age: one young, four old, the rest in between. No one is spared.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Mercedes Narcisse has voted for some safety bills. She backed the law that ended jaywalking enforcement, a move meant to stop blaming the dead for their own deaths. Narcisse said, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/26/modified-jaywalking-repeal-passes-council>&ldquo;Enforcement has disproportionately impacted certain communities, with 96.5 percent of jaywalking tickets this year issued to Black and Hispanic New Yorkers.&rdquo;</a> She has also supported daylighting, safer truck routes, and solar crosswalks. But too many bills stall. Too many streets stay the same. The city holds hearings. The dead do not testify.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay is a choice. Call Council Member Narcisse. Demand more daylighted intersections, lower speed limits, and protected crossings. Join with others. Refuse to let another name become a number.</p><p><strong>Act now. The street will not wait.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The measure, sponsored by Council Member Mercedes Narcisse, passed the Transportation Committee but was withdrawn before a full Council vote. The bill’s summary stated it would 'legalize crossing outside crosswalks and require a pedestrian education campaign.' Advocates objected to last-minute changes that would force pedestrians to yield to drivers, fearing it could criminalize those struck by cars. Narcisse highlighted 'systemic bias in how these laws are enforced.' Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers said, 'There is little evidence to support the claim that criminal or civil offenses for jaywalking change pedestrian behavior or increase pedestrian safety,' and noted racial disparities in ticketing. The NYPD and DOT opposed the bill, citing safety concerns.

The bill seeks to amend city law to "establish a reward for individuals who provide information leading to the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of a person who seriously injures or kills another individual in a hit-and-run accident." Council Member Rita C. Joseph leads as primary sponsor, joined by Brooks-Powers, Narcisse, Vernikov, Louis, Bottcher, Hudson, Gennaro, and Williams. The bill authorizes the mayor, on the police commissioner's recommendation, to offer up to $1,000 for actionable tips. Law enforcement and city or state employees are excluded. The bill responds to the grim fact that many hit-and-runs go unsolved, leaving victims and families without answers. It aims to break the code of silence and help bring reckless drivers to justice.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to redesigning the city truck route network," requires the Department of Transportation to redesign truck routes to "improve safety, increase visibility, reduce traffic congestion, and reduce vehicle miles traveled." Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by dozens of co-sponsors. The law mandates daylighting—removing parking near intersections—to clear sight lines for drivers and protect people crossing. DOT must consult with safety groups, residents, and businesses, and replace truck route signage for better clarity. The law sets deadlines: initial report by November 2023, implementation by June 2024, and new signage by July 2024. This overhaul targets the deadly risk trucks pose to vulnerable road users at city intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
