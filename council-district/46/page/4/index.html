The collision occurred at 7:35 p.m. and left the boy with crush injuries to his legs. The report states, 'A 14-year-old boy on an e-scooter, no helmet, struck by a speeding sedan. The car’s right bumper crushed his legs. He stayed awake. Blood pooled on the street where his ride ended.' The police report explicitly cites 'Unsafe Speed' as the contributing factor in the crash. The sedan’s right front bumper was the point of impact, matching the boy’s lower leg injuries. The report notes the boy was not wearing a helmet, but this is listed after the driver’s error of unsafe speed. The focus remains on the driver’s excessive speed, which led directly to the severe injuries suffered by the vulnerable e-scooter rider.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Advocates objected to last-minute changes that would force pedestrians to yield to drivers, fearing it could criminalize those struck by cars. Narcisse highlighted 'systemic bias in how these laws are enforced.' Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers said, 'There is little evidence to support the claim that criminal or civil offenses for jaywalking change pedestrian behavior or increase pedestrian safety,' and noted racial disparities in ticketing.

Pedestrians now cross anywhere, any time. No summons. Law strips drivers of excuses. Streets shift. Power tilts to people on foot.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0346-2024, now enacted, rewrites New York’s pedestrian rules. The bill, heard by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, passed on September 26, 2024, and became law on October 26, 2024. Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers. It shifts blame from people on foot to the system and those behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A 25-year-old woman, crossing with the light, was hit by a turning SUV. Pelvis shattered, blood pooled on dusk-lit asphalt. She lay conscious as traffic moved on, the city’s indifference unbroken.</p><p class=mb3>A 25-year-old pedestrian was seriously injured at the corner of East 82nd Street and Flatlands Avenue in Brooklyn. According to the police report, she was crossing with the signal in the crosswalk when an SUV, identified as an INFI -CAR/SUV, turned left and struck her. The impact hit her pelvis, causing severe bleeding and significant injury. The police report explicitly lists 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as contributing factors on the part of the driver. The narrative notes the woman was conscious after the crash, lying injured as cars passed. The report makes clear that the pedestrian was following the crossing signal at the time of the collision. All evidence points to driver error and disregard for traffic controls as the direct causes of this crash.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
