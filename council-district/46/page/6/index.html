He does not make it to the other side. In the last twelve months, <strong>five people have died</strong> on the streets of District 46. <strong>979 more have been injured</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>official crash data</a>). The numbers do not tell you about the shoes left behind, or the silence after sirens fade. They do not tell you about the families who wait for someone who will not come home.</p><p>A 30-year-old motorcyclist was killed at Flatbush Avenue and Avenue U, struck by a fire truck with lights and sirens blaring. The FDNY said the <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/motorcyclist-killed-crash-fire-truck-marine-park-brooklyn/16551852/>&ldquo;incident is under investigation&rdquo;</a>. The driver of the fire truck stayed at the scene. The victim did not leave the hospital alive.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Children, the elderly, and working people are the ones who bleed.</strong> In the past year, 97 children were hurt. Four seniors died. Cars and SUVs did most of the killing—<strong>nine deaths</strong>—but trucks, buses, and motorcycles also took lives (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>official crash data</a>). The city calls these &ldquo;accidents.&rdquo; The bodies say otherwise.</p><p>SUVs struck down six. Sedans killed three. Trucks took one more. The numbers rise. 1,265 crashes. 979 injuries. The pain spreads across every age: one young, four old, the rest in between. No one is spared.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Mercedes Narcisse has voted for some safety bills. She backed the law that ended jaywalking enforcement, a move meant to stop blaming the dead for their own deaths. Narcisse said, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/26/modified-jaywalking-repeal-passes-council>&ldquo;Enforcement has disproportionately impacted certain communities, with 96.5 percent of jaywalking tickets this year issued to Black and Hispanic New Yorkers.&rdquo;</a> She has also supported daylighting, safer truck routes, and solar crosswalks. But too many bills stall. Too many streets stay the same. The city holds hearings. The dead do not testify.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay is a choice. Call Council Member Narcisse. Demand more daylighted intersections, lower speed limits, and protected crossings. Join with others. Refuse to let another name become a number.</p><p><strong>Act now. The street will not wait.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

According to the police report, both the car and the cyclist were traveling straight when the sedan’s right front bumper hit the cyclist. The impact ejected the cyclist from his bike. He suffered a severe head injury and was in shock. The police report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Driver Inexperience' as contributing factors. The cyclist was wearing a helmet, as noted in the report, but the crash left him bleeding from the head.

She joins Mayor Adams and others, pushing for faster, safer rides. Riders wait too long. Streets choke with traffic. The city moves to act, despite driver backlash and parking fears.</p><p class=mb3>On August 9, 2022, Councilmember Mercedes Narcisse (District 46) endorsed the Flatbush Avenue dedicated bus lane proposal. The plan, a priority for the Adams administration and MTA, aims to speed up the B41 bus from Downtown Brooklyn to Marine Park. Narcisse and Councilmember Rita Joseph joined Mayor Eric Adams at a press conference, riding the B41 and speaking with riders. Narcisse said, “People are suffering waiting 30 minutes, 40 minutes, it’s unfair to the riders.” She stressed that better bus service could cut down on illegal dollar vans. The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, has started community engagement. Some community boards worry about lost parking, but Rodriguez called their role advisory, saying, “we want to hear what the riders want.” Narcisse acknowledged driver backlash but insisted on the need for faster, reliable transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill required the Department of Transportation to repair any curb deemed a safety hazard during street resurfacing. The matter summary reads: 'requiring that the department of transportation repair broken curbs as part of resurfacing projects.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by Schulman, Brewer, Dinowitz, Krishnan, Narcisse, Menin, Yeger, Avilés, Nurse, Gutiérrez, Riley, Brannan, Sanchez, and Louis. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not advance. Broken curbs are a daily threat to pedestrians, especially the elderly and disabled. The bill would have forced the city to address these hazards as part of routine work, but the effort stalled.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
