Thirty-two left with injuries that change a life.</strong> That’s the toll in District 46 since 2022. The dead include children, elders, and people just trying to cross the street. In the last twelve months alone, five people were killed and 1,250 injured. The violence does not slow. It does not choose its victims. It finds them in crosswalks, on corners, in the middle of the day.</p><h2 id=the-latest-losses>The Latest Losses</h2><p>Just this January, a child was killed crossing at East 88th Street and Avenue L. She was in the crosswalk. She did not make it home. In November, a 66-year-old man was struck and killed at Rockaway Parkway and Seaview Avenue. He was on foot. He died in the street. The stories repeat. A 14-year-old, dead at Glenwood Road. A 60-year-old, dead at Flatbush Avenue. The numbers are steady. The pain is not.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-and-stalls>Leadership: Steps and Stalls</h2><p>Council Member Mercedes Narcisse has taken some steps. She backed the bill to decriminalize jaywalking, calling out the <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/26/modified-jaywalking-repeal-passes-council>racial bias in enforcement</a>: “Enforcement has disproportionately impacted certain communities, with 96.5 percent of jaywalking tickets this year issued to Black and Hispanic New Yorkers.” She voted yes on bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>remove abandoned vehicles</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>speed up pavement markings</a>, both meant to clear sightlines and mark danger for drivers and walkers alike.</p><p>But there is drift. Narcisse has also sponsored bills that put the burden on cyclists and scooter riders—requiring more rules, more warnings, more hoops. These do not slow cars. They do not stop the killing. The street stays the same. The bodies pile up.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice to wait. Call Council Member Narcisse. Demand a street where a child can cross and live. Demand action that slows cars, narrows lanes, and puts people first. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The law mandates clear warning decals on all rear passenger doors of taxis and for-hire vehicles. The Taxi and Limousine Commission will provide the signs at no cost. The measure aims to cut down on 'dooring'—a threat to cyclists citywide.

The measure, supported by Council Members Tiffany Caban and Shahana Hanif, aims to 'greenlight pedestrians to freely cross streets outside the crosswalk or without obeying traffic signals.' The bill responds to claims of biased enforcement against Black and Latino New Yorkers. Council Majority Leader Joseph Borelli and Councilwoman Joann Ariola oppose the bill, warning it could endanger pedestrians. The bill has not yet advanced to committee or received a hearing. The NYPD and Mayor's office are reviewing the legislation. The debate highlights the tension between enforcement fairness and the ongoing risk to vulnerable road users.
