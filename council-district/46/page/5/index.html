He does not make it to the other side. In the last twelve months, <strong>five people have died</strong> on the streets of District 46. <strong>979 more have been injured</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>official crash data</a>). The numbers do not tell you about the shoes left behind, or the silence after sirens fade. They do not tell you about the families who wait for someone who will not come home.</p><p>A 30-year-old motorcyclist was killed at Flatbush Avenue and Avenue U, struck by a fire truck with lights and sirens blaring. The FDNY said the <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/motorcyclist-killed-crash-fire-truck-marine-park-brooklyn/16551852/>&ldquo;incident is under investigation&rdquo;</a>. The driver of the fire truck stayed at the scene. The victim did not leave the hospital alive.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Children, the elderly, and working people are the ones who bleed.</strong> In the past year, 97 children were hurt. Four seniors died. Cars and SUVs did most of the killing—<strong>nine deaths</strong>—but trucks, buses, and motorcycles also took lives (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>official crash data</a>). The city calls these &ldquo;accidents.&rdquo; The bodies say otherwise.</p><p>SUVs struck down six. Sedans killed three. Trucks took one more. The numbers rise. 1,265 crashes. 979 injuries. The pain spreads across every age: one young, four old, the rest in between. No one is spared.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Mercedes Narcisse has voted for some safety bills. She backed the law that ended jaywalking enforcement, a move meant to stop blaming the dead for their own deaths. Narcisse said, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/26/modified-jaywalking-repeal-passes-council>&ldquo;Enforcement has disproportionately impacted certain communities, with 96.5 percent of jaywalking tickets this year issued to Black and Hispanic New Yorkers.&rdquo;</a> She has also supported daylighting, safer truck routes, and solar crosswalks. But too many bills stall. Too many streets stay the same. The city holds hearings. The dead do not testify.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay is a choice. Call Council Member Narcisse. Demand more daylighted intersections, lower speed limits, and protected crossings. Join with others. Refuse to let another name become a number.</p><p><strong>Act now. The street will not wait.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The law requires the Department of Transportation to 'implement daylighting at a minimum of 100 intersections a year,' meaning no parking within 15 feet of corners. High-crash intersections must be prioritized unless deemed infeasible. DOT must also install physical daylighting features, such as planters or bike corrals, where possible. Council Member Farah N. Louis sponsored the bill, joined by Brooks-Powers, Hudson, Ossé, and others. The law took effect 90 days after enactment. DOT must report annually on locations and reasons for any exceptions. This measure targets the blind spots that kill and injure pedestrians and cyclists at intersections. The city’s streets will see more open corners and fewer hiding places for danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The resolution calls on the New York State Legislature and Governor to 'fully fund the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) in the State’s upcoming Fiscal Year 2024 Budget.' Council Member Farah N. Louis sponsored the measure, joined by over thirty co-sponsors. The committee vote was unanimous among present members. The resolution highlights the MTA’s critical role for millions of New Yorkers and warns of a 'looming fiscal cliff' as federal aid dries up. The Council insists that full funding is needed to prevent service cuts and keep transit affordable and frequent. The measure references the 'New York City in Six' plan, pushing for buses and trains every six minutes.
