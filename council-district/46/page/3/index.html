Thirty-two left with injuries that change a life.</strong> That’s the toll in District 46 since 2022. The dead include children, elders, and people just trying to cross the street. In the last twelve months alone, five people were killed and 1,250 injured. The violence does not slow. It does not choose its victims. It finds them in crosswalks, on corners, in the middle of the day.</p><h2 id=the-latest-losses>The Latest Losses</h2><p>Just this January, a child was killed crossing at East 88th Street and Avenue L. She was in the crosswalk. She did not make it home. In November, a 66-year-old man was struck and killed at Rockaway Parkway and Seaview Avenue. He was on foot. He died in the street. The stories repeat. A 14-year-old, dead at Glenwood Road. A 60-year-old, dead at Flatbush Avenue. The numbers are steady. The pain is not.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-and-stalls>Leadership: Steps and Stalls</h2><p>Council Member Mercedes Narcisse has taken some steps. She backed the bill to decriminalize jaywalking, calling out the <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/26/modified-jaywalking-repeal-passes-council>racial bias in enforcement</a>: “Enforcement has disproportionately impacted certain communities, with 96.5 percent of jaywalking tickets this year issued to Black and Hispanic New Yorkers.” She voted yes on bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>remove abandoned vehicles</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>speed up pavement markings</a>, both meant to clear sightlines and mark danger for drivers and walkers alike.</p><p>But there is drift. Narcisse has also sponsored bills that put the burden on cyclists and scooter riders—requiring more rules, more warnings, more hoops. These do not slow cars. They do not stop the killing. The street stays the same. The bodies pile up.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice to wait. Call Council Member Narcisse. Demand a street where a child can cross and live. Demand action that slows cars, narrows lanes, and puts people first. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Streets remain dangerous. Action still pending.</p><p class=mb3>On April 21, 2025, the City Council’s transportation committee held a hearing on parking policy. Three bills were considered: a daylighting bill by Councilmember Julie Won to ban parking near crosswalks and require 1,000 daylighting barriers per year; a bill by Councilmember Mercedes Narcisse to waive extra fees for late parking ticket responses; and a bill by Councilmember Natasha Williams to create overnight truck parking in industrial zones. The matter summary reads: 'NYC Council to examine truck parking, daylighting and fine relief in hearing on city parking woes.' Narcisse’s bill targets fee relief for drivers who respond to violations between 45 and 90 days. Won’s daylighting bill drew support from 120 organizations. DOT faced questions on loading zones, permit abuse, and intersection safety. The hearing spotlighted the city’s struggle to balance safety for pedestrians and cyclists with business and driver concerns. No final votes yet.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Saada and two daughters died; her son remains in a coma. Prosecutors say Yarimi sped through a red light, crashed into another car, then hit the family. Black box data showed she never braked. Yarimi’s license was suspended, and her car had 21 speed camera and five red light tickets. Brooklyn D.A. Eric Gonzalez called it “one of the worst collisions he has seen on a New York City street.” Yarimi faces manslaughter and homicide charges. The crash exposes gaps in enforcement and accountability for repeat traffic offenders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Epps left the scene, tried to escape in an Uber, and was arrested after fleeing on foot. The crash was one of three fatal Brooklyn incidents that weekend.
