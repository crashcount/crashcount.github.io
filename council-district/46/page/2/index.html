Same ending.</p><ul><li>A 22‑year‑old flipped his Lexus on the Belt Parkway just after midnight. He died there, westbound, the car overturned. NYPD logged it as <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>unsafe speed</a>.</li><li>A 30‑year‑old on a motorcycle hit a fire apparatus at Flatbush and Avenue U near midnight. He was ejected and killed. The log lists <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>unsafe speed</a>.</li><li>A baby girl in a marked crosswalk at Avenue L and E 88th. A left‑turning SUV struck her. She died at the scene. The city file shows <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>“Apparent Death”</a>.</li></ul><p>On Flatbush near Hendrickson, a 60‑year‑old man was crushed and killed. The file marks him only as “Pedestrian.” No more words. The SUV kept straight. The record shows <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>one life erased</a>.</p><p>Peak harm comes after dark. Death piles up at 6 p.m., 9 p.m., and the late hours. Four killed at 6 p.m. Three at 9 p.m. Three at 10 p.m. Two at 11 p.m. The clock does not care. It keeps time and takes names, one by one, in the city’s own <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hourly counts</a>.</p><p>Belt Parkway. Flatlands Avenue. Rockaway Parkway. The list runs long. The Belt alone holds five deaths and 539 injuries since 2022, the worst in the district’s own <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>ranked hot spots</a>.</p><p>Unsafe speed stains the logs. So does inattention. The city’s roll‑up shows speed as a top killer here, with pedestrians taking the hardest hit: <strong>10 dead, 462 injured</strong>. SUVs and sedans do most of the damage to people on foot, per the district’s <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>vehicle rollup</a>.</p><p>Police words are plain when death comes by train. “No criminality is suspected,” they said after two were killed by subways an hour apart, one in Brooklyn. EMS called both dead at the scene, an <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/10/two-people-killed-by-mta-trains-one-hour-apart-in-brooklyn-and-manhattan/>FDNY spokesman said</a>.</p><p>A driver hit a 47‑year‑old man on Broadway and Suydam and kept going. “A driver struck and killed a 47‑year‑old pedestrian… then left the scene,” police said. Detectives said he was dragged more than 50 feet. The search went on, the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/cops-looking-for-driver-who-fatally-struck-man-on-brooklyn-street/>reports noted</a>.</p><p>Three crashes. Two more dead. A teen in critical shape after a bus strike. “Criminal charges for him were still pending,” one story read about another driver in custody. The night began near the Knapp Street exit of the Belt. It ended with bodies and wrecks across the city. The city’s paper trail is here: <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-investigating-separate-collisions-that-left-2-dead-teen-critical-early-tuesday>one, two, three</a>.</p><h3 id=three-corners-one-fix>Three corners. One fix.</h3><ul><li>Belt Parkway. Five deaths. Hundreds hurt. Speed rules this strip. The city already calls it a top location in District 46. Harden the exits. Cut speeds. Enforce. The data points there: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Belt Parkway</a>.</li><li>Avenue L at E 88th. A child died on a left turn. Put in daylighting, leading‑pedestrian intervals, and hardened turns. Do it now. The case file sits here: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Avenue L</a>.</li><li>Flatlands Avenue. One death. More than a hundred injuries. Protect crossings. Slow the cars. The city’s list marks it hot: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Flatlands Avenue</a>.</li></ul><p>Late night kills. The district’s clock shows a drumbeat of evening and overnight trauma. Target those hours. Light the crossings. Hold speed.</p><h3 id=officials-know-what-works--do-they>Officials know what works — do they?</h3><p>City Hall has the tools. The Council passed a law to clear abandoned cars within 72 hours, to open sightlines and crosswalks. Narcisse voted yes. The bill sits on the Mayor’s desk, per the <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>official record</a>.</p><p>The Council also moved on small steps: faster pavement markings, public reporting. Narcisse voted yes on both, the <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>docket shows</a>. The daylighting bill citywide drew broad support at a 2025 hearing; DOT fielded questions on intersection safety and blocked corners. Narcisse also pushed fee relief for late ticket responses at that same hearing, the <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-council-to-examine-truck-parking-daylighting-and-fine-relief-in-hearing-on-city-parking-woes>story said</a>.</p><p>Jaywalking is now legal in a modified form. Narcisse led it. She said enforcement had hit Black and Hispanic New Yorkers hardest: “96.5 percent of jaywalking tickets this year” went to them, the <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/26/modified-jaywalking-repeal-passes-council>coverage noted</a>.</p><h3 id=stop-the-speeding-stop-the-killing>Stop the speeding. Stop the killing.</h3><p>This district’s numbers are not a cycle. They are a slope. <strong>18 dead. 3,556 injured</strong> since 2022 in District 46’s window. Pedestrians carry the weight. The late hours do the cutting, by the city’s <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>own tables</a>.</p><p>The city knows the fixes. Lower speeds save lives. Crack down on the small pool of repeat speeders who drive the worst harm. Advocates say the policy path is clear. Take it. Do it now.

Safety slips further from reach.</p><p class=mb3>On June 17, 2025, Mayor Eric Adams and Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch announced the expansion of their 'quality-of-life' pilot program at a press conference. The program, which turns routine traffic violations by cyclists into criminal summonses, will go citywide by the end of August. The matter, reported by Streetsblog NYC as 'The Crackdown This Time Edition,' drew sharp criticism from advocates and riders. Council Member Mercedes Narcisse acknowledged drivers as the main threat to pedestrians but called for consideration of drivers in transit deserts. Mayor Adams promised to consult with communities before redesigning streets. Safety analysts warn: expanding this enforcement targets vulnerable road users, discourages cycling, and shifts blame from drivers and infrastructure. The move undermines mode shift and street safety, putting cyclists and pedestrians at greater risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan includes boarding islands for safer passenger access and removes two car lanes. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, “Almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic, and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles.” The redesign aims to separate buses from car traffic, reduce conflicts, and improve safety for vulnerable road users. Parking will decrease, but the exact impact is unclear. The plan responds to chronic congestion and slow bus speeds, which often fall below five miles per hour during rush hour.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
