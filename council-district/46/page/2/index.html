A few months earlier a motorcyclist died at Avenue U and Flatbush Avenue, and in January a left turn at Avenue L and E 88th Street killed a person crossing in the crosswalk. Police said a driver struck and killed a 47‑year‑old pedestrian at Broadway and Suydam Street and then left the scene (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/cops-looking-for-driver-who-fatally-struck-man-on-brooklyn-street/>NY Daily News</a>, 2025-08-03).</p><h3 id=the-toll-in-district-46>The toll in District 46</h3><p>Crash records show 18 people killed and 33 seriously injured in Council District 46 since 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>, accessed 2025-08-15). The burden falls heaviest on people walking: cars and SUVs account for most pedestrian deaths (9), with trucks and buses responsible for at least 1. Contributing‑factor fields in the crash data flag broad categories such as &ldquo;other&rdquo; and &ldquo;vulnerable road user error,&rdquo; while individual reports frequently list unsafe speed and driver inattention.</p><p>Hotspots repeat. The Belt Parkway and Avenue L appear among the district’s most dangerous locations, and Flatlands Avenue also shows a high crash count. Crashes that kill are more likely in the evening and late night—data show elevated fatal counts around 6–11 p.m.—so improved lighting and targeted night enforcement are essential.</p><h3 id=what-council-member-narcisse-has-done>What Council Member Narcisse has done</h3><p>Council Member Mercedes Narcisse has supported measures that affect street safety: she voted for a law to remove abandoned vehicles quickly to clear sightlines and crosswalks (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 0857-2024, NYC Council – Legistar</a>, 2025-06-30). She also backed decriminalizing certain pedestrian crossings to reduce biased enforcement (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/26/modified-jaywalking-repeal-passes-council>Streetsblog NYC</a>, 2024-09-26). Last week she co‑sponsored a bill to crack down on unlicensed commuter vans; that measure remains in committee (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1347-2025, NYC Council – Legistar</a>, introduced 2025-08-14).</p><p>These steps matter, but the district’s fatal crashes point to pressing engineering and enforcement needs: speed and large vehicles are central to the pattern of harm.</p><h3 id=local-recommendations>Local recommendations</h3><ul><li>On Belt Parkway ramps and the Flatlands corridor: lower posted speeds, redesign ramp geometry to force slower turning speeds (hardened turns), and add targeted evening enforcement and improved lighting.</li><li>At Avenue L and other repeat intersections: daylight corners (clear parking near crosswalks), install leading pedestrian intervals (LPIs), and add high‑visibility crosswalks.</li><li>Use data to identify repeat hotspots and deploy short‑term traffic calming (bollards, curb extensions) while DOT pursues redesigns.</li></ul><h3 id=citywide-fixes-tied-to-local-findings>Citywide fixes tied to local findings</h3><p>District 46’s pattern—excess speed, large vehicles, repeated hotspots—underscores two citywide priorities: lower NYC’s default speed limit, and require intelligent speed‑assistance (speed limiters) for habitual speeders. Advocates and bills at the state and city level have pushed similar measures; the Stop Super Speeders proposals, for example, would require speed‑mitigating technology for drivers with repeated camera or point violations. Local engineering and enforcement plus these broader rules together would reduce the odds that a dangerous driver or a deadly high‑speed approach returns to the same corner.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What you can do</h3><p>Demand DOT and your Councilmember act on the known hazards: lower speeds on the Belt and Flatlands corridors, daylight Avenue L corners, install LPIs, and fund lighting and targeted night enforcement. Use our <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a> guide to contact Councilmember Mercedes Narcisse and the Mayor’s office.

The impact sent the SUV into a southbound NYPD cruiser. The article notes, 'An SUV slammed into an NYPD cruiser in a three-car smash-up in Brooklyn early Sunday.' Two police officers and two SUV passengers were hospitalized in stable condition. One person was taken into custody, though no charges were filed at the time of reporting. The crash, which occurred at 2:11 am, highlights the dangers at busy intersections and the violent force unleashed when vehicles collide.

The mayor cited 'community concerns' and stated, 'After several incidents—including some involving children...we decided to adjust the current design.' City Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized the move, calling it 'pure politics' and warning, 'He is going to make this area less safe for pedestrians, for cyclists.' The article highlights tension between local complaints and street safety policy. No driver error is cited; the crash involved a cyclist and a child. The decision raises questions about how New York responds to vulnerable road users and whether removing infrastructure addresses underlying dangers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary), Frank Morano, Linda Lee, Mercedes Narcisse, and Keith Powers sponsored the measure. The summary states, 'This bill would lower the speed limit for e-bikes to 15 miles per hour.' The bill is pending in committee.

The city holds its breath.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC (2025-06-09) reports the Department of Transportation plans a center-running bus lane on Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn. The project aims to connect neighborhoods and calm traffic. DOT Assistant Director Dustin Khuu said the goal is a 'high performing transit priority street.' The plan includes concrete bus boarding islands and may reduce car lanes, giving more space to pedestrians and buses. However, the article notes gaps: 'DOT didn't share a block-by-block breakdown,' and curbside parking may remain, risking bus lane obstruction by double-parked vehicles. The city may physically protect the lane, but details are pending. The B41 bus, serving 28,000 daily trips, crawls at 4 mph during rush hour. The proposal highlights the need for clear enforcement and design to keep cars out of bus lanes and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

One cyclist, Robert Hillebrand, suffered a severed windpipe and required blood transfusions. Another, Jennifer Noble, received stitches and a broken finger. Police said the string was likely from kite fighting, a practice where glass-coated strings are used to cut opponents' kites. Witnesses described a yellow nylon string stretched across the bike lane. The NYPD found no criminality. The city parks department bans kite fighting but enforcement is lacking. Danny Mundy, a local civic leader, said, “It’s absolutely dangerous and unacceptable.” Previous injuries and lawsuits linked to kite string in the area highlight ongoing risks for cyclists and wildlife.

Since 2019, 55 people have been killed or severely injured in crashes along this stretch. The plan removes curbside parking and bans cars from bus lanes, aiming to speed up twelve bus routes and protect people on foot. Most residents in the area do not own cars and depend on slow buses.
