He does not make it to the other side. In the last twelve months, <strong>five people have died</strong> on the streets of District 46. <strong>979 more have been injured</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>official crash data</a>). The numbers do not tell you about the shoes left behind, or the silence after sirens fade. They do not tell you about the families who wait for someone who will not come home.</p><p>A 30-year-old motorcyclist was killed at Flatbush Avenue and Avenue U, struck by a fire truck with lights and sirens blaring. The FDNY said the <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/motorcyclist-killed-crash-fire-truck-marine-park-brooklyn/16551852/>&ldquo;incident is under investigation&rdquo;</a>. The driver of the fire truck stayed at the scene. The victim did not leave the hospital alive.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Children, the elderly, and working people are the ones who bleed.</strong> In the past year, 97 children were hurt. Four seniors died. Cars and SUVs did most of the killing—<strong>nine deaths</strong>—but trucks, buses, and motorcycles also took lives (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>official crash data</a>). The city calls these &ldquo;accidents.&rdquo; The bodies say otherwise.</p><p>SUVs struck down six. Sedans killed three. Trucks took one more. The numbers rise. 1,265 crashes. 979 injuries. The pain spreads across every age: one young, four old, the rest in between. No one is spared.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Mercedes Narcisse has voted for some safety bills. She backed the law that ended jaywalking enforcement, a move meant to stop blaming the dead for their own deaths. Narcisse said, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/26/modified-jaywalking-repeal-passes-council>&ldquo;Enforcement has disproportionately impacted certain communities, with 96.5 percent of jaywalking tickets this year issued to Black and Hispanic New Yorkers.&rdquo;</a> She has also supported daylighting, safer truck routes, and solar crosswalks. But too many bills stall. Too many streets stay the same. The city holds hearings. The dead do not testify.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay is a choice. Call Council Member Narcisse. Demand more daylighted intersections, lower speed limits, and protected crossings. Join with others. Refuse to let another name become a number.</p><p><strong>Act now. The street will not wait.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Three bills were considered: a daylighting bill by Councilmember Julie Won to ban parking near crosswalks and require 1,000 daylighting barriers per year; a bill by Councilmember Mercedes Narcisse to waive extra fees for late parking ticket responses; and a bill by Councilmember Natasha Williams to create overnight truck parking in industrial zones. The matter summary reads: 'NYC Council to examine truck parking, daylighting and fine relief in hearing on city parking woes.' Narcisse’s bill targets fee relief for drivers who respond to violations between 45 and 90 days. Won’s daylighting bill drew support from 120 organizations. DOT faced questions on loading zones, permit abuse, and intersection safety.

The article quotes Councilmember Farrah Louis: "It appeared the driver was driving and hit the gas instead of the brakes, trying to avoid another car, and that's how he crashed." No students were on the bus at the time. The victims were hospitalized with serious injuries. Witnesses described the bus waiting for a pedestrian before suddenly jumping the curb and smashing through the fence. The incident highlights ongoing traffic dangers in the area and raises questions about driver error and the need for improved street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, championed by Councilwoman Mercedes Narcisse of District 46, cleared the chamber in a veto-proof 40-8 vote. The bill's matter title: 'Jaywalking in NYC is set to be legal.' The legislation eliminates the $250 fine for crossing outside crosswalks or against signals. DOT First Deputy Commissioner Margaret Forgione testified against the bill, warning, 'Over the last five years, 200 people lost their lives while crossing the street mid-block or against the signal, making up about 34 percent of all pedestrian fatalities.' Mayor Eric Adams neither signed nor vetoed the bill, allowing it to become law. City Hall and NYPD officials continue to urge pedestrians to follow traffic rules. The Department of Transportation must now draft rules to implement the change.
