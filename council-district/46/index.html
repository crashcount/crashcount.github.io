A few months earlier a motorcyclist died at Avenue U and Flatbush Avenue, and in January a left turn at Avenue L and E 88th Street killed a person crossing in the crosswalk. Police said a driver struck and killed a 47‑year‑old pedestrian at Broadway and Suydam Street and then left the scene (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/cops-looking-for-driver-who-fatally-struck-man-on-brooklyn-street/>NY Daily News</a>, 2025-08-03).</p><h3 id=the-toll-in-district-46>The toll in District 46</h3><p>Crash records show 18 people killed and 33 seriously injured in Council District 46 since 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>, accessed 2025-08-15). The burden falls heaviest on people walking: cars and SUVs account for most pedestrian deaths (9), with trucks and buses responsible for at least 1. Contributing‑factor fields in the crash data flag broad categories such as &ldquo;other&rdquo; and &ldquo;vulnerable road user error,&rdquo; while individual reports frequently list unsafe speed and driver inattention.</p><p>Hotspots repeat. The Belt Parkway and Avenue L appear among the district’s most dangerous locations, and Flatlands Avenue also shows a high crash count. Crashes that kill are more likely in the evening and late night—data show elevated fatal counts around 6–11 p.m.—so improved lighting and targeted night enforcement are essential.</p><h3 id=what-council-member-narcisse-has-done>What Council Member Narcisse has done</h3><p>Council Member Mercedes Narcisse has supported measures that affect street safety: she voted for a law to remove abandoned vehicles quickly to clear sightlines and crosswalks (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 0857-2024, NYC Council – Legistar</a>, 2025-06-30). She also backed decriminalizing certain pedestrian crossings to reduce biased enforcement (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/26/modified-jaywalking-repeal-passes-council>Streetsblog NYC</a>, 2024-09-26). Last week she co‑sponsored a bill to crack down on unlicensed commuter vans; that measure remains in committee (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1347-2025, NYC Council – Legistar</a>, introduced 2025-08-14).</p><p>These steps matter, but the district’s fatal crashes point to pressing engineering and enforcement needs: speed and large vehicles are central to the pattern of harm.</p><h3 id=local-recommendations>Local recommendations</h3><ul><li>On Belt Parkway ramps and the Flatlands corridor: lower posted speeds, redesign ramp geometry to force slower turning speeds (hardened turns), and add targeted evening enforcement and improved lighting.</li><li>At Avenue L and other repeat intersections: daylight corners (clear parking near crosswalks), install leading pedestrian intervals (LPIs), and add high‑visibility crosswalks.</li><li>Use data to identify repeat hotspots and deploy short‑term traffic calming (bollards, curb extensions) while DOT pursues redesigns.</li></ul><h3 id=citywide-fixes-tied-to-local-findings>Citywide fixes tied to local findings</h3><p>District 46’s pattern—excess speed, large vehicles, repeated hotspots—underscores two citywide priorities: lower NYC’s default speed limit, and require intelligent speed‑assistance (speed limiters) for habitual speeders. Advocates and bills at the state and city level have pushed similar measures; the Stop Super Speeders proposals, for example, would require speed‑mitigating technology for drivers with repeated camera or point violations. Local engineering and enforcement plus these broader rules together would reduce the odds that a dangerous driver or a deadly high‑speed approach returns to the same corner.</p><h3 id=what-you-can-do>What you can do</h3><p>Demand DOT and your Councilmember act on the known hazards: lower speeds on the Belt and Flatlands corridors, daylight Avenue L corners, install LPIs, and fund lighting and targeted night enforcement. Use our <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a> guide to contact Councilmember Mercedes Narcisse and the Mayor’s office.

Judge Ventura issued a restraining order after Transportation Alternatives and Baruch Herzfeld appealed the city’s move. The city had planned to start demolition after complaints from local leaders, but the court’s order blocks any changes until further review. Streetsblog quotes Ben Furnas: 'The Adams administration is going to have to spend their night preparing their legal case, not ripping out a critical safety project.' The article highlights weak enforcement of parking rules and the city’s reversal against its own DOT’s safety plan.
