He does not make it to the other side. In the last twelve months, <strong>five people have died</strong> on the streets of District 46. <strong>979 more have been injured</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>official crash data</a>). The numbers do not tell you about the shoes left behind, or the silence after sirens fade. They do not tell you about the families who wait for someone who will not come home.</p><p>A 30-year-old motorcyclist was killed at Flatbush Avenue and Avenue U, struck by a fire truck with lights and sirens blaring. The FDNY said the <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/motorcyclist-killed-crash-fire-truck-marine-park-brooklyn/16551852/>&ldquo;incident is under investigation&rdquo;</a>. The driver of the fire truck stayed at the scene. The victim did not leave the hospital alive.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Children, the elderly, and working people are the ones who bleed.</strong> In the past year, 97 children were hurt. Four seniors died. Cars and SUVs did most of the killing—<strong>nine deaths</strong>—but trucks, buses, and motorcycles also took lives (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>official crash data</a>). The city calls these &ldquo;accidents.&rdquo; The bodies say otherwise.</p><p>SUVs struck down six. Sedans killed three. Trucks took one more. The numbers rise. 1,265 crashes. 979 injuries. The pain spreads across every age: one young, four old, the rest in between. No one is spared.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Mercedes Narcisse has voted for some safety bills. She backed the law that ended jaywalking enforcement, a move meant to stop blaming the dead for their own deaths. Narcisse said, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/26/modified-jaywalking-repeal-passes-council>&ldquo;Enforcement has disproportionately impacted certain communities, with 96.5 percent of jaywalking tickets this year issued to Black and Hispanic New Yorkers.&rdquo;</a> She has also supported daylighting, safer truck routes, and solar crosswalks. But too many bills stall. Too many streets stay the same. The city holds hearings. The dead do not testify.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay is a choice. Call Council Member Narcisse. Demand more daylighted intersections, lower speed limits, and protected crossings. Join with others. Refuse to let another name become a number.</p><p><strong>Act now. The street will not wait.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Police target cyclists. Riders face more stops, more tickets. Streets grow tense. Enforcement rises. Vulnerable road users bear the brunt. Safety slips further from reach.</p><p class=mb3>On June 17, 2025, Mayor Eric Adams and Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch announced the expansion of their 'quality-of-life' pilot program at a press conference. The program, which turns routine traffic violations by cyclists into criminal summonses, will go citywide by the end of August. The matter, reported by Streetsblog NYC as 'The Crackdown This Time Edition,' drew sharp criticism from advocates and riders. Council Member Mercedes Narcisse acknowledged drivers as the main threat to pedestrians but called for consideration of drivers in transit deserts. Mayor Adams promised to consult with communities before redesigning streets. Safety analysts warn: expanding this enforcement targets vulnerable road users, discourages cycling, and shifts blame from drivers and infrastructure. The move undermines mode shift and street safety, putting cyclists and pedestrians at greater risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Officers, following new NYPD pursuit rules, did not chase but instead set a roadblock.

The driver, Jumaane Wright, swerved toward officers, nearly striking a lieutenant, who fired a single shot. Wright crashed a mile later and died at the hospital.

The matter summary reads: 'NYC Council to examine truck parking, daylighting and fine relief in hearing on city parking woes.' Narcisse’s bill targets fee relief for drivers who respond to violations between 45 and 90 days. Won’s daylighting bill drew support from 120 organizations.

The crash occurred at 18:46, as an SUV made a left turn and struck the child in a marked crosswalk. The report states the SUV driver’s action—'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way'—as the primary contributing factor. The narrative describes the baby in the crosswalk, the SUV turning left, and the impact crushing her chest. The sedan involved was parked and did not contribute to the collision. The police report makes no mention of the pedestrian’s behavior as a contributing factor. The focus remains on the SUV driver's failure to yield, a systemic danger that left a child dead in the intersection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill is titled, "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to installing child with autism warning plaques on streets." Council Member Kevin C. Riley is the primary sponsor, joined by Ariola, Joseph, Moya, Won, Banks, Narcisse, Paladino, and Marmorato. Their action: referral to committee. The bill requires the Department of Transportation to install warning plaques at the request of a parent or guardian. It details the process for requesting, installing, and removing these signs. The stated aim is to alert motorists to the presence of a child with autism. There is no evidence these plaques reduce crashes or protect children. The city continues to rely on signage, not street redesign, to address systemic danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law requires the Department of Transportation to consult with the Fire Department before approving open street applications, bicycle lane projects, or major transportation projects. The official matter title states the law amends the city code to require DOT to consult with FDNY and notify affected firehouses before moving forward. Primary sponsor Kalman Yeger, with co-sponsors including Joann Ariola, Robert Holden, Lynn Schulman, and others, pushed the bill through. The law expands notification and comment rights for firehouses and community boards, adding new steps before any street or lane changes. No safety analyst assessed the direct impact on vulnerable road users. The law’s effect: more agencies weigh in, but the process for safer streets grows longer and more complex.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill’s title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the department of transportation posting information on traffic-control device and speed reducer requests on its website.” Council Member Kalman Yeger led as primary sponsor, joined by dozens of co-sponsors. The law orders DOT to publish every request for traffic signals and speed humps—case number, subject, status, resolution, reason for approval or denial, and timeline if approved. The public can now track what the city does, or fails to do, when streets need taming. This transparency exposes the machinery behind every crosswalk, signal, and speed bump—vital for anyone who walks, bikes, or rides in New York.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
