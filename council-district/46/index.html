Thirty-two left with injuries that change a life.</strong> That’s the toll in District 46 since 2022. The dead include children, elders, and people just trying to cross the street. In the last twelve months alone, five people were killed and 1,250 injured. The violence does not slow. It does not choose its victims. It finds them in crosswalks, on corners, in the middle of the day.</p><h2 id=the-latest-losses>The Latest Losses</h2><p>Just this January, a child was killed crossing at East 88th Street and Avenue L. She was in the crosswalk. She did not make it home. In November, a 66-year-old man was struck and killed at Rockaway Parkway and Seaview Avenue. He was on foot. He died in the street. The stories repeat. A 14-year-old, dead at Glenwood Road. A 60-year-old, dead at Flatbush Avenue. The numbers are steady. The pain is not.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-and-stalls>Leadership: Steps and Stalls</h2><p>Council Member Mercedes Narcisse has taken some steps. She backed the bill to decriminalize jaywalking, calling out the <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/26/modified-jaywalking-repeal-passes-council>racial bias in enforcement</a>: “Enforcement has disproportionately impacted certain communities, with 96.5 percent of jaywalking tickets this year issued to Black and Hispanic New Yorkers.” She voted yes on bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>remove abandoned vehicles</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>speed up pavement markings</a>, both meant to clear sightlines and mark danger for drivers and walkers alike.</p><p>But there is drift. Narcisse has also sponsored bills that put the burden on cyclists and scooter riders—requiring more rules, more warnings, more hoops. These do not slow cars. They do not stop the killing. The street stays the same. The bodies pile up.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice to wait. Call Council Member Narcisse. Demand a street where a child can cross and live. Demand action that slows cars, narrows lanes, and puts people first. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Last week, a speeding driver ran a red light, killing two pedestrians. The article quotes Adams, who once called Third Avenue 'extremely intimidating' and said it 'must be at the top of our list.' Despite this, his administration 'put the brakes on a potentially life-saving road redesign,' favoring business interests. Attorney Peter Beadle notes, 'they had a plan ready to go and then it was pulled back.' The city could face legal action for failing to act despite knowing the risks, echoing a 2017 state court ruling on municipal liability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Judge Ventura issued a restraining order after Transportation Alternatives and Baruch Herzfeld appealed the city’s move. The city had planned to start demolition after complaints from local leaders, but the court’s order blocks any changes until further review. Streetsblog quotes Ben Furnas: 'The Adams administration is going to have to spend their night preparing their legal case, not ripping out a critical safety project.' The article highlights weak enforcement of parking rules and the city’s reversal against its own DOT’s safety plan.

Advocates say this 'all but guarantees that there will be blood on Eric Adams's hands.' NYPD data showed injuries dropped after the lane’s installation. The city acted after complaints from local leaders. The lane sits on a 'Vision Zero Priority Corridor,' one of Brooklyn’s most dangerous streets. Cyclists and residents called the move political and warned it strips away proven safety. No driver errors cited, but the policy shift exposes vulnerable road users to renewed risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Officials responded to concerns by painting pedestrian islands and loading zones but did not install physical barriers or bus boarding islands. Cyclists described the decision as political, with one saying, "There’s a very important voting bloc that’s using their leverage over the mayor to remove the bike lane."

The program, which turns routine traffic violations by cyclists into criminal summonses, will go citywide by the end of August. The matter, reported by Streetsblog NYC as 'The Crackdown This Time Edition,' drew sharp criticism from advocates and riders. Council Member Mercedes Narcisse acknowledged drivers as the main threat to pedestrians but called for consideration of drivers in transit deserts. Mayor Adams promised to consult with communities before redesigning streets. Safety analysts warn: expanding this enforcement targets vulnerable road users, discourages cycling, and shifts blame from drivers and infrastructure.
