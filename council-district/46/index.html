Police say the driver "sped through a red light" and fled. Since 2018, drivers have killed or seriously injured 80 people on this two-mile stretch. A redesign with protected bike lanes was approved but stalled. State Sen. Gounardes criticized the city's response: "We should all be offended... the response... is a sign that says: 'be careful.'"

The program, which turns routine traffic violations by cyclists into criminal summonses, will go citywide by the end of August. The matter, reported by Streetsblog NYC as 'The Crackdown This Time Edition,' drew sharp criticism from advocates and riders. Council Member Mercedes Narcisse acknowledged drivers as the main threat to pedestrians but called for consideration of drivers in transit deserts. Mayor Adams promised to consult with communities before redesigning streets. Safety analysts warn: expanding this enforcement targets vulnerable road users, discourages cycling, and shifts blame from drivers and infrastructure.
