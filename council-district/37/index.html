A gray Ford hit him and kept going. He died at Brookdale Hospital. The driver did not stop. Police are still looking. It was the second hit-and-run in the city that day. As of July, <strong>55 pedestrians have been killed crossing city streets this year</strong>. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/04/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-man-36-in-brooklyn-crash/>The driver of the Ford sped off, never stopping, cops said. He remained at large on Saturday.</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, District 37 saw <strong>3 deaths and 22 serious injuries</strong> from crashes. <strong>884 people were hurt</strong>. The numbers do not slow. They do not care about age. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash data</a></p><h3 id=the-shape-of-danger-who-pays-the-price>The Shape of Danger: Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars did the most harm.</strong> They caused the most injuries and deaths to people on foot. Trucks and buses followed. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes also left scars, but the weight of steel and speed is what kills. The stories repeat. A 71-year-old woman, crossing Knickerbocker Avenue, was killed by a driver who ran the light and sped. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash data</a></p><h3 id=council-member-sandy-nurse-record-and-responsibility>Council Member Sandy Nurse: Record and Responsibility</h3><p>Council Member Sandy Nurse has backed bills to make streets safer. She voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished walkers instead of drivers. She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, pushed for more protected bike lanes, and supported daylighting—banning parking near crosswalks to clear sightlines. But the pace is slow. The deaths keep coming. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so. The law sits. The streets bleed.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-demand-now>Call to Action: Demand More, Demand Now</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of loss.</strong> Call Council Member Nurse. Call the Mayor. Tell them to use the laws they have. Lower the speed. Build the barriers. Protect the crossings. Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/04/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-man-36-in-brooklyn-crash/>The victim was crossing near the Broadway Junction near the corner of Broadway and East New York Ave. in Ocean Hill at about 10 p.m. Thursday when a gray Ford rammed into him.</a></p><p><strong>Act now.

Police made an arrest.</p><p class=mb3>According to the New York Post (published June 19, 2025), Chaquasia Pigford was arrested and charged with murder, manslaughter, reckless driving, unlicensed operation, and leaving the scene after allegedly killing Tiffany Cifuni on May 24 in Bedford-Stuyvesant. Prosecutors say Pigford rear-ended Cifuni, then stopped two blocks away. When Cifuni approached, Pigford 'refused to roll down her window or speak,' then accelerated, striking and dragging Cifuni. The article quotes Assistant District Attorney Tara Kelly: 'The defendant floored the gas, instantly striking Tiffany, causing her body to become lodged beneath the vehicle.' Pigford then made an illegal turn and fled. The case highlights the lethal risk of hit-and-run driving and the dangers posed by unlicensed, reckless drivers operating stolen vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city had announced the removal would happen by the end of June. The order blocks any changes until a court hearing on August 6. According to NY1, the restraining order 'prevents the city from altering three blocks of a protected lane along Bedford Avenue, on the border of Bedford-Stuyvesant and South Williamsburg.' The case highlights the tension between city policy and street safety for vulnerable road users. No driver actions are cited, but the move would have reduced protection for cyclists and pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move follows complaints from local residents, especially after a viral video showed a child running into the lane from a double-parked car and colliding with an e-bike. Adams stated, 'we listened to community concerns and decided to adjust the current design to better reflect community feedback.' The Department of Transportation will revert the protected lane to its previous unprotected state between Willoughby and Flushing avenues. The article highlights ongoing political battles over street design and notes that double-parking and chaotic traffic remain unaddressed. Deputy Mayor Randy Mastro cited 'lack of action' on e-bike safety as a barrier to safer infrastructure.

One cyclist, Robert Hillebrand, suffered a severed windpipe and required blood transfusions. Another, Jennifer Noble, received stitches and a broken finger. Police said the string was likely from kite fighting, a practice where glass-coated strings are used to cut opponents' kites. Witnesses described a yellow nylon string stretched across the bike lane. The NYPD found no criminality. The city parks department bans kite fighting but enforcement is lacking. Danny Mundy, a local civic leader, said, “It’s absolutely dangerous and unacceptable.” Previous injuries and lawsuits linked to kite string in the area highlight ongoing risks for cyclists and wildlife. No driver involvement was reported, but the incident exposes gaps in infrastructure and enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
