He made this commitment clear in 2022" -- Sandy Nurse</p><p class=mb3>On August 6, 2025, Mayor Eric Adams signaled a likely veto of Intro 1135, a City Council bill to expand minimum wage protections to over 20,000 grocery delivery workers. The Council passed the bill with a veto-proof majority. Council Member Sandy Nurse, the sponsor, called out Adams for breaking his 2022 promise to raise pay standards. The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection backed the bill, saying it would close gaps in pay protections. According to safety analysts, this event concerns labor protections and does not directly affect street safety or infrastructure for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
