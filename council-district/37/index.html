A burgundy Ford Explorer hits him. The driver does not stop. The man dies in the street. This is not rare. In the last twelve months, three people died and 22 suffered serious injuries in District 37. Pedestrians, cyclists, and children pay the price.</p><p>A 71-year-old woman, crossing Knickerbocker Avenue, is crushed and left unconscious. A 59-year-old man, walking with the signal at Wyckoff and DeKalb, is struck by a van making a right turn. He does not get up. These are not accidents. They are the result of choices, speed, and streets built for cars, not people.</p><h2 id=the-numbers-relentless-and-unforgiving>The Numbers: Relentless and Unforgiving</h2><p>In just three years, District 37 saw 8 deaths and 43 serious injuries from crashes. More than 3,100 people were hurt. Cars and trucks caused most of the pain: 1 killed, 99 moderately hurt, 6 seriously injured. Motorcycles and mopeds left 2 seriously hurt. Bikes left 1 seriously hurt. The numbers do not lie. The bodies pile up. The city moves on.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-and-silence>Leadership: Action and Silence</h2><p>Council Member Sandy Nurse has not been silent. Nurse co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed protected bike lanes, and expand Open Streets. Nurse called out the city&rsquo;s failure to remove plateless, untraceable cars, warning, &ldquo;Cars with ghost plates are a risk to public safety&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/16/no-license-plates-no-problem-scofflaw-drivers-remove-tags-from-cars-and-rarely-get-caught>warned</a>). Nurse voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that blamed victims instead of drivers. But the carnage continues. Every delay, every loophole, every half-measure means another family shattered.</p><p>A man is killed crossing Fulton Street. The driver flees. The news repeats: &ldquo;The vehicle did not remain on the scene&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-fatal-hit-run-police-searching-driver-55-year-old-man-fatally-struck-car-cypress-hills/16447158/>reported</a>).</p><h2 id=what-next-demand-more-demand-now>What Next: Demand More, Demand Now</h2><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call your council member. Demand daylighting at every intersection. Demand protected bike lanes and lower speed limits. Demand the city use the power it has. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, titled “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to a discounted bike share rate for public school students aged 16 or older,” would require the Department of Transportation to set a discounted rate for eligible students. Council Member Christopher Marte leads as primary sponsor, joined by Gale A. Brewer, Shahana K. Hanif, Sandy Nurse, Linda Lee, Keith Powers, Lincoln Restler, Chi A. Ossé, Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, Althea V. Stevens, and Farah N. Louis. The measure aims to make cycling more accessible for youth, but the city must ensure safe streets as more young riders join traffic.

The matter summary states, 'The final plan did not eliminate parking mandates citywide but divided the city into zones.' Council Member Crystal Hudson pushed to eliminate mandates in all her districts. Council Member Shahana Hanif opposed carve-outs. Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez called parking mandates 'a concession to cars that we don’t need and can’t afford.'

Council Member Alexa Avilés, chair of the Immigration Committee, called for broader protections: 'When you become a worker, you should be ensured a living wage.' Ligia Guallpa of Worker’s Justice Project said all delivery workers face significant risks and deserve safety, dignity, and respect. The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection supports expanding the wage standard. Instacart opposes the bill. The Council’s action centers gig workers who ride city streets, exposed to daily danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
