A gray Ford hit him and kept going. He died at Brookdale Hospital. The driver did not stop. Police are still looking. It was the second hit-and-run in the city that day. As of July, <strong>55 pedestrians have been killed crossing city streets this year</strong>. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/04/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-man-36-in-brooklyn-crash/>The driver of the Ford sped off, never stopping, cops said. He remained at large on Saturday.</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, District 37 saw <strong>3 deaths and 22 serious injuries</strong> from crashes. <strong>884 people were hurt</strong>. The numbers do not slow. They do not care about age. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash data</a></p><h3 id=the-shape-of-danger-who-pays-the-price>The Shape of Danger: Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars did the most harm.</strong> They caused the most injuries and deaths to people on foot. Trucks and buses followed. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes also left scars, but the weight of steel and speed is what kills. The stories repeat. A 71-year-old woman, crossing Knickerbocker Avenue, was killed by a driver who ran the light and sped. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash data</a></p><h3 id=council-member-sandy-nurse-record-and-responsibility>Council Member Sandy Nurse: Record and Responsibility</h3><p>Council Member Sandy Nurse has backed bills to make streets safer. She voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished walkers instead of drivers. She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, pushed for more protected bike lanes, and supported daylighting—banning parking near crosswalks to clear sightlines. But the pace is slow. The deaths keep coming. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so. The law sits. The streets bleed.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-demand-now>Call to Action: Demand More, Demand Now</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of loss.</strong> Call Council Member Nurse. Call the Mayor. Tell them to use the laws they have. Lower the speed. Build the barriers. Protect the crossings. Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/04/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-man-36-in-brooklyn-crash/>The victim was crossing near the Broadway Junction near the corner of Broadway and East New York Ave. in Ocean Hill at about 10 p.m. Thursday when a gray Ford rammed into him.</a></p><p><strong>Act now.

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'before this bike lane from 2018 to 2022 this is the area that had the second largest numbers of pedestrian fatalities and crashes in the city.' The lane faced opposition from some Hasidic leaders, citing children running into the lane from illegally parked cars and buses. Despite tweaks—school bus zones, daylighted corners, no standing areas—drivers kept parking illegally, blocking sightlines and endangering children. The city rarely removes protected lanes, but Adams acted after political pressure. Moving the lane to Classon Avenue, as some demand, would force cyclists onto a chaotic BQE ramp.

The city moves to fix a deadly, clogged corridor.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist reported on June 4, 2025, that New York City's Department of Transportation plans to overhaul Flatbush Avenue between Livingston Street and Grand Army Plaza. The redesign replaces two car lanes with 24/7 bus-only lanes and adds pedestrian islands. DOT officials said, 'almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles.' Since 2019, 55 people have been killed or severely injured in crashes along this stretch. The plan removes curbside parking and bans cars from bus lanes, aiming to speed up twelve bus routes and protect people on foot. Most residents in the area do not own cars and depend on slow buses. The proposal reflects a shift toward prioritizing vulnerable road users and addressing systemic danger on one of Brooklyn's busiest corridors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
