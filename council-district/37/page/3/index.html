Twenty-four left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. In the last year alone, District 37 saw 1,612 crashes, 907 injuries, and 3 deaths, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. The numbers are blunt. The pain is sharper. A 71-year-old woman, crossing Knickerbocker and Eldert, never made it to the other side. A 59-year-old man, walking with the light on Wyckoff, was struck and killed by a van. A 55-year-old man, crossing Fulton in Cypress Hills, was hit by a Ford Explorer. The driver fled. The street kept its silence.</p><p>Police said, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/brooklyn-hit-and-run-driver-wanted-after-striking-man-in-street/>&ldquo;the man was crossing the street in Cypress Hills when he was hit by a burgundy Ford Explorer.&rdquo;</a> The car did not stop. The man died at the hospital.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Council Member Sandy Nurse has signed her name to bills that matter. She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, pushed for protected bike lanes, and voted to end jaywalking enforcement—removing a law that too often blamed the dead instead of the driver. She called out the city&rsquo;s failure to remove ghost cars: <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/16/no-license-plates-no-problem-scofflaw-drivers-remove-tags-from-cars-and-rarely-get-caught>&ldquo;Cars with ghost plates are a risk to public safety.&rdquo;</a> But bills alone do not save lives. Many measures sit in committee. Promises pile up. The danger does not wait.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>Most injuries and deaths come from cars and trucks. In three years, SUVs and sedans killed at least one person and seriously injured six more. Trucks and buses killed two. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left more bodies broken. The street does not care what you ride or drive. It only cares who is left standing.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-the-choice-is-ours>What Comes Next: The Choice Is Ours</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every day the city delays, another family risks losing someone. Call Council Member Nurse. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action, not just words. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Mastro is known for opposing bike lanes and congestion pricing, having fought the Prospect Park West bike lane and represented New Jersey against congestion pricing. Council Members Sandy Nurse and Tiffany Caban voiced strong opposition, with Caban declaring, 'No way in hell I vote to confirm Randy Mastro.' Joe Borelli, a congestion pricing opponent, supported the move, saying, 'I want more people who think like me on congestion pricing in City Hall.' The appointment signals a car-first agenda. Council resistance is fierce. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, bus riders—face greater risk if Mastro’s priorities shape city policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The 24-year-old moped rider, who was wearing a helmet, suffered head injuries described as 'crush injuries' and was found in shock, upright and bleeding.

Fines set at $175. Civilians can report violations. DOT must act on complaints. Council aims to clear paths for people, not cars.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0080-2024 sits in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure after its introduction on February 8, 2024. The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to hazardous obstruction by vehicles and civilian complaints to the department of transportation for hazardous obstruction violations," creates a new civil penalty for vehicles blocking bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or hydrants within 2,640 feet of a school. The penalty is $175 per violation. The Department of Transportation must launch a civilian reporting program. If DOT prosecutes a case using civilian evidence, the complainant gets 25% of the proceeds. Council Member Carlina Rivera leads as primary sponsor, joined by Restler, Joseph, Menin, Nurse, Hudson, Brannan, Farías, Brewer, Salaam, Hanif, Avilés, Won, Bottcher, Krishnan, Gutiérrez, Marte, and the Brooklyn Borough President. The bill aims to keep streets clear for vulnerable road users, especially near schools.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Critics warn registration means more stops, fewer bikes, and more danger for riders.</p><p class=mb3>On November 13, 2023, Council Member Gale Brewer (D-Upper West Side) publicly opposed Council Member Bob Holden’s proposed e-bike registration bill. The bill, not yet passed, would require every e-bike in New York City to be registered with the Department of Transportation. Brewer stated, “I do not believe a blanket e-bike registration rule will make streets safer, nor is NYC DOT equipped to establish, manage or enforce it.” She instead sponsors Intro. 1168, mandating safe lithium-ion batteries for delivery workers, and Intro. 1163, requiring worker training and identification. Thirty-one organizations endorsed Brewer’s approach, calling Holden’s bill “ineffective, dangerous, expensive, short-sighted, and bureaucratically complicated.” Council Members Rita Joseph and Sandy Nurse also withdrew support. Opponents argue the registration bill could suppress e-bike use, increase police stops in communities of color, and worsen traffic violence. Holden dismissed these concerns, insisting his bill is vital for safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
