A gray Ford hit him and kept going. He died at Brookdale Hospital. The driver did not stop. Police are still looking. It was the second hit-and-run in the city that day. As of July, <strong>55 pedestrians have been killed crossing city streets this year</strong>. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/04/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-man-36-in-brooklyn-crash/>The driver of the Ford sped off, never stopping, cops said. He remained at large on Saturday.</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, District 37 saw <strong>3 deaths and 22 serious injuries</strong> from crashes. <strong>884 people were hurt</strong>. The numbers do not slow. They do not care about age.

Trucks and buses followed. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes also left scars, but the weight of steel and speed is what kills. The stories repeat. A 71-year-old woman, crossing Knickerbocker Avenue, was killed by a driver who ran the light and sped. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash data</a></p><h3 id=council-member-sandy-nurse-record-and-responsibility>Council Member Sandy Nurse: Record and Responsibility</h3><p>Council Member Sandy Nurse has backed bills to make streets safer. She voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished walkers instead of drivers. She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, pushed for more protected bike lanes, and supported daylighting—banning parking near crosswalks to clear sightlines. But the pace is slow. The deaths keep coming. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so. The law sits. The streets bleed.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-demand-now>Call to Action: Demand More, Demand Now</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of loss.</strong> Call Council Member Nurse. Call the Mayor. Tell them to use the laws they have. Lower the speed. Build the barriers. Protect the crossings. Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/04/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-man-36-in-brooklyn-crash/>The victim was crossing near the Broadway Junction near the corner of Broadway and East New York Ave. in Ocean Hill at about 10 p.m. Thursday when a gray Ford rammed into him.</a></p><p><strong>Act now.

The matter summary states, 'The final plan did not eliminate parking mandates citywide but divided the city into zones.' Council Member Crystal Hudson pushed to eliminate mandates in all her districts. Council Member Shahana Hanif opposed carve-outs.

Metal struck a man’s hip. Blood spilled onto cold Brooklyn asphalt. He stood, wounded but conscious, as the street swallowed the noise and the danger lingered in the dark.</p><p class=mb3>A 40-year-old man was injured when a pickup truck backed into him on Fulton Street near Wyona Street in Brooklyn at 8:14 p.m., according to the police report. The report states the pedestrian was standing outside the crosswalk when the collision occurred. The pickup, a 2017 Dodge, struck the man with its right front bumper, causing severe lacerations to his hip and upper leg. According to the police report, the primary contributing factor was 'Backing Unsafely,' with 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' also cited. The pedestrian’s actions or location are mentioned only as context; the report does not list any pedestrian behavior as a contributing factor. The focus remains on the driver’s unsafe backing and lack of attention, which led to the injury.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill is 'Laid Over in Committee.' Its title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting standing or parking a vehicle within 20 feet of a crosswalk at an intersection.' Council Member Erik D. Bottcher is the primary sponsor, joined by Julie Won, Jumaane Williams, and others. The bill prohibits standing or parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and mandates the Department of Transportation to install daylighting barriers at a minimum of 1,000 intersections per year. The law also requires citywide outreach and reporting. This measure aims to keep sightlines clear at crossings, a known danger zone for people on foot and bike.
