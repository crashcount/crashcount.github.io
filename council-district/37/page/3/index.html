New Yorkers have already organized for it; the mechanism exists. Start with a citywide 20 MPH default and build from there (<a href=/take_action/>CrashCount: Take Action</a>).</li><li>Stop repeat speeders with in‑car limiters for the worst offenders.

The impact crushed the Hyundai's roof and damaged the rear ends of the parked vehicles. No pedestrians, cyclists, or other vehicle occupants were reported injured.
