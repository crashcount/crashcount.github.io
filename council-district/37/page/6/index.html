Twenty-four left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. In the last year alone, District 37 saw 1,612 crashes, 907 injuries, and 3 deaths, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. The numbers are blunt. The pain is sharper. A 71-year-old woman, crossing Knickerbocker and Eldert, never made it to the other side. A 59-year-old man, walking with the light on Wyckoff, was struck and killed by a van. A 55-year-old man, crossing Fulton in Cypress Hills, was hit by a Ford Explorer. The driver fled. The street kept its silence.</p><p>Police said, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/brooklyn-hit-and-run-driver-wanted-after-striking-man-in-street/>&ldquo;the man was crossing the street in Cypress Hills when he was hit by a burgundy Ford Explorer.&rdquo;</a> The car did not stop. The man died at the hospital.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Council Member Sandy Nurse has signed her name to bills that matter. She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, pushed for protected bike lanes, and voted to end jaywalking enforcement—removing a law that too often blamed the dead instead of the driver. She called out the city&rsquo;s failure to remove ghost cars: <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/16/no-license-plates-no-problem-scofflaw-drivers-remove-tags-from-cars-and-rarely-get-caught>&ldquo;Cars with ghost plates are a risk to public safety.&rdquo;</a> But bills alone do not save lives. Many measures sit in committee. Promises pile up. The danger does not wait.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>Most injuries and deaths come from cars and trucks. In three years, SUVs and sedans killed at least one person and seriously injured six more. Trucks and buses killed two. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left more bodies broken. The street does not care what you ride or drive. It only cares who is left standing.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-the-choice-is-ours>What Comes Next: The Choice Is Ours</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every day the city delays, another family risks losing someone. Call Council Member Nurse. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action, not just words. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Nurse stated, 'Our communities cannot afford any more delays.' Advocates and Families for Safe Streets highlighted the deadly toll: reckless commercial haulers have killed more than two dozen people in recent years. The reform aims to cut truck traffic, reduce pollution, and require life-saving side guards on heavy trucks by 2024.

They want special permits to drop parking. They say parking rules drive up costs, block affordable homes, and fuel car use. The message is clear—build for people, not for cars.</p><p class=mb3>On March 1, 2022, Brooklyn politicians announced a push to eliminate mandatory parking minimums for new developments. The action is not a formal bill, but a policy stance led by Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Council Member Lincoln Restler. The group, including Council Members Jennifer Gutierrez, Crystal Hudson, Chi Osse, Sandy Nurse, Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Rita Joseph, and Farah Louis, demands that developers seeking zoning changes first apply for a special permit to waive parking requirements. Restler said, 'Developers need our consent and approval, and we are telling them, plainly, that they have to file for a special permit to end parking requirements.' Reynoso added, 'You don't need to do that anymore.' Avilés called parking mandates a barrier to affordable housing and climate action. The group argues that parking minimums raise construction costs, encourage car use, and block green space. Restler warned he is 'far more likely to vote no' on projects without a parking waiver. Advocates and policy experts back the move, and related state legislation is pending.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
