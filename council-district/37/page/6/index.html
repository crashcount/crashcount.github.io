Twenty-four left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. In the last year alone, District 37 saw 1,612 crashes, 907 injuries, and 3 deaths, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. The numbers are blunt. The pain is sharper. A 71-year-old woman, crossing Knickerbocker and Eldert, never made it to the other side. A 59-year-old man, walking with the light on Wyckoff, was struck and killed by a van. A 55-year-old man, crossing Fulton in Cypress Hills, was hit by a Ford Explorer. The driver fled. The street kept its silence.</p><p>Police said, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/brooklyn-hit-and-run-driver-wanted-after-striking-man-in-street/>&ldquo;the man was crossing the street in Cypress Hills when he was hit by a burgundy Ford Explorer.&rdquo;</a> The car did not stop. The man died at the hospital.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Council Member Sandy Nurse has signed her name to bills that matter. She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, pushed for protected bike lanes, and voted to end jaywalking enforcement—removing a law that too often blamed the dead instead of the driver. She called out the city&rsquo;s failure to remove ghost cars: <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/16/no-license-plates-no-problem-scofflaw-drivers-remove-tags-from-cars-and-rarely-get-caught>&ldquo;Cars with ghost plates are a risk to public safety.&rdquo;</a> But bills alone do not save lives. Many measures sit in committee. Promises pile up. The danger does not wait.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>Most injuries and deaths come from cars and trucks. In three years, SUVs and sedans killed at least one person and seriously injured six more. Trucks and buses killed two. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left more bodies broken. The street does not care what you ride or drive. It only cares who is left standing.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-the-choice-is-ours>What Comes Next: The Choice Is Ours</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every day the city delays, another family risks losing someone. Call Council Member Nurse. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action, not just words. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The city’s most vulnerable remain at risk.</p><p class=mb3>On February 23, 2023, the City Council held an oversight hearing on the delayed rollout of commercial waste zone reform, first mandated by law in 2019. The Department of Sanitation (DSNY) admitted the overhaul would not start until late 2024, with citywide coverage years away. The matter, described as a fix for a 'free-for-all system that led to reckless driving and fatalities,' remains stalled. Council Members Lincoln Restler and Julie Menin pressed DSNY Commissioner Jessica Tisch on the slow pace and shifting deadlines. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, who introduced the original legislation, stressed the need for clear guidance. StreetsPAC’s Eric McClure highlighted the deadly consequences of delay. DSNY opposes a bill from Council Member Sandy Nurse to create a working group to address these setbacks. The ongoing delay leaves vulnerable road users exposed to dangerous private carting trucks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
