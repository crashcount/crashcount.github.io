A car hit him at Broadway and Suydam, dragged him more than 50 feet, and left him in the street. The driver fled. Police have not named the man. They are still looking for the car. The city is still waiting. Police <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/police-searching-for-information-on-bushwick-hit-and-run-that-killed-a-pedestrian>were looking on Monday for the driver of a car that struck and dragged a 47-year-old man on a Brooklyn street over the weekend, killing him</a>.</p><p>This is not rare. In the last 12 months, District 37 saw 6 deaths and 24 serious injuries in nearly 2,000 crashes. Over 1,000 people were hurt. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, sons, daughters. Some were walking. Some were riding. Some were just trying to cross the street.</p><h2 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h2><p>Brooklyn leads the city in pedestrian injuries. The city knows the danger. The council knows. Still, the streets stay the same. The cars keep coming. The bodies keep falling. Brooklyn <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/police-searching-for-information-on-bushwick-hit-and-run-that-killed-a-pedestrian>has the highest number of pedestrian injuries in New York City so far this year, with 228 hurt and two killed through June</a>.</p><h2 id=what-has-council-member-nurse-done>What Has Council Member Nurse Done?</h2><p>Council Member Sandy Nurse has backed some steps. She voted to remove abandoned vehicles blocking sightlines, co-sponsored bills for better lighting, and supported senior bike share discounts. She voted to require taxi warning decals about dooring. She co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, but the bill is stalled. She has not led on lowering speed limits or redesigning deadly corridors. The pace is slow. The danger is fast.</p><h2 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next? No More Waiting</h2><p>Every day of delay is another risk. Call Council Member Nurse. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand real street redesigns, not just studies and stickers. The dead cannot wait. The living should not have to.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
