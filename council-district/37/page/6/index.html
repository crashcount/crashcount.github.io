A burgundy Ford Explorer hits him. The driver does not stop. The man dies in the street. This is not rare. In the last twelve months, three people died and 22 suffered serious injuries in District 37. Pedestrians, cyclists, and children pay the price.</p><p>A 71-year-old woman, crossing Knickerbocker Avenue, is crushed and left unconscious. A 59-year-old man, walking with the signal at Wyckoff and DeKalb, is struck by a van making a right turn. He does not get up. These are not accidents. They are the result of choices, speed, and streets built for cars, not people.</p><h2 id=the-numbers-relentless-and-unforgiving>The Numbers: Relentless and Unforgiving</h2><p>In just three years, District 37 saw 8 deaths and 43 serious injuries from crashes. More than 3,100 people were hurt. Cars and trucks caused most of the pain: 1 killed, 99 moderately hurt, 6 seriously injured. Motorcycles and mopeds left 2 seriously hurt. Bikes left 1 seriously hurt. The numbers do not lie. The bodies pile up. The city moves on.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-and-silence>Leadership: Action and Silence</h2><p>Council Member Sandy Nurse has not been silent. Nurse co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed protected bike lanes, and expand Open Streets. Nurse called out the city&rsquo;s failure to remove plateless, untraceable cars, warning, &ldquo;Cars with ghost plates are a risk to public safety&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/16/no-license-plates-no-problem-scofflaw-drivers-remove-tags-from-cars-and-rarely-get-caught>warned</a>). Nurse voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that blamed victims instead of drivers. But the carnage continues. Every delay, every loophole, every half-measure means another family shattered.</p><p>A man is killed crossing Fulton Street. The driver flees. The news repeats: &ldquo;The vehicle did not remain on the scene&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-fatal-hit-run-police-searching-driver-55-year-old-man-fatally-struck-car-cypress-hills/16447158/>reported</a>).</p><h2 id=what-next-demand-more-demand-now>What Next: Demand More, Demand Now</h2><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call your council member. Demand daylighting at every intersection. Demand protected bike lanes and lower speed limits. Demand the city use the power it has. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter, titled 'Advocates Warn Against Further Delays on Commercial Waste Zones,' drew sharp criticism after the Department of Sanitation granted private carters a three-month extension to comply with new requirements. Nurse stated, 'Our communities cannot afford any more delays.' Advocates and Families for Safe Streets highlighted the deadly toll: reckless commercial haulers have killed more than two dozen people in recent years. The reform aims to cut truck traffic, reduce pollution, and require life-saving side guards on heavy trucks by 2024. Lauren Pine, a crash survivor, said, 'Commercial waste zone reform can not come fast enough.' The hearing underscored that every delay keeps vulnerable New Yorkers at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The group, including Council Members Jennifer Gutierrez, Crystal Hudson, Chi Osse, Sandy Nurse, Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Rita Joseph, and Farah Louis, demands that developers seeking zoning changes first apply for a special permit to waive parking requirements.

Reynoso added, 'You don't need to do that anymore.' Avilés called parking mandates a barrier to affordable housing and climate action. The group argues that parking minimums raise construction costs, encourage car use, and block green space. Restler warned he is 'far more likely to vote no' on projects without a parking waiver.
