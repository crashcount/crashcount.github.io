A gray Ford hit him and kept going. He died at Brookdale Hospital. The driver did not stop. Police are still looking. It was the second hit-and-run in the city that day. As of July, <strong>55 pedestrians have been killed crossing city streets this year</strong>. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/04/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-man-36-in-brooklyn-crash/>The driver of the Ford sped off, never stopping, cops said. He remained at large on Saturday.</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, District 37 saw <strong>3 deaths and 22 serious injuries</strong> from crashes. <strong>884 people were hurt</strong>. The numbers do not slow. They do not care about age. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash data</a></p><h3 id=the-shape-of-danger-who-pays-the-price>The Shape of Danger: Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars did the most harm.</strong> They caused the most injuries and deaths to people on foot. Trucks and buses followed. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes also left scars, but the weight of steel and speed is what kills. The stories repeat. A 71-year-old woman, crossing Knickerbocker Avenue, was killed by a driver who ran the light and sped. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash data</a></p><h3 id=council-member-sandy-nurse-record-and-responsibility>Council Member Sandy Nurse: Record and Responsibility</h3><p>Council Member Sandy Nurse has backed bills to make streets safer. She voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished walkers instead of drivers. She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, pushed for more protected bike lanes, and supported daylighting—banning parking near crosswalks to clear sightlines. But the pace is slow. The deaths keep coming. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so. The law sits. The streets bleed.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-demand-now>Call to Action: Demand More, Demand Now</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of loss.</strong> Call Council Member Nurse. Call the Mayor. Tell them to use the laws they have. Lower the speed. Build the barriers. Protect the crossings. Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/04/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-man-36-in-brooklyn-crash/>The victim was crossing near the Broadway Junction near the corner of Broadway and East New York Ave. in Ocean Hill at about 10 p.m. Thursday when a gray Ford rammed into him.</a></p><p><strong>Act now.

Holden (primary sponsor), Ari Kagan, Justin L. Brannan, Jennifer Gutiérrez, Sandy Nurse, Kalman Yeger, Rita C. Joseph, and Tiffany Cabán sponsored the bill. It would have required DOT to audit the city’s deadliest intersections and consider installing leading pedestrian intervals and exclusive pedestrian phases—signals proven to protect people on foot.
