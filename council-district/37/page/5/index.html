Brooklyn Streets Are Killing Fields—Who Will Stop the Bloodshed?</h1><p class="byline f6 silver">Written June 4, 2025 <em>(Revised June 10, 2025 – Fixed broken link, cleaned citations)</em></p></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>District 37: Jan 1, 2022 - Jun 8, 2025</h2><h2 id=the-toll-lives-lost-bodies-broken>The Toll: Lives Lost, Bodies Broken</h2><p>A man steps into the crosswalk in Cypress Hills. A burgundy Ford Explorer hits him. The driver does not stop. The man dies in the street. This is not rare. In the last twelve months, three people died and 22 suffered serious injuries in District 37. Pedestrians, cyclists, and children pay the price.</p><p>A 71-year-old woman, crossing Knickerbocker Avenue, is crushed and left unconscious. A 59-year-old man, walking with the signal at Wyckoff and DeKalb, is struck by a van making a right turn. He does not get up. These are not accidents. They are the result of choices, speed, and streets built for cars, not people.</p><h2 id=the-numbers-relentless-and-unforgiving>The Numbers: Relentless and Unforgiving</h2><p>In just over three years, District 37 saw 8 deaths and 43 serious injuries from crashes. More than 3,166 people were hurt. Cars and trucks caused most of the pain: 1 killed, 99 moderately hurt, 6 seriously injured. Motorcycles and mopeds left 2 seriously hurt. Bikes left 1 seriously hurt. The numbers do not lie. The bodies pile up. The city moves on.</p><p>The toll grows. 5,948 crashes. 3,166 injuries. Children, elders, workers. The numbers rise, the faces blur. The city keeps counting.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-and-silence>Leadership: Action and Silence</h2><p>Council Member Sandy Nurse has not been silent. Nurse co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed protected bike lanes, and expand Open Streets. Nurse called out the city&rsquo;s failure to remove plateless, untraceable cars, warning, &ldquo;Cars with ghost plates are a risk to public safety&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/16/no-license-plates-no-problem-scofflaw-drivers-remove-tags-from-cars-and-rarely-get-caught>warned Nurse</a>). Nurse voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that blamed victims instead of drivers. But the carnage continues. Every delay, every loophole, every half-measure means another family shattered.</p><p>A man is killed crossing Fulton Street. The driver flees. The news repeats: &ldquo;The vehicle did not remain on the scene&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-fatal-hit-run-police-searching-driver-55-year-old-man-fatally-struck-car-cypress-hills/16447158/>reported ABC7</a>).</p><h2 id=what-next-demand-more-demand-now>What Next: Demand More, Demand Now</h2><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call your council member. Demand daylighting at every intersection. Demand protected bike lanes and lower speed limits. Demand the city use the power it has. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Council Member Lincoln Restler led as primary sponsor, joined by Gutiérrez, Cabán, Farías, Hudson, Hanif, Richardson Jordan, Ayala, Nurse, Avilés, Won, and Brewer. The task force would have reviewed costs, locations, funding, and fire risks tied to lithium-ion batteries.

Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by Schulman, Brewer, Dinowitz, Krishnan, Narcisse, Menin, Yeger, Avilés, Nurse, Gutiérrez, Riley, Brannan, Sanchez, and Louis. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not advance. Broken curbs are a daily threat to pedestrians, especially the elderly and disabled. The bill would have forced the city to address these hazards as part of routine work, but the effort stalled.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0501-2022 was introduced to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on June 2, 2022. The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to hazardous obstruction by vehicles and civilian complaints to the department of transportation for hazardous obstruction violations,' aimed to create a new civil penalty for vehicles blocking bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or hydrants within 1,320 feet of a school. The penalty: $175 per violation, enforced through the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings. Civilians, except city employees, could file complaints and receive 25% of collected fines. The Department of Transportation would support this with a phased-in reporting program and annual public reports. Council Member Carlina Rivera led as primary sponsor, joined by over two dozen co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law.

Council Member Christopher Marte led as primary sponsor, joined by Restler, Brewer, Joseph, Nurse, Cabán, Avilés, Bottcher, Won, Ossé, and Richardson Jordan, plus the Brooklyn Borough President.

It was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote.
