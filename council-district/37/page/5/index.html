A car hit him at Broadway and Suydam, dragged him more than 50 feet, and left him in the street. The driver fled. Police have not named the man. They are still looking for the car. The city is still waiting. Police <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/police-searching-for-information-on-bushwick-hit-and-run-that-killed-a-pedestrian>were looking on Monday for the driver of a car that struck and dragged a 47-year-old man on a Brooklyn street over the weekend, killing him</a>.</p><p>This is not rare. In the last 12 months, District 37 saw 6 deaths and 24 serious injuries in nearly 2,000 crashes. Over 1,000 people were hurt. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, sons, daughters. Some were walking. Some were riding. Some were just trying to cross the street.</p><h2 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h2><p>Brooklyn leads the city in pedestrian injuries. The city knows the danger. The council knows. Still, the streets stay the same. The cars keep coming. The bodies keep falling. Brooklyn <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/police-searching-for-information-on-bushwick-hit-and-run-that-killed-a-pedestrian>has the highest number of pedestrian injuries in New York City so far this year, with 228 hurt and two killed through June</a>.</p><h2 id=what-has-council-member-nurse-done>What Has Council Member Nurse Done?</h2><p>Council Member Sandy Nurse has backed some steps. She voted to remove abandoned vehicles blocking sightlines, co-sponsored bills for better lighting, and supported senior bike share discounts. She voted to require taxi warning decals about dooring. She co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, but the bill is stalled. She has not led on lowering speed limits or redesigning deadly corridors. The pace is slow. The danger is fast.</p><h2 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next? No More Waiting</h2><p>Every day of delay is another risk. Call Council Member Nurse. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand real street redesigns, not just studies and stickers. The dead cannot wait. The living should not have to.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The impact occurred at the center back end of the taxi and the center front end of the sedan, crumpling metal severely. A 25-year-old woman, seated in the left rear passenger seat of the taxi and wearing a lap belt, sustained crushing injuries to her entire body and remained still, held by shock. The report lists no specific driver errors but the collision’s nature—a sedan hitting a stopped vehicle from behind—indicates a failure to prevent rear-end collisions. Both vehicles were traveling east, with the taxi stopped and the sedan moving straight ahead. No contributing factors were specified for either driver. The focus is on the violent impact and the severe harm inflicted on the passenger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The report states the vehicle's center front end hit the pedestrian's head, causing severe lacerations and leaving him bleeding but conscious on the pavement. The driver of the SUV held only a learner’s permit at the time of the crash, as documented in the police report. The report does not specify any additional driver errors or contributing factors beyond the driver’s license status. The pedestrian was not at an intersection and was crossing without a signal or crosswalk, but the police report does not list these as contributing factors—only as the location and action. The collision underscores the dangers faced by pedestrians on city streets, especially when drivers lack full licensure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Prime sponsor Joann Ariola, joined by sixteen co-sponsors, pushes for at least 25 step streets to be lit each year until all are covered.

The report states the pedestrian was hit in the chest by the bumper and suffered crush injuries. The incident occurred in late morning. Police data lists 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as a contributing factor on the part of the driver. The pedestrian was crossing with no signal present, as noted in the report, but the primary driver error cited is failure to yield. The narrative describes no warning, no sound, and a sudden, violent impact. The focus remains on the driver’s actions and the systemic danger present at the intersection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
