Brooklyn Streets Are Killing Fields—Who Will Stop the Bloodshed?</h1><p class="byline f6 silver">Written June 4, 2025 <em>(Revised June 7, 2025 – Fixed broken link, cleaned citations)</em></p></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>District 37: Jan 1, 2022 - Jun 8, 2025</h2><h2 id=the-toll-lives-lost-bodies-broken>The Toll: Lives Lost, Bodies Broken</h2><p>A man steps into the crosswalk in Cypress Hills. A burgundy Ford Explorer hits him. The driver does not stop. The man dies in the street. This is not rare. In the last twelve months, three people died and 22 suffered serious injuries in District 37. Pedestrians, cyclists, and children pay the price.</p><p>A 71-year-old woman, crossing Knickerbocker Avenue, is crushed and left unconscious. A 59-year-old man, walking with the signal at Wyckoff and DeKalb, is struck by a van making a right turn. He does not get up. These are not accidents. They are the result of choices, speed, and streets built for cars, not people.</p><h2 id=the-numbers-relentless-and-unforgiving>The Numbers: Relentless and Unforgiving</h2><p>In just over three years, District 37 saw 8 deaths and 43 serious injuries from crashes. More than 3,166 people were hurt. Cars and trucks caused most of the pain: 1 killed, 99 moderately hurt, 6 seriously injured. Motorcycles and mopeds left 2 seriously hurt. Bikes left 1 seriously hurt. The numbers do not lie. The bodies pile up. The city moves on.</p><p>The toll grows. 5,948 crashes. 3,166 injuries. Children, elders, workers. The numbers rise, the faces blur. The city keeps counting.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-and-silence>Leadership: Action and Silence</h2><p>Council Member Sandy Nurse has not been silent. Nurse co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed protected bike lanes, and expand Open Streets. Nurse called out the city&rsquo;s failure to remove plateless, untraceable cars, warning, &ldquo;Cars with ghost plates are a risk to public safety&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/16/no-license-plates-no-problem-scofflaw-drivers-remove-tags-from-cars-and-rarely-get-caught>warned Nurse</a>). Nurse voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that blamed victims instead of drivers. But the carnage continues. Every delay, every loophole, every half-measure means another family shattered.</p><p>A man is killed crossing Fulton Street. The driver flees. The news repeats: &ldquo;The vehicle did not remain on the scene&rdquo; (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-fatal-hit-run-police-searching-driver-55-year-old-man-fatally-struck-car-cypress-hills/16447158/>reported ABC7</a>).</p><h2 id=what-next-demand-more-demand-now>What Next: Demand More, Demand Now</h2><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call your council member. Demand daylighting at every intersection. Demand protected bike lanes and lower speed limits. Demand the city use the power it has. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, introduced on September 1, 2023, is under review and has drawn support from some council members known for opposing cycling infrastructure. The matter summary states: 'require the NYC Department of Transportation to register all legal electric bikes, stand-up scooters, and other legal motorized vehicles, and issue license plates for them.' David Carr is mentioned in connection with the bill. Major advocacy groups, including StreetsPAC, Open Plans, and Transportation Alternatives, strongly oppose the measure, warning it would hinder Citi Bike use, block sustainable commuting, and target nonwhite delivery workers. Critics say the bill ignores illegal mopeds, lacks funding, and risks racially biased enforcement.

The bill, introduced on September 1, 2023, has support from council members often hostile to cycling infrastructure. The matter summary states the bill targets 'all legal electric bikes, stand-up scooters, and other legal motorized vehicles.' Holden leads the push, while Council Member Sandy Nurse supports debate but not the bill itself. Major advocacy groups—StreetsPAC, Open Plans, and Transportation Alternatives—oppose the measure, warning it would 'sabotage mode shift while targeting nonwhite delivery workers' and 'create additional hurdles for low-income New Yorkers.' The bill does not address illegal mopeds, lacks funding, and omits enforcement details. DOT is reviewing the proposal. Critics say it will reduce cycling, worsen equity, and undermine safety for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Jen Gutierrez carried the resolution; Selvena Brooks-Powers later signed on. The bill targets corridors like Bushwick Avenue, Laurelton Parkway, and East Gun Hill Road—sites of hundreds of crashes and dozens killed or maimed since 2019. The matter summary states: 'Because people are dying and being maimed on New York's most-dangerous 25-mile-per-hour streets.' Supporters, including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, cite the science: lower speeds mean less force, fewer deaths. Research shows 20 mph zones cut crashes by 60 percent.

Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0549-2023, filed at session’s end, came from the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. It was introduced April 11, 2023, and pushed by Council Member Shahana K. Hanif as primary sponsor, with Jennifer Gutiérrez and over twenty others co-sponsoring. The resolution urged the State Legislature and Governor to pass S.2422 ('Sammy’s Law'), which would let New York City set lower speed limits, and A.1901, a crash victims bill of rights. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.2422, also known as ‘Sammy’s Law,’ ... and A.1901, enacting a crash victims bill of rights, as well as the other bills of the package known as the SAFE Streets Act.' The SAFE Streets Act package also includes safe passing for cyclists and complete street design mandates. The Council’s action highlights the city’s ongoing fight against reckless driving and the urgent need for stronger protections for people on foot, on bikes, and in cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city’s most vulnerable remain at risk.</p><p class=mb3>On February 23, 2023, the City Council held an oversight hearing on the delayed rollout of commercial waste zone reform, first mandated by law in 2019. The Department of Sanitation (DSNY) admitted the overhaul would not start until late 2024, with citywide coverage years away. The matter, described as a fix for a 'free-for-all system that led to reckless driving and fatalities,' remains stalled. Council Members Lincoln Restler and Julie Menin pressed DSNY Commissioner Jessica Tisch on the slow pace and shifting deadlines. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, who introduced the original legislation, stressed the need for clear guidance. StreetsPAC’s Eric McClure highlighted the deadly consequences of delay. DSNY opposes a bill from Council Member Sandy Nurse to create a working group to address these setbacks. The ongoing delay leaves vulnerable road users exposed to dangerous private carting trucks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
