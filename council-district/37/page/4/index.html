A gray Ford hit him and kept going. He died at Brookdale Hospital. The driver did not stop. Police are still looking. It was the second hit-and-run in the city that day. As of July, <strong>55 pedestrians have been killed crossing city streets this year</strong>. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/04/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-man-36-in-brooklyn-crash/>The driver of the Ford sped off, never stopping, cops said. He remained at large on Saturday.</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, District 37 saw <strong>3 deaths and 22 serious injuries</strong> from crashes. <strong>884 people were hurt</strong>. The numbers do not slow. They do not care about age. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash data</a></p><h3 id=the-shape-of-danger-who-pays-the-price>The Shape of Danger: Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars did the most harm.</strong> They caused the most injuries and deaths to people on foot. Trucks and buses followed. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes also left scars, but the weight of steel and speed is what kills. The stories repeat. A 71-year-old woman, crossing Knickerbocker Avenue, was killed by a driver who ran the light and sped. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash data</a></p><h3 id=council-member-sandy-nurse-record-and-responsibility>Council Member Sandy Nurse: Record and Responsibility</h3><p>Council Member Sandy Nurse has backed bills to make streets safer. She voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished walkers instead of drivers. She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, pushed for more protected bike lanes, and supported daylighting—banning parking near crosswalks to clear sightlines. But the pace is slow. The deaths keep coming. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so. The law sits. The streets bleed.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-demand-now>Call to Action: Demand More, Demand Now</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of loss.</strong> Call Council Member Nurse. Call the Mayor. Tell them to use the laws they have. Lower the speed. Build the barriers. Protect the crossings. Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/04/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-man-36-in-brooklyn-crash/>The victim was crossing near the Broadway Junction near the corner of Broadway and East New York Ave. in Ocean Hill at about 10 p.m. Thursday when a gray Ford rammed into him.</a></p><p><strong>Act now.

Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers. It shifts blame from people on foot to the system and those behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The impact was severe: 'A Jeep slammed into a northbound moped. The 65-year-old rider flew from the seat, struck the pavement headfirst. Blood pooled in the street. The SUV’s front end folded. He died there.' The moped rider, a 65-year-old man, was killed instantly, suffering fatal head injuries after being ejected from his vehicle. The police report notes the SUV driver was unlicensed, with a license from Georgia that was not valid in New York. No driver errors beyond 'unspecified' are listed, but the unlicensed status is a critical systemic failure. Helmet use is mentioned only to note its absence, after the primary driver error. The crash underscores the lethal consequences when unlicensed drivers operate vehicles on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
