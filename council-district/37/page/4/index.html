Mandates linger in outer areas. Progress, but not full victory. Some districts carved out exceptions. Housing and parking no longer clash in core neighborhoods. Vulnerable road users still face cars in many places.</p><p class=mb3>""A spokesperson for Council Member Sandy Nurse (D Brownsville) said her entire district is in the 'outer transit zone' because the Council's 'compromise [was] shaped by amendments from our district’s community boards.' 'It wasn't something that was pushed for specifically by Council Member Nurse,' spokesperson Patricia Santana told Streetsblog." -- Sandy Nurse</p><p class=mb3>On February 26, 2025, the City Council approved Mayor Adams's 'City of Yes' rezoning. The bill divided the city into zones: the Manhattan core, an inner transit zone with no parking mandates, an outer transit zone with reduced mandates, and areas beyond where mandates mostly remain. The matter summary states, 'The final plan did not eliminate parking mandates citywide but divided the city into zones.' Council Member Crystal Hudson pushed to eliminate mandates in all her districts. Council Member Shahana Hanif opposed carve-outs. Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez called parking mandates 'a concession to cars that we don’t need and can’t afford.' Council Member Sandy Nurse’s district saw mandates shaped by community board amendments, not her advocacy. Dan Garodnick, Department of City Planning chair, said, 'parking and housing are no longer coming into conflict in the parts of New York City that are well-served by transit.' The bill passed after compromises, leaving mandates in some areas and progress in others.

The child did not cry.' The child suffered severe lacerations and was listed as semiconscious, with injuries to his entire body. The police report lists 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a contributing factor. No driver errors such as failure to yield or distraction are cited in the data. The child was not in a crosswalk at the time of impact, as noted in the report, but the focus remains on the devastating outcome of the collision between a van and a vulnerable pedestrian.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

According to the police report, 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' was cited as the primary contributing factor for both individuals. The narrative notes, 'Distraction rode with them through the dark.' No other vehicles were involved, and no victim behaviors were listed as contributing factors beyond the mention of helmet use after driver distraction.
