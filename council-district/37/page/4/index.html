Twenty-four left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. In the last year alone, District 37 saw 1,612 crashes, 907 injuries, and 3 deaths, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. The numbers are blunt. The pain is sharper. A 71-year-old woman, crossing Knickerbocker and Eldert, never made it to the other side. A 59-year-old man, walking with the light on Wyckoff, was struck and killed by a van. A 55-year-old man, crossing Fulton in Cypress Hills, was hit by a Ford Explorer. The driver fled. The street kept its silence.</p><p>Police said, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/brooklyn-hit-and-run-driver-wanted-after-striking-man-in-street/>&ldquo;the man was crossing the street in Cypress Hills when he was hit by a burgundy Ford Explorer.&rdquo;</a> The car did not stop. The man died at the hospital.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Council Member Sandy Nurse has signed her name to bills that matter. She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, pushed for protected bike lanes, and voted to end jaywalking enforcement—removing a law that too often blamed the dead instead of the driver. She called out the city&rsquo;s failure to remove ghost cars: <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/16/no-license-plates-no-problem-scofflaw-drivers-remove-tags-from-cars-and-rarely-get-caught>&ldquo;Cars with ghost plates are a risk to public safety.&rdquo;</a> But bills alone do not save lives. Many measures sit in committee. Promises pile up. The danger does not wait.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>Most injuries and deaths come from cars and trucks. In three years, SUVs and sedans killed at least one person and seriously injured six more. Trucks and buses killed two. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left more bodies broken. The street does not care what you ride or drive. It only cares who is left standing.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-the-choice-is-ours>What Comes Next: The Choice Is Ours</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every day the city delays, another family risks losing someone. Call Council Member Nurse. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action, not just words. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Council Members Shaun Abreu and Sandy Nurse raised alarms, asking, 'how the city awarded a contract to a company with a history of endangering workers to begin with.' Cogent’s trucks have killed one, injured four, and racked up hundreds of violations. Despite this, DSNY allowed Cogent to win contracts in four waste zones. DSNY Deputy Commissioner Joshua Goodman defended the process, stating, 'Safety was absolutely one of the weighted factors,' and promised, 'there will be consequences for lack of compliance.' The oversight hearing exposes a system that lets reckless firms operate, even as new rules loom.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states, 'Traffic control was ignored,' identifying 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as the primary contributing factor. Both vehicles were traveling straight ahead when they collided. The police narrative makes clear that the drivers' failure to obey traffic controls directly led to the deadly collision. No information in the report attributes any contributing behavior to the victim. The crash underscores the lethal consequences when drivers disregard basic traffic rules, leaving passengers and bystanders exposed to catastrophic harm.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Prime sponsor Joann Ariola leads, joined by Council Members Hanks, Ayala, Salaam, Brooks-Powers, Banks, Restler, Brannan, Ung, Gutiérrez, Louis, Hudson, Schulman, Ossé, Krishnan, Nurse, Moya, and Marmorato. Step streets are public staircases linking streets at different heights. The bill aims to ensure these stairs are well-lit, reducing risk for walkers. Once all step streets are lit, the mandate ends.
