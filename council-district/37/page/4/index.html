The report states the pedestrian was standing outside the crosswalk when the collision occurred. The pickup, a 2017 Dodge, struck the man with its right front bumper, causing severe lacerations to his hip and upper leg. According to the police report, the primary contributing factor was 'Backing Unsafely,' with 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' also cited. The pedestrian’s actions or location are mentioned only as context; the report does not list any pedestrian behavior as a contributing factor. The focus remains on the driver’s unsafe backing and lack of attention, which led to the injury.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
