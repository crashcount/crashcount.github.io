It hit a woman in the crosswalk, then jumped the curb and mowed down five more. The driver and passenger ran. Six people went to the hospital. &ldquo;People were yelling, were in pain, so yelling, crying, it was very upsetting,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/03/us-news/6-pedestrians-struck-by-ford-mustang-that-crashed-into-nyc-scaffolding-before-driver-passenger-flee/>said Vivian Cole</a>.

The street is not safe for anyone on foot. The numbers do not lie: in three years, 16 people killed, 56 left with serious injuries, and thousands more scraped, broken, or bruised (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>Council Member Diana Ayala has signed on to bills that matter. She backed the law to end jaywalking tickets, giving people the right to cross where they need to (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>see vote</a>). She co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, to clear sightlines for people on foot (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>see bill</a>). She pushed for more lighting on step streets, and for curb extensions to shorten the distance a child or elder must cross. But bills can sit in committee while people bleed in the street. The Mustang that hit six people did not wait for a hearing.</p><p>&ldquo;We thought it was a bomb or something, because we are all panicking around here,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>said Christina Sieh</a>. The fear is real. The danger is daily.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Ayala. Tell her to fight for faster action, not just more studies. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand that the city stop blaming the people who walk and start protecting them. The next crash is coming. <strong>Do not wait until it is your family.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Mayor Eric Adams said, "there’s going to be a whole rule making process to make sure that we comply and follow the laws." Critics argue the plan singles out e-bikes while ignoring faster, heavier vehicles. Ben Furans of Transportation Alternatives called it "half-baked and ill-conceived," noting that "bikes and cars sharing the same road would be subject to different speed limits and consequences." Janet Schroeder of the E-Bike Safety Alliance doubts the rule will matter without real enforcement.

The article details heated opposition from local residents and bus riders, who argued the plan was rushed and lacked proper traffic analysis. Stacy Rauch, a daily bus rider, said, 'The bigger problem is we don’t have enough buses.' Critics worried diverted car traffic would overwhelm nearby streets. The city compared the move to the 14th Street car ban, but residents noted differences in bus frequency. The article highlights accusations of conflicts of interest involving community board members and advocacy groups. The policy aims to prioritize buses and vulnerable road users, but leaves open questions about implementation and neighborhood impact.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

After hitting Esiyok, Ali continued, injuring a cyclist, two more pedestrians, and crashing into a van.
