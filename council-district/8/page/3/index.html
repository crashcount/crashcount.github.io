It hit a woman in the crosswalk, then jumped the curb and mowed down five more. The driver and passenger ran. Six people went to the hospital. &ldquo;People were yelling, were in pain, so yelling, crying, it was very upsetting,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/03/us-news/6-pedestrians-struck-by-ford-mustang-that-crashed-into-nyc-scaffolding-before-driver-passenger-flee/>said Vivian Cole</a>.

The street is not safe for anyone on foot. The numbers do not lie: in three years, 16 people killed, 56 left with serious injuries, and thousands more scraped, broken, or bruised (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>Council Member Diana Ayala has signed on to bills that matter. She backed the law to end jaywalking tickets, giving people the right to cross where they need to (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>see vote</a>). She co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, to clear sightlines for people on foot (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>see bill</a>). She pushed for more lighting on step streets, and for curb extensions to shorten the distance a child or elder must cross. But bills can sit in committee while people bleed in the street. The Mustang that hit six people did not wait for a hearing.</p><p>&ldquo;We thought it was a bomb or something, because we are all panicking around here,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>said Christina Sieh</a>. The fear is real. The danger is daily.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Ayala. Tell her to fight for faster action, not just more studies. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand that the city stop blaming the people who walk and start protecting them. The next crash is coming. <strong>Do not wait until it is your family.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill is 'Laid Over in Committee.' Its title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting standing or parking a vehicle within 20 feet of a crosswalk at an intersection.' Council Member Erik D. Bottcher is the primary sponsor, joined by Julie Won, Jumaane Williams, and others. The bill prohibits standing or parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and mandates the Department of Transportation to install daylighting barriers at a minimum of 1,000 intersections per year. The law also requires citywide outreach and reporting. This measure aims to keep sightlines clear at crossings, a known danger zone for people on foot and bike.

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable.
