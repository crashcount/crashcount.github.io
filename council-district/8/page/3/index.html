Fifty-six left with serious injuries.</strong> In District 8, the numbers only hint at the pain. In the last twelve months, seven people died. Over a thousand were hurt. Some were children. Some were old. All were walking, riding, or just trying to cross the street.</p><p>A man named Willow Hall tried to cross Harlem River Drive before dawn. He never made it. An unlicensed driver in a black SUV hit him. The driver stayed. The police waited six months to charge him. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/unlicensed-suv-driver-arrested-6-months-after-killing-east-harlem-pedestrian/>&ldquo;Donald Pinnock was charged Sunday with aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle.&rdquo;</a></p><p>A few blocks away, a pedestrian was killed on the RFK Bridge. The driver did not stop. The city called it a hit-and-run. The man died alone on the road. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/rfk-bridge-pedestrian-struck-person-killed-apparent-hit-run-driver-nyc/16636349/>&ldquo;The vehicle fled from the scene, and no arrests have been made.&rdquo;</a></p><h2 id=the-vehicles-that-kill>The Vehicles That Kill</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars did the most harm.</strong> Five deaths. Eleven serious injuries. Trucks and buses killed two. Motorcycles and mopeds killed one. Bikes killed one. The rest were left broken, some for life. The street does not care what you drive. But the bigger the vehicle, the harder it hits.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-done-what-has-not>What Has Been Done, What Has Not</h2><p>Council Member Diana Ayala has signed on to bills that matter. She voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that blamed the dead for crossing the street. She co-sponsored a bill to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a> to keep sightlines clear. She backed a <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>citywide greenway plan</a> and pushed for <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>better lighting on step streets</a>. She has not stood in the way. But the blood on the street says it is not enough.</p><p><strong>The city moves slow. The dead do not wait.</strong></p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>Call Council Member Ayala. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand the city stop blaming the dead.</strong> Every day you wait is another day someone does not come home. The street remembers. So should you.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
