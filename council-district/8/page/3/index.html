She co-sponsored a bill to daylight intersections—no more hiding behind parked cars. She backed a law to curb repeat speeders. These are steps. But the pace is slow. The city still waits for protected bike lanes and safer crossings. <strong>&ldquo;New York City is on pace to see the deadliest year for bike riders since 1999,&rdquo;</strong> Ayala and others <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/nyc-on-pace-for-deadliest-year-for-bike-riders-since-1999-study/>warned last fall</a>.</p><h2 id=the-work-left-to-do>The Work Left to Do</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars killed five.

Demand daylighted intersections, protected bike lanes, and a 20 mph speed limit.</strong> The blood on the street is not an accident. It is policy. It is delay. It is silence.

The article quotes his sister-in-law: "He was going to buy socks. That's why he crossed the street." Police told the family that after the initial impact, two more vehicles struck Fofana. The driver remained at the scene and faced no immediate charges. Family members called for more safety measures at the busy intersection, noting, "There has to be a cross guard over there for the pedestrian to cross the street safely."

The chase ended near Dyckman Street when the car slammed into a building and caught fire. The officers 'approached the burning SUV but then left without helping the driver or calling for an ambulance.' They did not report the crash. Both have been suspended while the Force Investigation Division and Attorney General review their actions. The incident follows a February NYPD policy change barring pursuits for non-violent crimes. Commissioner Jessica Tisch said, 'The NYPD's enforcement efforts must never put the public or the police at undue risk.' NYPD data shows one in four pursuits last year led to crashes or injuries.
