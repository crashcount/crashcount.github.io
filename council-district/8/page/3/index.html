Over a thousand injured.</strong> In the last twelve months, District 8 has seen 1,065 people hurt and 7 killed in crashes. Twenty more were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. The numbers do not lie. The pain is not abstract.</p><p>On January 26, Willow Hall tried to cross Harlem River Drive. He never made it. An unlicensed driver in a Nissan Rogue struck him down. The driver stayed at the scene, but it took police six months to bring charges. &ldquo;Donald Pinnock was charged Sunday with aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/unlicensed-suv-driver-arrested-6-months-after-killing-east-harlem-pedestrian/>reported NY Daily News</a>.

The moped driver fled. &ldquo;Police said the moped driver sped away from the 3:45 a.m. crash&mldr; leaving the young woman to die on the road,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/21/woman-passenger-18-clings-to-life-after-falling-off-moped-in-bronx-crash-driver-speeds-off/>wrote NY Daily News</a>.

Trucks and buses killed 2. Motorcycles and mopeds killed 1. Bikes killed 1. The deadliest machines keep rolling. The most vulnerable keep paying.</p><p>Council Member Diana Ayala has backed bills to daylight crosswalks, light step streets, and expand greenways. She voted yes to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the desperate and the poor. But the bleeding has not stopped. The bills are slow. The streets are not.</p><h2 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another family broken.</strong> Call Council Member Ayala.
