Brooks-Powers (District 31) highlighted the deadly toll facing cyclists in New York City. The event, covered by amny.com, cited a study showing 25 bike riders killed since January, making this the deadliest year for cyclists since 1999. The matter summary states: 'New York City is on pace to see the deadliest year for bike riders since 1999.' Brooks-Powers stressed the urgent need for investments in street infrastructure, especially in outer-borough communities. She joined advocates and fellow Council Member Diana Ayala in demanding the city fulfill legal requirements to build safe streets. The analysis found 94% of cyclist deaths occurred on streets without protected bike lanes. Activists and analysts called for immediate action to fast track the NYC Streets Plan and expand protected lanes, noting that only 3% of city streets have them, despite an 18.1% drop in injuries and deaths where they exist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No more penalties for jaywalking. The measure aimed to strip state law and let pedestrians move freely. The session ended before action. Vulnerable users remain exposed.</p><p class=mb3>Int 1125-2023, introduced July 13, 2023, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, sought to amend city law on pedestrian crossing and right of way. The bill stated: “Pedestrians may cross any roadway at any point, including outside of a marked or unmarked crosswalk, and allow for crossing against traffic signals. It would legalize the activity commonly referred to as ‘jaywalking’ and specify that no penalties can be imposed for jaywalking.” Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by Narcisse, Won, Farías, Hanif, Ayala, Richardson Jordan, Krishnan, and Nurse. The bill superseded state law and removed penalties for pedestrian movement. Filed at session’s end, it did not advance. Vulnerable road users still face the same risks at crossings.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
