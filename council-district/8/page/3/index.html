Sixty-one suffered serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, six more lives were lost, and twenty-two more were left with wounds that do not heal.

We see people go through these red lights all the time,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said a woman named Nita</a>.

She co-sponsored a <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>bill to ban parking near crosswalks</a>, to keep sightlines clear for people on foot and bike. She voted to decriminalize jaywalking, shifting blame away from those on foot. But the pace is slow.

Every death is a failure.</strong> Call Council Member Ayala. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes, not promises. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
