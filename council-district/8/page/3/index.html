Fifty-seven left with serious injuries.</strong> More than 3,600 hurt since 2022. The dead do not speak, but the street remembers. A 71-year-old woman died in Co-op City after a car driven by a 79-year-old man slammed into two cars and a pole. &ldquo;I saw one lady was out on the ground. They was giving her medical attention,&rdquo; a witness <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/op-city-crash-multiple-people-injured-including-1-critically-bronx/17075710/>said</a>.</p><p>On East 149th, a Mustang jumped the curb and plowed into six people under scaffolding. The driver ran. &ldquo;People were yelling, were in pain, so yelling, crying, it was very upsetting,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>said Vivian Cole</a>.</p><p><strong>Most of the dead are not in cars.</strong> Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt. SUVs and trucks do the most harm, but bikes and mopeds are not spared from the tally. The street does not care who you are, only that you are in its path.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Diana Ayala has voted for laws that matter. She backed the bill that ended jaywalking enforcement, making it clear: <strong>the street belongs to people, not just cars.</strong> She co-sponsored bills for safer lighting, curb extensions, and more daylight at crosswalks. But the pace is slow. Many bills sit in committee. The dead do not wait for hearings.</p><p>Ayala stood with advocates when cyclist deaths spiked. She called for the city to build protected bike lanes, after a year when 94% of cyclist deaths happened on streets without them, according to <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/nyc-on-pace-for-deadliest-year-for-bike-riders-since-1999-study/>amNY</a>.</p><h3 id=the-next-fight-action-not-excuses>The Next Fight: Action, Not Excuses</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> These are not accidents. They are the result of choices—by drivers, by lawmakers, by those who design the street. The council can lower speed limits. It can demand protected bike lanes and daylight every crosswalk. It can fund real enforcement against reckless drivers, not just ticket the desperate and the poor.</p><p><strong>Call Council Member Ayala. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected lanes. Demand action before another name becomes a number.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bus crashed into the wall, leaving it hanging over the edge. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz said, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." No injuries were reported, but the crash caused structural damage and scattered debris below. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz noted, "It speaks to the importance of enforcing our parking rules because it was going around a double-parked car." The incident highlights the danger posed by lax parking enforcement and infrastructure vulnerable to impact.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The family’s attorney called it a “deadly maneuver” for a minor violation. The city later billed Williams’ family for police vehicle damages. The NYPD has not commented, citing litigation.

Council Member Erik D. Bottcher is the primary sponsor, joined by Julie Won, Jumaane Williams, and others.
