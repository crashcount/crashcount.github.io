Paramedics kneel beside her. She does not get up. On July 11, a 79-year-old driver crashed into two cars and a pole in the Bronx. His passenger, Stella Nyarko-Dei, 71, died at Jacobi Hospital. Seven others were hurt. Police said, &ldquo;The cause of the crash was not immediately known&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/13/multi-car-crash-in-the-bronx-kills-71-year-old-woman-injures-seven-others/>according to NY Daily News</a>. No arrests. No answers. The street is quiet again, but the loss remains.</p><p>This is not rare. Since 2022, District 8 has seen <strong>16 deaths and 57 serious injuries</strong> from crashes. <strong>Three children have died.</strong> More than 3,600 people have been hurt. The numbers do not stop. They only grow.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>The killers are not ghosts. They have names: <strong>SUVs, cars, trucks, bikes, mopeds</strong>. SUVs and cars alone caused <strong>five deaths and over 500 injuries</strong> to pedestrians. Trucks and buses killed two. Motorcycles and mopeds, two more. Even bikes have left bodies broken. The street does not care who you are. It only takes.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Diana Ayala has voted for some safety bills. She supported laws that force the city to remove abandoned cars, clear crosswalks, and track street safety projects <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>on NYC Council Legistar</a>. She co-sponsored a bill to curb repeat speeders. But the pace is slow. The deaths are not. In 2023, as bike riders died in record numbers, Ayala stood with advocates and said the city must &ldquo;fulfill legal requirements to build safe streets&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/nyc-on-pace-for-deadliest-year-for-bike-riders-since-1999-study/>reported amny.com</a>. Still, <strong>94% of cyclist deaths happened on streets without protected lanes</strong>. The law is not enough if it stays on paper.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>No more waiting.</strong> Call Council Member Ayala.
