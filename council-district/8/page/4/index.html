A Mercedes changed lanes, struck a Volkswagen, then hit the riders. Both men died at the hospital. Police charged the driver, Mauricio Neyra Yuyes, with vehicular manslaughter and driving while intoxicated. The crash closed the highway for hours. The city detoured traffic. The families got no detour. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/bronx-river-parkway-accident-east-gun-hill-road/>The men were ejected from their scooters and fatally injured in the collision. Both were pronounced dead at the hospital, NYPD said.</a></p><h2 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h2><p><strong>Sixteen people have died on District 8 streets since 2022.</strong> There have been 3,885 injuries and 63 serious injuries. The dead include children, cyclists, and pedestrians. Cars and SUVs killed five. Trucks and buses killed two. Motorcycles and mopeds killed two. Bikes killed one. The rest are lost in the data. Each number is a name erased from a family table.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-delayed>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Delayed</h2><p>Council Member Diana Ayala has voted for and co-sponsored bills to clear abandoned vehicles, daylight crosswalks, and boost street safety transparency. She backed the law to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>remove derelict cars within 72 hours</a>, clearing sightlines for people on foot and bike. She voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>decriminalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the vulnerable. She co-sponsored the bill to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>, but it sits stalled in committee. The city moves slow. The cars do not. <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/multi-vehicle-crash-on-the-bronx-river-parkway/>Neyra Yuyes was arrested on Monday&mldr; He faces a list of charges including vehicular manslaughter, driving while intoxicated and driving while ability impaired.</a></p><h2 id=the-work-left-to-do>The Work Left to Do</h2><p><strong>The carnage continues.</strong> The laws that would save lives gather dust. The streets remain wide, the crossings blind. The next crash waits at the next green light.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand action. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighted crosswalks and protected bike lanes. Demand that every bill to protect the vulnerable gets a vote, not a delay.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bus crashed into the wall, leaving it hanging over the edge. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz said, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." No injuries were reported, but the crash caused structural damage and scattered debris below. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz noted, "It speaks to the importance of enforcing our parking rules because it was going around a double-parked car." The incident highlights the danger posed by lax parking enforcement and infrastructure vulnerable to impact.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
