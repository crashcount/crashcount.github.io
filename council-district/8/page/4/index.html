Twenty-three left with life-changing injuries.</strong> In the past year alone, District 8 has seen 2,275 crashes. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do. A man is killed crossing Harlem River Drive. A child dies on the Major Deegan. A cyclist is thrown from her bike in Washington Heights. The street does not care who you are. It takes the young and the old, the walker and the rider.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a driver hit a cyclist and fled. Neighbors <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said</a>, &ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time.&rdquo; The intersection is a wound that never heals. The city lets it fester.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists bear the brunt.</strong> In three years, 16 people have died. Over 3,800 have been injured. Most were not in cars. Most never stood a chance. SUVs and cars did the most harm—five deaths, over 500 injuries. Trucks and buses killed two. Motorcycles and mopeds, one each. A bike killed one. The rest are numbers in a ledger, but every number is a name, a family, a future cut short.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-done>What Has Been Done?</h2><p>Council Member Diana Ayala has voted for some safety bills. She backed laws to clear abandoned cars from crosswalks, to mark pavement, to force the city to show its progress on safe streets. She <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>voted</a> to decriminalize jaywalking, a law that once punished the walker instead of the driver. She co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, to keep sightlines clear. But the pace is slow. The street is faster.</p><p>When the city dragged its feet on bike lanes, Ayala joined others to demand action. Advocates <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/nyc-on-pace-for-deadliest-year-for-bike-riders-since-1999-study/>warned</a>, &ldquo;New York City is on pace to see the deadliest year for bike riders since 1999.&rdquo; The city has not kept its promise. Most streets still have no protection.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>Every day, the street claims another victim.</strong> The council can act. The mayor can act. But they will not move unless you force them. Call Diana Ayala. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The KIA's front end collided with the Honda's back end, crushing two women inside the KIA—one suffered neck injuries, the other back injuries. Both were conscious after the crash, described as 'crushed against the belts.' The report explicitly notes the KIA driver was unlicensed at the time of the collision. No contributing factors are specified beyond the lack of a valid license. The narrative states, 'A KIA slammed into the back of a Honda. Two women inside crushed against the belts. One’s neck, the other’s back. Both awake. The driver held no license. The street held the rest.' The focus remains on the unlicensed driver and the violent impact that left both occupants injured.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

No injuries were reported, but the crash caused structural damage and scattered debris below. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz noted, "It speaks to the importance of enforcing our parking rules because it was going around a double-parked car."
