The Mustang came fast, hit one in the turn, then five more, then the scaffolding. The driver ran. The pain stayed. “People were yelling, were in pain, so yelling, crying, it was very upsetting,” <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/03/us-news/6-pedestrians-struck-by-ford-mustang-that-crashed-into-nyc-scaffolding-before-driver-passenger-flee/>said Vivian Cole</a>. This was July 3rd. Not last year. Not last month. Yesterday.</p><p>In the last twelve months, District 8 has seen <strong>7 deaths</strong> and <strong>18 serious injuries</strong> from crashes. <strong>1,060 people have been hurt</strong>. The bodies are young and old. Some never make it home. Some never walk again. The numbers do not heal. They only count the cost.</p><h3 id=the-slow-disaster>The Slow Disaster</h3><p>The violence does not stop. In the last three years, <strong>16 people have died</strong> on these streets. <strong>Over 3,400 have been injured</strong>. Cars and trucks do most of the damage—<strong>5 deaths and 11 serious injuries</strong> from SUVs and sedans alone. Trucks and buses killed 2. Motorcycles and mopeds killed 1. Bikes killed 1. No one is safe. Not the child, not the elder, not the person crossing with the light.</p><h3 id=council-member-ayala-steps-and-stalls>Council Member Ayala: Steps and Stalls</h3><p>Council Member Diana Ayala has backed bills to clear sightlines at corners, light up dark stairways, and ban fake plates. She voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that blamed the walker, not the driver. She co-sponsored a bill to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>, but it sits in committee. The danger waits for no one. The law waits.</p><p>The city is slow to build protected bike lanes. Last year was the deadliest for cyclists since 1999. Ayala joined calls to speed up the work. Still, most streets have no protection. “New York City is on pace to see the deadliest year for bike riders since 1999,” <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/nyc-on-pace-for-deadliest-year-for-bike-riders-since-1999-study/>warned advocates</a>.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day of delay is another day of blood on the street. Call Council Member Ayala. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand real protection for people, not cars. <strong>Do not wait for another body.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Council Member Erik D. Bottcher is the primary sponsor, joined by Julie Won, Jumaane Williams, and others. The bill prohibits standing or parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and mandates the Department of Transportation to install daylighting barriers at a minimum of 1,000 intersections per year. The law also requires citywide outreach and reporting. This measure aims to keep sightlines clear at crossings, a known danger zone for people on foot and bike.

Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights.
