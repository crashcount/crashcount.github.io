Paramedics kneel beside her. She does not get up. On July 11, a 79-year-old driver crashed into two cars and a pole in the Bronx. His passenger, Stella Nyarko-Dei, 71, died at Jacobi Hospital. Seven others were hurt. Police said, &ldquo;The cause of the crash was not immediately known&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/13/multi-car-crash-in-the-bronx-kills-71-year-old-woman-injures-seven-others/>according to NY Daily News</a>. No arrests. No answers. The street is quiet again, but the loss remains.</p><p>This is not rare. Since 2022, District 8 has seen <strong>16 deaths and 57 serious injuries</strong> from crashes. <strong>Three children have died.</strong> More than 3,600 people have been hurt. The numbers do not stop. They only grow.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>The killers are not ghosts. They have names: <strong>SUVs, cars, trucks, bikes, mopeds</strong>. SUVs and cars alone caused <strong>five deaths and over 500 injuries</strong> to pedestrians. Trucks and buses killed two. Motorcycles and mopeds, two more. Even bikes have left bodies broken. The street does not care who you are. It only takes.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Diana Ayala has voted for some safety bills. She supported laws that force the city to remove abandoned cars, clear crosswalks, and track street safety projects <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>on NYC Council Legistar</a>. She co-sponsored a bill to curb repeat speeders. But the pace is slow. The deaths are not. In 2023, as bike riders died in record numbers, Ayala stood with advocates and said the city must &ldquo;fulfill legal requirements to build safe streets&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/nyc-on-pace-for-deadliest-year-for-bike-riders-since-1999-study/>reported amny.com</a>. Still, <strong>94% of cyclist deaths happened on streets without protected lanes</strong>. The law is not enough if it stays on paper.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>No more waiting.</strong> Call Council Member Ayala.

Williams was struck, thrown, and died from his injuries. The article states, “An officer pursuing dirt bikers suddenly crossed the double yellow line into Williams' path, causing a collision.” Another NYPD vehicle attempted a similar maneuver. The family’s attorney called it a “deadly maneuver” for a minor violation. The city later billed Williams’ family for police vehicle damages. The NYPD has not commented, citing litigation. The case raises questions about police pursuit tactics and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law orders the Department of Transportation to install daylighting barriers at a minimum of 1,000 intersections each year, up from 100. The city must also run outreach and education. The bill aims to keep crosswalks clear, improve visibility, and protect people on foot and bike. No more hiding behind parked cars.

The bill, heard by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, passed on September 26, 2024, and became law on October 26, 2024. Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers. It shifts blame from people on foot to the system and those behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report notes the pedestrian was not at an intersection and was crossing without a signal, but this is listed after the driver's error. The vehicle, a 2016 CHEV-TRUCK/BUS, showed no damage, and the point of impact was the left front bumper.
