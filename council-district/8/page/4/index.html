Over a thousand injured.</strong> In the last twelve months, District 8 has seen 1,065 people hurt and 7 killed in crashes. Twenty more were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. The numbers do not lie. The pain is not abstract.</p><p>On January 26, Willow Hall tried to cross Harlem River Drive. He never made it. An unlicensed driver in a Nissan Rogue struck him down. The driver stayed at the scene, but it took police six months to bring charges. &ldquo;Donald Pinnock was charged Sunday with aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/unlicensed-suv-driver-arrested-6-months-after-killing-east-harlem-pedestrian/>reported NY Daily News</a>. The street was quiet again by sunrise. Hall was gone.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a crash on the Hutchinson River Parkway left an 18-year-old woman fighting for her life. The moped driver fled. &ldquo;Police said the moped driver sped away from the 3:45 a.m. crash&mldr; leaving the young woman to die on the road,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/21/woman-passenger-18-clings-to-life-after-falling-off-moped-in-bronx-crash-driver-speeds-off/>wrote NY Daily News</a>.

The road keeps moving.</p><h2 id=who-pays-who-acts>Who Pays, Who Acts</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> In District 8, they killed 5 people and injured 473 more. Trucks and buses killed 2. Motorcycles and mopeds killed 1. Bikes killed 1. The deadliest machines keep rolling. The most vulnerable keep paying.</p><p>Council Member Diana Ayala has backed bills to daylight crosswalks, light step streets, and expand greenways. She voted yes to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the desperate and the poor. But the bleeding has not stopped. The bills are slow. The streets are not.</p><h2 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another family broken.</strong> Call Council Member Ayala. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand curb extensions, daylighting, and protected crossings. Demand action, not studies. The dead cannot wait.

Council Member Erik D. Bottcher is the primary sponsor, joined by Julie Won, Jumaane Williams, and others. The bill prohibits standing or parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and mandates the Department of Transportation to install daylighting barriers at a minimum of 1,000 intersections per year. The law also requires citywide outreach and reporting. This measure aims to keep sightlines clear at crossings, a known danger zone for people on foot and bike.

Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights.
