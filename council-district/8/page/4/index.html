It hit a woman in the crosswalk, then jumped the curb and mowed down five more. The driver and passenger ran. Six people went to the hospital. &ldquo;People were yelling, were in pain, so yelling, crying, it was very upsetting,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/03/us-news/6-pedestrians-struck-by-ford-mustang-that-crashed-into-nyc-scaffolding-before-driver-passenger-flee/>said Vivian Cole</a>.

The street is not safe for anyone on foot. The numbers do not lie: in three years, 16 people killed, 56 left with serious injuries, and thousands more scraped, broken, or bruised (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>Council Member Diana Ayala has signed on to bills that matter. She backed the law to end jaywalking tickets, giving people the right to cross where they need to (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>see vote</a>). She co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, to clear sightlines for people on foot (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>see bill</a>). She pushed for more lighting on step streets, and for curb extensions to shorten the distance a child or elder must cross. But bills can sit in committee while people bleed in the street. The Mustang that hit six people did not wait for a hearing.</p><p>&ldquo;We thought it was a bomb or something, because we are all panicking around here,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>said Christina Sieh</a>. The fear is real. The danger is daily.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Ayala. Tell her to fight for faster action, not just more studies. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand that the city stop blaming the people who walk and start protecting them. The next crash is coming. <strong>Do not wait until it is your family.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Prime sponsor Joann Ariola leads, joined by Council Members Hanks, Ayala, Salaam, Brooks-Powers, Banks, Restler, Brannan, Ung, Gutiérrez, Louis, Hudson, Schulman, Ossé, Krishnan, Nurse, Moya, and Marmorato. Step streets are public staircases linking streets at different heights. The bill aims to ensure these stairs are well-lit, reducing risk for walkers. Once all step streets are lit, the mandate ends.
