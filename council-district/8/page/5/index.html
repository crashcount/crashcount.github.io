In the last twelve months, seven people died in crashes across District 8. Twenty more suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. In total, over a thousand neighbors have been hurt in 1,765 crashes. The numbers do not lie. They do not comfort. They only count the bodies.</p><p>Just days ago, a driver in the Bronx ran a red light at Bruckner and Hunts Point. His car jumped the curb and struck three men on the sidewalk. One is fighting for his life. The driver ran, but the pain stayed behind. Police charged him with vehicular assault and reckless endangerment. &ldquo;The suspect allegedly fled the scene after the crash, which injured several pedestrians&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/bronx-man-arrested-after-allegedly-fleeing-multivehicle-crash-that-injured-pedestrians/>reported CBS New York</a>. The sidewalk is not safe. The crosswalk is not safe. Nowhere is safe.</p><p>On Pelham Parkway, a left turn ended a man’s life. Nathaniel Martinez, 31, died when a Chevrolet Equinox turned into his path. &ldquo;The Equinox driver stayed at the scene, and both she and Martinez were transported by EMS to Jacob Medical Center, where Martinez died from severe internal injuries&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/29/motorcycle-rider-dies-crash-bronx-near-bruckner-expressway/>wrote NY Daily News</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-the-long-road-ahead>Leadership: Progress and the Long Road Ahead</h3><p>Council Member Diana Ayala has voted for laws to protect people on foot and bike. She backed the end of jaywalking tickets, a move that stops blaming the dead for their own deaths. She co-sponsored bills to light step streets, ban parking near crosswalks, and build curb extensions. These are steps, not leaps.</p><p>But the blood keeps coming. The city’s pace is slow. The law says redesign the streets, but the streets stay the same. Most deaths happen on roads without protection.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p>Every crash is preventable. The city has the power to lower speed limits, daylight corners, and build real protection for the vulnerable. The council can demand it. The mayor can order it. The people can force it.</p><p>Call Council Member Ayala. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit, daylighted corners, and protected bike lanes on every deadly stretch. Do not wait for another name on the list. The time for patience is over.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Brooks-Powers (District 31) highlighted the deadly toll facing cyclists in New York City. The event, covered by amny.com, cited a study showing 25 bike riders killed since January, making this the deadliest year for cyclists since 1999. The matter summary states: 'New York City is on pace to see the deadliest year for bike riders since 1999.' Brooks-Powers stressed the urgent need for investments in street infrastructure, especially in outer-borough communities. She joined advocates and fellow Council Member Diana Ayala in demanding the city fulfill legal requirements to build safe streets. The analysis found 94% of cyclist deaths occurred on streets without protected bike lanes. Activists and analysts called for immediate action to fast track the NYC Streets Plan and expand protected lanes, noting that only 3% of city streets have them, despite an 18.1% drop in injuries and deaths where they exist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill stated: “Pedestrians may cross any roadway at any point, including outside of a marked or unmarked crosswalk, and allow for crossing against traffic signals. It would legalize the activity commonly referred to as ‘jaywalking’ and specify that no penalties can be imposed for jaywalking.” Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by Narcisse, Won, Farías, Hanif, Ayala, Richardson Jordan, Krishnan, and Nurse. The bill superseded state law and removed penalties for pedestrian movement. Filed at session’s end, it did not advance.
