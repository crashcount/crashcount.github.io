Sixty-one suffered serious injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, six more lives were lost, and twenty-two more were left with wounds that do not heal.

We see people go through these red lights all the time,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said a woman named Nita</a>.

She co-sponsored a <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>bill to ban parking near crosswalks</a>, to keep sightlines clear for people on foot and bike. She voted to decriminalize jaywalking, shifting blame away from those on foot. But the pace is slow.

Every death is a failure.</strong> Call Council Member Ayala. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes, not promises. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, heard by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, passed on September 26, 2024, and became law on October 26, 2024. Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers. It shifts blame from people on foot to the system and those behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report notes the pedestrian was not at an intersection and was crossing without a signal, but this is listed after the driver's error. The vehicle, a 2016 CHEV-TRUCK/BUS, showed no damage, and the point of impact was the left front bumper.

The police describe the child as suffering crush injuries to his entire body and dying at the scene. The driver’s license status is listed as 'Unlicensed' in the report, and the vehicle was traveling straight ahead. The police narrative makes clear the driver left the scene. No contributing factors are specified beyond the unlicensed status and failure to remain.
