The truck struck a 63-year-old man riding a bike, hitting him headfirst. The report states the cyclist was ejected and suffered severe head lacerations, lying conscious but injured on the street. The primary contributing factor listed is 'Traffic Control Disregarded,' highlighting the truck driver's failure to obey the signal. The report notes the cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this detail is mentioned only after the driver's traffic violation.

A man, 33, trapped at the wheel. Both conscious. Both broken.' No contributing factors are attributed to the passenger. The report centers driver error as the cause of this severe crash.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
