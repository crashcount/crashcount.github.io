In the past year, <strong>7 people died and 20 suffered serious injuries</strong> in crashes. Over a thousand more were hurt. The dead include a 53-year-old man, crushed by an SUV on Harlem River Drive while crossing the road. The driver was unlicensed. Police waited six months before making an arrest. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/unlicensed-suv-driver-arrested-6-months-after-killing-east-harlem-pedestrian/>Donald Pinnock was charged Sunday with aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle.</a></p><p>On Southern Boulevard, a 22-year-old moped passenger died after a truck turned left and hit him. The crash report lists &ldquo;Traffic Control Disregarded.&rdquo; The numbers do not flinch: <strong>16 killed, 56 seriously hurt, 3,450 injured</strong> since 2022. Most were walking, riding, or just trying to get home.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars did the most harm</strong>—killing 5, injuring hundreds. Trucks and buses killed 2. Motorcycles and mopeds, 1. Bikes, 1. The pattern is clear: the bigger the vehicle, the greater the damage. The city blames the dead for being in the way. The living are left to count the bodies.</p><h3 id=council-member-ayala-action-and-silence>Council Member Ayala: Action and Silence</h3><p>Council Member Diana Ayala has signed her name to bills that could help. She backed laws to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>light up step streets</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>expand greenways</a>. She voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the vulnerable. She stood with advocates when the city failed to build protected bike lanes, saying nothing less than, <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/nyc-on-pace-for-deadliest-year-for-bike-riders-since-1999-study/>&ldquo;the city must fulfill legal requirements to build safe streets.&rdquo;</a></p><p>But the pace is slow. The deaths keep coming. The bills pile up in committee. The city drags its feet. The blood dries, but the danger stays.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-relentless-change>Call to Action: Demand Relentless Change</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Ayala. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand protected lanes, not painted lines. Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill required the Department of Transportation to study and report on using street design to limit or reduce commercial vehicle use in residential neighborhoods. The matter’s title reads: 'A Local Law in relation to requiring the department of transportation to study street design as a means to limit or reduce the use by commercial vehicles of streets in residential neighborhoods.' Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez sponsored the bill, joined by Avilés, the Public Advocate, and others. The report was due by December 31, 2023. The bill was filed at the end of session with no report issued. The measure aimed to examine street redesign, traffic calming, and camera enforcement to keep trucks out of residential areas, but it stalled before any impact reached the street.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez sponsored, joined by Avilés, the Public Advocate Williams, and others. The bill cited the city’s reliance on trucks—89% of freight—fueling congestion, pollution, and risk for everyone outside a vehicle.
