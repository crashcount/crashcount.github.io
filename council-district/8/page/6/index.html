A Mercedes changed lanes, struck a Volkswagen, then hit the riders. Both men died at the hospital. Police charged the driver, Mauricio Neyra Yuyes, with vehicular manslaughter and driving while intoxicated. The crash closed the highway for hours. The city detoured traffic. The families got no detour. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/bronx-river-parkway-accident-east-gun-hill-road/>The men were ejected from their scooters and fatally injured in the collision. Both were pronounced dead at the hospital, NYPD said.</a></p><h2 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h2><p><strong>Sixteen people have died on District 8 streets since 2022.</strong> There have been 3,885 injuries and 63 serious injuries. The dead include children, cyclists, and pedestrians. Cars and SUVs killed five. Trucks and buses killed two. Motorcycles and mopeds killed two. Bikes killed one. The rest are lost in the data. Each number is a name erased from a family table.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-delayed>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Delayed</h2><p>Council Member Diana Ayala has voted for and co-sponsored bills to clear abandoned vehicles, daylight crosswalks, and boost street safety transparency. She backed the law to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>remove derelict cars within 72 hours</a>, clearing sightlines for people on foot and bike. She voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>decriminalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the vulnerable. She co-sponsored the bill to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>, but it sits stalled in committee. The city moves slow. The cars do not. <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/multi-vehicle-crash-on-the-bronx-river-parkway/>Neyra Yuyes was arrested on Monday&mldr; He faces a list of charges including vehicular manslaughter, driving while intoxicated and driving while ability impaired.</a></p><h2 id=the-work-left-to-do>The Work Left to Do</h2><p><strong>The carnage continues.</strong> The laws that would save lives gather dust. The streets remain wide, the crossings blind. The next crash waits at the next green light.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand action. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighted crosswalks and protected bike lanes.

Brooks-Powers (District 31) highlighted the deadly toll facing cyclists in New York City. The event, covered by amny.com, cited a study showing 25 bike riders killed since January, making this the deadliest year for cyclists since 1999. The matter summary states: 'New York City is on pace to see the deadliest year for bike riders since 1999.' Brooks-Powers stressed the urgent need for investments in street infrastructure, especially in outer-borough communities. She joined advocates and fellow Council Member Diana Ayala in demanding the city fulfill legal requirements to build safe streets. The analysis found 94% of cyclist deaths occurred on streets without protected bike lanes. Activists and analysts called for immediate action to fast track the NYC Streets Plan and expand protected lanes, noting that only 3% of city streets have them, despite an 18.1% drop in injuries and deaths where they exist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
