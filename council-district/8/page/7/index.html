The matter, titled 'Staten Island’s congestion-pricing fight spurs new push to leave NYC,' centers on legal action and renewed secession talk. Hanks, a centrist Democrat, opposes the plan, citing 'costs, traffic problems and pollution.' She said, 'Historically, Staten Island gets the short end of the stick.' Rep. Nicole Malliotakis and Council Minority Leader Joe Borelli plan to sue the MTA, aiming to block the $23 toll for drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street. Councilwoman Diana Ayala echoed concerns about exclusion from decision-making. No safety analyst has formally assessed the impact, but officials warn that increased traffic and pollution could endanger pedestrians and cyclists as drivers seek toll-free routes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
