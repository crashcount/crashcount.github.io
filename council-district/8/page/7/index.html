Eighteen left with injuries that will never heal.</strong> In the last year alone, District 8 saw 1,949 crashes. These are not just numbers—they are bodies on the street, families waiting in hospital halls. Last month, a 22-year-old passenger died on Southern Boulevard, crushed between a moped and a truck. In June, a child was killed near the RFK Bridge exit. The city keeps moving. The dead do not. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h2 id=the-pattern-that-never-breaks>The Pattern That Never Breaks</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> In the past three years, cars and trucks took five lives and left hundreds wounded. Motorcycles and mopeds killed two. Bikes killed one. Pedestrians are hit crossing, waiting, walking home. The sidewalk is not safe. The crosswalk is not safe. The numbers do not lie. The pain does not fade.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h2><p>Council Member Diana Ayala has voted for laws to clear abandoned vehicles and open sightlines, making it harder for drivers to hide behind rusted metal and block the view of a child in the crosswalk. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Ayala votes yes to remove abandoned vehicles, boosting street safety.</a> She co-sponsored bills to force the city to show its work on street safety, to track progress, and to shine light on delays. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Ayala co-sponsors bill boosting street safety transparency and project accountability.</a> She stood with others to demand the city build the bike lanes it promised, after another year when most cyclists died on streets with no protection. <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/nyc-on-pace-for-deadliest-year-for-bike-riders-since-1999-study/>Ayala condemns city inaction amid deadly bike crashes</a></p><p>But the pace is slow. The deaths keep coming. The city passes laws, but the blood does not dry. &ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t even in the bike lane, they were parked on the corner, fixing the light or the sign or something,&rdquo; a witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/electric-biker-slashes-city-worker-nearly-crash-lower-manhattan/>said after a city worker was slashed by a cyclist in Lower Manhattan</a>. The work is never done. The danger never leaves.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day without action is another day someone does not come home. Call Council Member Ayala. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes on every street. Demand that the city clear the crosswalks, daylight the corners, and end the silence. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter, titled 'Staten Island’s congestion-pricing fight spurs new push to leave NYC,' centers on legal action and renewed secession talk. Hanks, a centrist Democrat, opposes the plan, citing 'costs, traffic problems and pollution.' She said, 'Historically, Staten Island gets the short end of the stick.' Rep. Nicole Malliotakis and Council Minority Leader Joe Borelli plan to sue the MTA, aiming to block the $23 toll for drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street. Councilwoman Diana Ayala echoed concerns about exclusion from decision-making. No safety analyst has formally assessed the impact, but officials warn that increased traffic and pollution could endanger pedestrians and cyclists as drivers seek toll-free routes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
