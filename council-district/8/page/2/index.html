Fifty-seven more have suffered serious injuries since 2022.</strong> These are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors. A child crushed on the Major Deegan. A man killed crossing Harlem River Drive. A moped passenger, age 22, dead on Bruckner Boulevard. The road keeps its silence. The city moves on.</p><p>Last week, a Ford Mustang tore through Courtlandt Avenue and East 149th, hitting six people before smashing into scaffolding. The driver ran. The pain stayed. &ldquo;People were yelling, were in pain, so yelling, crying, it was very upsetting,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/03/us-news/6-pedestrians-struck-by-ford-mustang-that-crashed-into-nyc-scaffolding-before-driver-passenger-flee/>said a witness</a>. Six more bodies in the hospital. Six more families waiting for news that will not heal them.</p><h2 id=patterns-in-the-wreckage>Patterns in the Wreckage</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> Since 2022, they have killed five people and injured hundreds more. Trucks and buses killed two. Motorcycles and mopeds, one each. Bikes, too, have left scars. The street does not care what you drive. It only cares how fast, how close, how blind.</p><p>The Mustang crash is not rare. It is the city’s rhythm. &ldquo;Once I heard the noise I turned around and it was already on the curb. It immediately backed up and fled,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/bronx-sidewalk-shed-crash-melrose/>said another witness</a>. The ambulance came. The driver did not.</p><h2 id=leadership-progress-and-the-long-road>Leadership: Progress and the Long Road</h2><p>Council Member Diana Ayala has signed on to bills that matter. She co-sponsored the push to ban parking near crosswalks, to light the city’s step streets, to expand curb extensions, and to legalize crossing the street outside the lines. She voted yes to the citywide greenway plan and to ending jaywalking tickets. These are steps. But the blood on the street says the steps are not enough.</p><p><strong>The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not.</strong> The city can redesign every deadly crossing. It has not. The city can end the reign of repeat speeders. It has not.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</h2><p><strong>Call Council Member Ayala. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand that every repeat speeder is stopped before they kill again.</strong></p><p>The street will not wait.

The plan widens sidewalks by 46% and cuts traffic lanes from five to three, aiming to boost pedestrian access. However, the redesign omits dedicated bus and bike lanes. Advocates criticized the move: 'Two mayors have now disregarded city workers' plans for a busway, throwing riders under the bus to favor luxury boutiques,' said Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance. Transportation Alternatives called the plan a failure, noting Fifth Avenue's slow bus speeds and lack of cycling infrastructure.

The article quotes Transportation Alternatives: “That 5-7 second head start can mean the difference between being hit by a turning car and being seen by a turning car.” Esparza says officers ignore the rule, issuing criminal summonses instead of traffic tickets.

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing.

The city’s system failed to stop it.</p><p class=mb3>According to the New York Post (April 25, 2025), a 32-year-old man was critically injured after being dragged by his own car during a daylight theft on Westchester Avenue in the Bronx. The article reports, 'Officers found the victim badly injured with trauma to his head and leg a block away.' Surveillance footage shows the man trying to stop the thief by grabbing the car window as it sped away. The Infiniti was later found abandoned with heavy damage. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch called the Bronx 'the absolute best place' in New York City to steal a car, citing a 3.6% rise in thefts in the borough, despite a citywide decrease. The incident highlights ongoing gaps in car theft prevention and prosecution.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
