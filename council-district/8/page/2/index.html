The driver ran. The pain stayed. &ldquo;People were yelling, were in pain, so yelling, crying, it was very upsetting,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>said Vivian Cole</a>. All six went to the hospital. They were lucky. This time, no one died.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>District 8 saw 7 deaths and 17 serious injuries</strong> from crashes. <strong>1,049 people were hurt</strong>. The dead included a 22-year-old passenger on a moped, a 53-year-old man crushed by an SUV, and a child killed crossing the Major Deegan. The numbers do not bleed, but the streets do.</p><h3 id=the-shape-of-danger>The Shape of Danger</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most harm.</strong> They killed five, left hundreds injured, and broke bodies at the curb.

The city moves on.</p><h3 id=council-member-ayala-action-and-silence>Council Member Ayala: Action and Silence</h3><p>Council Member Diana Ayala has backed bills to <strong>ban parking near crosswalks</strong>, <strong>light up step streets</strong>, and <strong>expand greenways</strong>. She voted to <strong>legalize jaywalking</strong>, ending a law that punished the desperate and the slow. She co-sponsored measures to <strong>target fake plates</strong> and <strong>curb dangerous trucks</strong>. But the carnage continues. &ldquo;We thought it was a bomb or something, because we are all panicking around here,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/03/us-news/6-pedestrians-struck-by-ford-mustang-that-crashed-into-nyc-scaffolding-before-driver-passenger-flee/>said Christina Sieh</a>.</p><p><strong>The council can do more.</strong> The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It can redesign every deadly street. It can end the reign of repeat offenders. Every day of delay is another family broken.</p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p><strong>Call Council Member Ayala. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit and real protection for people on foot and bike.</strong> The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice.

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing.

The street bears the scar.</p><p class=mb3>According to the New York Post (April 3, 2025), two NYPD officers pursued a stolen Honda CRV from the Bronx into Manhattan. The chase ended near Dyckman Street when the car slammed into a building and caught fire. The officers 'approached the burning SUV but then left without helping the driver or calling for an ambulance.' They did not report the crash. Both have been suspended while the Force Investigation Division and Attorney General review their actions. The incident follows a February NYPD policy change barring pursuits for non-violent crimes. Commissioner Jessica Tisch said, 'The NYPD's enforcement efforts must never put the public or the police at undue risk.' NYPD data shows one in four pursuits last year led to crashes or injuries. The crash exposes the risks of high-speed chases and gaps in police accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
