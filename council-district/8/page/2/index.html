Over 3,600 injured. Fifty-seven left with wounds so deep they are called serious.</strong> These are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors. They are the people who walk, ride, and cross our streets. In the last year alone, seven died and 1,180 were hurt. The disaster does not slow.</p><p><strong>Just last week, a 71-year-old woman was killed in Co-op City. Six more were hurt.</strong> &ldquo;One lady was out on the ground. They was giving her medical attention, checking her body. She was laid out,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/op-city-crash-multiple-people-injured-including-1-critically-bronx/17075710/>said Samuel Cherry</a>. The pain is not abstract. It is a body on the pavement, sirens in the morning, a family waiting for news that will break them.</p><p>At East 149th and Courtlandt, a Mustang jumped the curb and hit six people. &ldquo;People were yelling, were in pain, so yelling, crying, it was very upsetting,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>said Vivian Cole</a>. The driver ran. The city did not.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars did the most harm.</strong> Five deaths, 342 minor injuries, 146 moderate, 11 serious. Trucks and buses killed two, left 24 with minor wounds, 18 moderate, four serious. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes took lives too. No one is safe. The youngest and oldest are not spared. Children under 18: one dead, 282 injured. Seniors: four killed, 205 injured.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Diana Ayala has signed her name to bills that matter. She voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths. She co-sponsored laws to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>light up step streets</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>expand greenways</a>. These are steps. But the blood keeps flowing. The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not. The most dangerous drivers are still on the road.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Ayala.

Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model.

The collision forced the cyclist into the path of a red delivery truck, which then struck him. The 54-year-old truck driver stayed at the scene. Police had not determined if charges would be filed. The article highlights the lethal risk of dooring and the vulnerability of cyclists in mixed traffic.
