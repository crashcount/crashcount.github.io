A Mercedes changed lanes, struck a Volkswagen, then hit the riders. Both men died at the hospital. Police charged the driver, Mauricio Neyra Yuyes, with vehicular manslaughter and driving while intoxicated. The crash closed the highway for hours. The city detoured traffic. The families got no detour. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/bronx-river-parkway-accident-east-gun-hill-road/>The men were ejected from their scooters and fatally injured in the collision. Both were pronounced dead at the hospital, NYPD said.</a></p><h2 id=the-numbers-do-not-lie>The Numbers Do Not Lie</h2><p><strong>Sixteen people have died on District 8 streets since 2022.</strong> There have been 3,885 injuries and 63 serious injuries. The dead include children, cyclists, and pedestrians. Cars and SUVs killed five. Trucks and buses killed two. Motorcycles and mopeds killed two. Bikes killed one. The rest are lost in the data. Each number is a name erased from a family table.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-delayed>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Delayed</h2><p>Council Member Diana Ayala has voted for and co-sponsored bills to clear abandoned vehicles, daylight crosswalks, and boost street safety transparency. She backed the law to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>remove derelict cars within 72 hours</a>, clearing sightlines for people on foot and bike. She voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>decriminalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the vulnerable. She co-sponsored the bill to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>, but it sits stalled in committee. The city moves slow. The cars do not. <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/multi-vehicle-crash-on-the-bronx-river-parkway/>Neyra Yuyes was arrested on Monday&mldr; He faces a list of charges including vehicular manslaughter, driving while intoxicated and driving while ability impaired.</a></p><h2 id=the-work-left-to-do>The Work Left to Do</h2><p><strong>The carnage continues.</strong> The laws that would save lives gather dust. The streets remain wide, the crossings blind. The next crash waits at the next green light.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand action. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighted crosswalks and protected bike lanes. Demand that every bill to protect the vulnerable gets a vote, not a delay.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The incident left a family demanding accountability. The report highlights that officers, rather than assisting or remaining at the scene, drove away. This raises questions about police conduct and response protocols after crashes. The case underscores systemic failures in post-crash procedures and the need for transparent investigation when law enforcement is involved. The article does not detail the crash mechanics or the victims, focusing instead on the officers' actions and the family's call for answers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists and advocates argue the penalties are harsher than those faced by drivers for similar actions. As one protester said, “It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.” Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the crackdown, citing the lack of licensing for e-bikes as a challenge for enforcement, but acknowledged the need for legislative reform. The article highlights inconsistent enforcement and the risks faced by vulnerable road users, especially delivery workers. Policy gaps and unequal penalties expose systemic danger on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city’s pulse slows, but the outcome is uncertain.</p><p class=mb3>West Side Spirit reported on May 23, 2025, that New York’s congestion pricing tolls remain in place despite three missed federal deadlines to remove them. The article details a standoff between the MTA, New York State, and U.S. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy, who demands the tolls be taken down, threatening to withhold highway funds. The MTA argues the legality of the tolls and seeks a court injunction, stating, 'congestion pricing is legal and proper.' The system, operational since January 2025, has reduced daily vehicle entries into Manhattan’s core by 76,000 in April and raised $159 million in the first quarter. The dispute highlights tensions over funding priorities and the impact on lower-income drivers, but the courts, not drivers or pedestrians, will decide the fate of the tolls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Attorney Roberta Kaplan wrote, 'Secretary Duffy did not afford the Project Sponsors any notice or due process before that alleged termination.' The state’s response called the deadlines 'procedurally improper.'

The plan widens sidewalks by 46% and cuts traffic lanes from five to three, aiming to boost pedestrian access. However, the redesign omits dedicated bus and bike lanes. Advocates criticized the move: 'Two mayors have now disregarded city workers' plans for a busway, throwing riders under the bus to favor luxury boutiques,' said Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance. Transportation Alternatives called the plan a failure, noting Fifth Avenue's slow bus speeds and lack of cycling infrastructure.
