Paramedics kneel beside her. She does not get up. On July 11, a 79-year-old driver crashed into two cars and a pole in the Bronx. His passenger, Stella Nyarko-Dei, 71, died at Jacobi Hospital. Seven others were hurt. Police said, &ldquo;The cause of the crash was not immediately known&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/13/multi-car-crash-in-the-bronx-kills-71-year-old-woman-injures-seven-others/>according to NY Daily News</a>. No arrests. No answers. The street is quiet again, but the loss remains.</p><p>This is not rare. Since 2022, District 8 has seen <strong>16 deaths and 57 serious injuries</strong> from crashes. <strong>Three children have died.</strong> More than 3,600 people have been hurt. The numbers do not stop. They only grow.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>The killers are not ghosts. They have names: <strong>SUVs, cars, trucks, bikes, mopeds</strong>. SUVs and cars alone caused <strong>five deaths and over 500 injuries</strong> to pedestrians. Trucks and buses killed two. Motorcycles and mopeds, two more. Even bikes have left bodies broken. The street does not care who you are. It only takes.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Diana Ayala has voted for some safety bills. She supported laws that force the city to remove abandoned cars, clear crosswalks, and track street safety projects <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>on NYC Council Legistar</a>. She co-sponsored a bill to curb repeat speeders. But the pace is slow. The deaths are not. In 2023, as bike riders died in record numbers, Ayala stood with advocates and said the city must &ldquo;fulfill legal requirements to build safe streets&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/nyc-on-pace-for-deadliest-year-for-bike-riders-since-1999-study/>reported amny.com</a>. Still, <strong>94% of cyclist deaths happened on streets without protected lanes</strong>. The law is not enough if it stays on paper.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>No more waiting.</strong> Call Council Member Ayala.

The plan nearly doubles sidewalk widths and expands pedestrian zones, cutting space for vehicles. The redesign adds tree buffers, benches, and stormwater upgrades.

The Department of Transportation aims to allow only buses and trucks, forcing cars to turn off quickly. The M34 bus, used by 28,000 daily riders, currently averages just 3 mph during rush hour. Officials cite the 2019 14th Street busway, which increased bus speeds by 24% and reduced crash injuries. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'The vast majority of commuters in Midtown are traveling by transit and they deserve world-class, fast, and reliable buses.' The plan includes pedestrian improvements like shorter intersections and brighter crosswalks.

Only fragments and silence left behind.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News reported on May 7, 2025, that federal officials released images showing a sightseeing helicopter breaking apart in midair before crashing into the Hudson River, killing six. The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
