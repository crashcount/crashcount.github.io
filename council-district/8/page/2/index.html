Eighteen left with injuries that will never heal.</strong> In the last year alone, District 8 saw 1,949 crashes. These are not just numbers—they are bodies on the street, families waiting in hospital halls. Last month, a 22-year-old passenger died on Southern Boulevard, crushed between a moped and a truck. In June, a child was killed near the RFK Bridge exit. The city keeps moving. The dead do not. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h2 id=the-pattern-that-never-breaks>The Pattern That Never Breaks</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> In the past three years, cars and trucks took five lives and left hundreds wounded. Motorcycles and mopeds killed two. Bikes killed one. Pedestrians are hit crossing, waiting, walking home. The sidewalk is not safe. The crosswalk is not safe. The numbers do not lie. The pain does not fade.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h2><p>Council Member Diana Ayala has voted for laws to clear abandoned vehicles and open sightlines, making it harder for drivers to hide behind rusted metal and block the view of a child in the crosswalk. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Ayala votes yes to remove abandoned vehicles, boosting street safety.</a> She co-sponsored bills to force the city to show its work on street safety, to track progress, and to shine light on delays. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Ayala co-sponsors bill boosting street safety transparency and project accountability.</a> She stood with others to demand the city build the bike lanes it promised, after another year when most cyclists died on streets with no protection. <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/nyc-on-pace-for-deadliest-year-for-bike-riders-since-1999-study/>Ayala condemns city inaction amid deadly bike crashes</a></p><p>But the pace is slow. The deaths keep coming. The city passes laws, but the blood does not dry. &ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t even in the bike lane, they were parked on the corner, fixing the light or the sign or something,&rdquo; a witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/electric-biker-slashes-city-worker-nearly-crash-lower-manhattan/>said after a city worker was slashed by a cyclist in Lower Manhattan</a>. The work is never done. The danger never leaves.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day without action is another day someone does not come home. Call Council Member Ayala. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes on every street. Demand that the city clear the crosswalks, daylight the corners, and end the silence. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The coalition pushes for the SAFE Streets Package, including speed-limiting devices for repeat offenders and the 'Idaho stop' for cyclists. The article quotes Darnell Sealy-McCrorey: 'This epidemic is preventable. It doesn't have to be this way.' Lawmakers show mixed support. Some cite privacy fears or question the seriousness of multiple speeding violations. Jackson Chabot notes, 'A lot of people have understood the bill because of the tragic and fatal crashes recently.' The piece highlights the urgent need for policy change to address reckless driving and systemic danger on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The change means accused riders must appear in criminal court, not just pay a fine. The move follows the death of Priscilla Loke, struck by an e-bike in 2023. Advocates like Transportation Alternatives call the new policy 'a dangerous escalation.' The NYC E-Vehicle Safety Alliance urges lawmakers to require license plates for e-bikes and scooters. The article notes, 'Under the new policy, a person issued a criminal summons must turn up in person in criminal court.' The shift highlights growing tension over enforcement and the push for stricter regulation after high-profile crashes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing.
