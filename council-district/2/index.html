A car turns. The street swallows him. In the last twelve months, <strong>four people died</strong> and <strong>496 were hurt</strong> in traffic crashes in District 2. Sixteen suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same again. The dead include a 79-year-old woman struck by a taxi at East 4th and Bowery, a 45-year-old man killed by a bus at Avenue D and East 10th, and a 31-year-old woman hit by an SUV on the FDR. Each one had a name. Each one is gone.</p><h3 id=the-system-fails-the-vulnerable>The System Fails the Vulnerable</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs killed seven. Trucks and buses killed two. Bikes left dozens injured.</strong> The numbers do not lie. The city blames distraction, inattention, and the dead themselves.

No justice.</p><h3 id=riveras-record-progress-and-gaps>Rivera’s Record: Progress and Gaps</h3><p>Council Member Carlina Rivera has <strong>voted for bills to end jaywalking enforcement</strong>, to daylight intersections, to map bike lane closures, and to lower speed limits on Open Streets. She <strong>co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act</strong> and pushed for a citywide greenway plan. She backed a law to warn taxi passengers about dooring. But the carnage continues. Laws take time. Streets need change now. &ldquo;I’ve been hit by vehicles twice—pretty badly—and while I was completely following the traffic laws. And as far as I know, those drivers face no criminal charges,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/02/mondays-headlines-critical-mass-edition>said Tara Pham</a>, a cyclist who rides these streets.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Four dead in a year. Hundreds maimed.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It can ban parking near crosswalks. It can build real protection for people on foot and bike. It can end the slow bleed. But only if you demand it.</p><p><strong>Call Rivera. Call the Mayor. Call the DOT.</strong> Tell them to use every tool.

The demonstration, which began at Union Square, challenged new policies issuing criminal summonses for minor cycling offenses. Riders followed traffic laws, highlighting the crackdown’s contradictions. One cyclist, Erin Poland, said the policy 'is not actually protecting cyclists [but] putting them in more danger.' Another, Tara Pham, noted, 'I’ve been hit by vehicles twice... those drivers face no criminal charges.' The article details how police arrested a Citi Bike rider for not moving aside and lacking ID, while drivers who injure vulnerable road users often avoid serious consequences.

Cyclists and advocates argue the penalties are harsher than those faced by drivers for similar actions. As one protester said, “It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.” Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the crackdown, citing the lack of licensing for e-bikes as a challenge for enforcement, but acknowledged the need for legislative reform. The article highlights inconsistent enforcement and the risks faced by vulnerable road users, especially delivery workers.

The bill adds pets to protected victims in traffic law. It hikes fines for drivers who hit animals and flee. Lawmakers push for real consequences when cars strike dogs, cats, and other companions.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0723-2025 sits in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced January 23, 2025, it urges the state to pass A10660/S9915, the Protecting Animals Walking on the Street (PAWS) Act. The resolution states: 'add the term companion animals to the list of possible victim classes should a driver fail to exercise due care to avoid striking pedestrians and to increase the fine for striking a pet with a vehicle and leaving the scene without reporting the incident.' Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary sponsor), Lynn C. Schulman, Carlina Rivera, and Justin L. Brannan back the measure. The PAWS Act would raise fines for drivers who hit pets and leave, and would recognize companion animals as protected victims under traffic law. The move targets a gap in current law, where penalties for striking animals are minor—on par with an illegal U-turn. The Council’s action signals a push for stronger accountability when vehicles harm the city’s most vulnerable, including its animals.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law requires the Department of Transportation to consult with the Fire Department before approving open street applications, bicycle lane projects, or major transportation projects. The official matter title states the law amends the city code to require DOT to consult with FDNY and notify affected firehouses before moving forward. Primary sponsor Kalman Yeger, with co-sponsors including Joann Ariola, Robert Holden, Lynn Schulman, and others, pushed the bill through. The law expands notification and comment rights for firehouses and community boards, adding new steps before any street or lane changes. No safety analyst assessed the direct impact on vulnerable road users. The law’s effect: more agencies weigh in, but the process for safer streets grows longer and more complex.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
