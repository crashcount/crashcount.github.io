Twenty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 1,600 hurt. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. They are the man crushed by a bus at 28th and 3rd. The woman struck down by a taxi at Bowery and East 4th. The bodies pile up, slow and steady, year after year.</p><p>Just last month, a city worker was slashed by an e-bike rider after a near-miss at Broadway and Cedar. The DOT called it <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/dot-worker-slashed-by-e-biker-manhattan/>&ldquo;an abhorrent assault of a NYC DOT employee who performs critical work to keep our city moving&rdquo;</a>. The blood washed off the sidewalk. The fear lingers.</p><p><strong>Cars and trucks do most of the killing.</strong> Seven dead by sedan or SUV. Three by bus or truck. Bikes and mopeds injure, but it is the weight of steel that ends lives. A food cart, unhitched from a van, slammed into a parked car with a woman and child inside. Police found the van packed with propane and gasoline. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/cops-bust-minivan-driver-in-manhattan-for-carrying-propane-tanks/>&ldquo;Firefighters forced entry into the van, removing 76 20-pound propane cylinders and 15 five-gallon fuel containers,&rdquo;</a> the Daily News reported. The city was lucky. This time.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-missed>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Missed</h3><p>Council Member Carlina Rivera has backed bills to clear abandoned cars from crosswalks, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>voting yes to remove street hazards</a>. She co-sponsored a law to speed up pavement markings, another to force sidewalk repairs. She signed on to a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, demanding daylight for every intersection. But she missed a key committee vote on removing derelict vehicles. The work is not done. The streets are not safe.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by the city, by its leaders, by those who look away. The dead cannot call for change. The living must.</p><p><strong>Call Council Member Rivera. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand every crosswalk be cleared, every bike lane protected, every reckless driver stopped.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Act now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
