Hundreds Hurt. Who Still Thinks These Streets Are Safe?</h1><p class="byline f6 silver">Written August 5, 2025 <em>(Revised August 6, 2025 – Removed duplicate headline from body, deduped and sorted citations.)</em></p></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>District 2: Jan 1, 2022 - Aug 5, 2025</h2><h3 id=blood-on-the-asphalt-the-recent-toll>Blood on the Asphalt: The Recent Toll</h3><p>In District 2, the numbers do not lie. Since January 2022, 15 people have died and 30 have been seriously injured on these streets. Six hundred were hurt in the last year alone. The dead include the old and the young. The wounds are deep and do not heal.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a 65-year-old e-bike rider was struck on Second Avenue. The driver fled, later telling police he ran because he had no license. The cyclist was left with critical head trauma. The paper put it plain: <em>&ldquo;He now faces charges of leaving the scene of an accident that caused serious injury and driving without a license.&rdquo;</em> <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/driver-arrested-after-hitting-65-year-old-e-biker-on-second-ave-XF4896347>West Side Spirit</a></p><p>On East 4th Street, a 79-year-old woman was killed at the crosswalk. A taxi hit her as she crossed. The record says only this: <em>&ldquo;Apparent Death.&rdquo;</em> <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=the-system-fails-the-vulnerable>The System Fails the Vulnerable</h3><p>Cars and SUVs do the most harm. In this district, they killed 7, injured hundreds, and left families broken. Trucks and buses killed 3 more. Bikes and mopeds hurt dozens. The street is a gauntlet. The sidewalk is no refuge. The old, the young, the cyclist, the walker—none are safe.</p><h3 id=council-member-rivera-progress-and-gaps>Council Member Rivera: Progress and Gaps</h3><p>Council Member Carlina Rivera has backed bills to speed up pavement markings, boost street safety transparency, and force faster sidewalk repairs. She voted to clear abandoned vehicles and co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks. These are steps, not leaps. But the carnage continues.</p><p>The city can lower speed limits. It can redesign streets. It can end the reign of repeat offenders. But every delay costs lives. As one resident <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said after a recent crash</a>, <em>&ldquo;I really want there to be speed humps because it&rsquo;s just terrifying.&rdquo;</em></p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more>Call to Action: Demand More</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Call Council Member Rivera. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand action, not excuses. Every day of delay is another day of blood on the street.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Residents worry rerouted vehicles will jam local streets and worsen safety. Jessica Lavoie of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association warns, "diverting traffic from this critical corridor onto narrow residential streets would lead to increased congestion, safety hazards, and diminished quality of life." The Department of Transportation aims to replicate the 14th Street busway, which "reduced congestion, sped up bus travel and curbed accidents."

Justice, tangled in policy.</p><p class=mb3>NY1 reported on May 30, 2025, that the NYPD is issuing criminal summonses to e-bike riders for traffic infractions, citing a lack of City Council action on new regulations. Commissioner Tisch told the Council, "Pass e-bike regulations." Cyclists object to criminal charges for minor violations, arguing for civil penalties instead. The article highlights the case of Renee Baruch, hospitalized after an e-bike crash left her with facial fractures and a spinal injury. The NYPD’s new Quality of Life Division targets reckless e-bike use, but without updated laws, criminal summonses remain their only tool. The policy gap leaves vulnerable road users exposed and enforcement inconsistent.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Attorney Roberta Kaplan wrote, 'Secretary Duffy did not afford the Project Sponsors any notice or due process before that alleged termination.' The state’s response called the deadlines 'procedurally improper.'

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'After seeing tremendous success on 14th Street where buses have sped up, traffic has virtually disappeared, and far fewer New Yorkers are getting hurt in crashes we are excited to propose a similar design on 34th Street.' The 14th Street busway, launched in 2019, increased bus speeds by up to 24% and reduced crashes.

The suit claims, 'the city maintains a policy and practice of detaining, ticketing, and prosecuting cyclists who lawfully ride through an intersection when the pedestrian control signal indicates white/walk.' Esparza received a $190 summons at Third Avenue and East 42nd Street, Manhattan, despite acting within the law. The lawsuit names current and former NYPD commissioners, accusing them of knowingly violating civil rights. The article notes a sharp rise in tickets for cyclists in early 2025.

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
