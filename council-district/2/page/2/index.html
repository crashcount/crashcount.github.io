Twenty-eight left with wounds that will not heal. In District 2, the numbers do not tell the whole story, but they do not lie. <strong>In the last twelve months alone: 4 killed, 16 seriously injured, 502 hurt.</strong></p><p>A 29-year-old man was run down at East 4th and Avenue D. The driver made a U-turn, aimed, and hit him. The man lived. The driver vanished.

Cars and SUVs killed seven. Trucks and buses killed two. Bikes hurt twenty-seven, but killed none. The old, the young, the ones just crossing the street. A baby boy hit by a taxi on East 11th. An elderly woman struck by a turning pickup. The city keeps moving. The bodies pile up.</p><h3 id=riveras-record-steps-forward-steps-stalled>Rivera’s Record: Steps Forward, Steps Stalled</h3><p>Council Member Carlina Rivera has signed her name to bills that matter. She voted to end jaywalking penalties, so police cannot blame the dead for crossing the street (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 0346-2024</a>). She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, pushing for lower speed limits and safer roads. She led the charge for a citywide greenway plan, promising real space for people on foot and bike (<a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/nyc-greenway-plan-bike-pedestrian-city-council/>citywide greenway plan</a>).</p><p>But the work is not done. <strong>Every day without a citywide 20 mph limit is another day of risk.</strong> Cameras that catch speeders are set to expire unless Albany acts. The council can push harder. The mayor can act now. The blood is still fresh.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Call Rivera. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never go dark.</strong> Join the fight.

The bill, now before the Council, mandates at least 25 percent of stations be placed in the roadway and requires DOT to report on usage and maintenance after three years. The matter title calls for 'expanding e-bike charging and battery safety infrastructure.' Rivera said, 'We certainly want to expand the conversation around e-bike charging and battery safety as much as possible.' Industry voices, like Baruch Herzfeld of Pop Wheels, argue the plan is too small to meet demand or curb deadly indoor charging fires. Ligia Guallpa of the Worker’s Justice Project warns that infrastructure has not kept pace with e-micromobility growth, increasing risks for riders and workers. The bill follows years of slow city action, with only three public charging stations operating today.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Hanif led as primary sponsor, joined by Amanda Farías, Crystal Hudson, Julie Won, and Carlina Rivera. The committee approved the resolution with strong support. The bill targets streets where pedestrians and cyclists mix with traffic. Lower speeds mean fewer crashes and less severe injuries.
