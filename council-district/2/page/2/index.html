On 2025-06-16 a bus going straight struck a 49-year-old man at 3rd Avenue and East 28th Street. He died at the scene, according to city crash records (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)>https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)</a>. Last summer a taxi hit a 79-year-old woman at Bowery and East 4th Street. She died there as well (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)>https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)</a>.</p><p>FDR Drive slices the district’s edge and leads the roll of harm: 3 dead and 78 hurt on that corridor alone. Avenue D and 3rd Avenue follow (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)>https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)</a>. The worst hour is late afternoon. Around 4 p.m. more people die here than at any other hour (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)>https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)</a>.</p><p>In the past 12 months District 2 recorded 1,053 crashes, 2 deaths and 17 serious injuries. Since 2022 the toll stands at 16 dead, 30 seriously injured and 1,784 people hurt in total (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)>https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)</a>.</p><p>Promises and pavement
Fourteenth Street is slated for a redesign next year. As NY1 put it, “The redesign aims to improve the pedestrian experience.” (<a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/15/redesign-of-14th-street-to-kick-off-next-year)>http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/15/redesign-of-14th-street-to-kick-off-next-year)</a>. After two people were killed near Canal and Bowery, the city moved to harden that intersection. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, “We are taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection” (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street)>https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street)</a>. Advocates warned that most of the corridor will remain deadly even after these changes (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street)>https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street)</a>.</p><p>Rivera’s record
Council Member Carlina Rivera co-sponsored a bill to impose penalties on property owners who fail to repair sidewalks (Int 1320-2025) and backed a measure to ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and scale up daylighting at intersections (Int 1138-2024) (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx)>https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx)</a>. Those measures help. They do not stop a bus at 3rd Avenue.</p><p>Local patterns, clear fixes
City data flags several recurring causes: broad &ldquo;other&rdquo; classifications, vulnerable road-user error, and unsafe speed among the top contributing factors. Driver inattention and disregarded traffic-control appear frequently. Heavy vehicles dominate deaths: cars and SUVs plus trucks and buses account for 10 pedestrian deaths and 343 injury cases combined in the current period (vehicle rollup) (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)>https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)</a>.</p><p>Name the hotspots: FDR Drive and 3rd Avenue. Those are repeat blocks. They need the standard tools: daylight the corners, raise the curb, install hardened turn protections and leading pedestrian intervals (LPIs). Make no-turn-on-red the rule where loading and transit conflicts create blind turns. Target enforcement and signal-timing fixes to the 4–8 p.m. surge when crashes and deaths spike (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)>https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)</a>.</p><p>Political solutions — local to citywide
Local fixes save lives on these blocks. But the leverage is citywide policy. Lower New York City’s default speed limit to 20 mph. Require intelligent speed-assistance devices or limiters on vehicles belonging to habitual speeders. Those two moves — systemic speed reduction and forced limiters for repeat offenders — cut the lethality of crashes across every neighborhood.</p><p>What to do now</p><ol><li>Install LPIs and daylighting at the busiest crossings on FDR Drive and 3rd Avenue. 2) Harden turns with concrete curb extensions and barriers at repeat hotspots. 3) Set signal timing and targeted enforcement for the 4–8 p.m. surge. Pair these with a citywide 20 mph default and mandate speed limiters for habitual speeders.</li></ol><p>Call. Write. Show up.

Residents worry rerouted vehicles will jam local streets and worsen safety. Jessica Lavoie of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association warns, "diverting traffic from this critical corridor onto narrow residential streets would lead to increased congestion, safety hazards, and diminished quality of life." The Department of Transportation aims to replicate the 14th Street busway, which "reduced congestion, sped up bus travel and curbed accidents." The article highlights the ongoing struggle to balance efficient transit, tunnel access, and neighborhood safety. No specific driver errors are cited, but the plan underscores the systemic risks of shifting car traffic onto residential blocks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Prosecutors say Ali drank for nearly six hours at three Manhattan bars, reaching a blood alcohol content of .158, almost twice the legal limit. After hitting Esiyok, Ali continued, injuring a cyclist, two more pedestrians, and crashing into a van. The family’s lawsuit cites New York’s Dram Shop Act, which holds bars liable for serving visibly drunk patrons who later cause harm. The article quotes the family’s lawyer: “The family is devastated.

The article highlights the case of Renee Baruch, hospitalized after an e-bike crash left her with facial fractures and a spinal injury. The NYPD’s new Quality of Life Division targets reckless e-bike use, but without updated laws, criminal summonses remain their only tool.

Starting May 18, the north outer roadway becomes bike-only, while the south outer roadway, once for vehicles, opens to pedestrians. The article notes, “Advocates have fought to open a separate pedestrian path, citing dangerous overcrowding that has led to conflicts among cyclists, pedestrians and micromobility users.” The bridge was the last city-owned East River crossing without split paths. Manhattan Community Board 6 urged the city to act, pressing DOT to open the path despite construction delays. The change doubles space for non-drivers and removes a vehicle lane, addressing years of systemic risk from forced mixing of vulnerable users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
