Hundreds Hurt. Who Still Thinks These Streets Are Safe?</h1><p class="byline f6 silver">Written August 5, 2025 <em>(Revised August 13, 2025 – Removed duplicate headline from body, deduped and sorted citations.)</em></p></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>District 2: Jan 1, 2022 - Aug 5, 2025</h2><h3 id=blood-on-the-asphalt-the-recent-toll>Blood on the Asphalt: The Recent Toll</h3><p>In District 2, the numbers do not lie. Since January 2022, 15 people have died and 30 have been seriously injured on these streets. Six hundred were hurt in the last year alone. The dead include the old and the young. The wounds are deep and do not heal.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a 65-year-old e-bike rider was struck on Second Avenue. The driver fled, later telling police he ran because he had no license. The cyclist was left with critical head trauma. The paper put it plain: <em>&ldquo;He now faces charges of leaving the scene of an accident that caused serious injury and driving without a license.&rdquo;</em> <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/driver-arrested-after-hitting-65-year-old-e-biker-on-second-ave-XF4896347>West Side Spirit</a></p><p>On East 4th Street, a 79-year-old woman was killed at the crosswalk. A taxi hit her as she crossed. The record says only this: <em>&ldquo;Apparent Death.&rdquo;</em> <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=the-system-fails-the-vulnerable>The System Fails the Vulnerable</h3><p>Cars and SUVs do the most harm. In this district, they killed 7, injured hundreds, and left families broken. Trucks and buses killed 3 more. Bikes and mopeds hurt dozens. The street is a gauntlet. The sidewalk is no refuge. The old, the young, the cyclist, the walker—none are safe.</p><h3 id=council-member-rivera-progress-and-gaps>Council Member Rivera: Progress and Gaps</h3><p>Council Member Carlina Rivera has backed bills to speed up pavement markings, boost street safety transparency, and force faster sidewalk repairs. She voted to clear abandoned vehicles and co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks. These are steps, not leaps. But the carnage continues.</p><p>The city can lower speed limits. It can redesign streets. It can end the reign of repeat offenders. But every delay costs lives. As one resident <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said after a recent crash</a>, <em>&ldquo;I really want there to be speed humps because it&rsquo;s just terrifying.&rdquo;</em></p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more>Call to Action: Demand More</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Call Council Member Rivera. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand action, not excuses. Every day of delay is another day of blood on the street.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
