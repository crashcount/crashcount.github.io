Twenty-eight left with wounds that will not heal. In District 2, the numbers do not tell the whole story, but they do not lie. <strong>In the last twelve months alone: 4 killed, 16 seriously injured, 502 hurt.</strong></p><p>A 29-year-old man was run down at East 4th and Avenue D. The driver made a U-turn, aimed, and hit him. The man lived. The driver vanished.

Cars and SUVs killed seven. Trucks and buses killed two. Bikes hurt twenty-seven, but killed none. The old, the young, the ones just crossing the street. A baby boy hit by a taxi on East 11th. An elderly woman struck by a turning pickup. The city keeps moving. The bodies pile up.</p><h3 id=riveras-record-steps-forward-steps-stalled>Rivera’s Record: Steps Forward, Steps Stalled</h3><p>Council Member Carlina Rivera has signed her name to bills that matter. She voted to end jaywalking penalties, so police cannot blame the dead for crossing the street (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 0346-2024</a>). She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, pushing for lower speed limits and safer roads. She led the charge for a citywide greenway plan, promising real space for people on foot and bike (<a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/nyc-greenway-plan-bike-pedestrian-city-council/>citywide greenway plan</a>).</p><p>But the work is not done. <strong>Every day without a citywide 20 mph limit is another day of risk.</strong> Cameras that catch speeders are set to expire unless Albany acts. The council can push harder. The mayor can act now. The blood is still fresh.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Call Rivera. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never go dark.</strong> Join the fight.

Their letter cites 429 injuries and four pedestrian deaths along Broadway between August 2011 and May 2022. The officials wrote, 'This stretch of Broadway needs to be made safer, and we believe pedestrianization, with limited necessary entries for vehicles that must access certain points along Broadway, could be a way to positively transform the area and benefit all New Yorkers.' Business leaders, including Dan Biederman of the 34th Street Partnership, now support the plan, calling it good for economic development. The push follows a recent taxi crash at Broadway and 29th Street that injured six. The city’s Broadway Vision plan promises to pedestrianize much of the corridor from Union Square to Columbus Circle.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Executive Director Terri Carta of the Brooklyn Greenway Initiative said, 'NYC Parks and DOT need to provide a safe alternative for greenway users during construction.' Despite DOT’s willingness to help, no concrete detour exists. The city’s failure to plan puts vulnerable road users at risk during the closure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Carlina Rivera called noise pollution a public health crisis and urged health-focused street design, citing the 14th Street busway. Transportation Alternatives backed the bills, pushing for more pedestrian and green space. Dr. Arline Bronzaft and other experts criticized the Health Department's inaction.
