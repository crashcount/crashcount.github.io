On 2025-06-16 a bus going straight struck a 49-year-old man at 3rd Avenue and East 28th Street. He died at the scene, according to city crash records (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)>https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)</a>. Last summer a taxi hit a 79-year-old woman at Bowery and East 4th Street. She died there as well (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)>https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)</a>.</p><p>FDR Drive slices the district’s edge and leads the roll of harm: 3 dead and 78 hurt on that corridor alone. Avenue D and 3rd Avenue follow (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)>https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)</a>. The worst hour is late afternoon. Around 4 p.m. more people die here than at any other hour (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)>https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)</a>.</p><p>In the past 12 months District 2 recorded 1,053 crashes, 2 deaths and 17 serious injuries. Since 2022 the toll stands at 16 dead, 30 seriously injured and 1,784 people hurt in total (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)>https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)</a>.</p><p>Promises and pavement
Fourteenth Street is slated for a redesign next year. As NY1 put it, “The redesign aims to improve the pedestrian experience.” (<a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/15/redesign-of-14th-street-to-kick-off-next-year)>http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/15/redesign-of-14th-street-to-kick-off-next-year)</a>. After two people were killed near Canal and Bowery, the city moved to harden that intersection. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, “We are taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection” (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street)>https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street)</a>. Advocates warned that most of the corridor will remain deadly even after these changes (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street)>https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street)</a>.</p><p>Rivera’s record
Council Member Carlina Rivera co-sponsored a bill to impose penalties on property owners who fail to repair sidewalks (Int 1320-2025) and backed a measure to ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and scale up daylighting at intersections (Int 1138-2024) (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx)>https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx)</a>. Those measures help. They do not stop a bus at 3rd Avenue.</p><p>Local patterns, clear fixes
City data flags several recurring causes: broad &ldquo;other&rdquo; classifications, vulnerable road-user error, and unsafe speed among the top contributing factors. Driver inattention and disregarded traffic-control appear frequently. Heavy vehicles dominate deaths: cars and SUVs plus trucks and buses account for 10 pedestrian deaths and 343 injury cases combined in the current period (vehicle rollup) (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)>https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)</a>.</p><p>Name the hotspots: FDR Drive and 3rd Avenue. Those are repeat blocks. They need the standard tools: daylight the corners, raise the curb, install hardened turn protections and leading pedestrian intervals (LPIs). Make no-turn-on-red the rule where loading and transit conflicts create blind turns. Target enforcement and signal-timing fixes to the 4–8 p.m. surge when crashes and deaths spike (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)>https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)</a>.</p><p>Political solutions — local to citywide
Local fixes save lives on these blocks. But the leverage is citywide policy. Lower New York City’s default speed limit to 20 mph. Require intelligent speed-assistance devices or limiters on vehicles belonging to habitual speeders. Those two moves — systemic speed reduction and forced limiters for repeat offenders — cut the lethality of crashes across every neighborhood.</p><p>What to do now</p><ol><li>Install LPIs and daylighting at the busiest crossings on FDR Drive and 3rd Avenue. 2) Harden turns with concrete curb extensions and barriers at repeat hotspots. 3) Set signal timing and targeted enforcement for the 4–8 p.m. surge. Pair these with a citywide 20 mph default and mandate speed limiters for habitual speeders.</li></ol><p>Call. Write. Show up.

According to the police report, a 2012 Acura sedan experienced 'Tire Failure/Inadequate,' causing the vehicle to veer off course and strike a parked Hyundai sedan.

No contributing factors are listed for the victim beyond the tire failure. The parked Hyundai was unoccupied. The police report makes clear that the crash was set in motion by the mechanical failure, with the Acura's driver losing control and the vehicle striking a stationary car.

The injured man, operating the e-scooter, suffered severe bleeding and abdominal trauma, with the report noting he was 'trapped.' Police cite 'View Obstructed/Limited' and 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as contributing factors, underscoring driver error and systemic hazards at this intersection. The bus's right rear quarter panel and the scooter's front end bore the brunt of the impact. No mention is made of victim behavior as a contributing factor.

The report states the 19-year-old rider was ejected, landing hard on the asphalt, bleeding severely from his eye but remaining conscious. The police report lists 'Following Too Closely' as the contributing factor in the collision. The rear cyclist's failure to maintain a safe distance led directly to the violent impact, sending the victim forward onto the street. The report describes the point of impact as the right rear bumper of the lead bike and the left front quarter panel of the trailing bike. No information is provided about helmet use or other victim behaviors. The crash highlights the persistent danger when riders are not given adequate space, even on city streets dominated by vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
