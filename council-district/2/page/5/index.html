The law requires the Department of Transportation to publish a monthly-updated, searchable map of all city bike lanes. The map must show obstructions, construction, crash patterns, shared paths, conflict points, resurfacing, parking, bike share docks, open streets, repair shops, and reporting tools. The bill’s matter title reads: 'requiring the department of transportation to develop a map of bicycle infrastructure conditions.' Council Member Crystal Hudson sponsored the bill, joined by Rivera, Sanchez, Stevens, Yeger, Restler, Avilés, and others. The law brings sunlight to hidden hazards, giving vulnerable road users the facts they need to see the city’s dangers in plain sight.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
