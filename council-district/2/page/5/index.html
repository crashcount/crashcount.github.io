The grant, part of the federal RAISE program, aims to fix the city’s fragmented, poorly maintained greenways. Senator Chuck Schumer championed the funding, saying, 'We secured $7.25 million in funding from @USDOT to expand New York City's majestic greenway system!' Council Member Carlina Rivera stressed, 'New York City’s greenway system is currently a collection of fragments. We want to change that.' The City Council is considering a 'greenways master plan' bill to mandate completion and upkeep of the network. Jon Orcutt, Bike New York, called the grant 'foundational.' The money will not build paths yet, but it forces the city to plan for a safer, connected future for cyclists and pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The inspectors will check construction sites that spill into bike lanes and ensure contractors provide safe temporary lanes. The job listing, posted June 2, 2022, follows Rivera’s push for accountability: 'charged with checking out construction sites that spill into bike lanes to make sure that contractors provide safe temporary bike lanes.' Rivera sponsored the bill. The need is urgent. Cyclists Lin Wen-Chiang and Carlos Martinez died after encountering dangerous street conditions left by construction. The city’s action aims to prevent more deaths by enforcing rules and holding contractors accountable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, not tied to a specific bill, saw Council Members Jennifer Gutiérrez, Julie Menin, Alexa Avilés, and Carlina Rivera demand urgent safety upgrades. The matter summary reads: 'City lawmakers and transportation and education advocates expressed outrage over a recent Streetsblog report on dangerous school streets, demanding the city do more to prevent drivers from harming children outside schools.' Lawmakers called the findings 'egregious' and 'unconscionable.' They urged more crossing guards, traffic calming, and car-free hours. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez signaled openness to restricting cars during key times. The council’s stance is clear: the city’s inaction puts children, especially those of color, at deadly risk. Lawmakers want swift, systemic change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, discussed at Brooklyn Community Boards 10 and 11, aims to fix potholes, resurface the path, and repair the seawall. The presentation, however, lacked any guarantee of a safe alternate route for cyclists and pedestrians. Brooklyn Borough Commissioner Martin Maher admitted, 'I can't make any promises.' Council Member Carlina Rivera’s office noted her bill would require protections for cyclists around work zones, highlighting the gap in current planning. Executive Director Terri Carta of the Brooklyn Greenway Initiative said, 'NYC Parks and DOT need to provide a safe alternative for greenway users during construction.' Despite DOT’s willingness to help, no concrete detour exists.

Transportation Alternatives backed the bills, pushing for more pedestrian and green space. Dr. Arline Bronzaft and other experts criticized the Health Department's inaction.
