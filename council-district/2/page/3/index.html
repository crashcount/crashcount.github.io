The driver crashed at Dyckman St., and the car caught fire. The officers 'fled the scene, leaving him to die in the fiery wreck,' then returned to their Bronx precinct without reporting the crash. Surveillance footage showed their patrol car leaving. The NYPD suspended both officers and launched an investigation. This comes after new pursuit policies were enacted in February, restricting chases to felony or violent misdemeanor cases. The guidelines aimed to curb 'unnecessary police pursuits that lead to crashes and injure other motorists and pedestrians.'
