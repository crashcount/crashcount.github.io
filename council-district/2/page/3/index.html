On 2025-06-16 a bus going straight struck a 49-year-old man at 3rd Avenue and East 28th Street. He died at the scene, according to city crash records (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)>https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)</a>. Last summer a taxi hit a 79-year-old woman at Bowery and East 4th Street. She died there as well (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)>https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)</a>.</p><p>FDR Drive slices the district’s edge and leads the roll of harm: 3 dead and 78 hurt on that corridor alone. Avenue D and 3rd Avenue follow (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)>https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)</a>. The worst hour is late afternoon. Around 4 p.m. more people die here than at any other hour (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)>https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)</a>.</p><p>In the past 12 months District 2 recorded 1,053 crashes, 2 deaths and 17 serious injuries. Since 2022 the toll stands at 16 dead, 30 seriously injured and 1,784 people hurt in total (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)>https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)</a>.</p><p>Promises and pavement
Fourteenth Street is slated for a redesign next year. As NY1 put it, “The redesign aims to improve the pedestrian experience.” (<a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/15/redesign-of-14th-street-to-kick-off-next-year)>http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/15/redesign-of-14th-street-to-kick-off-next-year)</a>. After two people were killed near Canal and Bowery, the city moved to harden that intersection. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, “We are taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection” (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street)>https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street)</a>. Advocates warned that most of the corridor will remain deadly even after these changes (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street)>https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street)</a>.</p><p>Rivera’s record
Council Member Carlina Rivera co-sponsored a bill to impose penalties on property owners who fail to repair sidewalks (Int 1320-2025) and backed a measure to ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and scale up daylighting at intersections (Int 1138-2024) (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx)>https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx)</a>. Those measures help. They do not stop a bus at 3rd Avenue.</p><p>Local patterns, clear fixes
City data flags several recurring causes: broad &ldquo;other&rdquo; classifications, vulnerable road-user error, and unsafe speed among the top contributing factors. Driver inattention and disregarded traffic-control appear frequently. Heavy vehicles dominate deaths: cars and SUVs plus trucks and buses account for 10 pedestrian deaths and 343 injury cases combined in the current period (vehicle rollup) (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)>https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)</a>.</p><p>Name the hotspots: FDR Drive and 3rd Avenue. Those are repeat blocks. They need the standard tools: daylight the corners, raise the curb, install hardened turn protections and leading pedestrian intervals (LPIs). Make no-turn-on-red the rule where loading and transit conflicts create blind turns. Target enforcement and signal-timing fixes to the 4–8 p.m. surge when crashes and deaths spike (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)>https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)</a>.</p><p>Political solutions — local to citywide
Local fixes save lives on these blocks. But the leverage is citywide policy. Lower New York City’s default speed limit to 20 mph. Require intelligent speed-assistance devices or limiters on vehicles belonging to habitual speeders. Those two moves — systemic speed reduction and forced limiters for repeat offenders — cut the lethality of crashes across every neighborhood.</p><p>What to do now</p><ol><li>Install LPIs and daylighting at the busiest crossings on FDR Drive and 3rd Avenue. 2) Harden turns with concrete curb extensions and barriers at repeat hotspots. 3) Set signal timing and targeted enforcement for the 4–8 p.m. surge. Pair these with a citywide 20 mph default and mandate speed limiters for habitual speeders.</li></ol><p>Call. Write. Show up.

Law says cyclists can cross with pedestrians. NYPD ignores it. Tickets pile up. One rider fights back in court. The city’s policy stands, unmoved by the law.</p><p class=mb3>According to the New York Post (May 13, 2025), cyclist Oliver Casey Esparza filed a federal lawsuit against the NYPD, alleging officers wrongfully ticket cyclists for running red lights even when they follow pedestrian crossing signals, as permitted by a 2019 City Council law. The suit claims, 'the city maintains a policy and practice of detaining, ticketing, and prosecuting cyclists who lawfully ride through an intersection when the pedestrian control signal indicates white/walk.' Esparza received a $190 summons at Third Avenue and East 42nd Street, Manhattan, despite acting within the law. The lawsuit names current and former NYPD commissioners, accusing them of knowingly violating civil rights. The article notes a sharp rise in tickets for cyclists in early 2025. The NYPD declined to comment. The case highlights a gap between city law and police enforcement, raising questions about policy compliance and systemic accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
