Twenty-eight left with wounds that will not heal. In District 2, the numbers do not tell the whole story, but they do not lie. <strong>In the last twelve months alone: 4 killed, 16 seriously injured, 504 hurt.</strong></p><p>A 29-year-old man was run down at East 4th and Avenue D. The driver made a U-turn, aimed, and hit him. The man lived. The driver vanished. No arrests. <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/driver-strikes-lower-east-side-pedestrian-06022025/>The Brooklyn Paper called it &ldquo;shocking.&rdquo;</a></p><p>A cyclist in the West Village was crushed in a hit-and-run. He woke up in an ambulance. The driver ran a red, hit him, reversed, and sped off.

Cars and SUVs killed seven. Trucks and buses killed two. Bikes hurt twenty-seven, but killed none. The old, the young, the ones just crossing the street. A baby boy hit by a taxi on East 11th. An elderly woman struck by a turning pickup. The city keeps moving. The bodies pile up.</p><h3 id=riveras-record-steps-forward-steps-stalled>Rivera’s Record: Steps Forward, Steps Stalled</h3><p>Council Member Carlina Rivera has signed her name to bills that matter. She voted to end jaywalking penalties, so police cannot blame the dead for crossing the street (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ending jaywalking penalties</a>). She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, pushing for lower speed limits and safer roads. She led the charge for a <a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/nyc-greenway-plan-bike-pedestrian-city-council/>citywide greenway plan</a>, promising real space for people on foot and bike.</p><p>But the work is not done. <strong>Every day without a citywide 20 mph limit is another day of risk.</strong> Cameras that catch speeders are set to expire unless Albany acts. The council can push harder. The mayor can act now. The blood is still fresh.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Call Rivera. Call the mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand cameras that never go dark.</strong> Join the fight.

The matter’s summary: 'require license and registration for all types of e-bikes.' Council Members Keith Powers and Julie Menin support the bill; Carlina Rivera has not signed on. The committee’s resolution states the proposal would negatively impact all cyclists, especially delivery workers, and fails to address illegal mopeds or require point-of-sale registration. Critics argue the bill is regressive, ineffective, and would not improve safety for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill moved through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, passing on October 19, 2023, and became law on November 19, 2023. The law states: 'The department shall prioritize and promote...the safety of all street users...and improving equity in infrastructure investment.' Sponsored by Kevin C. Riley (primary), with Brooks-Powers, Narcisse, Hanif, Brewer, Restler, and Rivera as co-sponsors, the bill demands DOT report, by neighborhood, on safety infrastructure investment, crash rates, and demographics. It shines a light on which districts get safety upgrades and which are left exposed. The roadmap aims to close the gap for underserved areas, forcing transparency and accountability for every dollar spent on street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law, sponsored by Gale A. Brewer with co-sponsors including Erik D. Bottcher, Lincoln Restler, and others, amends the city code to require the Department of Transportation to report on vehicles with license plates unreadable by photo violation monitoring systems. The law’s title states it is 'in relation to reporting on motor vehicles with license plates that are unreadable by photo violation monitoring systems.' DOT must post quarterly reports showing the time, location, and reasons plates evade cameras—whether by concealment, distortion, or missing tags. The law aims to expose drivers who dodge automated enforcement, shining light on a loophole that puts pedestrians and cyclists at risk. The reports must be public and sent to the Mayor and Council Speaker.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill sits with the transportation and infrastructure committee and has 18 co-sponsors. It would require the Department of Transportation to create a searchable, real-time map of all city bike lanes, including details on construction obstacles, detours, bike parking, and micromobility stations. The measure aims to help the estimated 550,000 daily cyclists navigate safer routes. Rivera said, 'This would inform both cyclists on their daily rides and provide a new way for communities to rally and advocate for safety improvements.' The bill arrives as the city faces renewed debate over bike lane safety after a serious crash on the Manhattan Bridge.
