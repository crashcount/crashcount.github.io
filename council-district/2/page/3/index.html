Twenty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 1,600 hurt. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. They are the man crushed by a bus at 28th and 3rd. The woman struck down by a taxi at Bowery and East 4th. The bodies pile up, slow and steady, year after year.</p><p>Just last month, a city worker was slashed by an e-bike rider after a near-miss at Broadway and Cedar. The DOT called it <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/dot-worker-slashed-by-e-biker-manhattan/>&ldquo;an abhorrent assault of a NYC DOT employee who performs critical work to keep our city moving&rdquo;</a>. The blood washed off the sidewalk. The fear lingers.</p><p><strong>Cars and trucks do most of the killing.</strong> Seven dead by sedan or SUV. Three by bus or truck. Bikes and mopeds injure, but it is the weight of steel that ends lives. A food cart, unhitched from a van, slammed into a parked car with a woman and child inside. Police found the van packed with propane and gasoline. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/cops-bust-minivan-driver-in-manhattan-for-carrying-propane-tanks/>&ldquo;Firefighters forced entry into the van, removing 76 20-pound propane cylinders and 15 five-gallon fuel containers,&rdquo;</a> the Daily News reported. The city was lucky. This time.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-missed>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Missed</h3><p>Council Member Carlina Rivera has backed bills to clear abandoned cars from crosswalks, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>voting yes to remove street hazards</a>. She co-sponsored a law to speed up pavement markings, another to force sidewalk repairs. She signed on to a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, demanding daylight for every intersection. But she missed a key committee vote on removing derelict vehicles. The work is not done. The streets are not safe.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by the city, by its leaders, by those who look away. The dead cannot call for change. The living must.</p><p><strong>Call Council Member Rivera. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand every crosswalk be cleared, every bike lane protected, every reckless driver stopped.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Act now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report describes the vehicle's center front end as the point of impact, with damage matching the collision.

He lay on the pavement, semiconscious, as the light dimmed and the street watched in silence.' The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified.' No driver errors are explicitly cited in the report, but the collision occurred as the taxi proceeded straight ahead and the pedestrian was not at an intersection.

Williams was struck, thrown, and died from his injuries. The article states, “An officer pursuing dirt bikers suddenly crossed the double yellow line into Williams' path, causing a collision.” Another NYPD vehicle attempted a similar maneuver. The family’s attorney called it a “deadly maneuver” for a minor violation. The city later billed Williams’ family for police vehicle damages. The NYPD has not commented, citing litigation. The case raises questions about police pursuit tactics and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
