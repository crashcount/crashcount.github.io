Since 2022, 15 people have died and 28 have been seriously injured in traffic crashes here (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). In the last year alone, the toll stands at 2 dead, 15 seriously hurt, 524 injured—each number a life changed or ended (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The dead are not just numbers. On June 16, 2025, a pedestrian was killed by a bus at 3rd Avenue and East 28th. The cause: driver inattention (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data CrashID 4820937</a>). A 79-year-old woman died at Bowery and East 4th, struck by a taxi. The report lists her as “crossing against signal.” Only one person died that day. It was not the driver (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data CrashID 4735570</a>).</p><p>Cars and trucks do the most damage. In three years, they killed 7 and injured nearly 300 pedestrians. Buses and trucks killed 3 more. Bikes, mopeds, and motorcycles injured dozens, but killed none (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-gaps>Leadership: Progress and Gaps</h3><p>Council Member Carlina Rivera has backed bills that matter. She voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the vulnerable and left drivers untouched. She co-sponsored the <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>SAFE Streets Act</a>, pushing for lower speed limits and more rights for crash victims. She voted yes on <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>daylighting</a>, a law to clear parked cars from crosswalks and give children and elders a fighting chance to be seen.</p><p>But the crisis is not over. The city can now set a 20 mph speed limit. It has not. The dead keep coming. The numbers do not lie.</p><h3 id=the-system-is-the-killer>The System Is the Killer</h3><p>&ldquo;Completion of the Queens Boulevard redesign has reduced fatalities by 68% since work began in 2015,&rdquo; the city <a href="https://www.amny.com/news/dot-completion-of-queens-boulevard-redesign/#:~:text=phase%20of%20the%20Queens%20Boulevard,since%20work%20began%20in%202015">said</a>. The lesson is plain: street design saves lives. Enforcement and education are not enough. The city must act, not just talk.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-demand-now>Call to Action: Demand More, Demand Now</h3><p>Every day of delay is another family broken.

Williams was struck, thrown, and died from his injuries. The article states, “An officer pursuing dirt bikers suddenly crossed the double yellow line into Williams' path, causing a collision.” Another NYPD vehicle attempted a similar maneuver. The family’s attorney called it a “deadly maneuver” for a minor violation. The city later billed Williams’ family for police vehicle damages. The NYPD has not commented, citing litigation. The case raises questions about police pursuit tactics and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Police cite 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as contributing factors. The narrative details: 'A man stepped into the crosswalk, light in his favor. A bike cut through the dusk. Its front wheel struck his arm. Skin tore. Blood spilled.' The pedestrian, age 38, suffered injuries to the elbow and lower arm and remained conscious at the scene. The police report explicitly notes the pedestrian was 'Crossing With Signal.' The focus remains on the cyclist’s failure to yield and inattention, which led to the injury.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The cyclist suffered severe crush injuries to her lower leg, described as 'knee-lower leg foot' injuries with an injury severity level of 3. The report states she was 'riding with traffic' when the Ford turned into her path. The Ford was making a left turn while the cyclist was going straight ahead. The police data lists contributing factors as 'Unspecified' and does not explicitly cite driver errors such as failure to yield, but the collision highlights the danger posed by turning vehicles to cyclists lawfully riding in the lane. No cyclist behaviors are noted as contributing factors. The cyclist was wearing pads only and was incoherent after the crash, standing in shock with blood at the curb and her bike broken.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
