Since 2022, 15 people have died and 28 have been seriously injured in traffic crashes here (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). In the last year alone, the toll stands at 2 dead, 15 seriously hurt, 524 injured—each number a life changed or ended (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The dead are not just numbers. On June 16, 2025, a pedestrian was killed by a bus at 3rd Avenue and East 28th. The cause: driver inattention (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data CrashID 4820937</a>). A 79-year-old woman died at Bowery and East 4th, struck by a taxi. The report lists her as “crossing against signal.” Only one person died that day. It was not the driver (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data CrashID 4735570</a>).</p><p>Cars and trucks do the most damage. In three years, they killed 7 and injured nearly 300 pedestrians. Buses and trucks killed 3 more. Bikes, mopeds, and motorcycles injured dozens, but killed none (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-gaps>Leadership: Progress and Gaps</h3><p>Council Member Carlina Rivera has backed bills that matter. She voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the vulnerable and left drivers untouched. She co-sponsored the <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>SAFE Streets Act</a>, pushing for lower speed limits and more rights for crash victims. She voted yes on <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>daylighting</a>, a law to clear parked cars from crosswalks and give children and elders a fighting chance to be seen.</p><p>But the crisis is not over. The city can now set a 20 mph speed limit. It has not. The dead keep coming. The numbers do not lie.</p><h3 id=the-system-is-the-killer>The System Is the Killer</h3><p>&ldquo;Completion of the Queens Boulevard redesign has reduced fatalities by 68% since work began in 2015,&rdquo; the city <a href="https://www.amny.com/news/dot-completion-of-queens-boulevard-redesign/#:~:text=phase%20of%20the%20Queens%20Boulevard,since%20work%20began%20in%202015">said</a>. The lesson is plain: street design saves lives. Enforcement and education are not enough. The city must act, not just talk.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-demand-now>Call to Action: Demand More, Demand Now</h3><p>Every day of delay is another family broken.

No contributing factors are listed for the victim beyond the tire failure. The parked Hyundai was unoccupied. The police report makes clear that the crash was set in motion by the mechanical failure, with the Acura's driver losing control and the vehicle striking a stationary car.

The injured man, operating the e-scooter, suffered severe bleeding and abdominal trauma, with the report noting he was 'trapped.' Police cite 'View Obstructed/Limited' and 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as contributing factors, underscoring driver error and systemic hazards at this intersection. The bus's right rear quarter panel and the scooter's front end bore the brunt of the impact. No mention is made of victim behavior as a contributing factor.

The report states the 19-year-old rider was ejected, landing hard on the asphalt, bleeding severely from his eye but remaining conscious. The police report lists 'Following Too Closely' as the contributing factor in the collision. The rear cyclist's failure to maintain a safe distance led directly to the violent impact, sending the victim forward onto the street. The report describes the point of impact as the right rear bumper of the lead bike and the left front quarter panel of the trailing bike. No information is provided about helmet use or other victim behaviors.
