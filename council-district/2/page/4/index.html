Sixteen seriously hurt.</strong> Four hundred seventy-seven injured in the last year alone. Each number is a body broken, a life changed. The dead do not speak, but the silence is heavy on Avenue D, East 4th, and the FDR.</p><p>Just this spring, a taxi hit a baby boy on East 11th Street. A cyclist struck a pedestrian’s head. A pickup truck turned left and knocked down an elderly man. These are not rare events. They are the daily price paid by people who walk, bike, or simply cross the street.</p><h2 id=the-system-fails-the-vulnerable>The System Fails the Vulnerable</h2><p><strong>Cars and trucks do the most harm.</strong> In three years, they killed seven people and left hundreds more with wounds that do not heal. Bikes and mopeds hurt, too, but the carnage is not the same. The city’s own data shows who pays the price: the old, the young, the ones on foot.</p><p>The city passed a law last fall to end jaywalking tickets. Now, people can cross where they need to, without fear of a summons. The Council said yes. The law’s aim is simple: streets are for people, not just cars. Still, the danger remains. The curb is not a shield.</p><h2 id=riveras-record-progress-and-gaps>Rivera’s Record: Progress and Gaps</h2><p>Council Member Carlina Rivera has backed bills to daylight intersections, slow cars near schools, and legalize crossing mid-block. She <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>voted to let pedestrians cross anywhere, ending the old blame game</a>. She co-sponsored laws to add more bike lanes, fix sidewalks, and redesign truck routes. But the work is not done. The streets are still not safe for the most vulnerable.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;One with moderate injuries that required extrication, 10 patients with minor injuries all transported to local area hospitals,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/port-authority-bus-terminal-accident-nyc/>said FDNY Deputy Chief Jason Saffon after a bus crash at Port Authority</a>. The system strains under the weight of its own failures.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every death, every injury, is a choice made by those in power. The council can lower speed limits. They can build more protected lanes. They can ban parking near crosswalks. They can act now.</p><p><strong>Call Council Member Rivera. Demand safer speeds. Demand streets that put people first.</strong> The dead cannot speak, but you can.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Council notes that illegal, unregistered mopeds endanger pedestrians, cyclists, and riders. NYPD seized over 8,600 illegal mopeds by September 2023. The resolution presses for safeguards to keep unlicensed, unregistered vehicles off city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by dozens of co-sponsors. The law mandates daylighting—removing parking near intersections—to clear sight lines for drivers and protect people crossing. DOT must consult with safety groups, residents, and businesses, and replace truck route signage for better clarity. The law sets deadlines: initial report by November 2023, implementation by June 2024, and new signage by July 2024.
