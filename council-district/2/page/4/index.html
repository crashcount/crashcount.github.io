Since 2022, 15 people have died in crashes here. Twenty-eight more were seriously injured. These are not just numbers—they are mothers, sons, neighbors. A 79-year-old woman struck dead in a crosswalk at Bowery and East 4th. A 31-year-old woman killed by an SUV on the FDR. A 49-year-old man crushed by a bus at 3rd Avenue and 28th. The city records the deaths. The families keep the grief, as shown in <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=the-latest-blows>The Latest Blows</h3><p>The violence does not stop. In June, a bus killed a man at 3rd Avenue. Last summer, a sedan hit a 59-year-old man on the FDR. The stories repeat. Cars and trucks did most of the killing—7 deaths, 6 serious injuries. Buses and trucks took 3 more lives. Bikes left 5 people with serious injuries, but no deaths. The street does not care who you are. It only takes.</p><h3 id=leadership-small-steps-slow-change>Leadership: Small Steps, Slow Change</h3><p>Council Member Carlina Rivera has backed some bills to clear crosswalks and fix broken sidewalks. She voted to remove abandoned vehicles and speed up pavement markings. She co-sponsored a bill to fine property owners who leave sidewalks cracked and dangerous. But the pace is slow. The city still allows cars to hide pedestrians at corners. The council still debates how much to ask of drivers. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/14/civic-panel-dings-adams-for-cutting-bike-and-bus-lanes-out-of-fifth-av-redesign>&ldquo;We need to do something to make sure bicyclists feel safer,&rdquo;</a> said a local leader at a recent hearing, but the lanes are still missing.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p>Fifteen dead. Twenty-eight broken. The street is not safe until the killing stops. Call Council Member Rivera. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand action, not delay. The next name on the list could be yours.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report states the 19-year-old rider was ejected, landing hard on the asphalt, bleeding severely from his eye but remaining conscious. The police report lists 'Following Too Closely' as the contributing factor in the collision. The rear cyclist's failure to maintain a safe distance led directly to the violent impact, sending the victim forward onto the street. The report describes the point of impact as the right rear bumper of the lead bike and the left front quarter panel of the trailing bike. No information is provided about helmet use or other victim behaviors. The crash highlights the persistent danger when riders are not given adequate space, even on city streets dominated by vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
