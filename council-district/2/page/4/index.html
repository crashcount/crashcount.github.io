The report states: 'A bus turned right. The rear wheel struck a man’s head. He was 45. Blood pooled on the pavement. The bus showed no damage. He died where he fell.' The pedestrian was at the intersection, engaged in 'other actions in roadway' as described in the report. The vehicle, a 2018 bus, was undamaged and driven by a licensed male driver. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified.' No driver errors are explicitly cited, but the narrative centers the lethal consequences of a turning bus and the vulnerability of those on foot. No mention of pedestrian behavior as a contributing factor appears in the data.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
