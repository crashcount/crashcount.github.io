Police said they were seeking the vehicle and, early on, that it might have been a garbage truck.

From midnight to 5 a.m., the toll rises, then again at 3–4 a.m., and at 11 p.m. Three more deaths hit at 11 p.m.; two at 3 a.m.; two at 4 a.m. (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li></ul><p>Three corners.

It’s laid over in committee (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1138-2024</a>).</li><li>Harden turns and add leading pedestrian intervals at Broadway, Atlantic, and Bedford.

Small fix. Limited reach. It’s done (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 0193-2024</a>).</li><li>The Council also voted to speed removal of derelict cars that block views and crosswalks. That helps clear sightlines (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 0857-2024</a>).</li></ul><p>The pattern does not break.</p><ul><li>In the last 12 months here: 1,532 crashes, 5 dead, 940 injured.

Barriers, granite, planters—hard lines drawn. Sightlines open. Pedestrians and cyclists step forward, visible. Intersections, once blind, now clear. The city moves to cut the toll where most blood spills.</p><p class=mb3>amNY reported on June 11, 2025, that the NYC Department of Transportation will redesign intersections to protect pedestrians and cyclists. The plan uses 'hardened daylighting'—physical barriers, granite blocks, and planters—to stop vehicles from parking near corners. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' Nearly half of city traffic deaths happen at intersections. The new design will first appear at high-crash sites in Brooklyn, including Ocean Avenue at Church Avenue and several others. The move highlights a systemic effort to address visibility failures and reduce deadly conflicts at crossings.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
