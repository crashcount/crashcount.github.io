Nine more have life-altering injuries. In the last twelve months, <strong>659 people have been hurt in 1,152 crashes</strong> in District 36, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. The dead are not numbers. They are a pregnant woman dragged under an SUV on Van Buren Street. A senior struck crossing Broadway. A child who never made it home. The street keeps their silence. The city moves on.</p><p>A witness saw it all. &ldquo;They dragged her like to the middle of the street, and then they turned wrong up Lafayette and she was just left there,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/25/brooklyn-bed-stuy-fatal-hit-run-woman-gets-out-of-car/>said Shane Bridges</a>. The driver fled. The family waits for justice that may never come.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>SUVs killed more pedestrians here than any other vehicle.</strong> Four deaths, forty-two injuries, four serious injuries. Trucks, sedans, bikes, mopeds—they all leave scars, but the big cars do the worst. The city blames distraction, inattention, speed. The result is always the same: bodies in the road, families broken.</p><p>Tiffany Cifuni&rsquo;s husband said it plain: &ldquo;I lost my whole family tonight and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever be the same&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/husband-mourns-pregnant-wife-run-over-by-hit-run-driver-in-brooklyn-fender-bender-clash/>he told the Daily News</a>. The words hang in the air. The street does not care who you are.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>Council Member Chi Ossé has backed bills for <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/protected-bike-lanes-coming-bedford-avenue/>protected bike lanes</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>banning parking near crosswalks</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalizing jaywalking</a>—measures that shift the burden off the most vulnerable. Ossé demanded a redesign of Atlantic Avenue, calling it &ldquo;one of the most dangerous corridors in the entire borough&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/02/06/atlantic-avenue-dot-no-road-diet-redesign>at a Council hearing</a>. He pushed for the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane after years of delay (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/03/19/osse-bedford-ave-bike-lane-is-stuck-in-dots-community-engagement-purgatory>Streetsblog</a>). But the city drags its feet. Promises stack up. Asphalt stays the same.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by leaders who stall, delay, or look away. If you want change, make them feel it. Call Council Member Ossé. Demand safer streets. Demand action before another family is left with nothing but grief.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The city put it in last year to tame a deadly stretch. Now, cyclists and pedestrians lose their shield. The street grows more dangerous. Safety for Brooklyn’s most vulnerable is stripped away.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13, 2025, Mayor Adams announced the removal of the protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue, Brooklyn. The lane, installed in 2024, calmed a corridor once plagued by crashes and deaths. Streetsblog NYC reported: 'A protected bike lane that was installed last year to calm a notoriously dangerous Brooklyn corridor will be removed by the Adams administration, making the roadway less safe.' Council Members Lincoln Restler and Chi Ossé condemned the move, calling it reckless and political. Brad Lander and Zohran Mamdani joined in opposition. No council bill or committee review occurred; this was a unilateral mayoral action. Removing the lane eliminates a proven safety intervention, increasing risk for cyclists and pedestrians and discouraging active transportation, which undermines safety in numbers and equitable street access.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Ossé, Nantasha M. Williams, Alexa Avilés, Crystal Hudson, Carlina Rivera, and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams as co-sponsors.

According to police, the driver, Tanisha Simpson, "swiped an oncoming car," then "drove away, dragging the person several feet and hitting another car with a pregnant woman inside." She struck a third, empty car before New York City Sheriffs arrested her nearby. The pregnant woman was taken to the hospital for evaluation, but no serious injuries were reported. Simpson faces charges of reckless endangerment, assault, and leaving the scene.
