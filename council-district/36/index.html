A car does not stop. In the last twelve months, <strong>three people died</strong> on the streets of District 36. <strong>Eight more suffered serious injuries</strong>. The numbers do not tell you about the silence after a body falls, or the families left waiting for someone who will not come home. In May, a 32-year-old woman was killed by an SUV on Marcus Garvey Boulevard. In October, a 49-year-old man died at Bedford and Lafayette. In August, a 63-year-old man was struck and killed by an SUV at Broadway and Myrtle. The street does not care about age or time of day. It takes who it wants.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-cost>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Cost</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the killing.</strong> In the last three years, they were involved in 431 crashes that injured or killed pedestrians. Trucks and buses added 34 more. Bikes and mopeds, just 22. The violence is not random. It is heavy, fast, and metal. The dead are mostly on foot. The drivers keep moving.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>Council Member Chi Ossé has spoken up for safer streets. He called the delay of the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane &ldquo;unacceptable&rdquo; and demanded action from the city, saying, <em>&ldquo;The Bedford Avenue bike lane has been unacceptably dangerous since it was first laid, and for years, the people of my district have been promised that it would be protected&rdquo;</em> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/11/02/council-member-chi-osse-blasts-dot-for-delaying-and-maybe-killing-bedford-ave-bike-lane>Streetsblog NYC</a>). He co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, legalize crossing mid-block, and force the city to build more protected bike lanes. But the deaths keep coming. The city moves slow. The street moves fast.</p><h3 id=the-call-demand-more-demand-now>The Call: Demand More, Demand Now</h3><p><strong>No one should die crossing the street.</strong> Call Council Member Ossé. Call the Mayor. Tell them to finish the Bedford Avenue bike lane. Tell them to make every crossing safe. Tell them to act before another family waits for someone who will not come home.</p><p><strong>Do not wait.

The plan includes concrete bus boarding islands and may reduce car lanes, giving more space to pedestrians and buses.

Ossé (primary sponsor), Crystal Hudson, Lincoln Restler, and Tiffany Cabán back the measure. The cards, handed out by NYPD union members, let friends and relatives skirt penalties for traffic violations. The practice breeds unequal enforcement. A 2024 lawsuit exposed how officers faced pressure to honor these cards, even after a $175,000 city settlement. The bill demands an end to this shadow system.
