Nineteen more are seriously injured.</strong> Since 2022, there have been over 4,700 crashes, shattering bodies and families. The dead include a four-year-old boy, an elderly man, and a woman crushed by SUVs. The living carry scars and empty chairs at the table.</p><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> Five pedestrians died under the wheels of SUVs. Trucks, buses, and bikes left their own marks, but the carnage is driven by steel and speed. The stories are always the same. A man steps off the curb. A child crosses the street. The car does not stop. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-no-end-in-sight>Recent Crashes: No End in Sight</h3><p>The violence does not slow. In May, a woman was killed on Van Buren Street, crushed by two SUVs and a sedan. In October, a man died at the intersection of Lafayette and Bedford. A four-year-old was killed last year, riding with family. <strong>No warning. No time to react.</strong></p><p>Neighbors know the danger. After a hit-and-run killed two men in Brooklyn, one said, <strong>&ldquo;drivers speed on that stretch of roadway&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>CBS New York</a>). The city blames distraction, inattention, and inexperience. The result is always the same: bodies on the ground.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-delays-and-small-steps>Leadership: Promises, Delays, and Small Steps</h3><p>Council Member Chi Ossé has spoken up for safety. He called out the city for delaying a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue, writing, <strong>&ldquo;The Bedford Avenue bike lane has been unacceptably dangerous since it was first laid, and for years, the people of my district have been promised that it would be protected&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/11/02/council-member-chi-osse-blasts-dot-for-delaying-and-maybe-killing-bedford-ave-bike-lane>Streetsblog NYC</a>). He voted to remove abandoned vehicles and to require taxi dooring warnings. He co-sponsored bills for daylighting crosswalks and speeding up protected bike lanes. But the pace is slow. The deaths do not wait.</p><h3 id=what-now-demand-action-not-excuses>What Now: Demand Action, Not Excuses</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a policy failure. The city has the power to lower speed limits, redesign streets, and keep crosswalks clear. <strong>Call Council Member Ossé. Demand a protected bike lane on Bedford. Demand daylighting at every corner. Demand a 20 mph speed limit.</strong> Do not wait for another child to die. The blood is already on the street.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The crash happened in a painted, unprotected bike lane. The driver 'failed to yield to the cyclist,' police said, but was not charged. Advocates blame the lack of protected infrastructure: 'The road diet works where it's been installed and it's needed for the entire corridor before this happens again,' said Kevin LaCherra. The city had planned to remove a lane for cars, but left two lanes for traffic and an unprotected bike lane after political intervention.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
