In the last twelve months, three people died and 641 were injured in crashes. Eight suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same. Children are not spared—48 injured, none killed, but luck is not a plan. The numbers do not flinch. They do not lie.</p><h2 id=recent-crashes-no-end-in-sight>Recent Crashes: No End in Sight</h2><p>The horror does not pause. In May, a woman was killed on Van Buren Street, crushed by SUVs and a sedan. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. Last fall, a man died crossing Bedford Avenue at Lafayette. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. The dead do not speak. Their absence is the only testimony.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p>Cars and trucks are the main killers. In three years, they took five lives and left hundreds battered. SUVs alone caused four deaths and over 150 pedestrian injuries. Bikes and mopeds are not blameless, but their toll is a fraction. The street is built for the strong, not the vulnerable.</p><h2 id=leadership-words-votes-and-the-waiting>Leadership: Words, Votes, and the Waiting</h2><p>Council Member Chi Ossé has stood up at times. He backed the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane, calling it a &ldquo;public policy decision with only winners.&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-dot-begins-construction-on-protected-bike-lane-in-bed-stuy>Gothamist</a>. He voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the desperate, not the reckless. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Council record</a>. He co-sponsored bills to speed up protected bike lanes and daylight intersections. But the pace is slow. Promises pile up. The street stays the same.</p><p>When the city ripped out the Bedford Avenue protected lane, Ossé condemned the move. He called it reckless, a step backward for safety. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/13/breaking-mayor-adams-to-remove-bedford-avenue-protected-bike-lane-citing-bizarrely-safety>Streetsblog NYC</a>. But condemnation is not protection. The paint dries. The danger returns.</p><h2 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h2><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Every death is preventable. The city can build real protection. The Council can pass laws that put people before parking. The mayor can enforce the rules. But none of it happens unless you demand it.</p><p>Call your Council Member. Call the Mayor. Demand a street where children can cross without fear.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The city issued over 3,000 warnings during a 90-day grace period. Similar enforcement on Queens-bound trucks led to a 60% drop in overweight vehicles.

The new design 'daylights' corners, using concrete, granite, and planters to keep cars back and create mini-protected bike lanes. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' The agency targeted intersections with a history of turning crashes—Ocean Avenue saw 79 crashes in 2024, injuring 75 people, including 15 pedestrians and 13 cyclists. Advocates praised the move but called for faster, broader use of hard infrastructure. The article notes that most pedestrian injuries and deaths in New York occur at intersections, and that keeping corners clear is standard in other states.

Ossé (primary sponsor), Crystal Hudson, Lincoln Restler, and Tiffany Cabán back the measure. The cards, handed out by NYPD union members, let friends and relatives skirt penalties for traffic violations. The practice breeds unequal enforcement.
