Eighteen more are left with serious injuries.</strong> Since 2022, there have been over 4,500 crashes. The wounds are not just numbers. A four-year-old boy, killed in a crash on Brooklyn Avenue.

Their families do, if anyone listens.</p><h3 id=the-latest-blood-on-the-asphalt>The Latest Blood on the Asphalt</h3><p>Just weeks ago, a child was killed by an SUV in Crown Heights. In May, a woman died on Van Buren. In the last twelve months alone, <strong>three people have died and over 600 have been injured</strong> in this district. The violence is relentless. The most vulnerable—children, the elderly, people walking—pay the highest price. The cars that kill most often are SUVs and sedans. The city’s own data shows it: <strong>SUVs and cars caused five deaths and over 400 injuries to pedestrians here</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=leadership-words-votes-and-the-slow-grind-of-change>Leadership: Words, Votes, and the Slow Grind of Change</h3><p>Council Member Chi Ossé has stood up for safer streets.

Ossé co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and legalize jaywalking—ending a law that punished the vulnerable instead of the reckless (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council Legislation</a>). He demanded a redesign of Atlantic Avenue, calling it &ldquo;one of the most dangerous corridors in the entire borough&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/02/06/atlantic-avenue-dot-no-road-diet-redesign>DOT: Safety Improvements on Atlantic Avenue?</a>).</p><p>But the pace is slow.

The council member has taken steps, but it is not enough. The city must lower speed limits, redesign deadly corridors, and keep protection for those outside the car. <strong>Call Council Member Ossé. Demand faster action. Demand that every street is made safe for the people who walk, bike, and live here.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The law's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to a citywide greenway plan.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors including Rivera, Hudson, and others. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor on October 27, 2022. The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law. The measure compels the city to plan and maintain safe routes for non-drivers, with regular public reporting and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They want special permits to drop parking. They say parking rules drive up costs, block affordable homes, and fuel car use. The message is clear—build for people, not for cars.</p><p class=mb3>On March 1, 2022, Brooklyn politicians announced a push to eliminate mandatory parking minimums for new developments. The action is not a formal bill, but a policy stance led by Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Council Member Lincoln Restler. The group, including Council Members Jennifer Gutierrez, Crystal Hudson, Chi Osse, Sandy Nurse, Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Rita Joseph, and Farah Louis, demands that developers seeking zoning changes first apply for a special permit to waive parking requirements. Restler said, 'Developers need our consent and approval, and we are telling them, plainly, that they have to file for a special permit to end parking requirements.' Reynoso added, 'You don't need to do that anymore.' Avilés called parking mandates a barrier to affordable housing and climate action. The group argues that parking minimums raise construction costs, encourage car use, and block green space. Restler warned he is 'far more likely to vote no' on projects without a parking waiver. Advocates and policy experts back the move, and related state legislation is pending.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
