Eight seriously hurt.</strong> That is the toll in District 36 over the past year. In the last twelve months, there have been <strong>1,098 crashes</strong>—one every eight hours. <strong>628 people injured.</strong> The numbers do not flinch. They do not care who you are. They only climb.</p><p>On May 24, a woman was killed by an SUV on Marcus Garvey Boulevard. She was 32. On October 10, a man died crossing Bedford Avenue. He was 49. On August 30, a 63-year-old man was struck and killed by an SUV on Broadway. The driver was distracted. The man is gone. <strong>No policy, no law, no promise brought him back.</strong></p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>A witness saw the aftermath. &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor.

But the bodies keep coming.</p><p><strong>Every delay is a death sentence for someone.</strong></p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>Call Council Member Ossé.

Introduced February 28, 2024, it amends city law to require the Department of Transportation to expand Open Streets hours on holidays with heavy foot traffic. The bill’s summary reads: 'special activation of the Open Streets program on certain holidays and time periods with significant pedestrian traffic.' Council Member Shekar Krishnan leads as primary sponsor, joined by Rivera, Brooks-Powers, Louis, Nurse, Ossé, Sanchez, Cabán, Banks, Avilés, Riley, Salaam, Hanif, Feliz, Won, Restler, and Joseph. The bill directs DOT to seek community input for more activation days. Applications for these special activations follow the same review as regular Open Streets.

The bill targets a gap: current NYPD reports do not name motor vehicles as a means of force.
