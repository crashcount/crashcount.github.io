Nineteen more are seriously injured.</strong> In just the last twelve months, four lives ended and nine more were shattered. The dead include a four-year-old boy, a 32-year-old woman, and men and women crossing streets, riding bikes, or just sitting in a car. The violence does not stop. It comes on Marcus Garvey Boulevard, on Atlantic Avenue, on Broadway. It comes for the young and the old.</p><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> Of the deaths and injuries to pedestrians, six came from SUVs and cars, none from bikes. Trucks and buses injured dozens, but did not kill. The street is a battlefield, and the most vulnerable lose every time. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=the-faces-behind-the-numbers>The Faces Behind the Numbers</h3><p>A four-year-old boy died in the back seat. A 32-year-old woman was crushed on Van Buren Street. A 49-year-old man was killed at the intersection of Lafayette and Bedford. These are not statistics. They are families left with empty chairs and quiet rooms.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delays>Leadership: Progress and Delays</h3><p>Council Member Chi Ossé has taken some steps. He voted to clear abandoned vehicles from streets, a move to open sightlines and protect walkers and riders. He co-sponsored bills to speed up protected bike lanes and expand open streets. He called out city agencies for delays, saying, &ldquo;The Bedford Avenue bike lane has been unacceptably dangerous since it was first laid, and for years, the people of my district have been promised that it would be protected.&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/11/02/council-member-chi-osse-blasts-dot-for-delaying-and-maybe-killing-bedford-ave-bike-lane>Ossé called out city agencies</a></p><p>But the pace is slow. Promised bike lanes are delayed. Bills to ban parking near crosswalks and to build more protected space for people on foot and bike are stuck in committee. The violence continues while the city debates.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong> Call Council Member Ossé. Demand a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue. Demand daylighting at every crosswalk. Demand a 20 mph speed limit on every street. <strong>Do not wait for another child to die.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The e-bike's center front end crumpled on impact with the SUV's right rear bumper. The police narrative describes the rider as conscious but immobilized on the asphalt, staring at the sky.

The project, which was supposed to upgrade a painted lane to a parking-protected lane, has been pushed to at least next spring. Ossé wrote to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, calling the delay 'unacceptable' and demanding a firm installation date. He stated, 'The Bedford Avenue bike lane has been unacceptably dangerous since it was first laid, and for years, the people of my district have been promised that it would be protected.' Advocacy groups, including Transportation Alternatives, echoed his frustration, citing record cyclist deaths and urgent need for safety. The DOT has not responded to requests for comment.
