Same ending.</p><ul><li>A 47-year-old man was struck and dragged more than 50 feet at Broadway and Suydam around 3:45 a.m. The driver fled. Police said they were seeking the vehicle and, early on, that it might have been a garbage truck. The victim died there in the road (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/police-searching-for-information-on-bushwick-hit-and-run-that-killed-a-pedestrian>Gothamist</a>; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/cops-looking-for-driver-who-fatally-struck-man-on-brooklyn-street/>NY Daily News</a>; <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>A 49-year-old pedestrian died in the crosswalk at Bedford and Lafayette just after 3 a.m. The car’s front end hit him. He never got up (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li></ul><p>“Police were looking … for the driver of a car that struck and dragged a 47-year-old man,” the report said. “Officials said it was not immediately clear whether the man was walking in a crosswalk.” The one fact that is clear: he is dead (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/police-searching-for-information-on-bushwick-hit-and-run-that-killed-a-pedestrian>Gothamist</a>).</p><p>Night after night.</p><ul><li>In this district, deaths spike after dark. From midnight to 5 a.m., the toll rises, then again at 3–4 a.m., and at 11 p.m. Three more deaths hit at 11 p.m.; two at 3 a.m.; two at 4 a.m. (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li></ul><p>Three corners. One fix.</p><ul><li><strong>Broadway</strong> logged one death and 125 injuries. <strong>Atlantic Avenue</strong> logged two deaths and 158 injuries. <strong>Bedford Avenue</strong> logged one death and 70 injuries. These are repeat scenes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>Contributing factors in these crashes include inattention and disregarding signals. “Failure to yield” shows up again and again in the harm, even when it doesn’t end in death (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li></ul><p>Concrete steps:</p><ul><li>Daylight every crosswalk at these corridors. Clear 20 feet of sightlines with barriers and posts. A Council bill would ban parking near crosswalks and order at least 1,000 daylighted intersections a year. It’s laid over in committee (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1138-2024</a>).</li><li>Harden turns and add leading pedestrian intervals at Broadway, Atlantic, and Bedford. Cut the angles that break bodies. Post it. Paint it. Keep it.</li><li>Target late-night hotspots. The data points to the hours. Send the crews to where the blood dries (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li></ul><p>Officials know what works — do they?</p><ul><li>The Council Member for this district pressed DOT to stop delaying the protected Bedford Avenue bike lane. “Unacceptable,” he wrote. The lane “has been unacceptably dangerous since it was first laid.” The delay drags on (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/11/02/council-member-chi-osse-blasts-dot-for-delaying-and-maybe-killing-bedford-ave-bike-lane>Streetsblog</a>).</li><li>The city passed a law to put warning decals on taxi doors to curb dooring. Small fix. Limited reach. It’s done (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 0193-2024</a>).</li><li>The Council also voted to speed removal of derelict cars that block views and crosswalks. That helps clear sightlines (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 0857-2024</a>).</li></ul><p>The pattern does not break.</p><ul><li>In the last 12 months here: 1,532 crashes, 5 dead, 940 injured. This year to date: 1,012 crashes, 3 dead, 628 injured, up sharply from last year at this time (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Period stats</a>).</li><li>Pedestrians bear it. Seven pedestrian deaths since 2022. Hundreds hurt. SUVs lead the harm to people on foot: 175 pedestrian injuries and 5 deaths tied to SUVs, more than any other vehicle type (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>).</li></ul><p>Citywide fixes. Fewer funerals.</p><ul><li><strong>Lower the speed.</strong> New York now has the power to drop residential limits. A 20 mph default cuts the force that kills. The law granting that power exists. The city must choose to use it (<a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>).</li><li><strong>Stop repeat speeders.</strong> Require intelligent speed assistance for drivers who rack up violations. One bill would force it on the worst offenders. Families are already grieving the proof of what repeat speeding does (<a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>).</li></ul><p>One last note.</p><p>At Broadway and Suydam, police said, “A driver struck and killed a 47-year-old pedestrian… then left the scene.” The man stayed where he fell.

The report states the impact was to the center front end of the moped, causing fatal head injuries to the driver, who died at the scene. The police explicitly list 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor in the crash. The narrative underscores that the victim’s skull took the brunt of the blow. No other vehicles or persons are reported involved. The report does not specify the use of any safety equipment by the victim, nor does it list any victim behavior as a contributing factor. The focus remains on the systemic danger posed by driver distraction, as detailed in the official police account.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
