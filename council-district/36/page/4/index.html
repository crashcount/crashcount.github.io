Nineteen seriously hurt.</strong> In District 36, the numbers do not flinch. Since 2022, cars and trucks have struck down children, elders, and workers. The dead do not get a second chance. The living carry scars. In the last year alone, crashes rose nearly 10%. Injuries jumped almost 30%. Deaths doubled. The streets do not forgive.</p><p>On May 24, a 32-year-old woman was killed by an SUV on Marcus Garvey Boulevard. She was not at an intersection. She did not make it home. On October 10, a man died at Bedford and Lafayette. On August 30, a 63-year-old man was killed by an SUV at Broadway and Myrtle. The stories repeat. The names change. The pain stays.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p><strong>Most victims are on foot. Most drivers walk away.</strong> The numbers are cold: SUVs and cars caused six deaths and hundreds of injuries. Trucks and buses added more.

He voted for a citywide greenway plan. He backed the SAFE Streets Act. The record is there. The danger is not gone.</p><p>But laws on paper do not slow cars.

Introduced February 28, 2024, it urges the State Legislature and Governor to pass S.2422 ('Sammy’s Law'), A.1901 (Crash Victims Bill of Rights), and the full SAFE Streets Act package. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.2422, also known as ‘Sammy’s Law,’ in relation to allowing New York city to establish a lower speed limit, and A.1901, enacting a crash victims bill of rights, as well as the other bills of the package known as the SAFE Streets Act.' Council Member Shahana K. Hanif leads as primary sponsor, joined by Gutiérrez, Restler, Ossé, Avilés, Sanchez, Krishnan, Rivera, Cabán, Brewer, Abreu, Marte, Brannan, Schulman, Won, Feliz, Bottcher, Nurse, Hudson, and the Brooklyn Borough President. The SAFE Streets Act targets reckless driving, demands safer street design, and gives crash victims more rights.

Ossé wrote to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, calling the delay 'unacceptable' and demanding a firm installation date. He stated, 'The Bedford Avenue bike lane has been unacceptably dangerous since it was first laid, and for years, the people of my district have been promised that it would be protected.' Advocacy groups, including Transportation Alternatives, echoed his frustration, citing record cyclist deaths and urgent need for safety. The DOT has not responded to requests for comment.
