Nine more have life-altering injuries. In the last twelve months, <strong>659 people have been hurt in 1,152 crashes</strong> in District 36, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. The dead are not numbers. They are a pregnant woman dragged under an SUV on Van Buren Street. A senior struck crossing Broadway. A child who never made it home. The street keeps their silence. The city moves on.</p><p>A witness saw it all. &ldquo;They dragged her like to the middle of the street, and then they turned wrong up Lafayette and she was just left there,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/25/brooklyn-bed-stuy-fatal-hit-run-woman-gets-out-of-car/>said Shane Bridges</a>. The driver fled. The family waits for justice that may never come.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>SUVs killed more pedestrians here than any other vehicle.</strong> Four deaths, forty-two injuries, four serious injuries. Trucks, sedans, bikes, mopeds—they all leave scars, but the big cars do the worst. The city blames distraction, inattention, speed. The result is always the same: bodies in the road, families broken.</p><p>Tiffany Cifuni&rsquo;s husband said it plain: &ldquo;I lost my whole family tonight and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever be the same&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/husband-mourns-pregnant-wife-run-over-by-hit-run-driver-in-brooklyn-fender-bender-clash/>he told the Daily News</a>. The words hang in the air. The street does not care who you are.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>Council Member Chi Ossé has backed bills for <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/protected-bike-lanes-coming-bedford-avenue/>protected bike lanes</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>banning parking near crosswalks</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalizing jaywalking</a>—measures that shift the burden off the most vulnerable. Ossé demanded a redesign of Atlantic Avenue, calling it &ldquo;one of the most dangerous corridors in the entire borough&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/02/06/atlantic-avenue-dot-no-road-diet-redesign>at a Council hearing</a>. He pushed for the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane after years of delay (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/03/19/osse-bedford-ave-bike-lane-is-stuck-in-dots-community-engagement-purgatory>Streetsblog</a>). But the city drags its feet. Promises stack up. Asphalt stays the same.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by leaders who stall, delay, or look away. If you want change, make them feel it. Call Council Member Ossé. Demand safer streets. Demand action before another family is left with nothing but grief.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers, Carlina Rivera, Lincoln Restler, Sandy Nurse, Chi Ossé, Crystal Hudson, Shekar Krishnan, and Amanda Farías joined her. Traffic fatalities rose 44 percent in the first quarter of 2022, the deadliest start since Vision Zero began.

The message is clear—build for people, not for cars.</p><p class=mb3>On March 1, 2022, Brooklyn politicians announced a push to eliminate mandatory parking minimums for new developments. The action is not a formal bill, but a policy stance led by Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Council Member Lincoln Restler. The group, including Council Members Jennifer Gutierrez, Crystal Hudson, Chi Osse, Sandy Nurse, Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Rita Joseph, and Farah Louis, demands that developers seeking zoning changes first apply for a special permit to waive parking requirements. Restler said, 'Developers need our consent and approval, and we are telling them, plainly, that they have to file for a special permit to end parking requirements.' Reynoso added, 'You don't need to do that anymore.' Avilés called parking mandates a barrier to affordable housing and climate action. The group argues that parking minimums raise construction costs, encourage car use, and block green space. Restler warned he is 'far more likely to vote no' on projects without a parking waiver. Advocates and policy experts back the move, and related state legislation is pending.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
