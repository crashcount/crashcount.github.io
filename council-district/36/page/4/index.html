The city pledged 75 miles of new or improved bike routes by 2022. As of now, none have been built. Council Member Rita Joseph, representing Flatbush and Midwood, introduced legislation to speed up construction, stating, “My community has been asking for it. The Commissioner has made a commitment. He needs to step up and do it now.” Council Member Chi Ossé condemned the administration’s inaction, calling it “yet another glaring example” of broken promises. Advocates and residents cite safety and equity concerns, noting these districts suffer more cyclist injuries and deaths but get fewer protected lanes.

The DOT had pledged completion in late 2023, but the project remains stalled with no timeline. Ossé stated, 'They brought this to the community board and there was an outpouring of support for this protected bike lane.' The matter was discussed with Community Boards 3 and 8, and local officials, schools, and businesses support the project. Council Member Lincoln Restler accused Mayor Adams of putting politics over public safety, saying, 'Mayor Adams has decided that he cares more about who he thinks is going to vote for him in 2025 than our lives.' The delay leaves cyclists exposed to ongoing danger, with injuries on the rise. The DOT’s call for more 'community engagement' is seen as a smokescreen for inaction. No formal safety analyst assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A sedan struck a 26-year-old motorscooter rider broadside. According to the police report, 'Traffic Control Disregarded' was the contributing factor for both vehicles. The rider was ejected and suffered fatal head trauma. The report states, 'Signal ignored. Scooter crushed. Blood pooled as dawn crept over broken glass and silence.' The rider was not wearing a helmet, as noted in the report, but the primary cause listed was the failure to obey traffic control. The motorscooter was demolished. The crash left one dead and a city street stained with loss.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Sidewalk tables stay year-round. Curbside setups vanish from November to April. Lawmakers call it balance. Advocates see lost ground. Streets shift, but cars still win cold months.</p><p class=mb3>On August 3, 2023, the New York City Council passed a bill to make outdoor dining permanent, but with limits. The measure, approved 34-11, moves through the Council and awaits Mayor Adams’s signature. The bill states: 'curbside set-ups were designed to be temporary and should not be in the permanent program.' Council Member Marjorie Velázquez, the bill’s sponsor, said, 'We want to strike a chord and a balance and this is it.' Speaker Adrienne Adams backed the winter pause. Council Member Chi Ossé voted yes, but noted hardship for small businesses. The law allows sidewalk seating all year, but curbside dining only from April to November. Fees apply, and old sheds must go by November 2024. The Department of Transportation will set design rules. Advocates call the bill historic but incomplete, as curb space returns to cars in winter, limiting gains for people on foot and bike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
