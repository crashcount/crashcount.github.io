Nine more have life-altering injuries. In the last twelve months, <strong>659 people have been hurt in 1,152 crashes</strong> in District 36, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. The dead are not numbers. They are a pregnant woman dragged under an SUV on Van Buren Street. A senior struck crossing Broadway. A child who never made it home. The street keeps their silence. The city moves on.</p><p>A witness saw it all. &ldquo;They dragged her like to the middle of the street, and then they turned wrong up Lafayette and she was just left there,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/25/brooklyn-bed-stuy-fatal-hit-run-woman-gets-out-of-car/>said Shane Bridges</a>. The driver fled. The family waits for justice that may never come.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>SUVs killed more pedestrians here than any other vehicle.</strong> Four deaths, forty-two injuries, four serious injuries. Trucks, sedans, bikes, mopeds—they all leave scars, but the big cars do the worst. The city blames distraction, inattention, speed. The result is always the same: bodies in the road, families broken.</p><p>Tiffany Cifuni&rsquo;s husband said it plain: &ldquo;I lost my whole family tonight and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever be the same&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/husband-mourns-pregnant-wife-run-over-by-hit-run-driver-in-brooklyn-fender-bender-clash/>he told the Daily News</a>. The words hang in the air. The street does not care who you are.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>Council Member Chi Ossé has backed bills for <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/protected-bike-lanes-coming-bedford-avenue/>protected bike lanes</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>banning parking near crosswalks</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalizing jaywalking</a>—measures that shift the burden off the most vulnerable. Ossé demanded a redesign of Atlantic Avenue, calling it &ldquo;one of the most dangerous corridors in the entire borough&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/02/06/atlantic-avenue-dot-no-road-diet-redesign>at a Council hearing</a>. He pushed for the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane after years of delay (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/03/19/osse-bedford-ave-bike-lane-is-stuck-in-dots-community-engagement-purgatory>Streetsblog</a>). But the city drags its feet. Promises stack up. Asphalt stays the same.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by leaders who stall, delay, or look away. If you want change, make them feel it. Call Council Member Ossé. Demand safer streets. Demand action before another family is left with nothing but grief.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report states the bus was 'stopped in traffic' and did not move at the time of impact. The e-scooter, traveling straight ahead, struck the bus's left front quarter panel. The rider suffered severe lacerations to his leg, with blood pooling on the street. According to the police report, 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' was listed as a contributing factor in the crash. The narrative notes the e-scooter rider was helmetless, but only after documenting the driver error. The bus sustained damage to its left front quarter panel, while the scooter crumpled on impact. No injuries to bus occupants were reported. The crash underscores the lethal consequences of inattention and distraction on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The official summary states: 'The addition of a parking-protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue will create a critical cycling link...while making the road safer for everyone.' Ossé, who previously criticized DOT delays, said, 'This project is a win for everyone.' The lane will address a Vision Zero Priority Corridor with five pedestrian deaths and nearly 400 crashes since 2019. New medians, pedestrian islands, and traffic-calming measures will target deadly intersections.

The new 1.5-mile stretch, between Dean Street and Flushing Avenue, will include pedestrian islands and loading zones. Kathy Park Price of Transportation Alternatives called it 'a critical step towards creating an actual safe cycling network.' DOT spokesperson Vincent Barone cited data: protected bike lanes cut pedestrian deaths and injuries by 29.2%, and pedestrian islands by 29.9%.

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to use of force incidents involving police department use of a motor vehicle," forces the NYPD to add 'use of a motor vehicle to gain control of a subject' as a specific reporting category in quarterly and annual use of force reports. Council Member Lincoln Restler leads as primary sponsor, joined by Hudson, Won, Hanif, Bottcher, Brewer, Avilés, Abreu, Ossé, Krishnan, Williams, Cabán, Nurse, Sanchez, and the Brooklyn Borough President. The bill targets a gap: current NYPD reports do not name motor vehicles as a means of force. This change brings police violence by car into the light, exposing patterns that endanger pedestrians and other vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure aims to cut risk for cyclists and push back against deadly streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
