The dead do not speak. The living limp, or grieve, or cross with eyes fixed on the next car. Just days ago, a man tried to cross near Broadway and East New York Avenue. A gray Ford hit him and kept going. He died at Brookdale Hospital. The driver vanished. Police [said, &ldquo;The driver of the Ford sped off, never stopping.&rdquo;] (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/04/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-man-36-in-brooklyn-crash/>https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/04/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-man-36-in-brooklyn-crash/</a>)</p><p><strong>This was the second hit-and-run in the city in 24 hours.</strong> The numbers are not just numbers.

But the street still runs red.
