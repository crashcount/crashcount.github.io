No arrest. The boy’s name was Mordica Keller. His sister watched him die. A neighbor <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-year-old-boy-killed-suv-crossing-intersection-crown-heights-brooklyn/16875804/>called the street dangerous</a>. Police are still investigating. The street remains the same.</p><p><strong>In the last 12 months, District 36 saw 3 deaths and 639 injuries from traffic crashes.</strong> Children, elders, workers. The numbers do not stop. In May, a woman was killed by SUVs on Van Buren Street. In June, a 17-year-old died after his moped collided with a car. The city logs the bodies. The city moves on.</p><h2 id=the-record-of-council-member-chi-ossé>The Record of Council Member Chi Ossé</h2><p>Council Member Chi Ossé has called for safer streets. He backed the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane, <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/protected-bike-lanes-coming-bedford-avenue/>calling it a win for everyone</a>. He pushed the city to stop delaying safety upgrades. When the mayor ripped out the new protected lane, Ossé stood with those who <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/13/breaking-mayor-adams-to-remove-bedford-avenue-protected-bike-lane-citing-bizarrely-safety>called the move reckless</a>. He co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and legalize jaywalking—measures that shift the burden off the most vulnerable.</p><p>But the pace is slow. Promises pile up. Streets stay deadly. <strong>Every delay is another risk.</strong></p><h2 id=the-road-ahead-action-not-excuses>The Road Ahead: Action, Not Excuses</h2><p><strong>Most deaths here come from cars and SUVs.</strong> In three years, 11 people died, 2,407 were injured, and 18 were seriously hurt. The city knows what works: slower speeds, clear sightlines, protected lanes. The council can pass laws. The mayor can act. But the dead cannot.</p><p>A neighbor <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-year-old-boy-killed-suv-crossing-intersection-crown-heights-brooklyn/16875804/>said people will act in his memory</a>. That is not enough. <strong>Call your council member. Demand safer streets. Do not wait for another child’s name in the news.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Department of Transportation (DOT) would not commit to a 'road diet' or redesign for the deadly 13-block Brooklyn stretch, pending a traffic study that could take two years and requires Council funding. Council Members Crystal Hudson and Chi Ossé, along with Borough President Antonio Reynoso, demanded a fully funded redesign, calling Atlantic Avenue 'one of the most dangerous corridors in the entire borough.' Residents testified about fear and danger from speeding cars and blind turns. From 2021 to 2024, four people died and 473 were injured in 831 crashes. Advocates and lawmakers condemned DOT's reluctance, calling it emblematic of citywide failures.

The vehicle's point of impact was the center front end, consistent with a direct collision. The report does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor.

It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable.

The project, not a council bill but a city action, follows years of advocacy and delay. The DOT will convert a painted, often-blocked bike lane between Dean Street and Flushing Avenue into a protected corridor. The official summary states: 'The addition of a parking-protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue will create a critical cycling link...while making the road safer for everyone.' Ossé, who previously criticized DOT delays, said, 'This project is a win for everyone.' The lane will address a Vision Zero Priority Corridor with five pedestrian deaths and nearly 400 crashes since 2019. New medians, pedestrian islands, and traffic-calming measures will target deadly intersections. Advocates call it critical safety infrastructure, the first of its kind in the district.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The new 1.5-mile stretch, between Dean Street and Flushing Avenue, will include pedestrian islands and loading zones. Kathy Park Price of Transportation Alternatives called it 'a critical step towards creating an actual safe cycling network.' DOT spokesperson Vincent Barone cited data: protected bike lanes cut pedestrian deaths and injuries by 29.2%, and pedestrian islands by 29.9%. Construction starts this week, with completion expected by year’s end.
