Eight seriously hurt.</strong> That is the toll in District 36 over the past year. In the last twelve months, there have been <strong>1,098 crashes</strong>—one every eight hours. <strong>628 people injured.</strong> The numbers do not flinch. They do not care who you are. They only climb.</p><p>On May 24, a woman was killed by an SUV on Marcus Garvey Boulevard. She was 32. On October 10, a man died crossing Bedford Avenue. He was 49. On August 30, a 63-year-old man was struck and killed by an SUV on Broadway. The driver was distracted. The man is gone. <strong>No policy, no law, no promise brought him back.</strong></p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>A witness saw the aftermath. &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/brooklyn-90-year-old-man-hit-run-rider/>said Mugsy</a>. The driver left. The street was quiet again. The city moved on.</p><p>Another neighbor spoke of the chaos. &ldquo;I see mopeds ride illegally &ndash; no helmets, no brakes. They plow right through red lights, no consideration for people crossing. They just don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/90-year-old-killed-brooklyn-moped-nypd/>said Ryan Rivera</a>.</p><p><strong>Most deaths are not random. They happen at intersections, on wide roads, where speed and size win.</strong> In District 36, SUVs and cars caused the most pain—<strong>five deaths, 313 minor injuries, 110 moderate injuries, four serious injuries</strong>. Trucks and buses, mopeds, and bikes hurt others, but the big machines do the worst.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Council Member Chi Ossé has backed bills to daylight intersections, build protected bike lanes, and legalize crossing the street outside the lines. He called out city delays on the Bedford Avenue bike lane, calling the danger &ldquo;unacceptable&rdquo; and <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/11/02/council-member-chi-osse-blasts-dot-for-delaying-and-maybe-killing-bedford-ave-bike-lane>demanding action in November 2023</a>. He voted for the SAFE Streets Act and the citywide greenway plan. He has not stood in the way. But the bodies keep coming.</p><p><strong>Every delay is a death sentence for someone.</strong></p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>Call Council Member Ossé. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand daylight at every corner.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill sits in committee.</p><p class=mb3>Int 1039-2024, now in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, was introduced on September 12, 2024. The bill reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to setting maximum amounts for certain member usage fees charged by a bike share operator.' Council Member Chi A. Ossé leads as primary sponsor, joined by Restler, Marte, Hudson, Cabán, Brannan, Hanif, Brewer, and Abreu. The bill would prohibit bike share companies from charging members more than the base subway fare for e-bike rides of one hour or less, or regular bike rides of two hours or less. The law would take effect 120 days after passage and apply to new or renewed contracts. This measure aims to keep bike share affordable for New Yorkers, making cycling a more accessible option.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crash underscores the lethal consequences of driver distraction and the systemic dangers faced by people crossing New York City streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Prime sponsor Joann Ariola leads, joined by Council Members Hanks, Ayala, Salaam, Brooks-Powers, Banks, Restler, Brannan, Ung, Gutiérrez, Louis, Hudson, Schulman, Ossé, Krishnan, Nurse, Moya, and Marmorato. Step streets are public staircases linking streets at different heights. The bill aims to ensure these stairs are well-lit, reducing risk for walkers. Once all step streets are lit, the mandate ends.
