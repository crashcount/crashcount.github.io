Nineteen more carry wounds that will not heal.</strong> Since 2022, there have been 4,710 crashes. The dead include a child of four, a woman of thirty-two, a man of forty-nine. They were walking. They were crossing. They were living. Now they are gone.</p><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the killing.</strong> Five deaths and 116 injuries came from SUVs alone. Trucks, buses, bikes, mopeds—they all leave their mark, but the weight of steel and speed is what breaks bodies and ends lives. The numbers are cold. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-no-end-in-sight>Recent Crashes: No End in Sight</h3><p>The carnage does not slow. On May 24, a 32-year-old woman was crushed by a Jeep and a sedan on Marcus Garvey Boulevard. In October, a man was killed at Lafayette and Bedford. A four-year-old died on Atlantic Avenue. Each crash is a story cut short. Each one could have been stopped.</p><p>A witness to one of these deaths said, <strong>&ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open.&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/brooklyn-90-year-old-man-hit-run-rider/>NY Daily News</a>. There is no poetry in this. Only blood and silence.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>Council Member Chi Ossé has stood up for safer streets. He co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, expand protected bike lanes, and legalize crossing mid-block. He called out city agencies for delays, saying the Bedford Avenue bike lane has been <strong>&ldquo;unacceptably dangerous since it was first laid, and for years, the people of my district have been promised that it would be protected.&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/11/02/council-member-chi-osse-blasts-dot-for-delaying-and-maybe-killing-bedford-ave-bike-lane>Streetsblog NYC</a></p><p>But the deaths keep coming. Laws are passed. Paint dries. Still, the street takes its toll. <strong>Every day without change is another day someone does not come home.</strong></p><h3 id=what-you-can-do-demand-action-now>What You Can Do: Demand Action Now</h3><p><strong>Call Council Member Ossé. Call the Mayor. Call the DOT.</strong> Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes and daylighted intersections. Demand that every crash is counted and every death is not in vain. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Find out how to take action.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Jaywalking is now legal. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks or against signals. The law shifts blame from walkers to drivers. Streets belong to people again.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0346-2024, now Local Law 98 of 2024, was enacted by the City Council on October 26, 2024, after passing the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable. The law marks a shift: streets are for people, not just cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
