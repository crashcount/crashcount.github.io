He <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>voted to legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the desperate and the poor. He <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/02/06/atlantic-avenue-dot-no-road-diet-redesign>co-sponsored bills</a> to daylight intersections, speed up bike lanes, and demand a safer Atlantic Avenue. But the city moves slow. Promises pile up. Asphalt stays the same.

Ossé cited fears of increased police enforcement and harm to immigrant communities: 'The hearing demonstrated concerns about the bill to be right: Beyond its sweeping consequences for green transit and healthy urbanism, Intro 606 could spell disaster for immigrant communities.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez opposed the bill, stating it would burden delivery workers and lacks evidence for improving safety. Civil rights groups warned of racial bias and criminalization.

The project, not a council bill but a city action, follows years of advocacy and delay. The DOT will convert a painted, often-blocked bike lane between Dean Street and Flushing Avenue into a protected corridor. The official summary states: 'The addition of a parking-protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue will create a critical cycling link...while making the road safer for everyone.' Ossé, who previously criticized DOT delays, said, 'This project is a win for everyone.' The lane will address a Vision Zero Priority Corridor with five pedestrian deaths and nearly 400 crashes since 2019. New medians, pedestrian islands, and traffic-calming measures will target deadly intersections.

The project replaces a painted lane that was 'chronically parked in by drivers,' leaving cyclists exposed. The new 1.5-mile stretch, between Dean Street and Flushing Avenue, will include pedestrian islands and loading zones. Kathy Park Price of Transportation Alternatives called it 'a critical step towards creating an actual safe cycling network.' DOT spokesperson Vincent Barone cited data: protected bike lanes cut pedestrian deaths and injuries by 29.2%, and pedestrian islands by 29.9%. Construction starts this week, with completion expected by year’s end.
