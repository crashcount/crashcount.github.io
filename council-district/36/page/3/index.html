Eighteen more are left with serious injuries.</strong> Since 2022, there have been over 4,500 crashes. The wounds are not just numbers. A four-year-old boy, killed in a crash on Brooklyn Avenue.

Their families do, if anyone listens.</p><h3 id=the-latest-blood-on-the-asphalt>The Latest Blood on the Asphalt</h3><p>Just weeks ago, a child was killed by an SUV in Crown Heights. In May, a woman died on Van Buren. In the last twelve months alone, <strong>three people have died and over 600 have been injured</strong> in this district. The violence is relentless. The most vulnerable—children, the elderly, people walking—pay the highest price. The cars that kill most often are SUVs and sedans. The city’s own data shows it: <strong>SUVs and cars caused five deaths and over 400 injuries to pedestrians here</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=leadership-words-votes-and-the-slow-grind-of-change>Leadership: Words, Votes, and the Slow Grind of Change</h3><p>Council Member Chi Ossé has stood up for safer streets.

Ossé co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and legalize jaywalking—ending a law that punished the vulnerable instead of the reckless (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council Legislation</a>). He demanded a redesign of Atlantic Avenue, calling it &ldquo;one of the most dangerous corridors in the entire borough&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/02/06/atlantic-avenue-dot-no-road-diet-redesign>DOT: Safety Improvements on Atlantic Avenue?</a>).</p><p>But the pace is slow.

The council member has taken steps, but it is not enough. The city must lower speed limits, redesign deadly corridors, and keep protection for those outside the car. <strong>Call Council Member Ossé. Demand faster action. Demand that every street is made safe for the people who walk, bike, and live here.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Ossé cited fears of increased police enforcement and harm to immigrant communities: 'The hearing demonstrated concerns about the bill to be right: Beyond its sweeping consequences for green transit and healthy urbanism, Intro 606 could spell disaster for immigrant communities.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez opposed the bill, stating it would burden delivery workers and lacks evidence for improving safety. Civil rights groups warned of racial bias and criminalization.

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable. The law marks a shift: streets are for people, not just cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Ossé, who previously criticized DOT delays, said, 'This project is a win for everyone.' The lane will address a Vision Zero Priority Corridor with five pedestrian deaths and nearly 400 crashes since 2019.

The new 1.5-mile stretch, between Dean Street and Flushing Avenue, will include pedestrian islands and loading zones. Kathy Park Price of Transportation Alternatives called it 'a critical step towards creating an actual safe cycling network.' DOT spokesperson Vincent Barone cited data: protected bike lanes cut pedestrian deaths and injuries by 29.2%, and pedestrian islands by 29.9%.
