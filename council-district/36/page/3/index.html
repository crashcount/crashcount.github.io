Nine more have life-altering injuries. In the last twelve months, <strong>659 people have been hurt in 1,152 crashes</strong> in District 36, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. The dead are not numbers. They are a pregnant woman dragged under an SUV on Van Buren Street. A senior struck crossing Broadway. A child who never made it home. The street keeps their silence. The city moves on.</p><p>A witness saw it all. &ldquo;They dragged her like to the middle of the street, and then they turned wrong up Lafayette and she was just left there,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/25/brooklyn-bed-stuy-fatal-hit-run-woman-gets-out-of-car/>said Shane Bridges</a>. The driver fled. The family waits for justice that may never come.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>SUVs killed more pedestrians here than any other vehicle.</strong> Four deaths, forty-two injuries, four serious injuries. Trucks, sedans, bikes, mopeds—they all leave scars, but the big cars do the worst. The city blames distraction, inattention, speed. The result is always the same: bodies in the road, families broken.</p><p>Tiffany Cifuni&rsquo;s husband said it plain: &ldquo;I lost my whole family tonight and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever be the same&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/husband-mourns-pregnant-wife-run-over-by-hit-run-driver-in-brooklyn-fender-bender-clash/>he told the Daily News</a>. The words hang in the air. The street does not care who you are.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>Council Member Chi Ossé has backed bills for <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/protected-bike-lanes-coming-bedford-avenue/>protected bike lanes</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>banning parking near crosswalks</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalizing jaywalking</a>—measures that shift the burden off the most vulnerable. Ossé demanded a redesign of Atlantic Avenue, calling it &ldquo;one of the most dangerous corridors in the entire borough&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/02/06/atlantic-avenue-dot-no-road-diet-redesign>at a Council hearing</a>. He pushed for the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane after years of delay (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/03/19/osse-bedford-ave-bike-lane-is-stuck-in-dots-community-engagement-purgatory>Streetsblog</a>). But the city drags its feet. Promises stack up. Asphalt stays the same.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now?</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every crash is a choice made by leaders who stall, delay, or look away. If you want change, make them feel it. Call Council Member Ossé. Demand safer streets. Demand action before another family is left with nothing but grief.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The statement follows the death of Yvonne Sandiford, 79, who was struck by two vehicles while crossing in a marked crosswalk. Both drivers fled. Ossé said, 'Safe infrastructure is key. Driver and pedestrian education is key. Responsible policies are key.' Local leaders and groups, including Prospect Heights Neighborhood Development and Transportation Alternatives, joined the call, urging Mayor Adams to speed up DOT safety improvements.

Ossé wrote to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, calling the delay 'unacceptable' and demanding a firm installation date. He stated, 'The Bedford Avenue bike lane has been unacceptably dangerous since it was first laid, and for years, the people of my district have been promised that it would be protected.' Advocacy groups, including Transportation Alternatives, echoed his frustration, citing record cyclist deaths and urgent need for safety. The DOT has not responded to requests for comment.

Riders keep risking their lives.</p><p class=mb3>On March 22, 2023, activists and City Council Members Chi Ossé and Lincoln Restler called for a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue between Flushing and Flatbush avenues in Brooklyn. The matter, described as 'the heavily used existing painted bike lane on Bedford Avenue puts people on bikes at risk because it is chronically blocked by double-parked vehicles,' highlights a deadly stretch for cyclists and pedestrians. Good Co., a Black-led bike club, and Transportation Alternatives lead the push. DOT acknowledged support and is open to future talks. The effort faces resistance from some community boards. Council Members Ossé and Restler publicly backed the project, pressing for urgent action. The current lane leaves cyclists exposed, forcing them into traffic and danger. Advocates demand real protection, not paint.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
