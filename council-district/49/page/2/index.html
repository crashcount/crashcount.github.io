Seven more are seriously hurt.</strong> In the last twelve months, District 49 saw 1,322 crashes. Six hundred seventy-five people were injured. The dead do not get a second chance. The wounded carry scars. These numbers are not just statistics—they are neighbors, children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians.</p><p>On May 17, Jose Luis Gomez-Guallazaca tried to cross Targee Street. An e-scooter hit him. He died at Richmond University Medical Center. The driver was thrown from the scooter. Police said, &ldquo;upon impact, the driver was violently ejected off the scooter while Gomez-Guallazaca sustained severe trauma&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/bronx-man-killed-by-e-scooter-driver-05172025/>according to amNY</a>. No arrests. No comfort for the family. Only the echo of sirens and the stain on the street.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h2><p>Council Member Kamillah Hanks has voted for safer crossings and greenways. She voted yes to end jaywalking enforcement, a move that &ldquo;removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable&rdquo; <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>as documented by NYC Council – Legistar</a>. She co-sponsored bills for better lighting on step streets and solar-powered crosswalks. These are steps in the right direction.</p><p>But Hanks has also backed bills that could make streets less safe. She co-sponsored a helmet mandate for cyclists and a bill to remove speed cameras. These laws shift the burden to those most at risk and take proven tools off the street. When the city needed strong voices for speed cameras and lower speed limits, silence and delay cost lives.</p><h2 id=the-road-ahead-action-not-excuses>The Road Ahead: Action, Not Excuses</h2><p><strong>Speed kills.</strong> Most deaths and injuries come from cars and trucks. Speed cameras cut speeding by more than half, but their future is uncertain. The city now has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. Every day of delay is another day of risk.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit and permanent speed cameras.</strong> Join groups like <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> and <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Do not wait for another name to become a number. The crisis is slow, but it is relentless. Only action will stop it.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The event, covered by nypost.com, highlighted concerns that the $15 toll for driving south of 60th Street in Manhattan would, as Hanks said, 'have a negative impact in neighborhoods of color in the outer boroughs.' Hanks and others argued the plan would burden working residents and increase pollution in Staten Island’s minority communities. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s environmental assessment confirmed air quality could worsen in Staten Island, the Bronx, and New Jersey, even as it improves in Manhattan. The MTA pledged $130 million for clean-up, but local leaders remain unconvinced.

According to the bill summary: 'Such advisory board would be responsible for submitting biannual reports, relating to recommended deployment of school crossing guards, to the Mayor, the City Council Speaker and the Police Commissioner.' Council Member Kamillah Hanks leads as primary sponsor, joined by Stevens, Schulman, Salaam, Won, Cabán, Riley, Farías, Restler, Williams, Narcisse, Banks, Louis, Brooks-Powers, Marmorato, and the Bronx Borough President. The bill demands city agencies work together, but it does not guarantee more guards or safer crossings. The danger for children at city intersections remains.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Riders and walkers pay the price for weak enforcement.</p><p class=mb3>On June 27, 2023, the City Council held a hearing on NYPD enforcement against ghost cars—vehicles with fake, covered, or defaced plates. NYPD Transportation Bureau’s Michael Pilecki reported arrests for forged plates fell 11 percent from last year, while summonses rose just 0.6 percent. The hearing spotlighted two bills from Council Member Oswald Feliz to raise fines for using or selling fake plates, both widely supported, including by the NYPD. The matter summary: 'NYPD claims it has stepped up its efforts to summons and arrest car drivers who cover or deface their plate, or drive with a fake temporary tag, but its own statistics show that the effort has not continued into this year.' Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers and Kamillah Hanks did not comment. Activists and officials noted DOT’s automated cameras failed to bill 1.2 million violations last year due to temp tags, leaving dangerous drivers unaccountable. The city’s weak enforcement leaves vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
