Steel twisted. A 30-year-old man took the impact headfirst, blood streaking the dash. He stayed conscious. The road stayed cold. Speed left its mark.</p><p class=mb3>A violent crash unfolded on Goethals Road North near Western Avenue as a speeding sedan collided with a station wagon/SUV that was making a right turn, according to the police report. The report states, 'A speeding sedan slammed an SUV mid-turn. Steel crumpled.' The impact left a 30-year-old male occupant with severe head lacerations; he remained conscious at the scene. The police report lists 'Unsafe Speed' as the primary contributing factor. The sedan was traveling straight ahead, while the SUV was turning, and the crash resulted in significant damage to both vehicles. The injured man was not wearing a seatbelt, but the report does not cite this as a contributing factor to the crash itself. The focus remains on the excessive speed of the sedan, which led to the violent collision and serious injury.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The crash happened at Huguenot Ave. and Drumgoole Ave. West, Staten Island, after a precinct holiday party. Todaro admitted, "I had three or four drinks. My life is over." The impact triggered airbags and left her with a forehead gash. All three passengers, also officers, were placed on desk duty and may face charges for allowing Todaro to drive or being unfit for duty. The article notes this was one of three NYPD DWI arrests in four days, highlighting a pattern during holiday party season. The incident raises questions about internal discipline and the risks posed by impaired driving, even among law enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states the motorcyclist was traveling at an unsafe speed before slamming into the SUV, which was carrying five occupants. The impact ejected the motorcyclist from his bike, crushing his chest. He was wearing a helmet, as noted in the report. The narrative details that 'speed and failure to yield left silence in the street.' The police report explicitly lists 'Unsafe Speed' as a contributing factor in the crash. No actions or behaviors by the SUV occupants are cited as contributing factors. The collision left the motorcyclist dead at the scene, while the five SUV occupants survived. The crash underscores the deadly consequences when speed and failure to yield intersect on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The street offered no protection, only impact.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a 17-year-old girl was crossing near 290B Jersey Street in Staten Island when a southbound Jeep SUV struck her with its right front bumper. The report states she was left semiconscious with severe head bleeding on the pavement. The collision occurred at a location with no crosswalk and no pedestrian signal. Police data lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified' and 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion.' The Jeep was traveling straight ahead when the impact occurred. The narrative describes the scene starkly: 'No crosswalk. No time to move.' The report does not cite any specific driver error, but the absence of pedestrian infrastructure and the force of the SUV’s impact left the teenager gravely injured.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Danger loses its cover.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0875-2024 sits in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure after introduction on May 16, 2024. The bill reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring the installation of pedestrian lighting on step streets.' Prime sponsor Joann Ariola, joined by sixteen co-sponsors, pushes for at least 25 step streets to be lit each year until all are covered. Step streets are open-air staircases linking streets at different heights. The bill aims to strip darkness from these paths, making them safer for people on foot.
