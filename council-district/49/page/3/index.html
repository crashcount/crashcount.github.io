A car or a scooter comes fast. The man does not come home. In District 49, the numbers do not lie. <strong>Fourteen people have died on these roads since 2022.</strong> More than 2,200 have been injured. Twenty-two suffered wounds so grave they may never walk the same again. The dead include children, elders, riders, and walkers. The city calls them accidents. The families know better.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>16-year-old boy on an e-scooter was killed</a> in Westerleigh. The police said, <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>&ldquo;Ellis suffered head trauma as a result of the crash.&rdquo;</a> No arrest. No comfort. Only the sound of sirens and the scrape of a scooter on the pavement. Days before, a <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/staten-island-motorcyclist-killed-k-turn-07062025/>motorcyclist died on Bay Street</a> after a driver turned across his path. <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/staten-island-motorcyclist-killed-k-turn-07062025/>&ldquo;A motorcyclist was killed after colliding with a driver awkwardly turning their car on Staten Island during the Fourth of July holiday weekend,&rdquo;</a> the report read. The driver lived. The rider did not.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-risk>Who Bears the Risk?</h3><p><strong>Most of the blood on these streets comes from cars and trucks.</strong> Since 2022, they have killed three, injured 375, and left three with life-changing wounds. Motorcycles and mopeds have hurt and killed too, but the carnage is smaller. Bikes are in the mix, but the numbers are a shadow by comparison. The real danger is heavy, fast, and driven by people who walk away.</p><h3 id=what-has-council-member-hanks-done>What Has Council Member Hanks Done?</h3><p>Council Member Kamillah Hanks has voted for some safety bills. She said yes to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>removing abandoned vehicles</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>speeding up pavement markings</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>putting warning decals on taxi doors</a>. She co-sponsored a bill to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>require micromobility share operators to display safety rules</a>. These are steps, but they do not slow cars or redesign streets. She also backed bills that <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>target cyclists and e-bike riders</a>, shifting blame to those most at risk. The council can do more. They can fight for lower speed limits, more protected crossings, and enforcement that targets the real killers—speed and weight.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>The bodies are piling up.</strong> The fixes are known. Call Council Member Hanks. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand streets that protect people, not cars. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
