Seven more are seriously hurt.</strong> In the last twelve months, District 49 saw 1,322 crashes. Six hundred seventy-five people were injured. The dead do not get a second chance. The wounded carry scars. These numbers are not just statistics—they are neighbors, children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians.</p><p>On May 17, Jose Luis Gomez-Guallazaca tried to cross Targee Street. An e-scooter hit him. He died at Richmond University Medical Center. The driver was thrown from the scooter. Police said, &ldquo;upon impact, the driver was violently ejected off the scooter while Gomez-Guallazaca sustained severe trauma&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/bronx-man-killed-by-e-scooter-driver-05172025/>according to amNY</a>. No arrests. No comfort for the family. Only the echo of sirens and the stain on the street.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h2><p>Council Member Kamillah Hanks has voted for safer crossings and greenways. She voted yes to end jaywalking enforcement, a move that &ldquo;removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable&rdquo; <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>as documented by NYC Council – Legistar</a>. She co-sponsored bills for better lighting on step streets and solar-powered crosswalks. These are steps in the right direction.</p><p>But Hanks has also backed bills that could make streets less safe. She co-sponsored a helmet mandate for cyclists and a bill to remove speed cameras. These laws shift the burden to those most at risk and take proven tools off the street. When the city needed strong voices for speed cameras and lower speed limits, silence and delay cost lives.</p><h2 id=the-road-ahead-action-not-excuses>The Road Ahead: Action, Not Excuses</h2><p><strong>Speed kills.</strong> Most deaths and injuries come from cars and trucks. Speed cameras cut speeding by more than half, but their future is uncertain. The city now has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. Every day of delay is another day of risk.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit and permanent speed cameras.</strong> Join groups like <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> and <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Do not wait for another name to become a number. The crisis is slow, but it is relentless. Only action will stop it.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill came through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, first introduced April 28, 2022. The law's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to a citywide greenway plan.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors including Rivera, Hudson, and others. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor on October 27, 2022. The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law. The measure compels the city to plan and maintain safe routes for non-drivers, with regular public reporting and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
