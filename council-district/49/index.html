Seven more are seriously hurt.</strong> In the last twelve months, District 49 saw 1,322 crashes. Six hundred seventy-five people were injured. The dead do not get a second chance. The wounded carry scars. These numbers are not just statistics—they are neighbors, children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians.</p><p>On May 17, Jose Luis Gomez-Guallazaca tried to cross Targee Street. An e-scooter hit him. He died at Richmond University Medical Center. The driver was thrown from the scooter. Police said, &ldquo;upon impact, the driver was violently ejected off the scooter while Gomez-Guallazaca sustained severe trauma&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/bronx-man-killed-by-e-scooter-driver-05172025/>according to amNY</a>. No arrests. No comfort for the family. Only the echo of sirens and the stain on the street.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h2><p>Council Member Kamillah Hanks has voted for safer crossings and greenways. She voted yes to end jaywalking enforcement, a move that &ldquo;removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable&rdquo; <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>as documented by NYC Council – Legistar</a>. She co-sponsored bills for better lighting on step streets and solar-powered crosswalks. These are steps in the right direction.</p><p>But Hanks has also backed bills that could make streets less safe. She co-sponsored a helmet mandate for cyclists and a bill to remove speed cameras. These laws shift the burden to those most at risk and take proven tools off the street. When the city needed strong voices for speed cameras and lower speed limits, silence and delay cost lives.</p><h2 id=the-road-ahead-action-not-excuses>The Road Ahead: Action, Not Excuses</h2><p><strong>Speed kills.</strong> Most deaths and injuries come from cars and trucks. Speed cameras cut speeding by more than half, but their future is uncertain. The city now has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. Every day of delay is another day of risk.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit and permanent speed cameras.</strong> Join groups like <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> and <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Do not wait for another name to become a number. The crisis is slow, but it is relentless. Only action will stop it.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch stated, 'This morning is not just about crushing mopeds. It is about crushing the criminal activity and quality of life activities that come with them.' The crackdown targets vehicles often used by delivery workers but also linked by officials to traffic violations and other offenses.

The matter centers on whether car access improves safety after a recent attempted rape.

Locals warn that reintroducing cars endangers children and vulnerable users, undermining the park’s safety and purpose.

The impact caused severe front-end damage to both vehicles. A 21-year-old female driver was injured with a deep head laceration but remained conscious and was wearing a seatbelt. The report cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor to the crash. The narrative states, 'She had looked away. The street did not.' This highlights the critical role of driver distraction in causing the violent collision. No other contributing factors were noted for the victim.

Violators face civil penalties up to $50. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams leads as primary sponsor, joined by Council Members Holden, Vernikov, Narcisse, Moya, Schulman, Louis, Hanks, Brannan, and Zhuang. The bill does not address the root causes of cyclist injuries: reckless drivers, speeding cars, and deadly streets. Instead, it shifts responsibility onto those most at risk, leaving the city’s dangerous roads unchanged.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states, 'A speeding sedan slammed an SUV mid-turn. Steel crumpled.' The impact left a 30-year-old male occupant with severe head lacerations; he remained conscious at the scene. The police report lists 'Unsafe Speed' as the primary contributing factor. The sedan was traveling straight ahead, while the SUV was turning, and the crash resulted in significant damage to both vehicles. The injured man was not wearing a seatbelt, but the report does not cite this as a contributing factor to the crash itself. The focus remains on the excessive speed of the sedan, which led to the violent collision and serious injury.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The crash happened at Huguenot Ave. and Drumgoole Ave. West, Staten Island, after a precinct holiday party. Todaro admitted, "I had three or four drinks. My life is over." The impact triggered airbags and left her with a forehead gash. All three passengers, also officers, were placed on desk duty and may face charges for allowing Todaro to drive or being unfit for duty. The article notes this was one of three NYPD DWI arrests in four days, highlighting a pattern during holiday party season.

The bill orders the Commissioner of Transportation, with the Chancellor of New York City Public Schools, to conduct yearly studies to find non-operational schools. The matter title reads: 'Annual study to identify non-operational schools and the subsequent removal of speed cameras from eliminated school speed zones.' Council Members Chris Banks (District 42, primary sponsor) and Kamillah Hanks (District 49, co-sponsor) back the measure. If passed, speed cameras must be removed from zones tied to closed schools. The bill’s plain language summary confirms cameras will be pulled from these areas. No safety analyst has weighed in, but the removal of cameras means less oversight where children and families once crossed.
