A car does not stop. On Hylan Boulevard, 80-year-old Chaosheng Wu was killed crossing near his home. The driver stayed. Wu did not. Police said they were &ldquo;still investigating how fast the woman was driving and what the traffic signals at the intersection were displaying at the time&rdquo; (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/driver-fatally-strikes-80-year-old-staten-island-man-a-block-from-his-home-police-say>Gothamist</a>).</p><p>In May, a 58-year-old man, Jose Luis Gomez-Guallazaca, was struck and killed by an e-scooter on Targee Street. The impact threw both the pedestrian and the rider to the ground. &ldquo;Upon impact, the driver was violently ejected off the scooter while Gomez-Guallazaca sustained severe trauma&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/bronx-man-killed-by-e-scooter-driver-05172025/>amNY</a>).</p><p>A teenage e-scooter rider, Nacere Ellis, died in June after colliding with a Hyundai Tucson in Westerleigh.

Cars and SUVs did the most harm, causing the majority of deaths and injuries. Trucks, buses, motorcycles, and mopeds also left bodies broken. The numbers do not lie. They do not comfort.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Kamillah Hanks has voted for some safety bills. She backed laws to remove abandoned vehicles and add warning decals to taxis to prevent dooring (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>). She co-sponsored a bill to require micromobility share operators to display safety rules. But she also supported measures that shift the burden to cyclists and e-bike riders—like helmet mandates and registration bills—while the deadliest vehicles keep rolling. No major push for lower speed limits. No bold stand for the most vulnerable.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</h3><p><strong>The dead cannot speak. The living must.</strong> Call Council Member Hanks. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand enforcement that targets the real killers—speeding cars, reckless turns, repeat offenders. Join <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a> and <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a>. Do not wait for the next siren.
