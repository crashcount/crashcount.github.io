Seven more are seriously hurt.</strong> In the last twelve months, District 49 saw 1,322 crashes. Six hundred seventy-five people were injured. The dead do not get a second chance. The wounded carry scars. These numbers are not just statistics—they are neighbors, children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians.</p><p>On May 17, Jose Luis Gomez-Guallazaca tried to cross Targee Street. An e-scooter hit him. He died at Richmond University Medical Center. The driver was thrown from the scooter. Police said, &ldquo;upon impact, the driver was violently ejected off the scooter while Gomez-Guallazaca sustained severe trauma&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/bronx-man-killed-by-e-scooter-driver-05172025/>according to amNY</a>. No arrests. No comfort for the family. Only the echo of sirens and the stain on the street.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h2><p>Council Member Kamillah Hanks has voted for safer crossings and greenways. She voted yes to end jaywalking enforcement, a move that &ldquo;removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable&rdquo; <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>as documented by NYC Council – Legistar</a>. She co-sponsored bills for better lighting on step streets and solar-powered crosswalks. These are steps in the right direction.</p><p>But Hanks has also backed bills that could make streets less safe. She co-sponsored a helmet mandate for cyclists and a bill to remove speed cameras. These laws shift the burden to those most at risk and take proven tools off the street. When the city needed strong voices for speed cameras and lower speed limits, silence and delay cost lives.</p><h2 id=the-road-ahead-action-not-excuses>The Road Ahead: Action, Not Excuses</h2><p><strong>Speed kills.</strong> Most deaths and injuries come from cars and trucks. Speed cameras cut speeding by more than half, but their future is uncertain. The city now has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. Every day of delay is another day of risk.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit and permanent speed cameras.</strong> Join groups like <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> and <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Do not wait for another name to become a number. The crisis is slow, but it is relentless. Only action will stop it.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The road has been car-free since the pandemic, serving as a haven for walkers and cyclists. The Parks Department, once supportive of a car-free park, agreed to the reopening after political pressure. The matter centers on whether car access improves safety after a recent attempted rape.

Locals warn that reintroducing cars endangers children and vulnerable users, undermining the park’s safety and purpose.

Jaywalking is now legal. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks or against signals. The law shifts blame from walkers to drivers. Streets belong to people again.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0346-2024, now Local Law 98 of 2024, was enacted by the City Council on October 26, 2024, after passing the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable. The law marks a shift: streets are for people, not just cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
