In the last year alone, 94 people under 18 were hurt. Two people died. Most injuries come from cars and trucks. The city’s own data shows <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>cars and SUVs caused 203 pedestrian injuries</a>, with trucks and buses close behind.

Borelli voted yes on a bill to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>require DOT to report micromobility data</a>, but this does not stop the bleeding. He was absent for a vote on a bill to improve pedestrian safety and equity. There is no record of him leading on speed limits, street redesign, or enforcement against reckless drivers. The bills that pass are slow. The ones that matter most—lowering speeds, redesigning deadly roads—wait in committee.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p>Every day of delay is another day of loss.

The bill, heard by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, passed on September 26, 2024, and became law on October 26, 2024. Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers. It shifts blame from people on foot to the system and those behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
