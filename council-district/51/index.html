Over 1,500 injured.</strong> In District 51, the slow grind of traffic violence does not stop. In the last three years, three children died. Two elders died. Three people under 18 were killed. Four more suffered serious injuries. The numbers are not just numbers. They are lives cut short, families broken, futures erased.</p><h2 id=the-latest-crashes-flesh-and-asphalt>The Latest Crashes: Flesh and Asphalt</h2><p>A sedan struck an 84-year-old man crossing Amboy Road. He died on the street, not at an intersection, hit by a driver who was not paying attention. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>data records only the outcome</a>. On Drumgoole Road West, a 29-year-old driver was killed, ejected from his car after speeding. No one walked away from these crashes unchanged.</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-silence-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Votes, Silence, and Missed Chances</h2><p><strong>Council Member Joseph C. Borelli has voted for some safety bills, but has also stood against measures that would protect the most vulnerable.</strong> He voted yes on the citywide greenway plan, a step forward for non-drivers. But when the Council moved to end jaywalking enforcement—a law that punished people for crossing the street—Borelli was absent. He voted no on a bill to build safer medians and improve pedestrian safety. He co-sponsored bills that could slow street safety projects, and others that would burden e-bike riders with new licensing rules, making the streets less safe for those outside cars.</p><p>The city destroyed illegal mopeds in Staten Island. Mayor Adams <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/nyc-officials-destroy-illegal-mopeds-nypd-06132025/>said the rise of the moped era after COVID-19 &ldquo;has terrorized many of our pedestrians, particularly our seniors and older adults, who live in fear of being run down right on their own block.&rdquo;</a> The fear is real. The danger is not new.</p><p>Even the police are not immune. After a holiday party, an NYPD officer crashed her car with three colleagues inside. She <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/12/16/nypd-officer-charged-with-dwi-three-placed-on-desk-duty-following-crash-after-staten-island-precinct-holiday-party/>admitted, &ldquo;I had three or four drinks. My life is over.&rdquo;</a> The badge does not protect you from the laws of physics.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay, every vote against safety, every silence is a choice. Call Joseph C. Borelli. Call the Mayor. Demand safer speeds. Demand real protection for people outside cars. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The threat to walkers lingers.</p><p class=mb3>amNY reported on June 12, 2025, that New York City officials destroyed more than 200 illegal mopeds in Staten Island. Mayor Eric Adams and Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch oversaw the event, where a Sanitation Department bulldozer crushed the vehicles. Adams said, 'New Yorkers have strong feelings about illegal mopeds and scooters, especially when they are driving the wrong way down streets or sidewalks or in the dark without lights.' The city links these vehicles to traffic violations and crimes, including robberies and reckless riding. Since Adams took office, police have removed about 62,000 illegal vehicles, aiming to reduce hazards for pedestrians. NYPD data shows a 57% drop in moped-related crime in 2025. The crackdown highlights the city's push to address systemic dangers posed by unregulated vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan allows cameras on seven bridges and two tunnels, ticketing drivers who exceed speed limits. Fines start at $50 for a first offense, rising to $75 and $100 for repeat violations within 18 months. Governor Hochul's office called the program 'one more way the governor is working to improve safety on our roads and bridges for workers and travelers alike.' MTA Bridges and Tunnels President Catherine Sheridan said, 'We want to make sure that our maintenance workers and contractors are safe.' The program, part of the $254 billion state budget, will be reviewed again in 2031. The move targets driver speed, a key factor in crash severity, and signals a shift toward automated enforcement on major city crossings.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable.
