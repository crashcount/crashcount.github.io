Fifteen families broken.</strong> In District 51, from 2022 to June 2025, the numbers do not flinch: 1,521 people injured, 15 killed, 15 left with serious wounds that do not heal. Two children did not make it home. Two elders did not see another sunrise. The streets do not care if you are young or old. They take what they want.</p><p><strong>Cars and trucks did most of the damage.</strong> They killed, they maimed, they left scars. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>One sedan struck an 84-year-old man crossing Amboy Road. He never got up again.</a> A pickup turned left and a cyclist was thrown. A bus rolled through and an elderly pedestrian was lost. The numbers are not just numbers. They are names, faces, empty chairs at dinner.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-absence>Leadership: Action and Absence</h3><p>Council Member Joseph C. Borelli has voted for some safety bills. He backed the citywide greenway plan, which could mean safer routes for those who do not drive. But when the Council voted to end jaywalking enforcement and give pedestrians the right to cross where they need, Borelli was not there. The law passed without him. When it came to safer medians and better crossings, he voted no. When bills came up that could slow down street safety projects, he signed on. When it was time to make e-bikes harder to use, he signed on. When it was time to speed up resurfacing, he signed on. The record is mixed. The silence is not.</p><p><strong>Even those sworn to protect are not immune.</strong> Last December, an NYPD officer crashed her car after a holiday party. She told the press, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/12/16/nypd-officer-charged-with-dwi-three-placed-on-desk-duty-following-crash-after-staten-island-precinct-holiday-party/>&ldquo;I had three or four drinks. My life is over.&rdquo;</a> The badge did not save her. It did not save the others on the road.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay, every no vote, every absent seat in the chamber is a choice. The dead do not get to choose. The living do.</p><p><strong>Call Council Member Borelli. Demand safer streets. Demand action, not excuses.</strong> Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The crash happened at Huguenot Ave. and Drumgoole Ave. West, Staten Island, after a precinct holiday party. Todaro admitted, "I had three or four drinks. My life is over." The impact triggered airbags and left her with a forehead gash. All three passengers, also officers, were placed on desk duty and may face charges for allowing Todaro to drive or being unfit for duty. The article notes this was one of three NYPD DWI arrests in four days, highlighting a pattern during holiday party season. The incident raises questions about internal discipline and the risks posed by impaired driving, even among law enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable.
