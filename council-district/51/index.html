Over 1,500 injured.</strong> In District 51, the slow grind of traffic violence does not stop. In the last three years, three children died. Two elders died. Three people under 18 were killed. Four more suffered serious injuries. The numbers are not just numbers. They are lives cut short, families broken, futures erased.</p><h2 id=the-latest-crashes-flesh-and-asphalt>The Latest Crashes: Flesh and Asphalt</h2><p>A sedan struck an 84-year-old man crossing Amboy Road. He died on the street, not at an intersection, hit by a driver who was not paying attention. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>data records only the outcome</a>. On Drumgoole Road West, a 29-year-old driver was killed, ejected from his car after speeding. No one walked away from these crashes unchanged.</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-silence-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Votes, Silence, and Missed Chances</h2><p><strong>Council Member Joseph C. Borelli has voted for some safety bills, but has also stood against measures that would protect the most vulnerable.</strong> He voted yes on the citywide greenway plan, a step forward for non-drivers. But when the Council moved to end jaywalking enforcement—a law that punished people for crossing the street—Borelli was absent. He voted no on a bill to build safer medians and improve pedestrian safety. He co-sponsored bills that could slow street safety projects, and others that would burden e-bike riders with new licensing rules, making the streets less safe for those outside cars.</p><p>The city destroyed illegal mopeds in Staten Island. Mayor Adams <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/nyc-officials-destroy-illegal-mopeds-nypd-06132025/>said the rise of the moped era after COVID-19 &ldquo;has terrorized many of our pedestrians, particularly our seniors and older adults, who live in fear of being run down right on their own block.&rdquo;</a> The fear is real. The danger is not new.</p><p>Even the police are not immune. After a holiday party, an NYPD officer crashed her car with three colleagues inside. She <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/12/16/nypd-officer-charged-with-dwi-three-placed-on-desk-duty-following-crash-after-staten-island-precinct-holiday-party/>admitted, &ldquo;I had three or four drinks. My life is over.&rdquo;</a> The badge does not protect you from the laws of physics.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay, every vote against safety, every silence is a choice. Call Joseph C. Borelli. Call the Mayor. Demand safer speeds. Demand real protection for people outside cars. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The crash left a 20-year-old male e-bike rider with severe lacerations to his face. The police report states the driver of the sedan failed to yield right-of-way and was inattentive or distracted at the time of the crash. The report notes, 'No one yielded.' The e-bike rider was not wearing a helmet, but helmet use is not listed as a contributing factor. The impact struck the right side doors of the sedan and the center front end of the e-bike. The crash highlights the lethal consequences of driver inattention and failure to yield, as documented in the official report.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill, heard by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, passed on September 26, 2024, and became law on October 26, 2024. Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers. It shifts blame from people on foot to the system and those behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The sole occupant, a 29-year-old male driver, was ejected from the vehicle and killed. The report states the vehicle’s front quarter panel crumpled on impact, leaving the scene silent and grim. Police cite 'Unsafe Speed' as a contributing factor, and note the driver was unlicensed at the time of the crash. The report lists no other vehicles or people involved. The data highlights the danger posed by excessive speed and unlicensed operation, both explicitly documented as driver errors in the official report. No mention is made of victim behavior contributing to the crash.
