The city’s own data shows <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>cars and SUVs caused 203 pedestrian injuries</a>, with trucks and buses close behind.

He was absent for a vote on a bill to improve pedestrian safety and equity. There is no record of him leading on speed limits, street redesign, or enforcement against reckless drivers.

The threat to walkers lingers.</p><p class=mb3>amNY reported on June 12, 2025, that New York City officials destroyed more than 200 illegal mopeds in Staten Island. Mayor Eric Adams and Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch oversaw the event, where a Sanitation Department bulldozer crushed the vehicles. Adams said, 'New Yorkers have strong feelings about illegal mopeds and scooters, especially when they are driving the wrong way down streets or sidewalks or in the dark without lights.' The city links these vehicles to traffic violations and crimes, including robberies and reckless riding. Since Adams took office, police have removed about 62,000 illegal vehicles, aiming to reduce hazards for pedestrians. NYPD data shows a 57% drop in moped-related crime in 2025. The crackdown highlights the city's push to address systemic dangers posed by unregulated vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
