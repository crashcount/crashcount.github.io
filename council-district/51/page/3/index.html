Fifteen people have died since 2022. Sixteen more suffered serious injuries. The numbers do not tell you about the silence after the sirens fade. They do not tell you about the shoes left on the asphalt, or the families who wait for a voice that will not return.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>16-year-old on an e-scooter was killed</a> in Westerleigh.

No arrests. No comfort. Only another name on the list.</p><p>In May, a <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/bronx-man-killed-by-e-scooter-driver-05172025/>58-year-old man was struck and killed by an e-scooter</a> on Targee Street. The report was blunt: &ldquo;Upon impact, the driver was violently ejected off the scooter while Gomez-Guallazaca sustained severe trauma&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/bronx-man-killed-by-e-scooter-driver-05172025/>E-Scooter Kills Pedestrian On Staten Island</a>).

In the last year alone, 94 people under 18 were hurt. Two people died. Most injuries come from cars and trucks. The city’s own data shows <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>cars and SUVs caused 203 pedestrian injuries</a>, with trucks and buses close behind.

Borelli voted yes on a bill to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>require DOT to report micromobility data</a>, but this does not stop the bleeding. He was absent for a vote on a bill to improve pedestrian safety and equity. There is no record of him leading on speed limits, street redesign, or enforcement against reckless drivers. The bills that pass are slow. The ones that matter most—lowering speeds, redesigning deadly roads—wait in committee.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p>Every day of delay is another day of loss. Call Council Member Borelli. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings and real enforcement against reckless drivers. Do not wait for another child’s name in the news. The road will not wait.
