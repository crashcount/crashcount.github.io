Fifteen families broken.</strong> In District 51, from 2022 to June 2025, the numbers do not flinch: 1,521 people injured, 15 killed, 15 left with serious wounds that do not heal. Two children did not make it home. Two elders did not see another sunrise. The streets do not care if you are young or old. They take what they want.</p><p><strong>Cars and trucks did most of the damage.</strong> They killed, they maimed, they left scars. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>One sedan struck an 84-year-old man crossing Amboy Road. He never got up again.</a> A pickup turned left and a cyclist was thrown. A bus rolled through and an elderly pedestrian was lost. The numbers are not just numbers. They are names, faces, empty chairs at dinner.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-absence>Leadership: Action and Absence</h3><p>Council Member Joseph C. Borelli has voted for some safety bills. He backed the citywide greenway plan, which could mean safer routes for those who do not drive. But when the Council voted to end jaywalking enforcement and give pedestrians the right to cross where they need, Borelli was not there. The law passed without him. When it came to safer medians and better crossings, he voted no. When bills came up that could slow down street safety projects, he signed on. When it was time to make e-bikes harder to use, he signed on. When it was time to speed up resurfacing, he signed on. The record is mixed. The silence is not.</p><p><strong>Even those sworn to protect are not immune.</strong> Last December, an NYPD officer crashed her car after a holiday party. She told the press, <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/12/16/nypd-officer-charged-with-dwi-three-placed-on-desk-duty-following-crash-after-staten-island-precinct-holiday-party/>&ldquo;I had three or four drinks. My life is over.&rdquo;</a> The badge did not save her. It did not save the others on the road.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay, every no vote, every absent seat in the chamber is a choice. The dead do not get to choose. The living do.</p><p><strong>Call Council Member Borelli. Demand safer streets. Demand action, not excuses.</strong> Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
