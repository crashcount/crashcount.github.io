Over 1,500 injured.</strong> In District 51, the slow grind of traffic violence does not stop. In the last three years, three children died. Two elders died. Three people under 18 were killed. Four more suffered serious injuries. The numbers are not just numbers. They are lives cut short, families broken, futures erased.</p><h2 id=the-latest-crashes-flesh-and-asphalt>The Latest Crashes: Flesh and Asphalt</h2><p>A sedan struck an 84-year-old man crossing Amboy Road. He died on the street, not at an intersection, hit by a driver who was not paying attention. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>data records only the outcome</a>. On Drumgoole Road West, a 29-year-old driver was killed, ejected from his car after speeding. No one walked away from these crashes unchanged.</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-silence-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Votes, Silence, and Missed Chances</h2><p><strong>Council Member Joseph C. Borelli has voted for some safety bills, but has also stood against measures that would protect the most vulnerable.</strong> He voted yes on the citywide greenway plan, a step forward for non-drivers. But when the Council moved to end jaywalking enforcement—a law that punished people for crossing the street—Borelli was absent. He voted no on a bill to build safer medians and improve pedestrian safety. He co-sponsored bills that could slow street safety projects, and others that would burden e-bike riders with new licensing rules, making the streets less safe for those outside cars.</p><p>The city destroyed illegal mopeds in Staten Island. Mayor Adams <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/nyc-officials-destroy-illegal-mopeds-nypd-06132025/>said the rise of the moped era after COVID-19 &ldquo;has terrorized many of our pedestrians, particularly our seniors and older adults, who live in fear of being run down right on their own block.&rdquo;</a> The fear is real. The danger is not new.</p><p>Even the police are not immune. After a holiday party, an NYPD officer crashed her car with three colleagues inside. She <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/12/16/nypd-officer-charged-with-dwi-three-placed-on-desk-duty-following-crash-after-staten-island-precinct-holiday-party/>admitted, &ldquo;I had three or four drinks. My life is over.&rdquo;</a> The badge does not protect you from the laws of physics.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay, every vote against safety, every silence is a choice. Call Joseph C. Borelli. Call the Mayor. Demand safer speeds. Demand real protection for people outside cars. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The sponsors raise concerns about pollution, health, and traffic impacts on outer-borough communities. The measure questions whether congestion pricing will cut traffic or fund transit improvements.

The bill came through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, first introduced April 28, 2022. The law's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to a citywide greenway plan.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors including Rivera, Hudson, and others. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor on October 27, 2022. The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law. The measure compels the city to plan and maintain safe routes for non-drivers, with regular public reporting and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
