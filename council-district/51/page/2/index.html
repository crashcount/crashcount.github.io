Over 1,500 injured.</strong> In District 51, the slow grind of traffic violence does not stop. In the last three years, three children died. Two elders died. Three people under 18 were killed. Four more suffered serious injuries. The numbers are not just numbers. They are lives cut short, families broken, futures erased.</p><h2 id=the-latest-crashes-flesh-and-asphalt>The Latest Crashes: Flesh and Asphalt</h2><p>A sedan struck an 84-year-old man crossing Amboy Road. He died on the street, not at an intersection, hit by a driver who was not paying attention. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>data records only the outcome</a>. On Drumgoole Road West, a 29-year-old driver was killed, ejected from his car after speeding. No one walked away from these crashes unchanged.</p><h2 id=leadership-votes-silence-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Votes, Silence, and Missed Chances</h2><p><strong>Council Member Joseph C. Borelli has voted for some safety bills, but has also stood against measures that would protect the most vulnerable.</strong> He voted yes on the citywide greenway plan, a step forward for non-drivers. But when the Council moved to end jaywalking enforcement—a law that punished people for crossing the street—Borelli was absent. He voted no on a bill to build safer medians and improve pedestrian safety. He co-sponsored bills that could slow street safety projects, and others that would burden e-bike riders with new licensing rules, making the streets less safe for those outside cars.</p><p>The city destroyed illegal mopeds in Staten Island. Mayor Adams <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/nyc-officials-destroy-illegal-mopeds-nypd-06132025/>said the rise of the moped era after COVID-19 &ldquo;has terrorized many of our pedestrians, particularly our seniors and older adults, who live in fear of being run down right on their own block.&rdquo;</a> The fear is real. The danger is not new.</p><p>Even the police are not immune. After a holiday party, an NYPD officer crashed her car with three colleagues inside. She <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/12/16/nypd-officer-charged-with-dwi-three-placed-on-desk-duty-following-crash-after-staten-island-precinct-holiday-party/>admitted, &ldquo;I had three or four drinks. My life is over.&rdquo;</a> The badge does not protect you from the laws of physics.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay, every vote against safety, every silence is a choice. Call Joseph C. Borelli. Call the Mayor. Demand safer speeds. Demand real protection for people outside cars. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The street bore the scars of reckless speed.</p><p class=mb3>On Nippon Avenue near Edgegrove Avenue in Staten Island, a 17-year-old unlicensed driver lost control of his sedan and crashed into several parked vehicles. According to the police report, 'A 17-year-old, unlicensed, drove fast. His sedan slammed parked cars. Steel folded. Airbags burst. His legs crushed.' The crash left the teen driver with severe leg injuries and a 15-year-old passenger with back pain. A 19-year-old driver in another sedan suffered neck injuries. The police report lists 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as contributing factors. The unlicensed status of the teen driver and excessive speed led to a violent collision, leaving lasting harm for those inside the vehicles. Airbags deployed, but the force of the crash brought pain and silence to the street.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Borelli as co-sponsors, sought to require the Department of Transportation to group new active transportation docking stations—bike, scooter, and e-mobility docks—within one city block of each other, unless contracts prevented it. The official summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring centralized siting of active transportation docking stations.' The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not advance. Without passage, the city’s docking stations remain scattered, leaving vulnerable road users to navigate a patchwork of locations and unpredictable street conditions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure’s title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to establishing an inter-borough planning and advisory commission for the siting of active transportation parking hubs in the city.' Council Members David M. Carr (primary sponsor), Robert F. Holden, and Joseph C. Borelli backed the bill. The commission would have included 12 members, met quarterly, and submitted recommendations within 18 months. The bill was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023, and did not advance. No safety analyst assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
