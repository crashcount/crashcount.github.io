Since 2022, District 40 logged 4,587 crashes, with <strong>6 people killed and 2,873 injured</strong>. Pedestrians took the brunt: 569 hurt and six dead. Cars and SUVs caused most pedestrian injuries; trucks and buses killed three of the six. The numbers are not mercy. They are a roll call of loss drawn from <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city crash data</a>.</p><h3 id=bedford-and-caton-bodies-in-the-crosswalk>Bedford and Caton: bodies in the crosswalk</h3><p>At Bedford and Tilden, a 58-year-old woman crossed with the signal. A dump truck turned right and hit her. She died. The record reads: “Failure to Yield Right-of-Way,” “Making Right Turn,” “Oversized Vehicle.” It was 5:58 a.m. The driver was licensed in New Jersey. The truck was a 2014 Kenworth. It left her with “Internal” injuries and death at the scene, per <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4707890</a>.</p><p>At Caton and Coney Island Avenue, a tractor-trailer turned right as another car turned with it. A 47-year-old man, a pedestrian, suffered crush injuries to the head and died. Both vehicles were turning west. The truck was a 2006 Volvo registered in Indiana. The city log shows “Making Right Turn.” It was 9:13 p.m., per <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4580430</a>.</p><p>Nine minutes either side and a second fatal hit came on <strong>Linden Boulevard</strong>: a 47-year-old man, crossing with no signal, killed by a westbound Volvo tractor-trailer “Going Straight Ahead,” per <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4586191</a>. There is no comfort in the details.

Injuries stack up in the evening. From 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. the district saw spikes, with deaths at 5, 10, 17, 18, and two at 21:00 hours, per the city’s hour-by-hour ledger in our <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>district rollup</a>.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-do-the-killing>The machines that do the killing</h3><p>Heavy vehicles hit hard. Trucks and buses account for half the pedestrian deaths here and a share of the worst injuries. Cars and SUVs strike most often: 501 pedestrian injury cases tied to those vehicles, versus 38 for trucks and buses, per the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>cause by vehicle</a> data. The forms list “Failure to Yield,” “Right Turn,” “Going Straight Ahead.” The body count follows mass and speed.</p><h3 id=empire-boulevard-waits-for-protection>Empire Boulevard waits for protection</h3><p>Community Board 9 asked for a protected bike lane on Empire Boulevard. The painted lane fades. Crashes do not. Between 2021 and 2023, there were 406 crashes on that corridor, with 29 cyclists and 52 pedestrians injured. Two cyclists and two pedestrians have died there since 2011. Council Members Rita Joseph and Crystal Hudson represent the area. Hudson’s office called the board vote “a necessary step.” Joseph and DOT did not comment, reported <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/04/26/community-board-calls-for-protected-bike-lane-on-empire-boulevard>Streetsblog</a>.</p><h3 id=what-city-hall-has-done--and-hasnt>What City Hall has done — and hasn’t</h3><p>The Council passed a law forcing DOT to publish monthly and annual progress on the Streets Master Plan.

Council Member Rita Joseph co-sponsored it, and later voted yes on bills to speed up pavement markings and remove abandoned cars within 72 hours — hazards that block sightlines and crosswalks (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1160-2025</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 0857-2024</a>).</p><p>Joseph also backed measures to expand Open Streets, speed protected bike lanes, require speed humps near parks, and strengthen crash investigations and parking enforcement, according to Council records compiled in our <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>timeline</a>.</p><h3 id=what-would-stop-the-next-body-on-caton>What would stop the next body on Caton?</h3><p>Use tools we already name on paper.

Cyclists now dodge cars, buses, and chaos. City ignored safer designs. Riders left exposed. Anger boils. The street grows more dangerous. The city shrugs. Blood waits on the asphalt.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC reported on June 17, 2025, that Mayor Adams ordered the removal of the protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue after complaints from some residents. Cyclists called the move "unwise and unsafe." The article notes the city had previously identified this stretch as among the most dangerous. Officials responded to concerns by painting pedestrian islands and loading zones but did not install physical barriers or bus boarding islands. Cyclists described the decision as political, with one saying, "There’s a very important voting bloc that’s using their leverage over the mayor to remove the bike lane." The mayor’s refusal to sacrifice parking for safety left vulnerable road users exposed. The city’s Streets Master Plan, which mandates more protected lanes, remains unmet.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
