Thirty-one left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 2,600 hurt since 2022. The dead do not speak. Their absence is felt in empty chairs, unopened doors, and the silence after sirens fade.</p><p>Trucks and SUVs crush bodies at corners. Pedestrians are struck crossing with the light, against the light, or just trying to live. <strong>Most injuries and deaths happen at intersections.</strong> The city’s own data shows the carnage is not random.

She voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that blamed the vulnerable instead of the reckless. She backed the SAFE Streets Act and pushed for speed humps near parks and schools.</p><p>But bills alone do not stop the bleeding. <strong>&ldquo;Redesigning our streets under Vision Zero has helped us reduce traffic deaths to historic lows but we are always looking for new ways to keep people safe,&rdquo;</strong> said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, as the city finally began <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/nyc-dot-cyclist-safety-intersections/>adding hard barriers at high-crash intersections in Brooklyn</a>.</p><h2 id=the-system-fights-backbut-not-fast-enough>The System Fights Back—But Not Fast Enough</h2><p><strong>Nearly half of all traffic deaths happen at intersections.</strong> The city is rolling out hardened daylighting—granite blocks, planters, concrete—at corners where people keep dying. Advocates call it a start, but not enough. <strong>&ldquo;Anything with real (not plastic) infrastructure in street corners is good news,&rdquo;</strong> said Jon Orcutt, but he and others <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/12/dot-unveils-safer-intersection-design-mini-protected-bike-lanes-at-corners>want more, and faster</a>.</p><p>The numbers are down, but the bodies are not gone.

Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "Overweight trucks cause wear and tear on our roadways and we all pay the price through expensive repairs to our infrastructure." The city issued over 3,000 warnings during a 90-day grace period. Similar enforcement on Queens-bound trucks led to a 60% drop in overweight vehicles.

The court found the city may have acted "arbitrarily, capriciously, and illegally" by ordering the removal without proper legal notice. City law requires the Department of Transportation to notify local officials and allow time for public discussion, but, as the court papers state, "DOT did not provide the required notice." Plaintiffs argued that removing the lane would "irreparably" harm cyclists, especially children. The city claimed it would only shift the lane, not remove it, but advocates countered that any removal increases danger.

The plan includes concrete bus boarding islands and may reduce car lanes, giving more space to pedestrians and buses.
