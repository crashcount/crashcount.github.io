A child struck on Coney Island Avenue. An elderly woman crushed by a pickup on Albany. In the last twelve months, 768 people have been injured in crashes here. Ten were seriously hurt. One did not survive (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors—children, elders, mothers, fathers. The street does not care if you cross with the light or against it. The car always wins.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p>Cars and trucks do most of the damage. In this district, they have killed six people and injured hundreds more since 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Trucks and SUVs crush, sedans maim, and the numbers do not lie. Bikes and mopeds hurt too, but the toll is smaller. The street is a battlefield, and the most vulnerable are always outgunned.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Rita Joseph has signed her name to bills that matter. She backed the push for 100 miles of protected bike lanes a year and voted to end jaywalking enforcement, a law that <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable</a>. She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act and measures to daylight intersections, add speed humps, and expand Open Streets. These are steps, not leaps.</p><p>But the blood on the street says more is needed. Empire Boulevard still has no protected bike lane, despite years of crashes and deaths. The city moves slow. The cars do not. As one neighbor <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>said after another crash</a>, &ldquo;drivers speed on that stretch of roadway.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>No one is safe until every street is safe. Call Council Member Joseph. Demand real protection for people on foot and bike. Demand a default 20 mph speed limit, protected lanes, and daylighted corners. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
