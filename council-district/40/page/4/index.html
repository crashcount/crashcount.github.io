Thirty-one left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 2,600 hurt since 2022. The dead do not speak. Their absence is felt in empty chairs, unopened doors, and the silence after sirens fade.</p><p>Trucks and SUVs crush bodies at corners. Pedestrians are struck crossing with the light, against the light, or just trying to live. <strong>Most injuries and deaths happen at intersections.</strong> The city’s own data shows the carnage is not random.

She voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that blamed the vulnerable instead of the reckless. She backed the SAFE Streets Act and pushed for speed humps near parks and schools.</p><p>But bills alone do not stop the bleeding. <strong>&ldquo;Redesigning our streets under Vision Zero has helped us reduce traffic deaths to historic lows but we are always looking for new ways to keep people safe,&rdquo;</strong> said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, as the city finally began <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/nyc-dot-cyclist-safety-intersections/>adding hard barriers at high-crash intersections in Brooklyn</a>.</p><h2 id=the-system-fights-backbut-not-fast-enough>The System Fights Back—But Not Fast Enough</h2><p><strong>Nearly half of all traffic deaths happen at intersections.</strong> The city is rolling out hardened daylighting—granite blocks, planters, concrete—at corners where people keep dying. Advocates call it a start, but not enough. <strong>&ldquo;Anything with real (not plastic) infrastructure in street corners is good news,&rdquo;</strong> said Jon Orcutt, but he and others <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/12/dot-unveils-safer-intersection-design-mini-protected-bike-lanes-at-corners>want more, and faster</a>.</p><p>The numbers are down, but the bodies are not gone.

Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors including Rivera, Hudson, and others. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor on October 27, 2022.

Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law.

Joseph, in a joint statement with Transportation Alternatives, said, "The tragic death of yet another cyclist in our city, this time in my own neighborhood, shows how far we need to come to address traffic violence." Joseph called for urgent action to make streets safer. Parkside Avenue, not a designated truck route, has seen 161 injuries in five years, including 28 cyclists and 25 pedestrians. Advocates, including Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives, demanded the city fast-track protected bike lanes, warning, "Lives are on the line." The city has completed eight miles of protected lanes this year, with a goal of 20 by January. The push for protected infrastructure follows a spike in traffic deaths and ongoing danger for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Holden (primary sponsor), Ari Kagan, Justin L. Brannan, Jennifer Gutiérrez, Sandy Nurse, Kalman Yeger, Rita C. Joseph, and Tiffany Cabán sponsored the bill. It would have required DOT to audit the city’s deadliest intersections and consider installing leading pedestrian intervals and exclusive pedestrian phases—signals proven to protect people on foot. The bill’s failure leaves dangerous crossings unchanged.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation began planning a dedicated lane from Tillary Street to Avenue V. Joseph said, "Bringing a bus lane to the road will speed up bus service, while also helping to lower reliance on private cars, which will in turn help lower traffic." The B41 bus, one of Brooklyn’s busiest, crawls through traffic. Mayor Eric Adams and MTA Chair Janno Lieber also back the project, calling it a priority for bus infrastructure. The city will gather community input before moving forward. No formal bill number or committee is assigned yet. The project remains in early planning, with advocates pushing for safer, faster streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The impact injured an 18-year-old female passenger riding on the back of the bike. According to the police report, 'A moped slammed into a bike’s rear. The girl on the back seat took the hit in silence. Blood traced her face.' She suffered severe lacerations to her face but remained conscious. The report lists 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Unsafe Speed' as contributing factors. Both the moped and bike drivers were male and did not report injuries. The cyclist was wearing a helmet, as noted in the data, but the crash was driven by driver errors: unsafe speed and disregard for traffic control.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Council Members Shahana Hanif, Rita Joseph, and Crystal Hudson, whose districts border or include the park, call for a new policy to allow e-assist bikes. The article states, 'This policy is discriminatory and ableist, and harmful to climate goals.' Hanif notes e-bikes enabled her to ride after hip surgery. The ban forces riders onto dangerous streets, blocks access for families and people with limited mobility, and invites selective NYPD enforcement. The council members urge Mayor Adams to lift the ban, arguing it closes the park to those who need safe, accessible routes most.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She said, "We've designed streets all these years for cars – we need to start designing them with people in mind." Joseph, a former teacher, spoke of losing two students to traffic violence. She backed 24/7 school-zone speed cameras, higher pay and more staff for crossing guards, and new laws for speed humps near parks and hit-and-run accountability. Joseph also called for better public transit to cut car use. She said, "I love it. I would do it," about car-free school streets.
