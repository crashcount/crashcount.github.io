Since 2022, District 40 logged 4,587 crashes, with <strong>6 people killed and 2,873 injured</strong>. Pedestrians took the brunt: 569 hurt and six dead. Cars and SUVs caused most pedestrian injuries; trucks and buses killed three of the six. The numbers are not mercy. They are a roll call of loss drawn from <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city crash data</a>.</p><h3 id=bedford-and-caton-bodies-in-the-crosswalk>Bedford and Caton: bodies in the crosswalk</h3><p>At Bedford and Tilden, a 58-year-old woman crossed with the signal. A dump truck turned right and hit her. She died. The record reads: “Failure to Yield Right-of-Way,” “Making Right Turn,” “Oversized Vehicle.” It was 5:58 a.m. The driver was licensed in New Jersey. The truck was a 2014 Kenworth. It left her with “Internal” injuries and death at the scene, per <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4707890</a>.</p><p>At Caton and Coney Island Avenue, a tractor-trailer turned right as another car turned with it. A 47-year-old man, a pedestrian, suffered crush injuries to the head and died. Both vehicles were turning west. The truck was a 2006 Volvo registered in Indiana. The city log shows “Making Right Turn.” It was 9:13 p.m., per <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4580430</a>.</p><p>Nine minutes either side and a second fatal hit came on <strong>Linden Boulevard</strong>: a 47-year-old man, crossing with no signal, killed by a westbound Volvo tractor-trailer “Going Straight Ahead,” per <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4586191</a>. There is no comfort in the details.

Injuries stack up in the evening. From 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. the district saw spikes, with deaths at 5, 10, 17, 18, and two at 21:00 hours, per the city’s hour-by-hour ledger in our <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>district rollup</a>.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-do-the-killing>The machines that do the killing</h3><p>Heavy vehicles hit hard. Trucks and buses account for half the pedestrian deaths here and a share of the worst injuries. Cars and SUVs strike most often: 501 pedestrian injury cases tied to those vehicles, versus 38 for trucks and buses, per the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>cause by vehicle</a> data. The forms list “Failure to Yield,” “Right Turn,” “Going Straight Ahead.” The body count follows mass and speed.</p><h3 id=empire-boulevard-waits-for-protection>Empire Boulevard waits for protection</h3><p>Community Board 9 asked for a protected bike lane on Empire Boulevard. The painted lane fades. Crashes do not. Between 2021 and 2023, there were 406 crashes on that corridor, with 29 cyclists and 52 pedestrians injured. Two cyclists and two pedestrians have died there since 2011. Council Members Rita Joseph and Crystal Hudson represent the area. Hudson’s office called the board vote “a necessary step.” Joseph and DOT did not comment, reported <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/04/26/community-board-calls-for-protected-bike-lane-on-empire-boulevard>Streetsblog</a>.</p><h3 id=what-city-hall-has-done--and-hasnt>What City Hall has done — and hasn’t</h3><p>The Council passed a law forcing DOT to publish monthly and annual progress on the Streets Master Plan.

The SUV was making a left turn while the motorcycle was traveling straight south. The motorcycle rider, a 35-year-old male, was struck on the center front end and thrown face-first, sustaining severe facial lacerations and bleeding. The report states, 'An SUV turned left. A motorcycle came straight. No helmet. The rider flew, face-first. Flesh tore. Blood pooled on the asphalt. He stayed awake. Eyes open.' The SUV sustained damage to its right front quarter panel. The police report lists the contributing factor as 'Unspecified,' but the sequence clearly shows the SUV turning left into the motorcycle's path. The rider was not wearing a helmet, noted after the driver actions. The driver of the SUV was a 32-year-old male, wearing a lap belt and harness, and suffered minor abrasions. This collision highlights the dangers posed by turning vehicles crossing the path of oncoming motorcycles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The e-bike rider was not wearing a helmet, but the report does not cite this as a contributing factor—driver error remains central.

The board wants to upgrade the faded painted lane, which runs west to Flatbush Boulevard, to a 'vehicle-protected' lane. The matter summary states: 'bring much-needed road safety to a neighborhood.' Council Members Rita Joseph and Crystal Hudson represent the area. Hudson's spokesperson called the resolution 'a necessary step to protect cyclists and pedestrians.' Joseph and DOT did not comment. Between 2021 and 2023, Empire Boulevard saw 406 crashes, injuring 29 cyclists and 52 pedestrians. Two cyclists and two pedestrians have died since 2011. Community Board 9 has zero miles of protected bike lanes. Advocates say improvements are overdue.
