The bill, not yet passed, would require every e-bike in New York City to be registered with the Department of Transportation. Brewer stated, “I do not believe a blanket e-bike registration rule will make streets safer, nor is NYC DOT equipped to establish, manage or enforce it.” She instead sponsors Intro. 1168, mandating safe lithium-ion batteries for delivery workers, and Intro. 1163, requiring worker training and identification. Thirty-one organizations endorsed Brewer’s approach, calling Holden’s bill “ineffective, dangerous, expensive, short-sighted, and bureaucratically complicated.” Council Members Rita Joseph and Sandy Nurse also withdrew support. Opponents argue the registration bill could suppress e-bike use, increase police stops in communities of color, and worsen traffic violence. Holden dismissed these concerns, insisting his bill is vital for safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

This is the 26th cyclist killed this year—the most since Vision Zero began.</p><p class=mb3>On October 5, 2023, at Rogers and Clarkson avenues in Brooklyn, a truck driver struck and killed cyclist Emanuel Patterson. Police say both stopped at a red light; when it turned green, the truck turned right, running over Patterson. The driver stayed at the scene and was not charged. This marks the 26th cyclist death on New York City streets in 2023, the highest since the Vision Zero program began. The crash occurred in the 71st Precinct, which has seen 829 crashes, injuring 48 cyclists and 86 pedestrians this year. Council Member Rita Joseph responded, 'We must continue our efforts to make our streets safer for all.' Advocacy groups announced a rally to demand urgent action from city leaders to protect bike riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, co-sponsored by Council Member Lincoln Restler (D-Williamsburg), would apply from this year through 2028. The matter summary states the bill 'emphasizes the need for more protected bike lanes to make streets safer and increase cycling.' Joseph leads the legislation; Restler supports. The Department of Transportation failed to meet even the lower 30-mile requirement in 2022, building only 26.3 miles. DOT faces staffing shortages and budget gaps. Advocates warn that enforcement and maintenance lag, and that blocked lanes remain a threat. Joseph’s district ranks low in protected bike lane coverage, despite high rates of walking, biking, and transit use.
