Thirty-one left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 2,600 hurt since 2022. The dead do not speak. Their absence is felt in empty chairs, unopened doors, and the silence after sirens fade.</p><p>Trucks and SUVs crush bodies at corners. Pedestrians are struck crossing with the light, against the light, or just trying to live. <strong>Most injuries and deaths happen at intersections.</strong> The city’s own data shows the carnage is not random.

She voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that blamed the vulnerable instead of the reckless. She backed the SAFE Streets Act and pushed for speed humps near parks and schools.</p><p>But bills alone do not stop the bleeding. <strong>&ldquo;Redesigning our streets under Vision Zero has helped us reduce traffic deaths to historic lows but we are always looking for new ways to keep people safe,&rdquo;</strong> said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, as the city finally began <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/nyc-dot-cyclist-safety-intersections/>adding hard barriers at high-crash intersections in Brooklyn</a>.</p><h2 id=the-system-fights-backbut-not-fast-enough>The System Fights Back—But Not Fast Enough</h2><p><strong>Nearly half of all traffic deaths happen at intersections.</strong> The city is rolling out hardened daylighting—granite blocks, planters, concrete—at corners where people keep dying. Advocates call it a start, but not enough. <strong>&ldquo;Anything with real (not plastic) infrastructure in street corners is good news,&rdquo;</strong> said Jon Orcutt, but he and others <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/12/dot-unveils-safer-intersection-design-mini-protected-bike-lanes-at-corners>want more, and faster</a>.</p><p>The numbers are down, but the bodies are not gone.

The bill, not yet passed, would require every e-bike in New York City to be registered with the Department of Transportation. Brewer stated, “I do not believe a blanket e-bike registration rule will make streets safer, nor is NYC DOT equipped to establish, manage or enforce it.” She instead sponsors Intro. 1168, mandating safe lithium-ion batteries for delivery workers, and Intro. 1163, requiring worker training and identification. Thirty-one organizations endorsed Brewer’s approach, calling Holden’s bill “ineffective, dangerous, expensive, short-sighted, and bureaucratically complicated.” Council Members Rita Joseph and Sandy Nurse also withdrew support. Opponents argue the registration bill could suppress e-bike use, increase police stops in communities of color, and worsen traffic violence. Holden dismissed these concerns, insisting his bill is vital for safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Safety hangs in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On March 17, 2023, Council Member Rita Joseph (D-Flatbush) introduced a bill to require New York City to build 100 miles of protected bike lanes annually, doubling the current Streets Plan mandate. The bill, co-sponsored by Council Member Lincoln Restler (D-Williamsburg), would apply from this year through 2028. The matter summary states the bill 'emphasizes the need for more protected bike lanes to make streets safer and increase cycling.' Joseph leads the legislation; Restler supports. The Department of Transportation failed to meet even the lower 30-mile requirement in 2022, building only 26.3 miles. DOT faces staffing shortages and budget gaps. Advocates warn that enforcement and maintenance lag, and that blocked lanes remain a threat. Joseph’s district ranks low in protected bike lane coverage, despite high rates of walking, biking, and transit use. The bill sits before the Council, with DOT reviewing.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill required the Department of Transportation to install at least 100 miles of protected bicycle lanes annually until 2029. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the installation of protected bicycle lanes.' Lincoln Restler led as primary sponsor, joined by Sandy Nurse, Erik D. Bottcher, Jennifer Gutiérrez, Kristin Richardson Jordan, Shekar Krishnan, Julie Won, Chi A. Ossé, Tiffany Cabán, Christopher Marte, Crystal Hudson, and Rita C. Joseph. The bill was filed at the end of session, never enacted. The city’s protected bike lane network remains incomplete. Cyclists and other vulnerable road users still face daily risk from cars and trucks. The bill’s failure leaves the city’s most exposed travelers in harm’s way.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Adams promised 300 miles of protected bike lanes and 150 miles of bus lanes by 2025. In 2022, his administration delivered 25 miles of protected bike lanes and 11.95 miles of new or camera-protected bus lanes—far short of annual goals. The city upgraded 1,400 intersections, expanded speed and red-light cameras, and opened 46 new open streets, including Paseo Park. Adams pledged $904 million for the Streets Master Plan but missed year-one requirements. Council Member Rita Joseph praised plans for a Flatbush Avenue bus lane, while advocates like Elizabeth Adams called the lack of progress 'a troubling sign.' Enforcement against reckless drivers and placard abuse remained weak. Citi Bike expansion stalled in some neighborhoods.
