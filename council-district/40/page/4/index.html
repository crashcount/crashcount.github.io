Thirty-two left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 2,700 hurt since 2022. The dead do not get a second chance. The wounded carry scars—some seen, most not. The young are not spared. <strong>Forty-eight children injured in the last year alone.</strong></p><p>Just last month, a teenager was crushed by a distracted driver on Foster Avenue. A three-year-old was struck on Coney Island Avenue. The old and the young, the walker and the cyclist, all at risk. <strong>Trucks and SUVs do the most harm.</strong></p><h3 id=the-pattern-same-streets-same-blood>The Pattern: Same Streets, Same Blood</h3><p>The violence is not random. It is routine. <strong>Sedans, SUVs, and trucks are the main weapons.</strong> In three years, cars and SUVs caused 2 deaths and over 450 injuries to pedestrians. Trucks killed 3 more. Bikes and mopeds hurt, but they do not kill here. The crosswalk is no sanctuary. The curb is no shield.</p><h3 id=the-response-council-member-josephs-record>The Response: Council Member Joseph’s Record</h3><p>Council Member Rita Joseph has taken steps. She <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>co-sponsored bills</a> to speed up protected bike lanes, require speed humps near parks, and boost crash investigations. She voted to remove abandoned vehicles and to decriminalize jaywalking, a move that puts the burden back on drivers, where it belongs. She backed transparency on street upgrades and supported daylighting to clear crosswalks. But some bills—like the push for daylighting barriers at every intersection—are still stuck in committee, waiting for action.</p><p><strong>“It’s devastating. It’s affecting everyone in our family, especially (Ruiz’s) mom. Maddy was her only daughter,”</strong> <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>said Ruiz’s sister-in-law</a>. The grief is not abstract. It is a mother’s loss, a family’s wound.</p><h3 id=the-next-fight-demand-relentless-action>The Next Fight: Demand Relentless Action</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day without safer streets is a choice. Call Council Member Joseph. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes on Empire Boulevard and every deadly stretch. Demand that stalled bills move. <strong>“Drivers speed on that stretch of roadway,”</strong> <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>neighbors told CBS</a>. The city knows. The council knows. Now they must act.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name on the list. Call. Write. Show up.

The police report cites 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' and 'View Obstructed/Limited' as contributing factors, with driver inattention and distraction also noted.

The board wants to upgrade the faded painted lane, which runs west to Flatbush Boulevard, to a 'vehicle-protected' lane. The matter summary states: 'bring much-needed road safety to a neighborhood.' Council Members Rita Joseph and Crystal Hudson represent the area. Hudson's spokesperson called the resolution 'a necessary step to protect cyclists and pedestrians.' Joseph and DOT did not comment. Between 2021 and 2023, Empire Boulevard saw 406 crashes, injuring 29 cyclists and 52 pedestrians. Two cyclists and two pedestrians have died since 2011. Community Board 9 has zero miles of protected bike lanes. Advocates say improvements are overdue.
