Since 2022, <strong>six people have died</strong> and <strong>2,820 have been injured</strong> in crashes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). <strong>Seventeen suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong> The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors. A 64-year-old man struck dead on Flatbush Avenue. A 58-year-old woman killed by a truck turning at Tilden and Bedford. A 50-year-old woman, gone at Ditmas and East 21st. Each one, a life ended by speed and steel.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-cost-of-delay>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Cost of Delay</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most harm—three deaths, 488 injuries.

Still, the blood pools.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-missed>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Missed</h3><p>Council Member <strong>Rita Joseph</strong> has signed on to bills that matter. She voted to clear abandoned cars from crosswalks, co-sponsored laws for more protected bike lanes, and backed speed humps near parks. She voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>decriminalize jaywalking</a>, a move that ends the old game of blaming the dead for their own deaths. She co-sponsored a bill to force the city to show its work on street safety, demanding monthly updates on bike lanes and pedestrian upgrades. But when the council passed a law to warn taxi passengers about opening doors into cyclists, Joseph was absent. On Empire Boulevard, where two cyclists and two pedestrians have died since 2011, she did not comment when the <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/04/26/community-board-calls-for-protected-bike-lane-on-empire-boulevard>community board called for a protected bike lane</a>.

The dead do not read signs.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</strong> Call Council Member Joseph. Demand a protected bike lane on Empire Boulevard. Demand daylighting at every crosswalk. Demand the city use its new power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. <strong>Do not wait for another tragedy.</strong></p><p><a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

According to the police report, the collision occurred when the sedan's left front bumper hit the pedestrian's head, causing severe bleeding.

'View Obstructed/Limited' is also listed as a contributing factor. The police narrative states, 'A Dodge sedan turned left. A 75-year-old woman crossed with the signal. The bumper struck her head.
