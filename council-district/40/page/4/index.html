Thirty-one left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 2,600 hurt since 2022. The dead do not speak. Their absence is felt in empty chairs, unopened doors, and the silence after sirens fade.</p><p>Trucks and SUVs crush bodies at corners.

Advocates call it a start, but not enough. <strong>&ldquo;Anything with real (not plastic) infrastructure in street corners is good news,&rdquo;</strong> said Jon Orcutt, but he and others <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/12/dot-unveils-safer-intersection-design-mini-protected-bike-lanes-at-corners>want more, and faster</a>.</p><p>The numbers are down, but the bodies are not gone.

Brewer stated, “I do not believe a blanket e-bike registration rule will make streets safer, nor is NYC DOT equipped to establish, manage or enforce it.” She instead sponsors Intro. 1168, mandating safe lithium-ion batteries for delivery workers, and Intro. 1163, requiring worker training and identification. Thirty-one organizations endorsed Brewer’s approach, calling Holden’s bill “ineffective, dangerous, expensive, short-sighted, and bureaucratically complicated.” Council Members Rita Joseph and Sandy Nurse also withdrew support.

The mayor must now sign.</p><p class=mb3>On April 27, 2023, the New York City Council passed a slate of transportation safety bills. The measures, now headed to Mayor Eric Adams, require the Department of Transportation to report on traffic violence more often and to install traffic calming devices in areas with many senior pedestrians. The matter summary reads: 'Traffic calming devices that are designed to slow down traffic will now be mandated in parts of the five boroughs where a large number of senior citizens reside as the city plans to speed up part of its response to serious and fatal car crashes.' Speaker Adrienne Adams voted for the bills, stating, 'It's important that the Council advance equitable policies like the legislation we're voting on today to ensure that all New Yorkers can live, work and commute on safer streets.' Councilmember Rita C. Joseph, sponsor of the senior zones bill, said, 'It is our duty as this Council to take action to protect our most vulnerable residents.' Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, sponsor of the crash data bill, said the legislation 'would increase transparency, aid collaboration and help prevent traffic violence.' Both bills passed unanimously.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On April 27, 2023, the City Council committee voted on several transportation safety bills. The session included Councilmember Mercedes Narcisse of District 46, who supported the measures. The bills, as summarized, would require the Department of Transportation to create pedestrian zones for seniors, install traffic calming devices, increase the frequency of serious crash studies, and implement 'daylighting'—removing parking near intersections—at 100 sites starting January 1, 2025. The matter title reads: 'NYC Council tackles bills on policing, homeless rights and charity gambling.' Narcisse is listed as a sponsor. These actions aim to cut risk for pedestrians and seniors, especially at dangerous crossings. The council’s stance is clear: support for pedestrian safety zones, traffic calming, more crash studies, and daylighting. The vote signals a push for systemic change on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The resolution urged the State Legislature and Governor to pass S.2422 ('Sammy’s Law'), which would let New York City set lower speed limits, and A.1901, a crash victims bill of rights.

The bill, co-sponsored by Council Member Lincoln Restler (D-Williamsburg), would apply from this year through 2028. The matter summary states the bill 'emphasizes the need for more protected bike lanes to make streets safer and increase cycling.' Joseph leads the legislation; Restler supports. The Department of Transportation failed to meet even the lower 30-mile requirement in 2022, building only 26.3 miles. DOT faces staffing shortages and budget gaps. Advocates warn that enforcement and maintenance lag, and that blocked lanes remain a threat. Joseph’s district ranks low in protected bike lane coverage, despite high rates of walking, biking, and transit use. The bill sits before the Council, with DOT reviewing.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
