A school bus jumps the curb, crushing a mother and her son against a fence. In the last twelve months, <strong>743 people have been injured</strong> on the streets of District 40. <strong>Eleven suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong> Not one death this year—yet. But five dead since 2022. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.</p><p>On Caton Avenue, a witness saw the last moments of a neighbor: “I saw him at the stop light. He would go out to the cars and beg for change.

She voted to end jaywalking enforcement, shifting blame away from the people most at risk. She co-sponsored the push for 100 miles of protected bike lanes each year, but the city lags far behind. Joseph supported the call for a protected bike lane on Empire Boulevard, where two cyclists and two pedestrians have died since 2011. She has spoken after tragedy: “We must continue our efforts to make our streets safer for all.” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/10/05/another-cyclist-killed-most-ever-in-vision-zero-era>Streetsblog NYC</a></p><p>But <strong>words and bills do not stop cars</strong>.

The dead do not come back.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>The crisis is not over.</strong> The next crash is coming. The only question is who will pay. <strong>Contact Rita Joseph. Demand real protection: daylight every crosswalk, build real barriers, lower the speed limit to 20 mph.</strong> Join <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> and <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>.

All existing permits get revoked. Only disabled drivers and union contracts are spared. The bill targets abuse and privilege. It died in committee. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0500-2022 was introduced on June 2, 2022, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill sought to "prohibit the issuance of private vehicle parking permits and revoke such existing permits," with exceptions for people with disabilities and collective bargaining agreements. Council Member Christopher Marte led as primary sponsor, joined by Restler, Brewer, Joseph, Nurse, Cabán, Avilés, Bottcher, Won, Ossé, and Richardson Jordan, plus the Brooklyn Borough President. The bill aimed to end a system that let private cars claim curb space, fueling illegal parking and danger for those on foot or bike. It was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote. The status quo remains: permits still shield drivers, while vulnerable road users face the risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Julie Huntington stressed, 'This announcement must come with an investment in building protected bike lanes and safe routes to school to keep our new riders safe.'

Reynoso added, 'You don't need to do that anymore.' Avilés called parking mandates a barrier to affordable housing and climate action.

The NYPD charged Gale Grey-Lawrence with failure to yield, running a red light, and failure to exercise due care. The matter highlights deadly gaps in street design and snow removal. Council Member Rita Joseph said, 'Deaths like these happen far too often when our entire urban landscape is centered around cars, rather than actual people.' She added, 'It's clear we have so much work to do to prevent these senseless pedestrian deaths.' The intersection was still choked with snow hours after the crash. The city’s neglect and the driver’s reckless actions combined to kill. Vulnerable road users paid the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

East New York, East Flatbush, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Williamsburg, Jamaica. Council members speak. Some call for bike lanes, street redesigns, real safety. Others hesitate. The toll mounts. Streets remain hostile. Vision Zero falters.</p><p class=mb3>This council action, highlighted in a January 3, 2022 Streetsblog NYC article, spotlights deadly streets in East New York, East Flatbush, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Williamsburg, and Jamaica. The matter, 'Vision Zero Epicenters: 5 Dangerous Neighborhoods that Should Be on Eric Adams’s Agenda,' draws statements from council members. Charles Barron (East New York) showed initial reluctance but later acknowledged the need for safety and equity. Rita Joseph (East Flatbush) demanded urgent improvements, saying, 'We can and must do better as a city.' Chi Ossé (Bedford-Stuyvesant) called for expanded safe corridors. Lincoln Restler (Williamsburg) pushed for 'Vision Zero on steroids' and a network of protected bike lanes. Nantasha Williams (Jamaica) recognized the need for redesigns to curb speeding. The council’s stance: most support protected bike lanes, street redesigns, and Vision Zero policy, but action lags as deaths and injuries climb.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
