Thirty-one left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 2,600 hurt since 2022. The dead do not speak. Their absence is felt in empty chairs, unopened doors, and the silence after sirens fade.</p><p>Trucks and SUVs crush bodies at corners. Pedestrians are struck crossing with the light, against the light, or just trying to live. <strong>Most injuries and deaths happen at intersections.</strong> The city’s own data shows the carnage is not random.

She voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that blamed the vulnerable instead of the reckless. She backed the SAFE Streets Act and pushed for speed humps near parks and schools.</p><p>But bills alone do not stop the bleeding. <strong>&ldquo;Redesigning our streets under Vision Zero has helped us reduce traffic deaths to historic lows but we are always looking for new ways to keep people safe,&rdquo;</strong> said DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, as the city finally began <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/nyc-dot-cyclist-safety-intersections/>adding hard barriers at high-crash intersections in Brooklyn</a>.</p><h2 id=the-system-fights-backbut-not-fast-enough>The System Fights Back—But Not Fast Enough</h2><p><strong>Nearly half of all traffic deaths happen at intersections.</strong> The city is rolling out hardened daylighting—granite blocks, planters, concrete—at corners where people keep dying. Advocates call it a start, but not enough. <strong>&ldquo;Anything with real (not plastic) infrastructure in street corners is good news,&rdquo;</strong> said Jon Orcutt, but he and others <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/12/dot-unveils-safer-intersection-design-mini-protected-bike-lanes-at-corners>want more, and faster</a>.</p><p>The numbers are down, but the bodies are not gone.

They argue the ban unfairly targets vulnerable riders and blocks access for those who rely on e-bikes for work and daily life.

The bill came through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, first introduced April 28, 2022. The law's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to a citywide greenway plan.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors including Rivera, Hudson, and others. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor on October 27, 2022. The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law. The measure compels the city to plan and maintain safe routes for non-drivers, with regular public reporting and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On October 12, 2022, Councilmember Rita Joseph (District 40) responded to the death of cyclist Kala Santiago, struck and killed by a tractor-trailer on Parkside Avenue, Brooklyn. Joseph, in a joint statement with Transportation Alternatives, said, "The tragic death of yet another cyclist in our city, this time in my own neighborhood, shows how far we need to come to address traffic violence." Joseph called for urgent action to make streets safer. Parkside Avenue, not a designated truck route, has seen 161 injuries in five years, including 28 cyclists and 25 pedestrians. Advocates, including Danny Harris of Transportation Alternatives, demanded the city fast-track protected bike lanes, warning, "Lives are on the line." The city has completed eight miles of protected lanes this year, with a goal of 20 by January. The push for protected infrastructure follows a spike in traffic deaths and ongoing danger for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, a priority for the Adams administration and MTA, aims to speed up the B41 bus from Downtown Brooklyn to Marine Park. Narcisse and Councilmember Rita Joseph joined Mayor Eric Adams at a press conference, riding the B41 and speaking with riders. Narcisse said, “People are suffering waiting 30 minutes, 40 minutes, it’s unfair to the riders.” She stressed that better bus service could cut down on illegal dollar vans. The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, has started community engagement. Some community boards worry about lost parking, but Rodriguez called their role advisory, saying, “we want to hear what the riders want.” Narcisse acknowledged driver backlash but insisted on the need for faster, reliable transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
