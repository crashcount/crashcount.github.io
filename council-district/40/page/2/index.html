Thirty-one left with serious injuries.</strong> More than 2,600 hurt since 2022. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, elders, children. They cross the street and do not come home.</p><p><strong>Cars and trucks do most of the damage.</strong> They killed five. Trucks crushed, SUVs struck, sedans left bodies broken. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes hurt people too, but the carnage comes on four wheels more than two (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a>).</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-no-end-in-sight>Recent Crashes: No End in Sight</h3><p>The blood has not dried. In March, a box truck crushed a pedestrian’s arm. In February, a distracted driver struck a three-year-old on Coney Island Avenue. Last fall, an elderly pedestrian’s head was crushed by a pickup on Albany Avenue. The stories repeat. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h3><p>Council Member Rita Joseph has signed on to bills that could help. She co-sponsored laws to build protected bike lanes, add speed humps, and boost crash investigations (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council legislation</a>). She voted to legalize jaywalking, a move to stop blaming the dead for their own deaths (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council legislation</a>). She backed the SAFE Streets Act and a citywide greenway plan. But the pace is slow. The streets are not safe yet.</p><p><strong>The city still waits for real protection.</strong> Empire Boulevard, with its painted bike lane and history of death, has no protection. The community board <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/04/26/community-board-calls-for-protected-bike-lane-on-empire-boulevard>called for a real bike lane</a>. Joseph did not comment.</p><h3 id=the-voices-of-the-street>The Voices of the Street</h3><p>After a recent hit-and-run, a witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/brooklyn-man-90-struck-by-hit-and-run-moped-rider-dies/>said</a>, &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open.&rdquo; Another neighbor, after a moped killed a 90-year-old man, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/90-year-old-killed-brooklyn-moped-nypd/>said</a>, &ldquo;They plow right through red lights, no consideration for people crossing. They just don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Joseph. Demand protected bike lanes, daylighted intersections, and a 20 mph speed limit. Do not wait for another body in the crosswalk. The city moves slow. You cannot.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
