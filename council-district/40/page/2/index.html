In the last twelve months, <strong>743 people have been injured</strong> on the streets of District 40. <strong>Eleven suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong> Not one death this year—yet.

She voted to end jaywalking enforcement, shifting blame away from the people most at risk. She co-sponsored the push for 100 miles of protected bike lanes each year, but the city lags far behind. Joseph supported the call for a protected bike lane on Empire Boulevard, where two cyclists and two pedestrians have died since 2011. She has spoken after tragedy: “We must continue our efforts to make our streets safer for all.” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/10/05/another-cyclist-killed-most-ever-in-vision-zero-era>Streetsblog NYC</a></p><p>But <strong>words and bills do not stop cars</strong>.

Council Member Rita Joseph, representing Flatbush and Midwood, introduced legislation to speed up construction, stating, “My community has been asking for it. The Commissioner has made a commitment. He needs to step up and do it now.” Council Member Chi Ossé condemned the administration’s inaction, calling it “yet another glaring example” of broken promises. Advocates and residents cite safety and equity concerns, noting these districts suffer more cyclist injuries and deaths but get fewer protected lanes.

Critics warn registration means more stops, fewer bikes, and more danger for riders.</p><p class=mb3>On November 13, 2023, Council Member Gale Brewer (D-Upper West Side) publicly opposed Council Member Bob Holden’s proposed e-bike registration bill. The bill, not yet passed, would require every e-bike in New York City to be registered with the Department of Transportation. Brewer stated, “I do not believe a blanket e-bike registration rule will make streets safer, nor is NYC DOT equipped to establish, manage or enforce it.” She instead sponsors Intro. 1168, mandating safe lithium-ion batteries for delivery workers, and Intro. 1163, requiring worker training and identification. Thirty-one organizations endorsed Brewer’s approach, calling Holden’s bill “ineffective, dangerous, expensive, short-sighted, and bureaucratically complicated.” Council Members Rita Joseph and Sandy Nurse also withdrew support. Opponents argue the registration bill could suppress e-bike use, increase police stops in communities of color, and worsen traffic violence. Holden dismissed these concerns, insisting his bill is vital for safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
