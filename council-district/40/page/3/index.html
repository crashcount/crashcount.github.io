Safety hangs in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On March 17, 2023, Council Member Rita Joseph (D-Flatbush) introduced a bill to require New York City to build 100 miles of protected bike lanes annually, doubling the current Streets Plan mandate. The bill, co-sponsored by Council Member Lincoln Restler (D-Williamsburg), would apply from this year through 2028. The matter summary states the bill 'emphasizes the need for more protected bike lanes to make streets safer and increase cycling.' Joseph leads the legislation; Restler supports. The Department of Transportation failed to meet even the lower 30-mile requirement in 2022, building only 26.3 miles. DOT faces staffing shortages and budget gaps. Advocates warn that enforcement and maintenance lag, and that blocked lanes remain a threat. Joseph’s district ranks low in protected bike lane coverage, despite high rates of walking, biking, and transit use. The bill sits before the Council, with DOT reviewing.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lincoln Restler led as primary sponsor, joined by Sandy Nurse, Erik D. Bottcher, Jennifer Gutiérrez, Kristin Richardson Jordan, Shekar Krishnan, Julie Won, Chi A.

Adams pledged $904 million for the Streets Master Plan but missed year-one requirements. Council Member Rita Joseph praised plans for a Flatbush Avenue bus lane, while advocates like Elizabeth Adams called the lack of progress 'a troubling sign.'

The letter states, 'E-bikes are legal to ride on New York City streets and make moving around the city more accessible without adding more pollution and congestion.' The council members oppose the Parks Department’s policy that classifies e-bikes as motor vehicles, grouping them with SUVs and trucks. They argue this ban blocks access for delivery workers, families, older adults, and people with limited transit options. The lawmakers call for a new policy that permits e-bikes while addressing safety concerns, insisting the current rule undermines city values of accessibility and environmental care.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
