A woman steps into the street. A truck turns. She does not come home. In the last twelve months, <strong>over 760 people have been injured in crashes here</strong>. Ten were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. <strong>No one survived at all.</strong> The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors—children, elders, mothers, fathers.</p><p><strong>Cars and trucks do most of the harm.</strong> In this district, they have killed five people and injured hundreds more since 2022. Trucks crush bodies at corners. SUVs plow through crosswalks. The numbers do not lie: <strong>469 people hit by cars and SUVs, 35 by trucks and buses, 14 by motorcycles and mopeds, 14 by bikes</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>A witness saw a man &ldquo;laid out on the floor. His head was wide open&rdquo; after a hit-and-run moped crash. &ldquo;He hit the guy and he left&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/brooklyn-90-year-old-man-hit-run-rider/>said the witness</a>). The driver wore a mask. The victim was 90 years old. He died in the hospital. His family waits for answers. The street stays the same.</p><p>Another neighbor, Ryan Rivera, walks these blocks every day. &ldquo;I see mopeds ride illegally—no helmets, no brakes. They plow right through red lights, no consideration for people crossing. They just don&rsquo;t care&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/90-year-old-killed-brooklyn-moped-nypd/>he told reporters</a>). The danger is not new. It is everywhere.</p><h3 id=what-has-leadership-done>What Has Leadership Done?</h3><p>Council Member <strong>Rita Joseph has signed on to bills that matter</strong>. She co-sponsored laws to build more protected bike lanes, daylight intersections, and expand Open Streets. She voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable for crossing the street. She backed rewards for tips on hit-and-run drivers. These are steps. But the pace is slow. The streets do not wait.</p><p>Empire Boulevard still has no protected bike lane. Community Board 9 <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/04/26/community-board-calls-for-protected-bike-lane-on-empire-boulevard>called for it</a>. Joseph did not comment. The city has not moved. <strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong></p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Joseph. Demand a protected bike lane on Empire. Demand daylighting at every corner. Demand the citywide 20 mph speed limit. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p><p><a href=https://council.nyc.gov/districts/>Contact your council member now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The SUV was making a left turn while the motorcycle was traveling straight south. The motorcycle rider, a 35-year-old male, was struck on the center front end and thrown face-first, sustaining severe facial lacerations and bleeding. The report states, 'An SUV turned left. A motorcycle came straight. No helmet. The rider flew, face-first. Flesh tore. Blood pooled on the asphalt. He stayed awake. Eyes open.' The SUV sustained damage to its right front quarter panel. The police report lists the contributing factor as 'Unspecified,' but the sequence clearly shows the SUV turning left into the motorcycle's path. The rider was not wearing a helmet, noted after the driver actions. The driver of the SUV was a 32-year-old male, wearing a lap belt and harness, and suffered minor abrasions. This collision highlights the dangers posed by turning vehicles crossing the path of oncoming motorcycles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The board wants to upgrade the faded painted lane, which runs west to Flatbush Boulevard, to a 'vehicle-protected' lane. The matter summary states: 'bring much-needed road safety to a neighborhood.' Council Members Rita Joseph and Crystal Hudson represent the area. Hudson's spokesperson called the resolution 'a necessary step to protect cyclists and pedestrians.' Joseph and DOT did not comment. Between 2021 and 2023, Empire Boulevard saw 406 crashes, injuring 29 cyclists and 52 pedestrians. Two cyclists and two pedestrians have died since 2011. Community Board 9 has zero miles of protected bike lanes. Advocates say improvements are overdue.
