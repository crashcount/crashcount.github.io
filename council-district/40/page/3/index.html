Thirty-one left with serious injuries.</strong> More than 2,600 hurt since 2022. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, elders, children. They cross the street and do not come home.</p><p><strong>Cars and trucks do most of the damage.</strong> They killed five. Trucks crushed, SUVs struck, sedans left bodies broken. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes hurt people too, but the carnage comes on four wheels more than two (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a>).</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-no-end-in-sight>Recent Crashes: No End in Sight</h3><p>The blood has not dried. In March, a box truck crushed a pedestrian’s arm. In February, a distracted driver struck a three-year-old on Coney Island Avenue. Last fall, an elderly pedestrian’s head was crushed by a pickup on Albany Avenue. The stories repeat. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-doneand-not-done>What Leaders Have Done—And Not Done</h3><p>Council Member Rita Joseph has signed on to bills that could help. She co-sponsored laws to build protected bike lanes, add speed humps, and boost crash investigations (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council legislation</a>). She voted to legalize jaywalking, a move to stop blaming the dead for their own deaths (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council legislation</a>). She backed the SAFE Streets Act and a citywide greenway plan. But the pace is slow. The streets are not safe yet.</p><p><strong>The city still waits for real protection.</strong> Empire Boulevard, with its painted bike lane and history of death, has no protection. The community board <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/04/26/community-board-calls-for-protected-bike-lane-on-empire-boulevard>called for a real bike lane</a>. Joseph did not comment.</p><h3 id=the-voices-of-the-street>The Voices of the Street</h3><p>After a recent hit-and-run, a witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/brooklyn-man-90-struck-by-hit-and-run-moped-rider-dies/>said</a>, &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open.&rdquo; Another neighbor, after a moped killed a 90-year-old man, <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/90-year-old-killed-brooklyn-moped-nypd/>said</a>, &ldquo;They plow right through red lights, no consideration for people crossing. They just don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Joseph. Demand protected bike lanes, daylighted intersections, and a 20 mph speed limit. Do not wait for another body in the crosswalk. The city moves slow. You cannot.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The board wants to upgrade the faded painted lane, which runs west to Flatbush Boulevard, to a 'vehicle-protected' lane. The matter summary states: 'bring much-needed road safety to a neighborhood.' Council Members Rita Joseph and Crystal Hudson represent the area. Hudson's spokesperson called the resolution 'a necessary step to protect cyclists and pedestrians.' Joseph and DOT did not comment. Between 2021 and 2023, Empire Boulevard saw 406 crashes, injuring 29 cyclists and 52 pedestrians. Two cyclists and two pedestrians have died since 2011. Community Board 9 has zero miles of protected bike lanes. Advocates say improvements are overdue.
