Five people have died on these streets since 2022. Another 2,703 have been injured. Thirty-two suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same again. The dead do not speak. The wounded carry scars the city cannot count.</p><p>The violence is relentless. Cars and SUVs led the charge, killing two and injuring hundreds. Trucks killed three more. A 65-year-old woman was struck and killed by an SUV while crossing at an intersection. A dump truck crushed a pedestrian on Bedford Avenue. The details are spare, the pain is not. The city’s <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>open data shows the pattern</a>: most victims are on foot, hit at crossings, hit by drivers who failed to yield or simply did not see them.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-gaps>Leadership: Progress and Gaps</h3><p>Council Member Rita Joseph has not been silent. She voted yes on bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>remove abandoned vehicles</a> and clear blocked sightlines, a move meant to protect those on foot and bike. She co-sponsored laws to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>speed up protected bike lanes</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>require speed humps near parks</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>boost crash investigations</a>. She backed a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, forcing the city to daylight 1,000 intersections a year. These are steps, not leaps.</p><p>But the work is unfinished. Joseph was absent for a vote on warning decals for taxis, a bill with little direct safety impact. The city still moves slow. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/04/26/community-board-calls-for-protected-bike-lane-on-empire-boulevard>Empire Boulevard, with its faded paint and broken promises, waits for a protected bike lane</a>. The bodies pile up while the city studies, debates, delays. As one neighbor <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>said after a deadly hit-and-run</a>, &ldquo;drivers speed on that stretch of roadway.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>The crisis is not fate. It is policy. Every death is a choice made by those in power. The council can lower speed limits, build real protection for people on foot and bike, and end the reign of reckless drivers. The laws are there. The will is not.</p><p>Call Council Member Joseph. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes on every deadly corridor. Demand action, not words.</p><p>The dead cannot speak. The living must.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

A motorcycle came straight. No helmet. The rider flew, face-first. Flesh tore. Blood pooled on the asphalt. He stayed awake. Eyes open.' The SUV sustained damage to its right front quarter panel. The police report lists the contributing factor as 'Unspecified,' but the sequence clearly shows the SUV turning left into the motorcycle's path. The rider was not wearing a helmet, noted after the driver actions. The driver of the SUV was a 32-year-old male, wearing a lap belt and harness, and suffered minor abrasions. This collision highlights the dangers posed by turning vehicles crossing the path of oncoming motorcycles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
