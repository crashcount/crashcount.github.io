Since 2022, District 40 logged 4,587 crashes, with <strong>6 people killed and 2,873 injured</strong>. Pedestrians took the brunt: 569 hurt and six dead. Cars and SUVs caused most pedestrian injuries; trucks and buses killed three of the six. The numbers are not mercy. They are a roll call of loss drawn from <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>city crash data</a>.</p><h3 id=bedford-and-caton-bodies-in-the-crosswalk>Bedford and Caton: bodies in the crosswalk</h3><p>At Bedford and Tilden, a 58-year-old woman crossed with the signal. A dump truck turned right and hit her. She died. The record reads: “Failure to Yield Right-of-Way,” “Making Right Turn,” “Oversized Vehicle.” It was 5:58 a.m. The driver was licensed in New Jersey. The truck was a 2014 Kenworth. It left her with “Internal” injuries and death at the scene, per <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4707890</a>.</p><p>At Caton and Coney Island Avenue, a tractor-trailer turned right as another car turned with it. A 47-year-old man, a pedestrian, suffered crush injuries to the head and died. Both vehicles were turning west. The truck was a 2006 Volvo registered in Indiana. The city log shows “Making Right Turn.” It was 9:13 p.m., per <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4580430</a>.</p><p>Nine minutes either side and a second fatal hit came on <strong>Linden Boulevard</strong>: a 47-year-old man, crossing with no signal, killed by a westbound Volvo tractor-trailer “Going Straight Ahead,” per <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4586191</a>. There is no comfort in the details. Only time, direction, and a body.</p><h3 id=where-the-street-bleeds-most>Where the street bleeds most</h3><p>The worst counts cluster on our big roads. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Flatbush Avenue</a> logged 133 injuries and seven serious injuries since 2022. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Tilden Avenue</a> saw five serious injuries. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Bedford Avenue</a>, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Caton Avenue</a>, and <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Linden Boulevard</a> each recorded a death.</p><p>The clock tells on us too. Injuries stack up in the evening. From 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. the district saw spikes, with deaths at 5, 10, 17, 18, and two at 21:00 hours, per the city’s hour-by-hour ledger in our <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>district rollup</a>.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-do-the-killing>The machines that do the killing</h3><p>Heavy vehicles hit hard. Trucks and buses account for half the pedestrian deaths here and a share of the worst injuries. Cars and SUVs strike most often: 501 pedestrian injury cases tied to those vehicles, versus 38 for trucks and buses, per the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>cause by vehicle</a> data. The forms list “Failure to Yield,” “Right Turn,” “Going Straight Ahead.” The body count follows mass and speed.</p><h3 id=empire-boulevard-waits-for-protection>Empire Boulevard waits for protection</h3><p>Community Board 9 asked for a protected bike lane on Empire Boulevard. The painted lane fades. Crashes do not. Between 2021 and 2023, there were 406 crashes on that corridor, with 29 cyclists and 52 pedestrians injured. Two cyclists and two pedestrians have died there since 2011. Council Members Rita Joseph and Crystal Hudson represent the area. Hudson’s office called the board vote “a necessary step.” Joseph and DOT did not comment, reported <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/04/26/community-board-calls-for-protected-bike-lane-on-empire-boulevard>Streetsblog</a>.</p><h3 id=what-city-hall-has-done--and-hasnt>What City Hall has done — and hasn’t</h3><p>The Council passed a law forcing DOT to publish monthly and annual progress on the Streets Master Plan. The mayor returned it unsigned; it became law anyway. The text requires public tracking of protected lanes, bus lanes, and signals, per <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1105-2024</a>. Council Member Rita Joseph co-sponsored it, and later voted yes on bills to speed up pavement markings and remove abandoned cars within 72 hours — hazards that block sightlines and crosswalks (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1160-2025</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 0857-2024</a>).</p><p>Joseph also backed measures to expand Open Streets, speed protected bike lanes, require speed humps near parks, and strengthen crash investigations and parking enforcement, according to Council records compiled in our <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>timeline</a>.</p><h3 id=what-would-stop-the-next-body-on-caton>What would stop the next body on Caton?</h3><p>Use tools we already name on paper. Three fixes rise from the data:</p><ul><li>Daylight the corners where turning trucks kill. A bill to ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and add barriers citywide is laid over in committee, with Public Advocate Jumaane Williams and others backing faster rollout, per <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1138-2024</a>.</li><li>Harden turns and add leading pedestrian intervals at Bedford/Tilden and Coney Island/Caton. Failure to yield and right-turn strikes are written into the fatal files: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>4707890</a>, <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>4580430</a>.</li><li>Build the protected bike lane on Empire Boulevard the board asked for.

Albany passed Sammy’s Law. New York City can cut residential limits to 20 mph. Advocates are calling for a citywide default and for speed limiters on drivers who rack up tickets. Read our full brief and take action in our <a href=/take_action/>campaign guide</a>.</p><p>One more number. In the last 12 months, this district saw 1 death and 877 injuries across 1,344 crashes.

The incident occurred as she stepped down from a parked SUV. The report states, 'A Ford strikes her head with its front bumper. Blood pools on the curb. She is conscious.' The child suffered severe lacerations to her head and was listed as injured but conscious. The police report explicitly notes that 'the driver was distracted' and that 'alcohol was involved.'
