Since 2022, <strong>six people have died</strong> and <strong>2,820 have been injured</strong> in crashes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). <strong>Seventeen suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong> The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors. A 64-year-old man struck dead on Flatbush Avenue. A 58-year-old woman killed by a truck turning at Tilden and Bedford. A 50-year-old woman, gone at Ditmas and East 21st. Each one, a life ended by speed and steel.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-cost-of-delay>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Cost of Delay</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most harm—three deaths, 488 injuries.

Still, the blood pools.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-missed>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Missed</h3><p>Council Member <strong>Rita Joseph</strong> has signed on to bills that matter. She voted to clear abandoned cars from crosswalks, co-sponsored laws for more protected bike lanes, and backed speed humps near parks. She voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>decriminalize jaywalking</a>, a move that ends the old game of blaming the dead for their own deaths. She co-sponsored a bill to force the city to show its work on street safety, demanding monthly updates on bike lanes and pedestrian upgrades. But when the council passed a law to warn taxi passengers about opening doors into cyclists, Joseph was absent. On Empire Boulevard, where two cyclists and two pedestrians have died since 2011, she did not comment when the <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/04/26/community-board-calls-for-protected-bike-lane-on-empire-boulevard>community board called for a protected bike lane</a>.

The dead do not read signs.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</strong> Call Council Member Joseph. Demand a protected bike lane on Empire Boulevard. Demand daylighting at every crosswalk. Demand the city use its new power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. <strong>Do not wait for another tragedy.</strong></p><p><a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The impact pushed the Camry aside and sent the Audi into four pedestrians—a mother and her three young children—crossing in the crosswalk. Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch stated, "This was a horrific tragedy caused by someone who shouldn't have been on the road." The mother and two daughters died; a four-year-old boy remains in critical condition. The Audi overturned. Speed cameras are present at the intersection, but the investigation continues. No criminal charges have been filed. The crash highlights the lethal risk posed by unlicensed drivers and the vulnerability of people on foot, even in marked crosswalks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident occurred as she stepped down from a parked SUV. The report states, 'A Ford strikes her head with its front bumper. Blood pools on the curb. She is conscious.' The child suffered severe lacerations to her head and was listed as injured but conscious. The police report explicitly notes that 'the driver was distracted' and that 'alcohol was involved.' These driver errors—distraction and alcohol use—are central to the crash. The report does not cite any contributing factors related to the victim’s behavior. The impact and aftermath underscore the ongoing systemic danger faced by the city’s most vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
