In the last twelve months, <strong>743 people have been injured</strong> on the streets of District 40. <strong>Eleven suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong> Not one death this year—yet.

She voted to end jaywalking enforcement, shifting blame away from the people most at risk. She co-sponsored the push for 100 miles of protected bike lanes each year, but the city lags far behind. Joseph supported the call for a protected bike lane on Empire Boulevard, where two cyclists and two pedestrians have died since 2011. She has spoken after tragedy: “We must continue our efforts to make our streets safer for all.” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/10/05/another-cyclist-killed-most-ever-in-vision-zero-era>Streetsblog NYC</a></p><p>But <strong>words and bills do not stop cars</strong>.

The bill, co-sponsored by Council Member Lincoln Restler (D-Williamsburg), would apply from this year through 2028. The matter summary states the bill 'emphasizes the need for more protected bike lanes to make streets safer and increase cycling.' Joseph leads the legislation; Restler supports. The Department of Transportation failed to meet even the lower 30-mile requirement in 2022, building only 26.3 miles. DOT faces staffing shortages and budget gaps. Advocates warn that enforcement and maintenance lag, and that blocked lanes remain a threat. Joseph’s district ranks low in protected bike lane coverage, despite high rates of walking, biking, and transit use. The bill sits before the Council, with DOT reviewing.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lincoln Restler led as primary sponsor, joined by Sandy Nurse, Erik D. Bottcher, Jennifer Gutiérrez, Kristin Richardson Jordan, Shekar Krishnan, Julie Won, Chi A.

They say the rule punishes workers and families. E-bikes are legal on city streets. The ban blocks access and forces riders into danger elsewhere.</p><p class=mb3>On December 22, 2022, Councilmember Rita Joseph (District 40) joined Crystal Hudson and Shahana Hanif in urging the Parks Department to repeal the Prospect Park e-bike ban. The matter, titled 'Brooklyn pols call for repeal of Prospect Park e-bike ban,' highlights how the current policy keeps e-bikers out of the park, even after citywide legalization. The councilmembers wrote, 'E-bike users include delivery workers who keep us fed, families on cargo bikes, individuals recovering from surgery, older adults, people who live in areas with fewer public transit options, those who want to limit their carbon footprint by not driving cars, and so many more.' They argue the ban unfairly targets vulnerable riders and blocks access for those who rely on e-bikes for work and daily life. The Parks Department’s stance forces e-bike users onto more dangerous streets, undermining safety and equity. The councilmembers call for a new, inclusive policy shaped by community input.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
