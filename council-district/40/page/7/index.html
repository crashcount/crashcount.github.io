Thirty-one left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 2,600 hurt since 2022. The dead do not speak. Their absence is felt in empty chairs, unopened doors, and the silence after sirens fade.</p><p>Trucks and SUVs crush bodies at corners.

Advocates call it a start, but not enough. <strong>&ldquo;Anything with real (not plastic) infrastructure in street corners is good news,&rdquo;</strong> said Jon Orcutt, but he and others <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/12/dot-unveils-safer-intersection-design-mini-protected-bike-lanes-at-corners>want more, and faster</a>.</p><p>The numbers are down, but the bodies are not gone.

The resolution states: 'Providing instruction in bicycle and traffic safety in schools, starting at an early age and continuing throughout students' years in school, would be an effective measure to both promote cycling and prevent bicycle accidents and other safety incidents.' Bottcher criticized the Department of Education for failing to follow the law, noting only a handful of schools offer bike lessons. Bottcher said, 'We want to see that program enlarged significantly.' Advocates support the push but warn that education alone is not enough. Julie Huntington stressed, 'This announcement must come with an investment in building protected bike lanes and safe routes to school to keep our new riders safe.' Bottcher put the responsibility on drivers: 'Drivers are in the vehicle that weighs thousands of pounds... if they hit someone with their car, it’s very likely they could take their life.'

The group, including Council Members Jennifer Gutierrez, Crystal Hudson, Chi Osse, Sandy Nurse, Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Rita Joseph, and Farah Louis, demands that developers seeking zoning changes first apply for a special permit to waive parking requirements. Restler said, 'Developers need our consent and approval, and we are telling them, plainly, that they have to file for a special permit to end parking requirements.' Reynoso added, 'You don't need to do that anymore.' Avilés called parking mandates a barrier to affordable housing and climate action. The group argues that parking minimums raise construction costs, encourage car use, and block green space. Restler warned he is 'far more likely to vote no' on projects without a parking waiver.
