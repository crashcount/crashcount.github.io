A cyclist, sixty-two, dead on College Point Boulevard. A woman’s legs crushed by a van with bad brakes. In the last twelve months, one person died and sixteen suffered serious injuries on the streets of District 19. Children are not spared—one killed, three left with life-altering wounds. In all, 827 people were hurt in 1,342 crashes. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><h2 id=who-pays-who-acts>Who Pays, Who Acts</h2><p>Cars and SUVs do the most harm. In three years, they killed four and seriously injured twelve. Trucks and buses added two more serious injuries. Not a single cyclist killed anyone. The deadliest crashes come from speed, distraction, and drivers without licenses. David Berney, 43, died on the Whitestone Expressway. The man who killed him ran. He drove without a license. It took a year to arrest him. His sister <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/05/queens-whitestone-expressway-hit-and-run-crash-unlicensed-james-vennitti-david-berney/>expressed relief at the arrest after 12 months</a>.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-delay-and-denial>Leadership: Action, Delay, and Denial</h2><p>Council Member Vickie Paladino has stood in the way of proven safety. She voted against ending jaywalking tickets—a law that stops blaming victims and targets real danger (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council legislation</a>). She opposed <a href=https://nypost.com/2022/05/26/nyc-council-signs-off-on-24-7-speed-enforcement-cameras/>24/7 speed cameras</a>, which cut speeding and save lives. She fought <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/08/29/more-open-school-streets-coming-to-nyc-this-fall>new bike lanes and greenways</a>, even as <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/28/report-a-record-number-of-kids-were-killed-on-nyc-streets-last-year>children die in record numbers</a>. She backed <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/12/10/trojan-horse-e-bike-licensing-bill-would-fuel-anti-immigrant-policing>e-bike licensing bills that target immigrants</a>, not reckless drivers. When the city expanded car-free school streets, she called it a win. But the record shows more opposition than action.</p><h2 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h2><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Every day of delay means another family broken. Call Council Member Paladino. Demand she back 20 mph speed limits, protected bike lanes, and 24/7 speed cameras.

The impact damaged the right side doors of the sedan and the motorcycle’s front end. Two other occupants, a 42-year-old female driver and a 29-year-old male, were listed with unspecified injuries.

The rally, also attended by Council Member Bob Holden, highlighted injuries from e-bike collisions. The event summary reads: 'Over 100 New Yorkers, including cyclists, victims of e-vehicle collisions, and supporters, gathered outside Central Park... to demand an end to a program that allows e-bike riding in city parks.' Paladino sponsors the bill, with 19 council members signed on. Janet Schroeder of the NYC e-vehicle Safety Alliance argued, 'Parks are for recreation, not transportation.' NYC Parks officials defended the current program, but advocates insisted that e-vehicles threaten the safety and peace of park users.

According to the police report, the sedan was 'making left turn' when it struck the cyclist, who was 'going straight ahead.' The report states, 'Steel met skin. The rider, 32, fell hard. Legs crushed.' The cyclist suffered crush injuries to the lower legs and remained conscious at the scene. Police explicitly list 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor for both the sedan and the crash overall. The sedan’s left front bumper struck the bike’s center front end. The report notes the cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this is mentioned only after driver distraction is cited as the cause.

The bill is supported by a majority of council members and discussed in recent committee hearings. The official summary states it aims to improve public safety. Council Member Vickie Paladino backs the bill, suggesting bike lane funds be diverted to its rollout. Speaker Adrienne Adams voiced concern for immigrant communities but did not address the bill's direct impact. Critics, including Michael Sisitzky of NYCLU and Luis Cortes of Los Deliveristas Unidos, warn the bill will lead to discriminatory policing and criminalize delivery workers. Experts say e-bikes are linked to a small share of road deaths, and the bill could expose immigrants to federal enforcement. The measure, they argue, misses the real dangers on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states the vehicle was moving with 'Unsafe Speed,' which is cited as a contributing factor. The right front bumper took the brunt of the impact, leaving the car 'demolished.' A 17-year-old front passenger suffered severe crush injuries to his hips and upper legs. He was wearing a lap belt and harness and remained conscious after the collision. The report also notes 'Tire Failure/Inadequate' as a secondary contributing factor. The narrative describes the violence of the crash: 'The right front hit hard. Metal folded. A 17-year-old boy, belted in front, screamed through crushed hips.' No actions by the passenger are listed as contributing to the crash. The focus remains on the excessive speed and mechanical failure that led to devastating harm.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

No formal bill number or committee is cited, but the shift signals momentum.

The event saw yelling, name-calling, and shoving, forcing officials to postpone. In response, DOT announced a new code of conduct for future meetings. Paladino insisted her district’s residents deserve a voice and opposed the project, saying, 'Some people were trying to shove the project down our throats.'

She encouraged greenway opponents to leave, sparking tension. Paladino argued, 'bike lanes are not presently being used here,' and claimed connecting neighborhoods via the greenway could facilitate crime.
