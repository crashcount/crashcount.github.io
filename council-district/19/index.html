Elsewhere in Queens this week, a man died in a hit-and-run near JFK. Police said, “<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/police-investigate-hit-run-death-springfield-gardens-queens-john-kennedy-international-airport/17524816/>The operator of the vehicle fled the scene after hitting the man.</a>” The Daily News put it bluntly: “<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/13/queens-hit-and-run-driver-kills-52-year-old-man-near-jfk-airport/>The driver sped off without stopping. No arrests have been made.</a>” Different precinct. Same city. Same risk for people on foot.</p><p>What Paladino Has Done — And Undone
Council Member Vickie Paladino <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>backed a new bill</a> on August 14 to strip the Streets Master Plan of its bike and bus lane quotas (Int 1362-2025). The bill is in committee; no vote yet. Removing clear lane targets means fewer protected places to walk to the bus or ride a bike.
She also <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>voted yes</a> to tow derelict cars faster — a practical fix that clears sightlines and crosswalks (Int 0857-2024). She publicly celebrated new <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/08/29/more-open-school-streets-coming-to-nyc-this-fall>School Streets</a> at PS 129, which keep cars away from kids at the curb.</p><p>The Pattern</p><ul><li>Fatal crashes concentrate on arterials: Northern Boulevard, the Cross Island, Whitestone Expressway.</li><li>SUVs and sedans account for most pedestrian deaths and injuries here; trucks and buses trail far behind (per <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>district data</a>).</li><li>The numbers do not flinch. People do.</li></ul><p>What Now
Keep the fixes that work. Drop the ones that stall. Tell Paladino to keep protections, not erase them. Call 212-788-7250. Email <a href=mailto:District19@council.nyc.gov>District19@council.nyc.gov</a>. Then press City Hall to slow the streets and build the lanes.

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code...in relation to vehicles reported as abandoned to the department of sanitation," requires the Department of Sanitation to remove derelict vehicles within 72 hours of report. The NYPD must tow cars lacking valid plates or stickers. Prime sponsor Selvena N. Brooks-Powers led, joined by Crystal Hudson, Amanda Farías, Lincoln Restler, and others. The law targets street hazards, clearing blocked sightlines and crosswalks. It aims to cut risks for pedestrians and cyclists by removing abandoned vehicles fast.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Police allege Peña was 'drunk and high on cocaine and marijuana' and speeding at 83 mph when he 'ran a red light and T-boned a car driven by 24-year-old Justin Diaz.' The crash happened at Northern Boulevard and East 107th Street as Diaz drove to work. Prosecutors cited Peña’s firing from the FDNY and prior legal issues to argue for remand, but the appellate court released him with minimal bail conditions. Peña faces manslaughter and other charges, with a possible 15-year sentence if convicted. The case highlights the lethal risk of impaired, reckless driving and the limits of pretrial detention policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
