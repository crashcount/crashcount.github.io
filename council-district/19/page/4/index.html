It sits in committee (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>).

The road stayed silent.</p><p class=mb3>A 17-year-old girl was killed while riding on the outside of a 2002 Honda motorcycle on Cross Island Parkway just after midnight. According to the police report, the motorcycle made a left turn when the passenger, who was wearing a helmet, was ejected and suffered fatal head injuries. The driver, a male with only a permit, was operating the motorcycle at an unsafe speed. The police report lists 'Driver Inexperience' and 'Unsafe Speed' as contributing factors. The victim was a passenger, not responsible for the crash. The report notes she was helmeted, but the primary causes were driver error and inexperience.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
