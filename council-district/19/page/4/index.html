Fifteen left with injuries that will not heal.</strong> In the last year and a half, this is the price paid by people in District 19 for crossing a street, riding a bike, or just being in the wrong place when a driver made a mistake. The numbers do not tell you about the silence after the sirens fade. They do not show you the blood on the curb, or the way a family waits for news that will break them.</p><p>Just last month, a 74-year-old man was killed crossing at Northern Boulevard and 217th Street. The SUV kept going straight. The man did not. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>He died at the scene</a>.</p><p>On July 11, eight people were hurt when an MTA bus jumped the curb in Flushing. The driver, just 25, told investigators he &ldquo;misjudged the curb.&rdquo; Video showed more. He had fallen asleep at the wheel. The MTA pulled him from service. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>&ldquo;I was all the way in the back and all of a sudden the bus hit the curb, I guess, jumped the curb, I went this way and that way and banged into the side of the bus,&rdquo;</a> said one rider. The crash missed two people at the stop by inches.</p><h3 id=the-record-of-leadership>The Record of Leadership</h3><p>Council Member Vickie Paladino has voted for some safety bills. She backed laws to clear abandoned vehicles from streets, to require better pavement markings, and to speed up the removal of utility poles and wires. She co-sponsored a bill to put speed humps near parks. These are steps, but they are not enough. She also voted <strong>against</strong> a bill that would have made it safer for people to cross the street by legalizing safe crossings outside the crosswalk. The dead do not care about technicalities. They are just dead.</p><p>Paladino has supported new school streets, calling them a win for children. But she has also pushed for more e-bike registration, a move that does little to stop the cars and trucks that do most of the killing.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every death and injury is a choice made by those in power. The city now has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so. The council can demand more protected crossings, more daylighted corners, more enforcement against reckless drivers—not just cyclists and delivery workers.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people outside cars.</strong> The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a warning.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
