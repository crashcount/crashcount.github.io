Fifteen seriously hurt.</strong> In the past year, District 19 saw 1,407 crashes. <strong>Children, elders, and working people—no one is spared.</strong> A 74-year-old man was killed crossing at Northern Boulevard and 217th Street, struck by an SUV.

A family left waiting.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h2><p>Council Member Vickie Paladino has voted for bills to clear abandoned vehicles and improve street safety reporting. She co-sponsored a bill to require speed humps near parks. She voted yes on pavement marking improvements and on removing derelict vehicles within 72 hours—measures that clear sightlines and protect those on foot and bike. But she voted <strong>no</strong> on a bill to decriminalize jaywalking, a law that would have protected pedestrians from needless punishment.</p><p>Paladino celebrated new open streets at PS 129, calling it a win for safe pick-up and play (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/08/29/more-open-school-streets-coming-to-nyc-this-fall>Streetsblog NYC</a>). But the work is not done. <strong>Every week brings another crash.</strong></p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Paladino.

She suffered severe lacerations but remained conscious at the scene. The report states, 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as contributing factors. The driver, a man alone in the vehicle, did not yield to the pedestrian. The woman was following the signal. No injuries were reported for the driver. The crash highlights the danger when drivers ignore traffic controls and fail to yield to people crossing the street.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
