Your Council Member is Vickie Paladino. On Aug 14, 2025 she sponsored <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1362-2025</a>, a bill that would remove protected bike and bus lane benchmarks from the Streets Master Plan. It sits in committee (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>). She also voted yes to speed derelict vehicle removal (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 0857-2024</a>) and was absent on a dooring-warning decal bill for taxis and for-hire vehicles (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 0193-2024</a>). She voted no on the jaywalking reform bill (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 0346-2024</a>).</p><p>On transit funding, she said, “They laugh at your concerns because they don&rsquo;t care… this moron is going to get billions more dollars on the backs of working people” (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/14/nyc-subway-safety-crime-congestion-pricing-opponents>Streetsblog NYC</a>). The anger is clear. The crashes here are clearer.</p><p>Your Assembly Member is Ed Braunstein. Your State Senator is Toby Stavisky. Albany controls tools for repeat speeders. The bill to force the worst offenders to slow down is ready. City Hall controls speed limits. Lower speeds save lives. Both levers exist.</p><h3 id=do-one-thing-today>Do one thing today</h3><p>Tell your lawmakers to slow the cars and stop the repeat offenders. The steps are laid out <a href=/take_action/>here</a>.
