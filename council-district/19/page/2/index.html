A cyclist, sixty-two, dead on College Point Boulevard. A woman’s legs crushed by a van with bad brakes. In the last twelve months, one person died and sixteen suffered serious injuries on the streets of District 19. Children are not spared—one killed, three left with life-altering wounds. In all, 827 people were hurt in 1,342 crashes.

In three years, they killed four and seriously injured twelve. Trucks and buses added two more serious injuries. Not a single cyclist killed anyone. The deadliest crashes come from speed, distraction, and drivers without licenses. David Berney, 43, died on the Whitestone Expressway. The man who killed him ran. He drove without a license. It took a year to arrest him. His sister <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/05/queens-whitestone-expressway-hit-and-run-crash-unlicensed-james-vennitti-david-berney/>expressed relief at the arrest after 12 months</a>.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-delay-and-denial>Leadership: Action, Delay, and Denial</h2><p>Council Member Vickie Paladino has stood in the way of proven safety. She voted against ending jaywalking tickets—a law that stops blaming victims and targets real danger (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council legislation</a>). She opposed <a href=https://nypost.com/2022/05/26/nyc-council-signs-off-on-24-7-speed-enforcement-cameras/>24/7 speed cameras</a>, which cut speeding and save lives. She fought <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/08/29/more-open-school-streets-coming-to-nyc-this-fall>new bike lanes and greenways</a>, even as <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/28/report-a-record-number-of-kids-were-killed-on-nyc-streets-last-year>children die in record numbers</a>. She backed <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/12/10/trojan-horse-e-bike-licensing-bill-would-fuel-anti-immigrant-policing>e-bike licensing bills that target immigrants</a>, not reckless drivers. When the city expanded car-free school streets, she called it a win. But the record shows more opposition than action.</p><h2 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h2><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Every day of delay means another family broken. Call Council Member Paladino. Demand she back 20 mph speed limits, protected bike lanes, and 24/7 speed cameras.

Transportation experts like Sam Schwartz called for stronger action: 'There’s a lot more the city can do.' The NYPD and Sanitation Department have removed some ghost plates, but enforcement remains patchy. Placard abuse and fake plates let drivers dodge tolls and traffic laws, eroding the policy’s impact. The anonymous watchdog Placard Corruption noted, 'Even a strong effort would probably take some time to reverse years of corruption.'

Paladino also shared footage of vigilantes destroying enforcement cameras in London, warning, "it would be foolish to believe the same won't happen here in due time."

On December 10, 2024, Manhattan Community Board 2’s transportation and parks committees reviewed Council Member Vickie Paladino’s proposal to ban e-bikes from city parks. The committees voted overwhelmingly against it. The matter, described as an effort to 'make it more harmonious and safer for people in parks,' was criticized as 'not fleshed out.' Paladino, a Queens Republican, failed to provide data or address existing rules. Co-sponsor Gale Brewer admitted she signed on under pressure and doubted enforcement. Committee members Shirley Secunda, Susanna Aaron, Janet Liff, and Jeannine Kiely all voiced strong opposition, calling the bill redundant and inadequate. The Central Park Conservancy declined to endorse a ban, urging more protected bike lanes instead. The board found the proposal did nothing for safety and ignored systemic issues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill is supported by a majority of council members and discussed in recent committee hearings. The official summary states it aims to improve public safety. Council Member Vickie Paladino backs the bill, suggesting bike lane funds be diverted to its rollout. Speaker Adrienne Adams voiced concern for immigrant communities but did not address the bill's direct impact. Critics, including Michael Sisitzky of NYCLU and Luis Cortes of Los Deliveristas Unidos, warn the bill will lead to discriminatory policing and criminalize delivery workers. Experts say e-bikes are linked to a small share of road deaths, and the bill could expose immigrants to federal enforcement. The measure, they argue, misses the real dangers on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states the vehicle was moving with 'Unsafe Speed,' which is cited as a contributing factor. The right front bumper took the brunt of the impact, leaving the car 'demolished.' A 17-year-old front passenger suffered severe crush injuries to his hips and upper legs. He was wearing a lap belt and harness and remained conscious after the collision. The report also notes 'Tire Failure/Inadequate' as a secondary contributing factor. The narrative describes the violence of the crash: 'The right front hit hard. Metal folded. A 17-year-old boy, belted in front, screamed through crushed hips.' No actions by the passenger are listed as contributing to the crash.
