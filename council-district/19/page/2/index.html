A cyclist, sixty-two, dead on College Point Boulevard. A woman’s legs crushed by a van with bad brakes. In the last twelve months, one person died and sixteen suffered serious injuries on the streets of District 19. Children are not spared—one killed, three left with life-altering wounds. In all, 827 people were hurt in 1,342 crashes. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><h2 id=who-pays-who-acts>Who Pays, Who Acts</h2><p>Cars and SUVs do the most harm. In three years, they killed four and seriously injured twelve. Trucks and buses added two more serious injuries. Not a single cyclist killed anyone. The deadliest crashes come from speed, distraction, and drivers without licenses. David Berney, 43, died on the Whitestone Expressway. The man who killed him ran. He drove without a license. It took a year to arrest him. His sister <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/05/queens-whitestone-expressway-hit-and-run-crash-unlicensed-james-vennitti-david-berney/>expressed relief at the arrest after 12 months</a>.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-delay-and-denial>Leadership: Action, Delay, and Denial</h2><p>Council Member Vickie Paladino has stood in the way of proven safety. She voted against ending jaywalking tickets—a law that stops blaming victims and targets real danger (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council legislation</a>). She opposed <a href=https://nypost.com/2022/05/26/nyc-council-signs-off-on-24-7-speed-enforcement-cameras/>24/7 speed cameras</a>, which cut speeding and save lives. She fought <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/08/29/more-open-school-streets-coming-to-nyc-this-fall>new bike lanes and greenways</a>, even as <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/28/report-a-record-number-of-kids-were-killed-on-nyc-streets-last-year>children die in record numbers</a>. She backed <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/12/10/trojan-horse-e-bike-licensing-bill-would-fuel-anti-immigrant-policing>e-bike licensing bills that target immigrants</a>, not reckless drivers. When the city expanded car-free school streets, she called it a win. But the record shows more opposition than action.</p><h2 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h2><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Every day of delay means another family broken. Call Council Member Paladino. Demand she back 20 mph speed limits, protected bike lanes, and 24/7 speed cameras. Join <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a> and <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a>. Stand up. Speak out.

The op-ed, titled 'We Just Want Safety While Vickie Paladino Wants Chaos and Danger,' details Paladino's actions: she misled supporters about the meeting, encouraged disruption, and left with her group. Paladino claimed, 'Bike lanes are not presently being used here,' and voiced fears that greenways would enable crime. She framed cyclists as outsiders and dismissed community input. The op-ed accuses her of fueling division and suppressing dissent. After Paladino's exit, the workshop shifted to productive discussion about safe infrastructure for all, especially the most vulnerable.

Councilwoman Vickie Paladino celebrated the new open street at PS 129, calling it a win for safe pick-up, drop-off, and play. Funding comes from the Public Space Equity Program, with $30 million focused on under-resourced areas. Street Lab will provide programming and street furniture. The program responds to past investigations showing higher crash and injury rates outside schools, especially in poorer neighborhoods.

The law would require all unregistered e-bikes, mopeds, and scooters to register with the NYC Department of Transportation and display a visible plate. The bill honors Priscilla Loke, killed by an e-bike rider who ran a red light. Paladino declared, 'It's time for e-bike accountability. Our streets cannot be a free-for-all when it comes to these motorized vehicles, which are increasingly causing chaos throughout the city.' The bill has support from 31 council members. Emergency doctors report rising injuries and deaths from e-vehicle crashes. The city’s crackdown continues, but the toll mounts.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states the SUV was making a right turn when it struck the cyclist, who was traveling east. The cyclist, a 53-year-old woman, suffered crush injuries to her lower leg after the SUV’s front left quarter panel hit her. She remained conscious but was bleeding on the pavement. According to the police report, 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' was cited as the contributing factor, highlighting a critical driver error. The report notes the cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this detail is listed only after the driver’s failure to yield. The impact and resulting injury underscore the dangers faced by cyclists when drivers do not yield as required.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Streets remain deadly for the vulnerable.</p><p class=mb3>On May 20, 2024, Councilmember Vickie Paladino (District 19) was mentioned in a public debate following a deadly weekend on Queens streets. The event, covered by Gothamist, highlighted that 2024 is one of the deadliest years for Queens since Vision Zero began. The matter summary states, 'Five people were killed by cars over the weekend.' Paladino criticized DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and street safety advocates, calling for a 'robust, inclusive debate.' Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives condemned the city's failure to meet the 2019 NYC Streets Plan, which mandates 50 miles of protected bike lanes and 30 miles of bus lanes each year. The city has built only 72% of required bike lanes and 19% of bus lanes. Advocates point to rising deaths, especially among children, and blame delays and opposition from local officials. The debate underscores a systemic failure to protect pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
