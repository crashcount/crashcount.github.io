Elsewhere in Queens this week, a man died in a hit-and-run near JFK. Police said, “<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/police-investigate-hit-run-death-springfield-gardens-queens-john-kennedy-international-airport/17524816/>The operator of the vehicle fled the scene after hitting the man.</a>” The Daily News put it bluntly: “<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/13/queens-hit-and-run-driver-kills-52-year-old-man-near-jfk-airport/>The driver sped off without stopping. No arrests have been made.</a>” Different precinct. Same city. Same risk for people on foot.</p><p>What Paladino Has Done — And Undone
Council Member Vickie Paladino <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>backed a new bill</a> on August 14 to strip the Streets Master Plan of its bike and bus lane quotas (Int 1362-2025). The bill is in committee; no vote yet. Removing clear lane targets means fewer protected places to walk to the bus or ride a bike.
She also <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>voted yes</a> to tow derelict cars faster — a practical fix that clears sightlines and crosswalks (Int 0857-2024). She publicly celebrated new <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/08/29/more-open-school-streets-coming-to-nyc-this-fall>School Streets</a> at PS 129, which keep cars away from kids at the curb.</p><p>The Pattern</p><ul><li>Fatal crashes concentrate on arterials: Northern Boulevard, the Cross Island, Whitestone Expressway.</li><li>SUVs and sedans account for most pedestrian deaths and injuries here; trucks and buses trail far behind (per <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>district data</a>).</li><li>The numbers do not flinch. People do.</li></ul><p>What Now
Keep the fixes that work. Drop the ones that stall. Tell Paladino to keep protections, not erase them. Call 212-788-7250. Email <a href=mailto:District19@council.nyc.gov>District19@council.nyc.gov</a>. Then press City Hall to slow the streets and build the lanes.
