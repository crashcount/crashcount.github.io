It sits in committee (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>). She also voted yes to speed derelict vehicle removal (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 0857-2024</a>) and was absent on a dooring-warning decal bill for taxis and for-hire vehicles (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 0193-2024</a>). She voted no on the jaywalking reform bill (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 0346-2024</a>).</p><p>On transit funding, she said, “They laugh at your concerns because they don&rsquo;t care… this moron is going to get billions more dollars on the backs of working people” (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/14/nyc-subway-safety-crime-congestion-pricing-opponents>Streetsblog NYC</a>).
