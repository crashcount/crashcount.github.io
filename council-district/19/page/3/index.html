A cyclist, sixty-two, dead on College Point Boulevard. A woman’s legs crushed by a van with bad brakes. In the last twelve months, one person died and sixteen suffered serious injuries on the streets of District 19. Children are not spared—one killed, three left with life-altering wounds. In all, 827 people were hurt in 1,342 crashes. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC crash data</a></p><h2 id=who-pays-who-acts>Who Pays, Who Acts</h2><p>Cars and SUVs do the most harm. In three years, they killed four and seriously injured twelve. Trucks and buses added two more serious injuries. Not a single cyclist killed anyone. The deadliest crashes come from speed, distraction, and drivers without licenses. David Berney, 43, died on the Whitestone Expressway. The man who killed him ran. He drove without a license. It took a year to arrest him. His sister <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/05/queens-whitestone-expressway-hit-and-run-crash-unlicensed-james-vennitti-david-berney/>expressed relief at the arrest after 12 months</a>.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-delay-and-denial>Leadership: Action, Delay, and Denial</h2><p>Council Member Vickie Paladino has stood in the way of proven safety. She voted against ending jaywalking tickets—a law that stops blaming victims and targets real danger (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council legislation</a>). She opposed <a href=https://nypost.com/2022/05/26/nyc-council-signs-off-on-24-7-speed-enforcement-cameras/>24/7 speed cameras</a>, which cut speeding and save lives. She fought <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/08/29/more-open-school-streets-coming-to-nyc-this-fall>new bike lanes and greenways</a>, even as <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/28/report-a-record-number-of-kids-were-killed-on-nyc-streets-last-year>children die in record numbers</a>. She backed <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/12/10/trojan-horse-e-bike-licensing-bill-would-fuel-anti-immigrant-policing>e-bike licensing bills that target immigrants</a>, not reckless drivers. When the city expanded car-free school streets, she called it a win. But the record shows more opposition than action.</p><h2 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h2><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Every day of delay means another family broken. Call Council Member Paladino. Demand she back 20 mph speed limits, protected bike lanes, and 24/7 speed cameras.

The bill states: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring the parks department to repair damage caused by trees owned by the city of New York.' Council Members James F. Gennaro (primary sponsor), Robert F. Holden, Joann Ariola, Vickie Paladino, and Inna Vernikov back the measure. Their bill requires the Parks Department to repair sidewalks damaged by city-owned trees, removing the burden from homeowners of one-, two-, or three-family homes. Owners must notify the city if tree roots break the walk. If the damage is not tree-related, owners still have ninety days to fix it. The bill aims to clarify responsibility and ensure city action on hazards caused by its own trees.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lincoln Restler leads as primary sponsor, joined by seventeen co-sponsors including Joseph, Feliz, Louis, Marte, and others. The Department of Transportation must install speed humps on qualifying streets unless the commissioner finds it unsafe or inconsistent with DOT guidelines. The bill remains in committee.
