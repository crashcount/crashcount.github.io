Forty-eight with injuries so severe they will not forget.</strong> In the past twelve months, three people died and fifteen were seriously hurt. One was a child. One was an elder. The rest were neighbors, crossing streets, riding bikes, or just walking home.</p><p>On June 11, a 74-year-old man was killed at the intersection of 217th Street and Northern Boulevard. He was crossing. An SUV hit him. He died at the scene. The driver was unlicensed. The street was unchanged. The story is always the same.</p><p>On July 11, a Q20 bus in Flushing jumped the curb and smashed into a pole. Eight people were hurt. A passenger <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>described the chaos</a>: &ldquo;I was all the way in the back and all of a sudden the bus hit the curb, I guess, jumped the curb, I went this way and that way and banged into the side of the bus.&rdquo; The driver had fallen asleep. The MTA pulled him from service. The sidewalk was almost not empty.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>SUVs and sedans do most of the killing.</strong> In three years, SUVs alone took five lives and left fourteen with serious wounds. Trucks, buses, motorcycles, and bikes add to the toll. The dead are not numbers. They are children, elders, workers, and parents. They are you, if you walk or ride here.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h2><p>Council Member Vickie Paladino has voted for some safety bills. She backed laws to remove abandoned vehicles and clear sightlines, and to require pavement markings. She co-sponsored bills for speed humps near parks and for faster removal of sidewalk hazards. But she also voted <strong>against decriminalizing jaywalking</strong>, a move that would have protected pedestrians from police, not cars. She co-sponsored a bill to require e-bike registration, a law that burdens delivery workers and does nothing to slow cars.</p><p>Paladino celebrated new <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/08/29/more-open-school-streets-coming-to-nyc-this-fall>open school streets</a>, calling it a win for safe pick-up, drop-off, and play. But the work is not done. The streets are not safe. The dead do not come back.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a policy failure. Call Council Member Paladino. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people outside cars. Do not wait for another name on the list. <strong>Act now.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report states, 'The taxi slowed, but the driver looked away.' The woman suffered crush injuries to her knee and lower leg and went into shock.

The victim was not at an intersection and was engaged in 'Other Actions in Roadway,' but the report identifies driver distraction as the primary cause.

Steel tore. A 10-year-old boy and a 34-year-old woman crushed in their seats. Five injured. All awake. All broken.' The report lists 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as contributing factors for at least one vehicle. The narrative underscores that 'speed was too much. Yielding came too late.' Both the child and the woman, along with three others, suffered crush injuries to their entire bodies. All occupants were conscious but injured. The data points to driver actions—excessive speed and failure to yield—as the primary causes of this violent crash.

The cyclist, a 53-year-old woman, suffered crush injuries to her lower leg after the SUV’s front left quarter panel hit her. She remained conscious but was bleeding on the pavement.

According to the police report, the vehicle's right front quarter panel sustained heavy damage. The driver remained conscious, restrained by a lap belt and harness, but suffered injuries described as spreading through her entire body. The report states the driver was licensed and alone in the car. Both contributing factors are listed as 'Unspecified,' providing no further detail on the cause. The narrative notes, 'A Hyundai sedan slammed hard on its right front. The driver, a 30-year-old woman, stayed conscious. Her seatbelt held. Her bones did not. Crush injuries spread through her body like fire through dry grass.'

DOT can skip spots if safety or rules demand. Law aims to slow cars where families walk, run, and play.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0262-2024 sits with the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure after introduction on February 28, 2024. The bill reads: “requiring the installation of speed humps on roadways adjacent to any park equal or greater than one acre.” Lincoln Restler leads as primary sponsor, joined by eighteen co-sponsors. The Department of Transportation must install speed humps unless the commissioner finds a risk to safety or a conflict with DOT guidelines. The law would take effect 180 days after passage. The measure targets streets where parks meet traffic, aiming to slow cars and shield people outside vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
