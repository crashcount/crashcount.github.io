Twenty-five suffered injuries so grave they will never be the same. The dead include children, elders, and riders on foot, bike, and scooter. The city keeps counting. The bodies keep coming.</p><p><strong>Just last month, a 13-year-old boy was thrown from his moped after colliding with an MTA bus in Port Richmond.</strong> He hit the pavement hard. He left the scene in critical condition, his head battered. Police said, &ldquo;the moped went through a stop sign without stopping and hit the bus&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/moped-bus-collision-staten-island/>according to amNY</a>. The bus rolled on. The boy did not.</p><p>A week before, a 16-year-old on an e-scooter died after a crash with a Hyundai Tucson. The police said only this: &ldquo;Ellis suffered head trauma as a result of the crash&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>reported by The Brooklyn Paper</a>. No charges. No arrests. Just another name for the list.</p><h2 id=the-hazards-multiply>The Hazards Multiply</h2><p><strong>The danger is not random.</strong> Cars and trucks did the most harm: 7 deaths, 340 injuries. Trucks and buses killed 4, injured 39. Motorcycles and mopeds, bikes, all add to the toll. The old and the young are not spared. In the last year, one child died and 165 more were hurt. Two people over 75 are dead. The city’s streets are not safe for anyone.</p><p>On Hylan Boulevard, confusion breeds carnage. Borough President Vito Fossella said, “That’s one accident every four days where somebody perhaps unwittingly thinks they must turn from the middle lane in order to make a right-hand turn” <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/bus-lanes-staten-island-hylan-boulevard/>as reported by amNY</a>. The signs are unclear. The crashes keep coming.</p><h2 id=council-member-carr-action-and-inaction>Council Member Carr: Action and Inaction</h2><p><strong>Council Member David Carr has voted for some safety bills.</strong> He backed laws to speed up pavement markings and remove abandoned vehicles, both meant to clear sightlines and mark danger zones. He voted for taxi dooring warnings. But he also voted against legalizing jaywalking, a measure meant to stop punishing pedestrians for their own deaths. He co-sponsored bills to require e-bike registration and to remove speed cameras—moves that shift blame and weaken proven protections.</p><p><strong>The crisis is not fate.</strong> Every crash is a policy failure. Every delay is a choice. <strong>Call Council Member Carr. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people walking, biking, and riding.</strong> The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a warning. Act before another family mourns.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

He says all regions use transit, all must pay. Exempting suburbs would gut MTA funding. Carroll demands shared cost, warns against service cuts, and calls for real revenue.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Member Robert Carroll issued a legislative statement on April 28, 2023, urging equal cost-sharing for the MTA Payroll Mobility Tax (PMT) increase. The proposal, discussed in the Assembly, faces suburban resistance. Carroll’s statement, titled "When It Comes to Transit, Everyone Must Pay Their Fair Share," argues that exempting suburbs would cost the MTA $325 million and undermine regional transit. Carroll and NYC Assembly colleagues wrote to Speaker Heastie, demanding the PMT hike apply to both city and suburbs or, failing that, that new revenue go only to NYC Transit. Carroll said, "It is unwise and bad policy to abandon the principle of an integrated regional transportation system funded through cost sharing across the jurisdictions that benefit most from the MTA." He warns that letting only city businesses pay would be unfair and would threaten transit service. No formal safety analyst note was provided, but the statement centers on funding the transit system that protects vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
