But he also voted <strong>against daylighting intersections</strong> and <strong>against safer medians</strong>, measures proven to save lives. He co-sponsored bills to add speed humps at camera locations, but these have not become law. He voted <strong>no</strong> on ending jaywalking enforcement, a law that stops blaming the victim and starts protecting the walker. The dead do not care about intent. Only action.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every delay is a choice. Call Council Member Carr. Demand he back a citywide 20 mph speed limit, real daylighting, and street designs that put people first. Do not wait for another name on the list. The street remembers.

The law states: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the installation of traffic calming devices in senior pedestrian zones.' Council Member Darlene Mealy sponsored the bill, joined by co-sponsors including Amanda Farías, Tiffany Cabán, and others. The council voted overwhelmingly in favor on April 27, 2023. The law requires the Department of Transportation, in consultation with the Department for the Aging, to annually install at least one traffic calming device in each designated senior pedestrian zone, with a minimum of fifty devices citywide per year. DOT must report installation locations to the council every year. The law aims to slow traffic and protect older pedestrians where they are most at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0419-2022, filed by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, urges the New York State Legislature to require a statewide ballot proposal before the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s congestion pricing plan—known as the Central Business District Tolling Program—can proceed. Introduced December 7, 2022, and filed at session’s end, the resolution states: “calls upon the New York State Legislature to amend state law to make implementation of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s congestion pricing plan... subject to a statewide ballot proposal.” Council Member Kamillah Hanks led sponsorship, joined by Borelli, Carr, Louis, Yeger, Ariola, and Paladino. The sponsors raise concerns about pollution, health, and traffic impacts on outer-borough communities. The measure questions whether congestion pricing will cut traffic or fund transit improvements. No direct safety impact for vulnerable road users is assessed. The bill remains filed, with no further action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
