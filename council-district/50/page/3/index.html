He died of head trauma. Police said the driver stayed at the scene, and the case is under review (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>amNY</a>).</p><p>He was one of <strong>19 people killed</strong> on the streets of Council District 50 since Jan 1, 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). <strong>Pedestrians account for 11</strong> of those deaths in this district (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=nights-and-mornings-take-lives>Nights and mornings take lives</h3><p>Deaths stack up at the edges of the day here. The district’s log shows five deaths around 10 PM, and four more around 6 AM (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). On Hylan Boulevard, crashes have killed four people and injured 154. Jewett Avenue has seen two deaths and 18 injuries (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The deaths read like routine. A 68-year-old man, crossing in a marked crosswalk at Forest Avenue and Raymond Place, killed by a left-turning SUV; the police report lists failure to yield and distraction (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data, CrashID 4784160</a>). A 64-year-old woman, struck while crossing Mason Avenue by a left-turning SUV; again, failure to yield and distraction appear in the file (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data, CrashID 4777953</a>).</p><h3 id=heavy-vehicles-heavier-toll>Heavy vehicles, heavier toll</h3><p>Trucks and buses are a small slice of traffic but a hard edge in harm: they are tied to <strong>4 pedestrian deaths</strong> in this district’s records since 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). One worker was crushed by a reversing box truck at a Gulf Avenue warehouse late at night; the dataset records a death at that address (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-pattern-is-getting-worse>The pattern is getting worse</h3><p>Year to date, District 50 shows <strong>9 deaths</strong>, up from <strong>1</strong> at this point last year.

The victims span ages, but the toll on elders is stark: two deaths among people 75+ so far this year (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Late one night in Port Richmond, a 13-year-old on a moped hit an MTA bus at Castleton and Park. He was ejected and left with a severe head injury. As the DMV reminds riders, “The requirements to operate a moped are like those for motorcycles. You must have a driver license and register your moped to drive it on streets and highways” (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/moped-bus-collision-staten-island/>amNY</a>).</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-done--and-havent>What leaders have done — and haven’t</h3><p>Council Member <strong>David Carr</strong> voted to require fast restoration of pavement markings after repaving — a basic safety step that cuts confusion at crossings (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>). The law is on the books.</p><p>But speed remains the thread through so many of these files. City and state leaders have a bill on the table to go after repeat speeders: the <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045C/A2299C)</strong> would force drivers with long camera or point histories to install speed limiters (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/20/the-1-5-percent-of-drivers-who-cause-21-percent-of-pedestrian-deaths>Streetsblog NYC</a>). The case for it is blunt: a tiny fraction of drivers cause a huge share of deaths; racking up tickets multiplies risk (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/20/the-1-5-percent-of-drivers-who-cause-21-percent-of-pedestrian-deaths>Streetsblog NYC</a>). <strong>Assembly Member Mike Reilly</strong> and <strong>State Senator Jessica Scarcella‑Spanton</strong> represent this area. They can co-sponsor and press leadership to pass it.</p><h3 id=fix-the-streets-that-kill>Fix the streets that kill</h3><p>The map points to clear moves for District 50.</p><ul><li>Hylan Boulevard and Jewett Avenue need hardened turns, daylighting, and tighter signal timing to protect crossings. The deaths and injuries demand it (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>Target trucks at night: side guards, better backing controls, lighting, and enforcement on warehouse blocks like Gulf Avenue where workers die after dark (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>Focus on the deadly hours with enforcement and calming near bus corridors and senior routes. The late-night and early-morning spikes are in the log (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li></ul><p>Lower speeds will save lives here.

The SUV's point of impact was the center front end, consistent with a direct collision.

He says all regions use transit, all must pay. Exempting suburbs would gut MTA funding. Carroll demands shared cost, warns against service cuts, and calls for real revenue.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Member Robert Carroll issued a legislative statement on April 28, 2023, urging equal cost-sharing for the MTA Payroll Mobility Tax (PMT) increase. The proposal, discussed in the Assembly, faces suburban resistance. Carroll’s statement, titled "When It Comes to Transit, Everyone Must Pay Their Fair Share," argues that exempting suburbs would cost the MTA $325 million and undermine regional transit. Carroll and NYC Assembly colleagues wrote to Speaker Heastie, demanding the PMT hike apply to both city and suburbs or, failing that, that new revenue go only to NYC Transit. Carroll said, "It is unwise and bad policy to abandon the principle of an integrated regional transportation system funded through cost sharing across the jurisdictions that benefit most from the MTA." He warns that letting only city businesses pay would be unfair and would threaten transit service. No formal safety analyst note was provided, but the statement centers on funding the transit system that protects vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
