He died of head trauma. Police said the driver stayed at the scene, and the case is under review (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>amNY</a>).</p><p>He was one of <strong>19 people killed</strong> on the streets of Council District 50 since Jan 1, 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). <strong>Pedestrians account for 11</strong> of those deaths in this district (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=nights-and-mornings-take-lives>Nights and mornings take lives</h3><p>Deaths stack up at the edges of the day here. The district’s log shows five deaths around 10 PM, and four more around 6 AM (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). On Hylan Boulevard, crashes have killed four people and injured 154. Jewett Avenue has seen two deaths and 18 injuries (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The deaths read like routine. A 68-year-old man, crossing in a marked crosswalk at Forest Avenue and Raymond Place, killed by a left-turning SUV; the police report lists failure to yield and distraction (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data, CrashID 4784160</a>). A 64-year-old woman, struck while crossing Mason Avenue by a left-turning SUV; again, failure to yield and distraction appear in the file (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data, CrashID 4777953</a>).</p><h3 id=heavy-vehicles-heavier-toll>Heavy vehicles, heavier toll</h3><p>Trucks and buses are a small slice of traffic but a hard edge in harm: they are tied to <strong>4 pedestrian deaths</strong> in this district’s records since 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). One worker was crushed by a reversing box truck at a Gulf Avenue warehouse late at night; the dataset records a death at that address (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-pattern-is-getting-worse>The pattern is getting worse</h3><p>Year to date, District 50 shows <strong>9 deaths</strong>, up from <strong>1</strong> at this point last year.

The victims span ages, but the toll on elders is stark: two deaths among people 75+ so far this year (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Late one night in Port Richmond, a 13-year-old on a moped hit an MTA bus at Castleton and Park. He was ejected and left with a severe head injury. As the DMV reminds riders, “The requirements to operate a moped are like those for motorcycles. You must have a driver license and register your moped to drive it on streets and highways” (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/moped-bus-collision-staten-island/>amNY</a>).</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-done--and-havent>What leaders have done — and haven’t</h3><p>Council Member <strong>David Carr</strong> voted to require fast restoration of pavement markings after repaving — a basic safety step that cuts confusion at crossings (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>). The law is on the books.</p><p>But speed remains the thread through so many of these files. City and state leaders have a bill on the table to go after repeat speeders: the <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045C/A2299C)</strong> would force drivers with long camera or point histories to install speed limiters (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/20/the-1-5-percent-of-drivers-who-cause-21-percent-of-pedestrian-deaths>Streetsblog NYC</a>). The case for it is blunt: a tiny fraction of drivers cause a huge share of deaths; racking up tickets multiplies risk (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/20/the-1-5-percent-of-drivers-who-cause-21-percent-of-pedestrian-deaths>Streetsblog NYC</a>). <strong>Assembly Member Mike Reilly</strong> and <strong>State Senator Jessica Scarcella‑Spanton</strong> represent this area. They can co-sponsor and press leadership to pass it.</p><h3 id=fix-the-streets-that-kill>Fix the streets that kill</h3><p>The map points to clear moves for District 50.</p><ul><li>Hylan Boulevard and Jewett Avenue need hardened turns, daylighting, and tighter signal timing to protect crossings.

The crash happened at Huguenot Ave. and Drumgoole Ave. West, Staten Island, after a precinct holiday party. Todaro admitted, "I had three or four drinks. My life is over." The impact triggered airbags and left her with a forehead gash. All three passengers, also officers, were placed on desk duty and may face charges for allowing Todaro to drive or being unfit for duty. The article notes this was one of three NYPD DWI arrests in four days, highlighting a pattern during holiday party season. The incident raises questions about internal discipline and the risks posed by impaired driving, even among law enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the driver failed to yield the right-of-way and was inattentive or distracted at the time of the crash. The report states, 'Steel met flesh. She dropped, broken. The driver did not yield.' The impact occurred at the left front quarter panel of the SUV, causing fatal crush injuries to the pedestrian's entire body. The woman was not at an intersection and was crossing without a signal or crosswalk, as noted in the report, but the primary contributing factors remain 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction.' The driver was licensed and operating a 2023 SUV. The collision underscores the lethal consequences of driver error on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill orders the city to study which schools have closed each year and to remove speed cameras from those erased school zones. The matter title reads: 'Annual study to identify non-operational schools and the subsequent removal of speed cameras from eliminated school speed zones.' If passed, the law would strip cameras from streets where schools once stood, erasing a layer of protection for people on foot and bike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Introduced February 28, 2024, by Council Members Louis (primary), Carr, Ung, Holden, Ariola, Paladino, and Morano. The bill orders DOT to assess at least 100 speed camera locations each year for raised speed reducer feasibility. If feasible, DOT must install the bump within a year. The law demands annual reports on these checks and on shifts in dangerous driving at treated sites. The bill summary reads: 'requiring a raised speed reducer feasibility assessment at speed camera locations.' Council aims to force physical changes where cameras alone fail.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the man stepped into the street where there was 'no light, no crosswalk.' A northbound Mercedes SUV struck him head-on. The pedestrian suffered head trauma and internal bleeding and died at the scene. The police report explicitly cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor in the crash. The SUV's point of impact was the center front end, consistent with a direct collision. The report notes the pedestrian was 'crossing, no signal, or crosswalk,' but lists driver inattention as the primary cause. The deadly outcome unfolded on a street lacking basic pedestrian infrastructure, with driver error at its core.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
