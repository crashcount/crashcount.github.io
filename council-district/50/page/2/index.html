His name was Chaosheng Wu. He was 80. He tried to cross the street a block from his home. An SUV hit him. He died at the hospital. The driver stayed. No charges. Police are still asking how fast she was going, what the light showed. But Wu is gone. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/10/staten-island-pedestrian-struck-suv-driver-block-from-home-chaosheng-wu/>&ldquo;The 65-year-old driver stayed at the scene and was not charged, but police are still investigating the crash.&rdquo;</a></p><p>A worker at an Amazon warehouse. A box truck backed up. It crushed him. His name was Leony Salcedo-Chevalier. He was 34. Both men worked for subcontractors. The driver stayed. No charges. <a href=https://www.amny.com/police-fire/staten-island-amazon-warehouse-collision-04092025/>&ldquo;a 40-year-old man, while operating a box truck, backed the vehicle up at the location but wound up striking a pedestrian.&rdquo;</a></p><p>In the last 12 months, <strong>six people died</strong> on District 50 streets. <strong>Over 1,000 were hurt.</strong> Ten were seriously injured. The old, the young, the worker on his shift. The numbers do not stop. They only rise.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p>The dead are not numbers. They are fathers, mothers, neighbors. In District 50, SUVs and trucks do most of the killing. In three years, SUVs killed five pedestrians. Trucks killed two. Cars, buses, taxis—they all take their share. The street does not forgive. It does not care if you are careful or not. It only takes.</p><h2 id=what-has-david-carr-done>What Has David Carr Done?</h2><p>Council Member David Carr has voted for some safety bills. He backed redesigning truck routes to protect people at crossings. He voted to move trucks off residential streets. He co-sponsored bills for raised speed bumps at camera sites. But he also voted <strong>against 24/7 speed cameras</strong>—the only tool proven to slow drivers when no one is watching. He voted <strong>no on daylighting</strong>—the simple act of clearing parked cars from corners so drivers can see children in the crosswalk. He voted <strong>no on safer medians</strong> for pedestrians. He voted <strong>no on ending jaywalking tickets</strong>, a law that stops blaming the dead for their own deaths.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>Six dead. A thousand hurt.</strong> The council member votes yes, then no. The bodies keep coming. If you want change, you must demand it. Call David Carr. Tell him to back every proven safety measure—<strong>24/7 speed cameras, daylighting, safer crossings, lower speed limits</strong>. Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The law mandates daylighting—removing parking near intersections—to clear sight lines for drivers and protect people crossing. DOT must consult with safety groups, residents, and businesses, and replace truck route signage for better clarity.

Council Member David Carr (District 50) offered Staten Island tow pound space to help the NYPD, which faces a shortage after the Manhattan pound closed. The NYPD reported towing is up 192% for covered plates, but limited storage stalls progress.
