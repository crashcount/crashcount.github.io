But he also voted <strong>against daylighting intersections</strong> and <strong>against safer medians</strong>, measures proven to save lives. He co-sponsored bills to add speed humps at camera locations, but these have not become law. He voted <strong>no</strong> on ending jaywalking enforcement, a law that stops blaming the victim and starts protecting the walker. The dead do not care about intent. Only action.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every delay is a choice. Call Council Member Carr. Demand he back a citywide 20 mph speed limit, real daylighting, and street designs that put people first. Do not wait for another name on the list. The street remembers.

The 25-year-old moped rider, unlicensed and without a helmet, was ejected from the seat after the moped struck the center front end against the SUV's left rear bumper. The police report states the rider suffered severe lacerations to his knee, lower leg, and foot, with blood pooling at the scene. The primary contributing factor cited in the report is 'Pavement Defective,' highlighting the hazardous road conditions that caused the crash. The SUV was parked and unoccupied at the time. The report notes the rider's lack of license and helmet, but these details are listed after the systemic danger of broken pavement. The crash underscores the lethal risk posed by neglected infrastructure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Council Members Robert F. Holden, Justin L. Brannan, James F. Gennaro (primary sponsor), Farah N. Louis, Vickie Paladino, and David M. Carr back the bill.

Lives may change.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0161-2024 sits in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced February 28, 2024, it commands the Department of Transportation to assess at least 100 speed camera locations each year for raised speed reducer feasibility. The bill reads: 'requiring a raised speed reducer feasibility assessment at speed camera locations.' Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary), David M. Carr, Sandra Ung, Robert F. Holden, Joann Ariola, and Vickie Paladino sponsor the measure. If DOT finds a location suitable, it must install a raised speed reducer within a year. DOT must also report annually, track changes in dangerous driving, and recommend if cameras are still needed. The bill aims to force physical changes where drivers speed, not just rely on cameras.

According to the police report, the man stepped into the street where there was 'no light, no crosswalk.' A northbound Mercedes SUV struck him head-on. The pedestrian suffered head trauma and internal bleeding and died at the scene. The police report explicitly cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor in the crash. The SUV's point of impact was the center front end, consistent with a direct collision. The report notes the pedestrian was 'crossing, no signal, or crosswalk,' but lists driver inattention as the primary cause. The deadly outcome unfolded on a street lacking basic pedestrian infrastructure, with driver error at its core.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The law mandates daylighting—removing parking near intersections—to clear sight lines for drivers and protect people crossing. DOT must consult with safety groups, residents, and businesses, and replace truck route signage for better clarity. The law sets deadlines: initial report by November 2023, implementation by June 2024, and new signage by July 2024.

Carroll and NYC Assembly colleagues wrote to Speaker Heastie, demanding the PMT hike apply to both city and suburbs or, failing that, that new revenue go only to NYC Transit. Carroll said, "It is unwise and bad policy to abandon the principle of an integrated regional transportation system funded through cost sharing across the jurisdictions that benefit most from the MTA." He warns that letting only city businesses pay would be unfair and would threaten transit service.

Reports must go to community boards, the mayor, and the public. The bill aims to expose patterns, speed up fixes, and keep pressure on city agencies.</p><p class=mb3>Bill Int 0805-2022, now Local Law 65 of 2023, was enacted by the City Council and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The law was introduced on October 27, 2022, passed on May 29, 2023, and returned unsigned by the mayor. The bill amends the administrative code to require the Department of Transportation to conduct a comprehensive study of all pedestrian fatalities and serious injuries every three years, instead of every five. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian safety reporting.' Sponsors include Alexa Avilés (primary), Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, Crystal Hudson, Amanda Farías, Tiffany Cabán, Lynn C. Schulman, Kalman Yeger, Farah N. Louis, Lincoln Restler, Darlene Mealy, Eric Dinowitz, Linda Lee, Pierina Ana Sanchez, Carlina Rivera, Mercedes Narcisse, and Rita C. Joseph. The law mandates that crash reports and recommendations be sent to council members, community boards, and made public. This change increases transparency and keeps the focus on the deadly toll of cars in New York City.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lawmakers want more frequent, reliable, and affordable transit. They warn of a looming fiscal cliff. Without action, riders face service cuts. The vote backs millions who depend on buses and trains.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0460-2023 was adopted by the City Council on April 27, 2023, after review by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The resolution calls on the New York State Legislature and Governor to 'fully fund the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) in the State’s upcoming Fiscal Year 2024 Budget.' Council Member Farah N. Louis sponsored the measure, joined by over thirty co-sponsors. The committee vote was unanimous among present members. The resolution highlights the MTA’s critical role for millions of New Yorkers and warns of a 'looming fiscal cliff' as federal aid dries up. The Council insists that full funding is needed to prevent service cuts and keep transit affordable and frequent. The measure references the 'New York City in Six' plan, pushing for buses and trains every six minutes. The Council’s action centers the needs of riders—especially those with no other way to move safely through the city.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
