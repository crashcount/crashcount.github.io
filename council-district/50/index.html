His name was Chaosheng Wu. He was 80. He tried to cross the street a block from his home. An SUV hit him. He died at the hospital. The driver stayed. No charges. Police are still asking how fast she was going, what the light showed. But Wu is gone. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/10/staten-island-pedestrian-struck-suv-driver-block-from-home-chaosheng-wu/>&ldquo;The 65-year-old driver stayed at the scene and was not charged, but police are still investigating the crash.&rdquo;</a></p><p>A worker at an Amazon warehouse. A box truck backed up. It crushed him. His name was Leony Salcedo-Chevalier. He was 34. Both men worked for subcontractors. The driver stayed. No charges. <a href=https://www.amny.com/police-fire/staten-island-amazon-warehouse-collision-04092025/>&ldquo;a 40-year-old man, while operating a box truck, backed the vehicle up at the location but wound up striking a pedestrian.&rdquo;</a></p><p>In the last 12 months, <strong>six people died</strong> on District 50 streets. <strong>Over 1,000 were hurt.</strong> Ten were seriously injured. The old, the young, the worker on his shift. The numbers do not stop. They only rise.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h2><p>The dead are not numbers. They are fathers, mothers, neighbors. In District 50, SUVs and trucks do most of the killing. In three years, SUVs killed five pedestrians. Trucks killed two. Cars, buses, taxis—they all take their share. The street does not forgive. It does not care if you are careful or not. It only takes.</p><h2 id=what-has-david-carr-done>What Has David Carr Done?</h2><p>Council Member David Carr has voted for some safety bills. He backed redesigning truck routes to protect people at crossings. He voted to move trucks off residential streets. He co-sponsored bills for raised speed bumps at camera sites. But he also voted <strong>against 24/7 speed cameras</strong>—the only tool proven to slow drivers when no one is watching. He voted <strong>no on daylighting</strong>—the simple act of clearing parked cars from corners so drivers can see children in the crosswalk. He voted <strong>no on safer medians</strong> for pedestrians. He voted <strong>no on ending jaywalking tickets</strong>, a law that stops blaming the dead for their own deaths.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>Six dead. A thousand hurt.</strong> The council member votes yes, then no. The bodies keep coming. If you want change, you must demand it. Call David Carr. Tell him to back every proven safety measure—<strong>24/7 speed cameras, daylighting, safer crossings, lower speed limits</strong>. Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Mayor Eric Adams said over 100,000 'ghost vehicles' have been seized since 2022, including cars with fake or missing plates. Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch stated, 'This morning is not just about crushing mopeds. It is about crushing the criminal activity and quality of life activities that come with them.' The crackdown targets vehicles often used by delivery workers but also linked by officials to traffic violations and other offenses. A Citi Bike was destroyed among the pile, though officials did not explain why.

The plan allows cameras on seven bridges and two tunnels, ticketing drivers who exceed speed limits. Fines start at $50 for a first offense, rising to $75 and $100 for repeat violations within 18 months. Governor Hochul's office called the program 'one more way the governor is working to improve safety on our roads and bridges for workers and travelers alike.' MTA Bridges and Tunnels President Catherine Sheridan said, 'We want to make sure that our maintenance workers and contractors are safe.' The program, part of the $254 billion state budget, will be reviewed again in 2031.

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable. The law marks a shift: streets are for people, not just cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
