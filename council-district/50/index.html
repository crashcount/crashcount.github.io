Twenty-five suffered injuries so grave they will never be the same. The dead include children, elders, and riders on foot, bike, and scooter. The city keeps counting. The bodies keep coming.</p><p><strong>Just last month, a 13-year-old boy was thrown from his moped after colliding with an MTA bus in Port Richmond.</strong> He hit the pavement hard. He left the scene in critical condition, his head battered. Police said, &ldquo;the moped went through a stop sign without stopping and hit the bus&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/moped-bus-collision-staten-island/>according to amNY</a>. The bus rolled on. The boy did not.</p><p>A week before, a 16-year-old on an e-scooter died after a crash with a Hyundai Tucson. The police said only this: &ldquo;Ellis suffered head trauma as a result of the crash&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>reported by The Brooklyn Paper</a>. No charges. No arrests. Just another name for the list.</p><h2 id=the-hazards-multiply>The Hazards Multiply</h2><p><strong>The danger is not random.</strong> Cars and trucks did the most harm: 7 deaths, 340 injuries. Trucks and buses killed 4, injured 39. Motorcycles and mopeds, bikes, all add to the toll. The old and the young are not spared. In the last year, one child died and 165 more were hurt. Two people over 75 are dead. The city’s streets are not safe for anyone.</p><p>On Hylan Boulevard, confusion breeds carnage. Borough President Vito Fossella said, “That’s one accident every four days where somebody perhaps unwittingly thinks they must turn from the middle lane in order to make a right-hand turn” <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/bus-lanes-staten-island-hylan-boulevard/>as reported by amNY</a>. The signs are unclear. The crashes keep coming.</p><h2 id=council-member-carr-action-and-inaction>Council Member Carr: Action and Inaction</h2><p><strong>Council Member David Carr has voted for some safety bills.</strong> He backed laws to speed up pavement markings and remove abandoned vehicles, both meant to clear sightlines and mark danger zones. He voted for taxi dooring warnings. But he also voted against legalizing jaywalking, a measure meant to stop punishing pedestrians for their own deaths. He co-sponsored bills to require e-bike registration and to remove speed cameras—moves that shift blame and weaken proven protections.</p><p><strong>The crisis is not fate.</strong> Every crash is a policy failure. Every delay is a choice. <strong>Call Council Member Carr. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people walking, biking, and riding.</strong> The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a warning. Act before another family mourns.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Borough President Vito Fossella noted, “That’s one accident every four days where somebody perhaps unwittingly thinks they must turn from the middle lane.” The article reports 32 crashes in 2025 tied to drivers making right turns from the middle lane instead of the curb-side bus lane. Some signs list hours, others only say 'Bus Corridor Photo,' confusing drivers. The lack of clear, consistent information leaves intersections hazardous, especially for vulnerable road users. The report highlights a pressing need for better signage and clearer policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Her car hit another, airbags burst, blood spilled. Three fellow officers rode with her. All face discipline. Two more NYPD drunk-driving arrests followed. System failed. Streets paid.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News (2024-12-16) reports that NYPD Officer Diana Todaro was arrested for driving while intoxicated after crashing her car with three colleagues as passengers. The crash happened at Huguenot Ave. and Drumgoole Ave. West, Staten Island, after a precinct holiday party. Todaro admitted, "I had three or four drinks. My life is over." The impact triggered airbags and left her with a forehead gash. All three passengers, also officers, were placed on desk duty and may face charges for allowing Todaro to drive or being unfit for duty. The article notes this was one of three NYPD DWI arrests in four days, highlighting a pattern during holiday party season. The incident raises questions about internal discipline and the risks posed by impaired driving, even among law enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
