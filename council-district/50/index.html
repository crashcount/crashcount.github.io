He died of head trauma. Police said the driver stayed at the scene, and the case is under review (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>amNY</a>).</p><p>He was one of <strong>19 people killed</strong> on the streets of Council District 50 since Jan 1, 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). <strong>Pedestrians account for 11</strong> of those deaths in this district (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=nights-and-mornings-take-lives>Nights and mornings take lives</h3><p>Deaths stack up at the edges of the day here. The district’s log shows five deaths around 10 PM, and four more around 6 AM (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). On Hylan Boulevard, crashes have killed four people and injured 154. Jewett Avenue has seen two deaths and 18 injuries (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The deaths read like routine. A 68-year-old man, crossing in a marked crosswalk at Forest Avenue and Raymond Place, killed by a left-turning SUV; the police report lists failure to yield and distraction (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data, CrashID 4784160</a>). A 64-year-old woman, struck while crossing Mason Avenue by a left-turning SUV; again, failure to yield and distraction appear in the file (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data, CrashID 4777953</a>).</p><h3 id=heavy-vehicles-heavier-toll>Heavy vehicles, heavier toll</h3><p>Trucks and buses are a small slice of traffic but a hard edge in harm: they are tied to <strong>4 pedestrian deaths</strong> in this district’s records since 2022 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). One worker was crushed by a reversing box truck at a Gulf Avenue warehouse late at night; the dataset records a death at that address (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-pattern-is-getting-worse>The pattern is getting worse</h3><p>Year to date, District 50 shows <strong>9 deaths</strong>, up from <strong>1</strong> at this point last year. Reported injuries are up <strong>62.0%</strong>, and crashes up <strong>27.1%</strong> over the same span (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The victims span ages, but the toll on elders is stark: two deaths among people 75+ so far this year (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Late one night in Port Richmond, a 13-year-old on a moped hit an MTA bus at Castleton and Park. He was ejected and left with a severe head injury. As the DMV reminds riders, “The requirements to operate a moped are like those for motorcycles. You must have a driver license and register your moped to drive it on streets and highways” (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/moped-bus-collision-staten-island/>amNY</a>).</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-done--and-havent>What leaders have done — and haven’t</h3><p>Council Member <strong>David Carr</strong> voted to require fast restoration of pavement markings after repaving — a basic safety step that cuts confusion at crossings (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>). The law is on the books.</p><p>But speed remains the thread through so many of these files. City and state leaders have a bill on the table to go after repeat speeders: the <strong>Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045C/A2299C)</strong> would force drivers with long camera or point histories to install speed limiters (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/20/the-1-5-percent-of-drivers-who-cause-21-percent-of-pedestrian-deaths>Streetsblog NYC</a>). The case for it is blunt: a tiny fraction of drivers cause a huge share of deaths; racking up tickets multiplies risk (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/20/the-1-5-percent-of-drivers-who-cause-21-percent-of-pedestrian-deaths>Streetsblog NYC</a>). <strong>Assembly Member Mike Reilly</strong> and <strong>State Senator Jessica Scarcella‑Spanton</strong> represent this area. They can co-sponsor and press leadership to pass it.</p><h3 id=fix-the-streets-that-kill>Fix the streets that kill</h3><p>The map points to clear moves for District 50.</p><ul><li>Hylan Boulevard and Jewett Avenue need hardened turns, daylighting, and tighter signal timing to protect crossings. The deaths and injuries demand it (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>Target trucks at night: side guards, better backing controls, lighting, and enforcement on warehouse blocks like Gulf Avenue where workers die after dark (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li><li>Focus on the deadly hours with enforcement and calming near bus corridors and senior routes. The late-night and early-morning spikes are in the log (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</li></ul><p>Lower speeds will save lives here. Limit the worst repeat offenders. Paint the lines. The next obituary should not be a crossing on Hylan.</p><p>Take one step now.

The officers 'lost control of their marked cruiser and slammed into the front of a Mexican restaurant' after swerving to avoid a car making a U-turn. Both officers sustained minor injuries. Hours earlier in Manhattan, a Dodge Charger 'spinning out of control' struck a police officer, pinning him against his patrol vehicle. Witness Abi Aguirre described, 'He crashed into a sanitation car... then he's doing circles and then he crashed out with a police car.' Both the officer and the driver were hospitalized.
