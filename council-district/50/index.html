Fourteen people are dead since 2022. Over three thousand more are hurt. Twenty-four left with wounds that will not heal. The dead are old and young. A 16-year-old on a scooter. An 80-year-old crossing Hylan Boulevard. A man crushed by a truck. The street does not care. The numbers keep rising.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a teenager died on College Avenue. The police said, <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/staten-island-e-scooter-rider-killed-july-2025/>&ldquo;Ellis suffered head trauma as a result of the crash.&rdquo;</a> No arrest. No comfort. The investigation drags on. The street stays the same.</p><p>On Hylan Boulevard, an 80-year-old man tried to cross. A Ford Edge hit him. He died a block from home. Police said they were <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/driver-fatally-strikes-80-year-old-staten-island-man-a-block-from-his-home-police-say>&ldquo;still investigating how fast the woman was driving and what the traffic signals at the intersection were displaying at the time.&rdquo;</a> The light changes. The blood dries. The cars keep coming.</p><h3 id=who-bears-the-risk>Who Bears the Risk</h3><p>Most deaths come from cars and trucks. Six killed by SUVs or sedans. Three by trucks or buses. No one killed by a bike. The old and the young are not spared. Under 18, 400 injured. Over 75, three dead. The street does not choose. It takes who it wants.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-done-what-has-not>What Has Been Done, What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member David Carr has voted for some safety bills. He backed laws to speed up pavement markings and clear abandoned cars. He co-sponsored a bill to require raised speed reducers. But he also backed bills to register e-bikes and remove speed cameras—laws that shift the burden to the most vulnerable, not the most dangerous. He voted no on a bill to decriminalize jaywalking. The street stays dangerous. The dead stay dead.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call Council Member Carr. Demand a default 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people walking and riding. The street will not change itself. Only you can force it.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch stated, 'This morning is not just about crushing mopeds. It is about crushing the criminal activity and quality of life activities that come with them.'

No criminal charges were filed at the time of reporting. An Amazon spokesperson called it a 'horrible tragedy' and said the company was cooperating with police. The article quotes a coworker: 'He was 34 years old. He had two daughters. He was killed on the job.'
