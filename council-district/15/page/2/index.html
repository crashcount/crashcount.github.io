Police said, &ldquo;The men were ejected from their scooters and fatally injured in the collision. Both were pronounced dead at the hospital&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/bronx-river-parkway-accident-east-gun-hill-road/>CBS New York</a>). The driver faces charges of vehicular manslaughter and driving while intoxicated. The road closed for hours. The city kept moving.</p><p>This is not rare. In the last twelve months, District 15 saw <strong>1,194 injuries</strong> and <strong>1 death</strong> from traffic crashes. Ten people suffered serious injuries. Children were not spared—<strong>122 injured under 18</strong>. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about hope.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p>The dead and wounded are mostly young. The city’s own data shows SUVs and cars did the most harm: <strong>4 deaths, 397 minor injuries, 131 moderate injuries, 7 serious injuries</strong>. Motorcycles and mopeds, too, left bodies broken. Bikes and trucks added to the toll. No one walks away untouched.</p><p>A witness to the Parkway crash said, &ldquo;Police said a Mercedes sedan driver struck two men on scooters, who then suffered fatal injuries&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/driver-arrested-in-bronx-river-parkway-fatal-crash/>CBS New York</a>). The words are plain. The loss is not.</p><h3 id=council-member-feliz-steps-and-silences>Council Member Feliz: Steps and Silences</h3><p>Council Member Oswald Feliz has backed some safety bills. He sponsored a measure to fine property owners who ignore sidewalk repairs, aiming to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>make sidewalks safer by making owners pay for neglect</a>. He voted to clear abandoned vehicles, which block sightlines and endanger people on foot and bike. He co-sponsored bills for speed humps near parks and for better crash investigations. These are steps. But the carnage continues.</p><p>On the big fights—lowering speed limits, redesigning deadly roads, stopping repeat reckless drivers—there is no record of bold action. The Parkway still runs fast and wide. The bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=act-now-demand-more-than-words>Act Now: Demand More Than Words</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Feliz. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand streets where children can walk and ride without fear. The dead cannot call. The living must.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code... in relation to police department parking enforcement.' Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary), Oswald Feliz, Justin L. Brannan, Lincoln Restler, Robert F. Holden, and Chris Banks sponsor the measure. It forces NYPD to verify license plates and VINs on vehicles with temp tags or those ticketed for violations. NYPD must also publish quarterly parking enforcement reports. No safety analyst has assessed the bill's impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
