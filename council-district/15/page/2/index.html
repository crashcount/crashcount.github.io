Nine left with life-changing injuries.</strong> In the last year, District 15 saw 1,375 crashes. <strong>Children, elders, workers—nobody spared.</strong> In those twelve months, 91 kids were hurt. Not one was killed, but pain lingers. Cars, SUVs, mopeds, bikes—every machine that moves can break a body. The numbers are not just numbers. They are people who never made it home.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>A man lay in the Bronx street after a road rage assault. An ambulance rolled over him. He was left in critical condition. <strong>&ldquo;Authorities say a man injured in a road rage assault in the Bronx was also hit by a passing ambulance while lying on the street&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/man-critically-injured-in-bronx-road-rage-assault/>reported CBS New York</a>. No warning. No chance. Another day, two drivers sped down Southern Boulevard, guns drawn. Shots rang out. One man crashed, bleeding, and called a cab to the hospital. He died. <strong>&ldquo;There were a whole lot of rounds. It was crazy. This doesn&rsquo;t happen around here during the day time&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/01/dueling-drivers-exchange-gunfire-near-bronx-zoo-wounded-man-calls-cab-to-hospital-later-dies/>said a deli worker</a>.</p><h3 id=what-has-oswald-feliz-done>What Has Oswald Feliz Done?</h3><p>Council Member Oswald Feliz has backed bills to make streets safer. He co-sponsored laws for more speed humps, protected bike lanes, and daylighting at crosswalks (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council Legislation</a>). He voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished walkers for crossing where they could. He pushed for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/28/applications-delivery-worker-e-bike-moped-trade-in>safer e-bikes for delivery workers</a> and a <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/02/year-in-review-in-2023-nycs-ambitious-streets-master-plan-was-just-pretty-paper-and-maps>citywide greenway plan</a>. But when it came to the Fordham Road bus lane—a project proven to protect the most vulnerable—he stood in the way. <strong>Good bills are not enough if the most dangerous streets stay the same.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day without change is a day someone else bleeds on the asphalt. <strong>Call Oswald Feliz. Demand safer speeds, protected crossings, and real action on deadly corridors.</strong> Join <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> and <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Show up.

The matter, discussed with Bronx Community Boards 5 and 6, is titled: “City Considers Fixes for Another Ridiculously Slow Cross-Bronx Bus.” Council Member Oswald Feliz, who once opposed a Fordham Road bus lane, now supports dedicated lanes on Tremont. Council Member Pierina Sanchez also represents the area. Residents and riders call the Bx36 the slowest bus in the Bronx, citing delays and crowding. DOT data shows no speed gains since 2022. The corridor’s narrow lanes and parking worsen congestion and danger. Community leaders urge a busway or bus/truck-only stretch. DOT plans traffic analysis through summer 2024, with a proposal due later. The agency claims its top priority is “fast, reliable, and on-time” bus service, but skepticism remains after past inaction.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, discussed in multiple legislative hearings since December, would require used car dealers to display at least five vehicles and limit temp tag issuance to 50 per year unless substantial business is proven. Brokers must hold Georgia licenses and show five sales yearly. The Department of Revenue could suspend or revoke dealer access for violations. The bill follows a Streetsblog probe exposing how weak Georgia rules fuel a black market for temp tags, endangering New York City streets. Councilman Oswald Feliz, who introduced two related NYC bills, calls this a 'big priority,' saying, 'We must use all tools to deter this reckless conduct.' The legislation’s summary states it will create or increase fines for those selling or driving with fraudulent tags. Industry groups say they want loopholes closed without hurting legitimate dealers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill was discussed at a City Council hearing on February 1, 2024. The Adams administration, represented by DOT officials Margaret Forgione and Will Carry, voiced strong support, citing 'public safety risks posed by growing risks of uncertified e-bike batteries.' The bill aims to help delivery workers transition to legal, safe devices and address both street and fire safety. Last year, 18 people died in 268 lithium-ion battery fires. Delivery companies like Uber, DoorDash, and Grubhub oppose the bill, claiming it could lead to fraud and fail to solve the battery crisis. Workers' advocates back the bill but demand protections against retaliation, noting certified batteries are expensive and scarce.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan promised faster commutes for tens of thousands. Instead, Feliz and Bronx power brokers pushed a weak compromise: repainting the lane and expanding bus lane cameras. The matter summary states, 'Feliz has been a staunch opponent of the Department of Transportation's plan to improve the existing Fordham Road bus lane.' Feliz’s Honda Accord was cited three times for bus lane violations, including twice on Fordham Road, and six times for speeding in school zones since 2020. He claimed the car was 'shared.' Bus speeds barely improved, rising from 6 to 6.3 mph—still below the Bronx average. Vulnerable road users—bus riders, pedestrians—remain at risk.
