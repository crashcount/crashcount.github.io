Six were left with injuries so grave they may never walk the same.</strong> The victims are not numbers. They are children, elders, workers, neighbors. Last week, a Ford Mustang jumped the curb at East 149th and Courtlandt. Six people were thrown to the ground. Some were old, some young. Vivian Cole heard the aftermath: <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>&ldquo;People were yelling, were in pain, so yelling, crying, it was very upsetting.&rdquo;</a> The driver ran. The pain stayed.</p><h3 id=patterns-in-the-blood-who-pays-the-price>Patterns in the Blood: Who Pays the Price</h3><p>The violence does not let up. <strong>Since 2022, 18 people have died and 3,067 have been injured on these streets.</strong> Cars and SUVs do most of the harm, but trucks, mopeds, and bikes all leave scars. The city counts the bodies. It does not count the empty chairs at dinner. &ldquo;We thought it was a bomb or something, because we are all panicking around here,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/03/us-news/6-pedestrians-struck-by-ford-mustang-that-crashed-into-nyc-scaffolding-before-driver-passenger-flee/>said Christina Sieh</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h3><p>Council Member Oswald Feliz has signed on to bills that matter. He voted to legalize crossing the street outside the lines, ending the city&rsquo;s war on so-called jaywalkers. He co-sponsored laws to daylight intersections, ban obscured plates, and speed up protected bike lanes. He called for more speed humps near parks and for towing away ghost cars. But when the city tried to build a busway on Fordham Road—a lifeline for 85,000 daily riders, many of them the most vulnerable—Feliz stood in the way. The <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/07/20/mtas-hope-for-eric-adams-stay-with-us-on-fordham-road>busway died</a>. The danger stayed.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day the city delays a 20 mph speed limit, every time a leader blocks a safer street, another family risks losing someone. Call Council Member Feliz. Call the mayor. Demand the city use its new power to lower the speed limit and build streets for people, not just cars. <strong>Do not wait for another siren.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bus crashed into the wall, breaking through and leaving debris below. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz said, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." No injuries were reported, but the crash caused structural damage. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz noted, "That’s a very big bus, so even going very slowly, it can do a lot of damage," highlighting the risk of lax parking enforcement. The incident underscores systemic issues: double-parking and weak infrastructure can combine to threaten lives, even when no one is hurt.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states, 'Signals were ignored,' and lists 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as a contributing factor. The moped's center front end bore the brunt of the impact. The injured woman, riding as a rear passenger, remained conscious at the scene. Police data highlights that the driver failed to obey traffic controls, directly contributing to the collision. No information in the report attributes any contributing behavior to the passenger.

A moped, operated by an unlicensed and helmetless 41-year-old man, overturned and left its rider ejected and crushed, suffering injuries to his entire body but remaining conscious in the aftermath. The report states that 'Unsafe Speed' was a contributing factor. One sedan, an Audi driven by an unlicensed man, was engaged in a police pursuit and fled the scene. The violence of the crash is underscored by the report’s vivid description: 'Metal screamed. Glass rained.' The moped’s lack of safety equipment is noted in the data, but the central danger stemmed from driver actions—specifically, unsafe speed and a police pursuit. No evidence in the report attributes fault to the moped rider’s behavior beyond these systemic and driver errors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
