No warning. No chance. Another day, two drivers sped down Southern Boulevard, guns drawn. Shots rang out. One man crashed, bleeding, and called a cab to the hospital. He died. <strong>&ldquo;There were a whole lot of rounds. It was crazy. This doesn&rsquo;t happen around here during the day time&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/01/dueling-drivers-exchange-gunfire-near-bronx-zoo-wounded-man-calls-cab-to-hospital-later-dies/>said a deli worker</a>.</p><h3 id=what-has-oswald-feliz-done>What Has Oswald Feliz Done?</h3><p>Council Member Oswald Feliz has backed bills to make streets safer. He co-sponsored laws for more speed humps, protected bike lanes, and daylighting at crosswalks (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council Legislation</a>). He voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished walkers for crossing where they could. He pushed for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/28/applications-delivery-worker-e-bike-moped-trade-in>safer e-bikes for delivery workers</a> and a <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/02/year-in-review-in-2023-nycs-ambitious-streets-master-plan-was-just-pretty-paper-and-maps>citywide greenway plan</a>. But when it came to the Fordham Road bus lane—a project proven to protect the most vulnerable—he stood in the way. <strong>Good bills are not enough if the most dangerous streets stay the same.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.

Seventeen council members back it. Delivery giants resist. They call it unworkable. Workers face fire risk. City Hall sides with safety. The fight continues.</p><p class=mb3>On November 22, 2023, Bronx Council Member Oswald Feliz introduced a bill in the New York City Council requiring delivery companies to provide safe, certified e-bikes and batteries to their workers. The bill, supported by 17 sponsors, aims to curb deadly fires caused by uncertified lithium-ion batteries. The matter summary states, 'Delivery companies are opposing a new bill...that would require them to provide delivery workers with safe, certified e-bikes and batteries.' Feliz, joined by advocates like Ligia Guallpa, argues that companies profit from deliveristas and must bear the cost of safety. Delivery giants Uber, DoorDash, and Grubhub oppose the bill, calling it 'simply infeasible' and propose a centralized fund instead. The Adams administration, represented by Carlos Ortiz, supports the bill, insisting business apps are responsible for worker safety. The bill remains under council consideration, with the debate ongoing.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law aims to protect delivery workers and consumers from battery fires. Council Members Oswald Feliz and Marjorie Velazquez back new bills requiring app-based delivery companies to provide safe e-bikes and batteries. Velazquez called the bill a 'key' step for safety. Advocates like Ligia Guallpa of the Worker's Justice Project testified that certified batteries are too expensive and in short supply. Delivery workers, facing high costs and legal threats, often keep using unsafe batteries or turn to gas-powered mopeds. App companies resist, citing worker status and costs. The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection has started enforcement, but the core danger persists: safe batteries are out of reach for many, leaving workers exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Riders Alliance, representing local transit users, wrote, 'You turned around and caved to a handful of drivers who don't even live in the Bronx. How could you betray us like that?' Council Member Oswald Feliz, Rep. Adriano Espaillat, and business interests opposed both the original and compromise busway plans.

The matter summary states the program aims to address the high cost of certified batteries, which can be prohibitive for low-paid workers. Council Members Oswald Feliz and Gale Brewer sponsored additional bills: Feliz's requires safe bikes and batteries for deliveries, while Brewer's mandates delivery apps provide safety training and equipment. Brewer also called for the Department of Transportation to update its safety course. Powers said, "We will provide them the opportunity to surrender that unsafe equipment and receive a safe replacement." The Council's action follows 180 battery fire incidents, 14 deaths, and over 100 injuries this year. Lawmakers push for delivery companies to take responsibility for worker safety and equipment standards. Enforcement against uncertified battery sales will begin soon.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lawmakers who once supported the upgrades grew silent or opposed them after Espaillat’s intervention. The Department of Transportation, MTA, and governor’s office met with Espaillat to discuss the project, but delays persisted.

Ghost cars dodge cameras, break laws, and endanger New Yorkers. Local enforcement fails. Council wants tighter rules, shorter plate validity, and real accountability.</p><p class=mb3>On August 3, 2023, Bronx Councilman Oswald Feliz and 32 other New York City Council members sent a letter to U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. The letter urges federal reforms to stop the spread of fraudulent paper license plates, known as 'ghost car' plates. The council members wrote, 'The sale and use of fraudulent paper plates has created new challenges in New York City: cars using such plates cannot be easily traced, and thereby pose a street safety threat to New Yorkers.' Feliz and his colleagues demand that only legitimate dealerships issue paper plates and that validity be capped at 30 days nationwide. They note that some states allow up to 90 days, overwhelming communities and making enforcement difficult. The council’s push follows local proposals for stiffer penalties. The letter highlights how ghost cars evade cameras, break traffic laws, and fuel dangerous chases, putting everyone on city streets at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
