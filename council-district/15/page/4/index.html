In the last twelve months, one person died and nine suffered serious injuries in crashes. More than 900 were hurt. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. The numbers do not flinch: 1,373 crashes, 916 injuries, 9 left with wounds that will not heal (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>A man lay in the Bronx street after a road rage assault. An ambulance struck him as he waited for help. &ldquo;Authorities say a man injured in a road rage assault in the Bronx was also hit by a passing ambulance while lying on the street&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/man-critically-injured-in-bronx-road-rage-assault/>CBS New York</a>). The city moved on. He did not.</p><p>On Southern Boulevard, two drivers exchanged gunfire. One crashed, bleeding, into a stop sign. A deli worker watched: &ldquo;There were a whole lot of rounds. It was crazy. This doesn&rsquo;t happen around here during the day time&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/01/dueling-drivers-exchange-gunfire-near-bronx-zoo-wounded-man-calls-cab-to-hospital-later-dies/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p>SUVs and cars do the most damage. In three years, they killed four and injured over 100 on foot. Trucks, bikes, mopeds—they all leave scars, but the heaviest toll comes from the biggest machines. The dead are not numbers. They are sons, daughters, neighbors. Their names fade. The pain does not.</p><h3 id=what-has-oswald-feliz-done>What Has Oswald Feliz Done?</h3><p>Council Member Oswald Feliz has backed some safety bills. He co-sponsored laws to expand protected bike lanes, open streets, and daylighting at crosswalks. He voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable for crossing the street (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>). He pushed for safer e-bikes for delivery workers, but the city&rsquo;s trade-in program reaches only a handful out of thousands (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/28/applications-delivery-worker-e-bike-moped-trade-in>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>But when it mattered most, Feliz stood in the way of the Fordham Road bus lane—a project proven to save lives and speed up commutes for the working poor. The plan stalled. The street stayed deadly.</p><h3 id=what-next>What Next?</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Call Oswald Feliz. Demand he fight for a citywide 20 mph speed limit, for protected bike lanes, for bus lanes that move people, not just cars. Demand he stop blocking the changes that save lives. The street will not heal itself. It needs your voice.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Lawmakers who once supported the upgrades grew silent or opposed them after Espaillat’s intervention. The Department of Transportation, MTA, and governor’s office met with Espaillat to discuss the project, but delays persisted.

Feliz and his colleagues demand that only legitimate dealerships issue paper plates and that validity be capped at 30 days nationwide.

Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers and Kamillah Hanks did not comment. Activists and officials noted DOT’s automated cameras failed to bill 1.2 million violations last year due to temp tags, leaving dangerous drivers unaccountable.

We must ensure buses are moving and we can address that by fixing the bus lanes we have.' The letter calls for repainting bus lanes and installing fixed cameras before considering new restrictions.

Assembly Member Clinton Calabrese is working with state agencies to fix regulatory gaps. In Georgia, Rep. John Corbett, chair of the Motor Vehicles Committee, plans to introduce legislation, while Sen. Josh McLaurin urges stronger regulatory enforcement to block bad actors. Sen. Sonya Halpern called Georgia's role in the black market "concerning." The matter centers on the illegal sale and use of temp tags, which, as safe streets advocate Jimmy Lee warns, embolden reckless drivers and make streets more dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists. Advocates demand swift, tough action to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
