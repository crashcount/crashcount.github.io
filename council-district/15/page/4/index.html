Nine suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. One did not survive. Since 2022, eighteen have died. The dead do not speak. The wounded carry the story in scars and limps.</p><p><strong>Just weeks ago, a 79-year-old driver crashed into two cars and a pole.</strong> A 71-year-old woman, Stella Nyarko-Dei, died in the seat beside him. Seven others were hurt. Police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/13/multi-car-crash-in-the-bronx-kills-71-year-old-woman-injures-seven-others/>said the cause of the crash was not immediately known</a>.

The driver ran. The victims went to the hospital. The sidewalk offered no shelter.</p><h2 id=the-machinery-of-harm>The Machinery of Harm</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the damage.</strong> They killed four, hurt 393, and left 130 with moderate injuries. Trucks and buses hurt dozens more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll, but the weight of harm is steel and speed.</p><h2 id=council-member-feliz-steps-and-silences>Council Member Feliz: Steps and Silences</h2><p>Council Member Oswald Feliz has moved on some fronts. He <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>sponsored a bill to fine property owners who ignore sidewalk repairs</a>, aiming to make walking safer. He <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>voted to remove abandoned vehicles</a> that block sightlines and crosswalks. He co-sponsored bills for speed humps near parks and for better crash investigations. These are steps, not leaps.</p><p>But on the biggest corridor—Fordham Road—Feliz <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/07/20/mtas-hope-for-eric-adams-stay-with-us-on-fordham-road>opposed a busway</a> that would have protected 85,000 daily riders, many of them the most vulnerable. The street remains a gauntlet.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>The crisis is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every delay, every watered-down bill, every blocked redesign leaves blood on the street. Call Council Member Feliz. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people on foot, on bike, on bus. Do not wait for another name to be carved into stone.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The map must show disruptions, detours, hazards, and closures in real time. The bill summary states: 'Cyclists deserve the same attention and information already given to the city's drivers and transit riders in the form of notifications, updates, and well-marked detours.' Council Member Carlina Rivera sponsored the bill and led its passage. Rivera and Bike New York’s Jon Orcutt wrote, 'Disruption of any city bikeway requires public information, working detours and operational attention—not just an unheralded shut-down.' The law aims to end the chaos and danger of sudden bike lane closures, giving half a million daily riders the information they need to stay safe and keep moving.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city had canceled a planned busway after pushback from business owners and Council Member Oswald Feliz, who remains a vocal critic. MTA New York City Transit President Richard Davey said, "Our hope is that we DOT stays with us and we're implementing this, hopefully, later this year." MTA CEO Janno Lieber stressed, "We can't deemphasize and under-prioritize the lives of people of the Bronx and also Upper Manhattan who are trying to get east and west across this incredibly busy corridor." DOT spokesperson Vin Barone described a new proposal with dedicated curbside loading and minimal traffic diversions. The city’s earlier pledge for 20 new miles of bus lanes per year has not been met. Eighty-five thousand daily bus riders, many vulnerable, remain at risk on slow, crowded streets.
