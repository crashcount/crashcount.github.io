Police said, &ldquo;The men were ejected from their scooters and fatally injured in the collision. Both were pronounced dead at the hospital&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/bronx-river-parkway-accident-east-gun-hill-road/>CBS New York</a>). The driver faces charges of vehicular manslaughter and driving while intoxicated. The road closed for hours. The city kept moving.</p><p>This is not rare. In the last twelve months, District 15 saw <strong>1,194 injuries</strong> and <strong>1 death</strong> from traffic crashes. Ten people suffered serious injuries. Children were not spared—<strong>122 injured under 18</strong>. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about hope.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p>The dead and wounded are mostly young. The city’s own data shows SUVs and cars did the most harm: <strong>4 deaths, 397 minor injuries, 131 moderate injuries, 7 serious injuries</strong>. Motorcycles and mopeds, too, left bodies broken. Bikes and trucks added to the toll. No one walks away untouched.</p><p>A witness to the Parkway crash said, &ldquo;Police said a Mercedes sedan driver struck two men on scooters, who then suffered fatal injuries&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/driver-arrested-in-bronx-river-parkway-fatal-crash/>CBS New York</a>). The words are plain. The loss is not.</p><h3 id=council-member-feliz-steps-and-silences>Council Member Feliz: Steps and Silences</h3><p>Council Member Oswald Feliz has backed some safety bills. He sponsored a measure to fine property owners who ignore sidewalk repairs, aiming to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>make sidewalks safer by making owners pay for neglect</a>. He voted to clear abandoned vehicles, which block sightlines and endanger people on foot and bike. He co-sponsored bills for speed humps near parks and for better crash investigations. These are steps. But the carnage continues.</p><p>On the big fights—lowering speed limits, redesigning deadly roads, stopping repeat reckless drivers—there is no record of bold action. The Parkway still runs fast and wide. The bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=act-now-demand-more-than-words>Act Now: Demand More Than Words</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Feliz. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand streets where children can walk and ride without fear. The dead cannot call. The living must.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
