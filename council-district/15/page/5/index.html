Nine left with life-changing injuries.</strong> In the last year, District 15 saw 1,375 crashes. <strong>Children, elders, workers—nobody spared.</strong> In those twelve months, 91 kids were hurt. Not one was killed, but pain lingers. Cars, SUVs, mopeds, bikes—every machine that moves can break a body. The numbers are not just numbers. They are people who never made it home.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>A man lay in the Bronx street after a road rage assault. An ambulance rolled over him. He was left in critical condition. <strong>&ldquo;Authorities say a man injured in a road rage assault in the Bronx was also hit by a passing ambulance while lying on the street&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/man-critically-injured-in-bronx-road-rage-assault/>reported CBS New York</a>. No warning. No chance. Another day, two drivers sped down Southern Boulevard, guns drawn. Shots rang out. One man crashed, bleeding, and called a cab to the hospital. He died. <strong>&ldquo;There were a whole lot of rounds. It was crazy. This doesn&rsquo;t happen around here during the day time&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/01/dueling-drivers-exchange-gunfire-near-bronx-zoo-wounded-man-calls-cab-to-hospital-later-dies/>said a deli worker</a>.</p><h3 id=what-has-oswald-feliz-done>What Has Oswald Feliz Done?</h3><p>Council Member Oswald Feliz has backed bills to make streets safer. He co-sponsored laws for more speed humps, protected bike lanes, and daylighting at crosswalks (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council Legislation</a>). He voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished walkers for crossing where they could. He pushed for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/28/applications-delivery-worker-e-bike-moped-trade-in>safer e-bikes for delivery workers</a> and a <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/02/year-in-review-in-2023-nycs-ambitious-streets-master-plan-was-just-pretty-paper-and-maps>citywide greenway plan</a>. But when it came to the Fordham Road bus lane—a project proven to protect the most vulnerable—he stood in the way. <strong>Good bills are not enough if the most dangerous streets stay the same.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day without change is a day someone else bleeds on the asphalt. <strong>Call Oswald Feliz. Demand safer speeds, protected crossings, and real action on deadly corridors.</strong> Join <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> and <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>.

Council Member Keith Powers introduced the buy-back bill, which creates a citywide program for defective or uncertified batteries. Powers said, "We don't want to penalize businesses and workers without thinking about this strategically." The Council also moved bills from Oswald Feliz, Gale Brewer, Alexa Avilés, and Robert Holden. These measures ban uncertified batteries, require fireproof charging containers, mandate public education, and order FDNY reporting on battery fires. Speaker Adrienne Adams clarified the bills target commercial sellers, not workers. Shahana Hanif urged that policy must "keep workers" at the center. The Council and delivery workers’ union stressed that tech companies, not workers, should bear costs. The FDNY opposed the reporting bill over resource concerns. The legislation aims to curb battery fires while protecting delivery workers who depend on e-bikes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The official summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to conducting a study of the impact that truck and delivery traffic generated by last mile facilities have on local communities and infrastructure.' The bill required the Department of Transportation to report on delivery vehicle volumes, parking, congestion, collisions, and pedestrian injuries near these hubs.

Streetsblog’s coverage, criticized by City Hall and DOT, revealed that vacancies and political interference—especially from Council Members Bob Holden and Oswald Feliz—stalled projects like the Citi Bike expansion in Queens and the Fordham Road bus lane in the Bronx. DOT completed only 67% of its bus lane mandate and fell 17% short on bike lanes.

The mayor returned it unsigned.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0291-2022, now Local Law 115 of 2022, was enacted by the City Council on November 27, 2022. The bill came through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, first introduced April 28, 2022. The law's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to a citywide greenway plan.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors including Rivera, Hudson, and others. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor on October 27, 2022. The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law. The measure compels the city to plan and maintain safe routes for non-drivers, with regular public reporting and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Safety loses.</p><p class=mb3>On October 17, 2022, Streetsblog NYC reported that City Hall, under Mayor Adams, is obstructing key street safety projects. The article, titled 'A NIMBY City Hall: Adams Appointees Thwart Key Bike and Bus Projects,' details how the Mayor’s Office of Intergovernmental Affairs (IGA) delays or blocks bus lanes, bike lanes, Citi Bike expansion, and pedestrianization. Appointees Tiffany Raspberry and Menashe Shapiro, both lacking transportation backgrounds, are named as obstacles. Council Members Francisco Moya, Bob Holden, and Oswald Feliz, all Adams allies, have influenced these delays. DOT officials describe a new layer of bureaucracy: 'The threshold for stopping any single project, it’s almost nonexistent.' Projects like Northern Boulevard bus lanes and Fordham Road improvements are on hold. DOT morale is low. The city’s promise of $904 million for street safety is undermined by political interference. Vulnerable road users remain at risk as progress stalls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Feliz asked DOT to pause the redesign for at least 12 months, citing concerns about traffic diversion and business impacts. The matter, reported as 'Eric Adams’ ambitious bus lane plans hit roadblock on NYC’s Fordham Road,' details how Feliz’s opposition blocks a key part of Mayor Adams’ pledge to build 20 new miles of bus lanes. DOT’s proposal aimed to restrict private vehicle traffic and prioritize buses and deliveries, a move supported by transit advocates and local polls. But Feliz’s action keeps the status quo: crowded streets, slow buses, and danger for those outside cars.

In a letter to NYCHA CEO Greg Russ, Avilés urged targeted battery safety rules instead of a broad ban, warning, 'NYCHA's all-out ban could hurt workers and residents more.' She offered eight recommendations, including federal study, safe battery storage, and clear rules for mobility devices. Bronx Council Member Oswald Feliz announced plans for legislation requiring certified batteries, while Manhattan’s Gale Brewer is drafting a ban on second-hand batteries and pushing for delivery app accountability. The matter is under review after the comment period closed September 6. NYCHA declined to comment. Avilés’s stance centers on protecting delivery workers and vulnerable residents while addressing real fire risks from faulty batteries.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
