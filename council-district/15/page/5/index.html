In the last twelve months, one person died and nine suffered serious injuries in crashes. More than 900 were hurt. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. The numbers do not flinch: 1,373 crashes, 916 injuries, 9 left with wounds that will not heal (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>A man lay in the Bronx street after a road rage assault. An ambulance struck him as he waited for help. &ldquo;Authorities say a man injured in a road rage assault in the Bronx was also hit by a passing ambulance while lying on the street&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/man-critically-injured-in-bronx-road-rage-assault/>CBS New York</a>). The city moved on. He did not.</p><p>On Southern Boulevard, two drivers exchanged gunfire. One crashed, bleeding, into a stop sign. A deli worker watched: &ldquo;There were a whole lot of rounds. It was crazy. This doesn&rsquo;t happen around here during the day time&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/01/dueling-drivers-exchange-gunfire-near-bronx-zoo-wounded-man-calls-cab-to-hospital-later-dies/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p>SUVs and cars do the most damage. In three years, they killed four and injured over 100 on foot. Trucks, bikes, mopeds—they all leave scars, but the heaviest toll comes from the biggest machines. The dead are not numbers. They are sons, daughters, neighbors. Their names fade. The pain does not.</p><h3 id=what-has-oswald-feliz-done>What Has Oswald Feliz Done?</h3><p>Council Member Oswald Feliz has backed some safety bills. He co-sponsored laws to expand protected bike lanes, open streets, and daylighting at crosswalks. He voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable for crossing the street (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>). He pushed for safer e-bikes for delivery workers, but the city&rsquo;s trade-in program reaches only a handful out of thousands (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/28/applications-delivery-worker-e-bike-moped-trade-in>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>But when it mattered most, Feliz stood in the way of the Fordham Road bus lane—a project proven to save lives and speed up commutes for the working poor. The plan stalled. The street stayed deadly.</p><h3 id=what-next>What Next?</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Call Oswald Feliz. Demand he fight for a citywide 20 mph speed limit, for protected bike lanes, for bus lanes that move people, not just cars. Demand he stop blocking the changes that save lives. The street will not heal itself. It needs your voice.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Council Member Keith Powers introduced the buy-back bill, which creates a citywide program for defective or uncertified batteries. Powers said, "We don't want to penalize businesses and workers without thinking about this strategically." The Council also moved bills from Oswald Feliz, Gale Brewer, Alexa Avilés, and Robert Holden. These measures ban uncertified batteries, require fireproof charging containers, mandate public education, and order FDNY reporting on battery fires. Speaker Adrienne Adams clarified the bills target commercial sellers, not workers. Shahana Hanif urged that policy must "keep workers" at the center. The Council and delivery workers’ union stressed that tech companies, not workers, should bear costs. The FDNY opposed the reporting bill over resource concerns. The legislation aims to curb battery fires while protecting delivery workers who depend on e-bikes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Public Advocate Jumaane Williams and Council Member Alexa Avilés, with over thirty co-sponsors, sought a city study on the impact of truck and delivery traffic from last mile facilities. The official summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to conducting a study of the impact that truck and delivery traffic generated by last mile facilities have on local communities and infrastructure.' The bill required the Department of Transportation to report on delivery vehicle volumes, parking, congestion, collisions, and pedestrian injuries near these hubs. It called for identifying the most affected streets and estimating the costs and possible fixes. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without passage.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streetsblog’s coverage, criticized by City Hall and DOT, revealed that vacancies and political interference—especially from Council Members Bob Holden and Oswald Feliz—stalled projects like the Citi Bike expansion in Queens and the Fordham Road bus lane in the Bronx. DOT completed only 67% of its bus lane mandate and fell 17% short on bike lanes.

The agency scaled back busway hours on Jamaica Avenue and 181st Street after local pushback. Council Member Oswald Feliz opposed Fordham Road improvements, calling them an 'existential threat.'

The city’s promise fades.</p><p class=mb3>On October 2, 2022, Councilmember Oswald Feliz of District 15 opposed the Department of Transportation’s plan to convert segments of Fordham Road to bus and delivery-only lanes. Feliz asked DOT to pause the redesign for at least 12 months, citing concerns about traffic diversion and business impacts. The matter, reported as 'Eric Adams’ ambitious bus lane plans hit roadblock on NYC’s Fordham Road,' details how Feliz’s opposition blocks a key part of Mayor Adams’ pledge to build 20 new miles of bus lanes. DOT’s proposal aimed to restrict private vehicle traffic and prioritize buses and deliveries, a move supported by transit advocates and local polls. But Feliz’s action keeps the status quo: crowded streets, slow buses, and danger for those outside cars.

No comment yet.</p><p class=mb3>On September 16, 2022, Council Member Alexa Avilés challenged NYCHA’s proposed blanket ban on e-bikes across public housing. In a letter to NYCHA CEO Greg Russ, Avilés urged targeted battery safety rules instead of a broad ban, warning, 'NYCHA's all-out ban could hurt workers and residents more.' She offered eight recommendations, including federal study, safe battery storage, and clear rules for mobility devices. Bronx Council Member Oswald Feliz announced plans for legislation requiring certified batteries, while Manhattan’s Gale Brewer is drafting a ban on second-hand batteries and pushing for delivery app accountability. The matter is under review after the comment period closed September 6. NYCHA declined to comment. Avilés’s stance centers on protecting delivery workers and vulnerable residents while addressing real fire risks from faulty batteries.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
