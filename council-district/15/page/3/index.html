In the last twelve months, one person died and nine suffered serious injuries in crashes. More than 900 were hurt. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. The numbers do not flinch: 1,373 crashes, 916 injuries, 9 left with wounds that will not heal (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>A man lay in the Bronx street after a road rage assault. An ambulance struck him as he waited for help. &ldquo;Authorities say a man injured in a road rage assault in the Bronx was also hit by a passing ambulance while lying on the street&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/man-critically-injured-in-bronx-road-rage-assault/>CBS New York</a>). The city moved on. He did not.</p><p>On Southern Boulevard, two drivers exchanged gunfire. One crashed, bleeding, into a stop sign. A deli worker watched: &ldquo;There were a whole lot of rounds. It was crazy. This doesn&rsquo;t happen around here during the day time&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/01/dueling-drivers-exchange-gunfire-near-bronx-zoo-wounded-man-calls-cab-to-hospital-later-dies/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p>SUVs and cars do the most damage. In three years, they killed four and injured over 100 on foot. Trucks, bikes, mopeds—they all leave scars, but the heaviest toll comes from the biggest machines. The dead are not numbers. They are sons, daughters, neighbors. Their names fade. The pain does not.</p><h3 id=what-has-oswald-feliz-done>What Has Oswald Feliz Done?</h3><p>Council Member Oswald Feliz has backed some safety bills. He co-sponsored laws to expand protected bike lanes, open streets, and daylighting at crosswalks. He voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable for crossing the street (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>). He pushed for safer e-bikes for delivery workers, but the city&rsquo;s trade-in program reaches only a handful out of thousands (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/28/applications-delivery-worker-e-bike-moped-trade-in>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>But when it mattered most, Feliz stood in the way of the Fordham Road bus lane—a project proven to save lives and speed up commutes for the working poor. The plan stalled. The street stayed deadly.</p><h3 id=what-next>What Next?</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Call Oswald Feliz. Demand he fight for a citywide 20 mph speed limit, for protected bike lanes, for bus lanes that move people, not just cars. Demand he stop blocking the changes that save lives. The street will not heal itself. It needs your voice.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On January 4, 2024, Bronx Council Member Oswald Feliz was exposed for opposing the Department of Transportation’s plan to improve the Fordham Road bus lane, according to Streetsblog NYC. The plan promised faster commutes for tens of thousands. Instead, Feliz and Bronx power brokers pushed a weak compromise: repainting the lane and expanding bus lane cameras. The matter summary states, 'Feliz has been a staunch opponent of the Department of Transportation's plan to improve the existing Fordham Road bus lane.' Feliz’s Honda Accord was cited three times for bus lane violations, including twice on Fordham Road, and six times for speeding in school zones since 2020. He claimed the car was 'shared.' Bus speeds barely improved, rising from 6 to 6.3 mph—still below the Bronx average. Vulnerable road users—bus riders, pedestrians—remain at risk. The council member’s actions show disregard for safety and transit equity.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law, championed by then-Speaker Corey Johnson, aimed for safer, more equitable streets. Key projects, including bike lanes on McGuinness Boulevard and Ashland Place, and bus lanes on Fordham Road, were stalled or abandoned. The Department of Transportation blamed staff shortages and budget cuts. Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers said, 'Thirty-plus miles of completed new bike lane is of course better than none, but falls far short of Streets Plan requirements.' Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and other members voiced frustration but admitted limited power to enforce compliance. Council Member Chi Ossé was mentioned in coverage. Without mayoral commitment, the plan’s promise to protect vulnerable road users remains unfulfilled. The city’s vision for safer streets is at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Feliz’s opposition helped powerful interests defeat the busway, leaving only more enforcement cameras.

Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On September 22, 2023, Mayor Adams abandoned plans for major bus improvements on Fordham Road in the Bronx. The plan, once promised by the mayor, would have installed offset bus lanes. Instead, the Department of Transportation will only repaint existing lanes and consider more automated enforcement. The move came after opposition from Council Member Oswald Feliz, Belmont BID Chair Peter Madonia, Rep. Adriano Espaillat, and local institutions. The official matter: 'Adams administration is abandoning plans for major improvements to bus infrastructure on Fordham Road.' DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno confirmed, 'we are repainting curbside bus lanes and continuing automated bus lane enforcement.' Advocates and MTA officials condemned the reversal, noting that most shoppers and visitors arrive by transit or on foot. The city missed its legal bus lane targets last year. Vulnerable road users—bus riders, pedestrians—remain exposed to slow service and unsafe streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

City law bans these sales, but enforcement lags. Council Member Feliz pushes new rules. Delivery workers risk fire, injury. Buy-back program launches. Federal action looms. Danger persists.</p><p class=mb3>On September 21, 2023, Bronx Council Member Oswald Feliz introduced legislation to crack down on online sales of illegal lithium-ion batteries and mopeds. The bill responds to ongoing violations of Local Law 39, which bans uncertified batteries not approved by UL Solutions. Despite this, online retailers like Amazon continue to sell these dangerous products. The matter summary states: 'Online retailers such as Amazon are selling illegal, uncertified lithium-ion batteries and mopeds to New York City residents, despite city laws prohibiting such sales.' Feliz’s proposal aims to close enforcement gaps and protect delivery workers, who often rely on cheap, unsafe batteries. Lawmakers also approved a citywide buy-back program for faulty batteries. Rep. Ritchie Torres introduced federal legislation to set safety standards and hold online marketplaces accountable. The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection is investigating but has yet to issue penalties. Advocates demand action to stop the flow of deadly batteries into city homes and streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Enforcement on uncertified sales begins soon.</p><p class=mb3>On September 14, 2023, the New York City Council passed a package of bills to fight lithium-ion battery fires. The main bill, introduced by Council Member Keith Powers, creates a city-funded buy-back program for delivery workers to exchange faulty batteries and devices for safe, certified ones. The matter summary states the program aims to address the high cost of certified batteries, which can be prohibitive for low-paid workers. Council Members Oswald Feliz and Gale Brewer sponsored additional bills: Feliz's requires safe bikes and batteries for deliveries, while Brewer's mandates delivery apps provide safety training and equipment. Brewer also called for the Department of Transportation to update its safety course. Powers said, "We will provide them the opportunity to surrender that unsafe equipment and receive a safe replacement." The Council's action follows 180 battery fire incidents, 14 deaths, and over 100 injuries this year. Lawmakers push for delivery companies to take responsibility for worker safety and equipment standards. Enforcement against uncertified battery sales will begin soon.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
