Six were left with injuries so grave they may never walk the same.</strong> The victims are not numbers. They are children, elders, workers, neighbors. Last week, a Ford Mustang jumped the curb at East 149th and Courtlandt. Six people were thrown to the ground. Some were old, some young. Vivian Cole heard the aftermath: <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>&ldquo;People were yelling, were in pain, so yelling, crying, it was very upsetting.&rdquo;</a> The driver ran. The pain stayed.</p><h3 id=patterns-in-the-blood-who-pays-the-price>Patterns in the Blood: Who Pays the Price</h3><p>The violence does not let up. <strong>Since 2022, 18 people have died and 3,067 have been injured on these streets.</strong> Cars and SUVs do most of the harm, but trucks, mopeds, and bikes all leave scars. The city counts the bodies. It does not count the empty chairs at dinner. &ldquo;We thought it was a bomb or something, because we are all panicking around here,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/03/us-news/6-pedestrians-struck-by-ford-mustang-that-crashed-into-nyc-scaffolding-before-driver-passenger-flee/>said Christina Sieh</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h3><p>Council Member Oswald Feliz has signed on to bills that matter. He voted to legalize crossing the street outside the lines, ending the city&rsquo;s war on so-called jaywalkers. He co-sponsored laws to daylight intersections, ban obscured plates, and speed up protected bike lanes. He called for more speed humps near parks and for towing away ghost cars. But when the city tried to build a busway on Fordham Road—a lifeline for 85,000 daily riders, many of them the most vulnerable—Feliz stood in the way. The <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/07/20/mtas-hope-for-eric-adams-stay-with-us-on-fordham-road>busway died</a>. The danger stayed.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day the city delays a 20 mph speed limit, every time a leader blocks a safer street, another family risks losing someone. Call Council Member Feliz. Call the mayor. Demand the city use its new power to lower the speed limit and build streets for people, not just cars. <strong>Do not wait for another siren.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
