Nine suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. One did not survive. Since 2022, eighteen have died. The dead do not speak. The wounded carry the story in scars and limps.</p><p><strong>Just weeks ago, a 79-year-old driver crashed into two cars and a pole.</strong> A 71-year-old woman, Stella Nyarko-Dei, died in the seat beside him. Seven others were hurt. Police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/13/multi-car-crash-in-the-bronx-kills-71-year-old-woman-injures-seven-others/>said the cause of the crash was not immediately known</a>.

The driver ran. The victims went to the hospital. The sidewalk offered no shelter.</p><h2 id=the-machinery-of-harm>The Machinery of Harm</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the damage.</strong> They killed four, hurt 393, and left 130 with moderate injuries. Trucks and buses hurt dozens more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll, but the weight of harm is steel and speed.</p><h2 id=council-member-feliz-steps-and-silences>Council Member Feliz: Steps and Silences</h2><p>Council Member Oswald Feliz has moved on some fronts. He <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>sponsored a bill to fine property owners who ignore sidewalk repairs</a>, aiming to make walking safer. He <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>voted to remove abandoned vehicles</a> that block sightlines and crosswalks. He co-sponsored bills for speed humps near parks and for better crash investigations. These are steps, not leaps.</p><p>But on the biggest corridor—Fordham Road—Feliz <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/07/20/mtas-hope-for-eric-adams-stay-with-us-on-fordham-road>opposed a busway</a> that would have protected 85,000 daily riders, many of them the most vulnerable. The street remains a gauntlet.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>The crisis is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every delay, every watered-down bill, every blocked redesign leaves blood on the street. Call Council Member Feliz. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people on foot, on bike, on bus. Do not wait for another name to be carved into stone.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

A moped, operated by an unlicensed and helmetless 41-year-old man, overturned and left its rider ejected and crushed, suffering injuries to his entire body but remaining conscious in the aftermath. The report states that 'Unsafe Speed' was a contributing factor. One sedan, an Audi driven by an unlicensed man, was engaged in a police pursuit and fled the scene. The violence of the crash is underscored by the report’s vivid description: 'Metal screamed. Glass rained.' The moped’s lack of safety equipment is noted in the data, but the central danger stemmed from driver actions—specifically, unsafe speed and a police pursuit. No evidence in the report attributes fault to the moped rider’s behavior beyond these systemic and driver errors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The report identifies 'Unsafe Speed' as the primary contributing factor. The driver was traveling northbound and lost control, resulting in a catastrophic impact that demolished the vehicle and twisted its frame beyond saving. The driver, who wore no seat belt, was ejected from the SUV and suffered fatal injuries including a shattered pelvis and severe lacerations. The police report explicitly notes the driver's unlicensed status and unsafe speed as causes of the crash. A front-seat passenger, a 34-year-old man wearing a lap belt and harness, was injured with internal complaints and shoulder-upper arm trauma but was not ejected. No victim behaviors contributed to the crash according to the report.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
