Nine left with life-changing injuries.</strong> In the last year, District 15 saw 1,375 crashes. <strong>Children, elders, workers—nobody spared.</strong> In those twelve months, 91 kids were hurt. Not one was killed, but pain lingers. Cars, SUVs, mopeds, bikes—every machine that moves can break a body. The numbers are not just numbers. They are people who never made it home.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>A man lay in the Bronx street after a road rage assault. An ambulance rolled over him. He was left in critical condition. <strong>&ldquo;Authorities say a man injured in a road rage assault in the Bronx was also hit by a passing ambulance while lying on the street&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/man-critically-injured-in-bronx-road-rage-assault/>reported CBS New York</a>. No warning. No chance. Another day, two drivers sped down Southern Boulevard, guns drawn. Shots rang out. One man crashed, bleeding, and called a cab to the hospital. He died. <strong>&ldquo;There were a whole lot of rounds. It was crazy. This doesn&rsquo;t happen around here during the day time&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/01/dueling-drivers-exchange-gunfire-near-bronx-zoo-wounded-man-calls-cab-to-hospital-later-dies/>said a deli worker</a>.</p><h3 id=what-has-oswald-feliz-done>What Has Oswald Feliz Done?</h3><p>Council Member Oswald Feliz has backed bills to make streets safer. He co-sponsored laws for more speed humps, protected bike lanes, and daylighting at crosswalks (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council Legislation</a>). He voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished walkers for crossing where they could. He pushed for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/28/applications-delivery-worker-e-bike-moped-trade-in>safer e-bikes for delivery workers</a> and a <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/02/year-in-review-in-2023-nycs-ambitious-streets-master-plan-was-just-pretty-paper-and-maps>citywide greenway plan</a>. But when it came to the Fordham Road bus lane—a project proven to protect the most vulnerable—he stood in the way. <strong>Good bills are not enough if the most dangerous streets stay the same.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day without change is a day someone else bleeds on the asphalt. <strong>Call Oswald Feliz. Demand safer speeds, protected crossings, and real action on deadly corridors.</strong> Join <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> and <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Show up.

The Department of Transportation failed to build the 30 miles of protected bike lanes and 20 miles of bus lanes required by law. The agency scaled back busway hours on Jamaica Avenue and 181st Street after local pushback. Council Member Oswald Feliz opposed Fordham Road improvements, calling them an 'existential threat.' Queens Council Member Julie Won labeled Queensboro Bridge delays 'garbage.' The DOT removed protected bike lanes during Fourth Avenue construction, endangering cyclists. The Central Park Conservancy stalled on safety studies. Canal Street and Ocean Parkway saw little progress. The report states: 'city agencies failing to prioritize or deliver on street safety and sustainable transportation commitments.'

The city’s promise fades.</p><p class=mb3>On October 2, 2022, Councilmember Oswald Feliz of District 15 opposed the Department of Transportation’s plan to convert segments of Fordham Road to bus and delivery-only lanes. Feliz asked DOT to pause the redesign for at least 12 months, citing concerns about traffic diversion and business impacts. The matter, reported as 'Eric Adams’ ambitious bus lane plans hit roadblock on NYC’s Fordham Road,' details how Feliz’s opposition blocks a key part of Mayor Adams’ pledge to build 20 new miles of bus lanes. DOT’s proposal aimed to restrict private vehicle traffic and prioritize buses and deliveries, a move supported by transit advocates and local polls. But Feliz’s action keeps the status quo: crowded streets, slow buses, and danger for those outside cars.

In a letter to NYCHA CEO Greg Russ, Avilés urged targeted battery safety rules instead of a broad ban, warning, 'NYCHA's all-out ban could hurt workers and residents more.' She offered eight recommendations, including federal study, safe battery storage, and clear rules for mobility devices. Bronx Council Member Oswald Feliz announced plans for legislation requiring certified batteries, while Manhattan’s Gale Brewer is drafting a ban on second-hand batteries and pushing for delivery app accountability. The matter is under review after the comment period closed September 6. NYCHA declined to comment. Avilés’s stance centers on protecting delivery workers and vulnerable residents while addressing real fire risks from faulty batteries.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Their letter to the Department of Transportation warned, 'Closing any portion of Fordham Road to vehicular traffic will result in many negative consequences to our community.' They argued it would push cars onto residential streets, creating 'endless gridlock and danger for pedestrians.' The Fordham Road Business Improvement District and Feliz led the opposition. Despite their stance, city data shows 86 percent of corridor visitors arrive by walking or transit. DOT polling revealed strong support among residents for improved bus lanes and a car-free busway. Most locals do not own cars and rely on public transit. Transit advocates and DOT officials back the busway, citing better bus speeds and retail sales elsewhere. The proposal remains contested, with vulnerable road users caught in the middle.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
