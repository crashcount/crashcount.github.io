Nine left with life-changing injuries.</strong> In the last year, District 15 saw 1,375 crashes. <strong>Children, elders, workers—nobody spared.</strong> In those twelve months, 91 kids were hurt. Not one was killed, but pain lingers. Cars, SUVs, mopeds, bikes—every machine that moves can break a body. The numbers are not just numbers. They are people who never made it home.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>A man lay in the Bronx street after a road rage assault. An ambulance rolled over him. He was left in critical condition. <strong>&ldquo;Authorities say a man injured in a road rage assault in the Bronx was also hit by a passing ambulance while lying on the street&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/man-critically-injured-in-bronx-road-rage-assault/>reported CBS New York</a>. No warning. No chance. Another day, two drivers sped down Southern Boulevard, guns drawn. Shots rang out. One man crashed, bleeding, and called a cab to the hospital. He died. <strong>&ldquo;There were a whole lot of rounds. It was crazy. This doesn&rsquo;t happen around here during the day time&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/01/dueling-drivers-exchange-gunfire-near-bronx-zoo-wounded-man-calls-cab-to-hospital-later-dies/>said a deli worker</a>.</p><h3 id=what-has-oswald-feliz-done>What Has Oswald Feliz Done?</h3><p>Council Member Oswald Feliz has backed bills to make streets safer. He co-sponsored laws for more speed humps, protected bike lanes, and daylighting at crosswalks (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council Legislation</a>). He voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished walkers for crossing where they could. He pushed for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/28/applications-delivery-worker-e-bike-moped-trade-in>safer e-bikes for delivery workers</a> and a <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/01/02/year-in-review-in-2023-nycs-ambitious-streets-master-plan-was-just-pretty-paper-and-maps>citywide greenway plan</a>. But when it came to the Fordham Road bus lane—a project proven to protect the most vulnerable—he stood in the way. <strong>Good bills are not enough if the most dangerous streets stay the same.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day without change is a day someone else bleeds on the asphalt. <strong>Call Oswald Feliz. Demand safer speeds, protected crossings, and real action on deadly corridors.</strong> Join <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> and <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>.

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to police department parking enforcement," demands the NYPD confirm license plates and VINs on vehicles with temporary tags or those ticketed for violations. The NYPD must also release quarterly reports on parking enforcement. Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary), Oswald Feliz, Lincoln Restler, Robert F. Holden, and Chris Banks sponsor the measure. On April 28, 2025, the committee laid the bill over. The bill aims to expose enforcement gaps and bring accountability, but for now, the city’s most vulnerable—pedestrians and cyclists—see no immediate relief. The system stalls. The risk remains.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
