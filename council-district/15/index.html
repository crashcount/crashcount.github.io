Nine suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. One did not survive. Since 2022, eighteen have died. The dead do not speak. The wounded carry the story in scars and limps.</p><p><strong>Just weeks ago, a 79-year-old driver crashed into two cars and a pole.</strong> A 71-year-old woman, Stella Nyarko-Dei, died in the seat beside him. Seven others were hurt. Police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/13/multi-car-crash-in-the-bronx-kills-71-year-old-woman-injures-seven-others/>said the cause of the crash was not immediately known</a>. No one was arrested. The street swallowed another life.</p><p>On July 3rd, a driver in a Ford Mustang failed a left turn and <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/driver-plows-into-six-people-after-botching-left-turn-in-the-bronx/>plowed onto the sidewalk, hitting six people</a>. The driver ran. The victims went to the hospital. The sidewalk offered no shelter.</p><h2 id=the-machinery-of-harm>The Machinery of Harm</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the damage.</strong> They killed four, hurt 393, and left 130 with moderate injuries. Trucks and buses hurt dozens more. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll, but the weight of harm is steel and speed.</p><h2 id=council-member-feliz-steps-and-silences>Council Member Feliz: Steps and Silences</h2><p>Council Member Oswald Feliz has moved on some fronts. He <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>sponsored a bill to fine property owners who ignore sidewalk repairs</a>, aiming to make walking safer. He <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>voted to remove abandoned vehicles</a> that block sightlines and crosswalks. He co-sponsored bills for speed humps near parks and for better crash investigations. These are steps, not leaps.</p><p>But on the biggest corridor—Fordham Road—Feliz <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/07/20/mtas-hope-for-eric-adams-stay-with-us-on-fordham-road>opposed a busway</a> that would have protected 85,000 daily riders, many of them the most vulnerable. The street remains a gauntlet.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>The crisis is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every delay, every watered-down bill, every blocked redesign leaves blood on the street. Call Council Member Feliz. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people on foot, on bike, on bus. Do not wait for another name to be carved into stone.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The article quotes Bronx DA Darcel Clark: "The defendant allegedly drove her car over the victim... then after looking under her vehicle... she allegedly drove away without reporting what happened."

Jonathan Rivera, who fatally shot Allan Feliz, unarmed, during a 2019 Bronx traffic stop. Judge Maldonado found Rivera's use of deadly force unjustified, writing it 'requires more than the mere possibility of danger.' Tisch disagreed, citing a 'split-second decision' and risk to another officer. The stop began over a seatbelt. Feliz tried to flee; Rivera fired once, killing him. Tisch's decision echoes the state attorney general, who declined charges.
