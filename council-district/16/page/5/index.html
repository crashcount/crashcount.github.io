Their names: Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19, and Enrique Martinez, 21. The driver was charged with vehicular manslaughter and DWI.

In 2022, Bronx Borough President Vanessa Gibson joined a letter urging DOT to widen paths and add protection on the Washington Bridge for people on foot and on bikes. “<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/exclusive-bps-levine-and-gibson-pen-letter-to-dot-calling-for-upgrades-to-washington-bridge/>The bridge has just two very narrow, poorly lit lanes for foot and bike traffic</a>,” the letter said. Work was urged. The danger remained.</p><p>City Hall and the Council have passed smaller fixes: towing derelict cars faster, adding taxi door warnings, decriminalizing jaywalking, and reporting on pavement markings. Vote records and bill texts are on the Council’s <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Legistar</a>. Whether these save a life at Webster and 168th tonight is a different measure.</p><h3 id=what-would-stem-the-next-siren-here>What would stem the next siren here?</h3><ul><li>Daylight every corner on Webster and Jerome. Pull parking back from crosswalks so a person can be seen. Install hardened left turns at the worst intersections. Use leading pedestrian intervals. These are standard tools; the district map already flags the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>repeat hotspots</a>.</li><li>Calm speeds at night on the Major Deegan and the Cross Bronx service roads. Target the overnight hours where deaths spike in the city’s own charts. Focus on speed and impairment where the harm clusters.</li><li>Keep trucks and buses in check on local streets. The pedestrian casualty roll‑up shows heavy vehicles killing and maiming here; prioritize routes and turns that avoid crosswalk conflicts.</li></ul><h3 id=citywide-moves-that-would-matter-on-these-blocks>Citywide moves that would matter on these blocks</h3><ul><li>Lower the default limit. Albany gave the city the power. Use it. A 20 mph floor can cut death risk. Make it the rule, not the pilot. Then enforce it. See our call to action: <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>.</li><li>Stop the worst repeat speeders. Mandate intelligent speed assistance for chronic offenders, as proposed in the Stop Super Speeders Act. Details and contacts are in <a href=../../take_action/>our guide</a>.</li></ul><p>The Bronx River Parkway deaths were not a bolt from the blue.
