An SUV turned into a driveway and struck her. The driver did not stop. She died at St. Barnabas Hospital. Police are still searching for the person who left her in the road. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/woman-killed-in-bronx-hit-and-run/>A Bronx woman is dead after a hit-and-run in Morris Heights.</a></p><p>This is not rare. In the last twelve months, District 16 saw <strong>5 deaths and 777 injuries</strong> from crashes. <strong>Nine people were seriously hurt.</strong> Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. The numbers do not stop. They only grow.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-speed-flight-and-no-consequence>The Pattern: Speed, Flight, and No Consequence</h2><p>Last year, a cab driver was killed at 77 miles per hour. The driver ran a red light, hit the cab, and fled. The cab was pushed seventy feet. The driver bled out in the street. Police said <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/07/bronx-hit-and-run-crash-livery-cab-driver-robert-godwin-imani-williams-arrested-manslaughter/>Williams managed to get out of the mangled SUV and stumble away, leaving Godwin to die</a>.</p><p>Most deaths come from cars and SUVs.

Bikes and mopeds hurt fewer, but the real threat is heavy and fast.</p><h2 id=council-member-stevens-steps-and-stalls>Council Member Stevens: Steps and Stalls</h2><p>Council Member Althea Stevens has voted for some safety bills. She backed laws to remove abandoned cars, warn taxi passengers about cyclists, and decriminalize jaywalking. She co-sponsored a bill for discounted bike share for students. But she also signed on to bills that raise fines for e-mobility users and require e-bike registration—measures that burden the most vulnerable and do little to stop the real killers: speeding cars and reckless drivers.</p><p><strong>The council can do more.</strong> The city now has the power to set a 20 mph speed limit. It has not done so.

The official contributing factor cited is 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper,' highlighting a failure in lane discipline that led to the crash. Both the sedan and taxi were westbound, with the taxi parked at the time of impact. The e-bike rider was unlicensed and wore no helmet, but the police report does not list these as contributing factors. The focus remains on the improper lane usage that resulted in a vulnerable road user suffering grave injuries under the Bronx night.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The report states the woman was 'crossing with the signal' at the intersection. The driver was traveling at 'unsafe speed' and 'disregarded traffic control,' as cited in the contributing factors. The sedan was heading south and made no attempt to yield. The victim suffered fatal crush injuries to her entire body and died at the scene. The police report makes clear the driver’s lack of license and failure to obey traffic signals were central to the deadly impact.
