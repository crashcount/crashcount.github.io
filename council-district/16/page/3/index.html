The bill's title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to increasing civil penalties for operating a bicycle, bicycle with electric assist, or electric scooter on the sidewalk.' Council Members Althea V. Stevens (primary sponsor), James F. Gennaro, Justin L. Brannan, Gale A. Brewer, and Sandra Ung back the measure. The bill would raise fines for anyone caught riding a bike, e-bike, or scooter on sidewalks. Supporters say higher penalties will curb sidewalk riding and protect pedestrians. The bill awaits further action in committee.
