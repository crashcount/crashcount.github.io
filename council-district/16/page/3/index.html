Twenty-four left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 2,200 hurt since 2022. The dead include children, parents, neighbors. They are not statistics. They are the empty chair at dinner, the silence on a basketball court, the father who will not come home.</p><p>On a May night, a black Mercedes sped down Webster Avenue. It hit Kelvin Mitchell, a 43-year-old father, and dragged him half a block. His mother <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/14/police-chase-linked-to-fatal-hit-and-run-in-bronx>said, &ldquo;They killed my son. I need justice for my son.&rdquo;</a> The driver did not stop. The street did not forgive. The city moved on.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-cost-of-speed>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Cost of Speed</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs killed six. Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left others broken.</strong> The numbers are steady, the pain is not. Speed is the constant. A sedan, a truck, a bus—each can end a life in a second. The victims are most often on foot, in the crosswalk, or riding a bike. They are not shielded by steel or speed. They are exposed.</p><p>Mitchell’s sister <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/11/sister-of-bronx-man-killed-by-hit-and-run-mercedes-driver-has-faith-driver-will-be-caught/>said, &ldquo;We shouldn’t be afraid to come outside and not make it back home.&rdquo;</a> The fear is real. The risk is not shared equally.</p><h3 id=the-response-what-althea-stevens-has-doneand-not-done>The Response: What Althea Stevens Has Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Council Member Althea Stevens has backed some measures that matter. She <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>voted to legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the vulnerable and did nothing to stop drivers from killing. She co-sponsored bills for <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>bollards</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>curb extensions</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>greenway planning</a>. She joined calls for <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/exclusive-bps-levine-and-gibson-pen-letter-to-dot-calling-for-upgrades-to-washington-bridge/>safer crossings on the Washington Bridge</a>. These are steps. But the blood on the street says it is not enough.</p><p>Stevens has also supported bills that raise fines for sidewalk cycling and e-scooter violations. These laws target the least protected, not the most dangerous. They do not stop cars from killing. They do not slow the traffic that takes lives.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day without action is another day of risk.</strong> The city can lower speed limits. It can build more protected crossings. It can put people before parking. Call Council Member Stevens. Demand more. Demand streets where children can cross without fear, where parents come home. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill came through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, first introduced April 28, 2022. The law's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to a citywide greenway plan.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors including Rivera, Hudson, and others. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor on October 27, 2022. The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law. The measure compels the city to plan and maintain safe routes for non-drivers, with regular public reporting and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The letter calls for urgent upgrades to the 133-year-old Washington Bridge. The officials demand a two-way protected bike lane, wider pedestrian paths, improved lighting, and safety cameras. The letter states: 'The city has done a terrific job of making wise investments in improving mobility on both sides of the Harlem River, but left the bridge with just two very narrow, poorly lit lanes for foot and bike traffic.' Stevens and her colleagues stress that the bridge is unsafe for people on foot and bike. They urge DOT to act, citing the need to reduce traffic deaths and make the bridge safe for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
