Six hundred fifty-eight injured.</strong> That is the count in District 16 over the last year. The numbers do not bleed, but the streets do. In the last twelve months, three people died in just the 35–44 age group. Seventy-eight children were hurt. The old and the young, all at risk.</p><p>On July 11, a 79-year-old driver crashed into two cars and a pole. His passenger, Stella Nyarko-Dei, 71, died. Seven others were hurt. &ldquo;I saw one lady was out on the ground. They was giving her medical attention, checking her body. She was laid out,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/op-city-crash-multiple-people-injured-including-1-critically-bronx/17075710/>said Samuel Cherry</a>. The cause is still under investigation. No arrests. No answers. Only loss.</p><h2 id=patterns-that-kill>Patterns That Kill</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> In three years, they killed seven and injured over 350 people walking or biking. Trucks and buses killed one, injured dozens. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes hurt many more. The street is a gauntlet. The most vulnerable—children, elders, people on foot—pay the price.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h2><p>Council Member Althea Stevens has voted for some safety bills: clearing abandoned cars, warning decals for taxis, more pavement markings. She co-sponsored a bill to give students cheaper bike share, and another to remove derelict vehicles fast. These are steps, but not leaps. <strong>No bold push for lower speeds, protected bike lanes, or real accountability for reckless drivers.</strong></p><p>The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not. The council can demand more. It has not. &ldquo;It was a terrible sound &ndash; it was a terrible incident that happened,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/op-city-crash-multiple-people-injured-including-1-critically-bronx/17075710/>said Jennifer</a>. The sound echoes. The silence from leadership does too.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Stevens. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings and bike lanes. Demand action for the living, not memorials for the dead. The toll will not stop until the council does more than vote. It must fight.</p><p><strong>Call. Demand. Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
