An SUV turned into a driveway and struck her. The driver did not stop. She died at St. Barnabas Hospital. Police are still searching for the person who left her in the road. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/woman-killed-in-bronx-hit-and-run/>A Bronx woman is dead after a hit-and-run in Morris Heights.</a></p><p>This is not rare. In the last twelve months, District 16 saw <strong>5 deaths and 777 injuries</strong> from crashes. <strong>Nine people were seriously hurt.</strong> Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. The numbers do not stop. They only grow.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-speed-flight-and-no-consequence>The Pattern: Speed, Flight, and No Consequence</h2><p>Last year, a cab driver was killed at 77 miles per hour. The driver ran a red light, hit the cab, and fled. The cab was pushed seventy feet. The driver bled out in the street. Police said <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/07/bronx-hit-and-run-crash-livery-cab-driver-robert-godwin-imani-williams-arrested-manslaughter/>Williams managed to get out of the mangled SUV and stumble away, leaving Godwin to die</a>.</p><p>Most deaths come from cars and SUVs. In three years, <strong>7 killed, 4 seriously hurt, 399 injured</strong>—all by cars and trucks. Bikes and mopeds hurt fewer, but the real threat is heavy and fast.</p><h2 id=council-member-stevens-steps-and-stalls>Council Member Stevens: Steps and Stalls</h2><p>Council Member Althea Stevens has voted for some safety bills. She backed laws to remove abandoned cars, warn taxi passengers about cyclists, and decriminalize jaywalking. She co-sponsored a bill for discounted bike share for students. But she also signed on to bills that raise fines for e-mobility users and require e-bike registration—measures that burden the most vulnerable and do little to stop the real killers: speeding cars and reckless drivers.</p><p><strong>The council can do more.</strong> The city now has the power to set a 20 mph speed limit. It has not done so. The most dangerous drivers still keep their keys.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</h2><p><strong>Every day, another family loses someone.

The measure, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code...increasing civil penalties for operating a bicycle, bicycle with electric assist, or electric scooter on the sidewalk,' seeks to raise fines for sidewalk riding. Council Members Stevens (primary), Gennaro, Ung, Brewer, Brannan, and Morano sponsor the bill. The action: referral to committee. The summary states, 'This bill would increase each of the existing civil penalties for operating a bicycle, a bicycle with electric assist (commonly referred to as an “e-bike”), or an electric scooter on the sidewalk.'
