Six hundred fifty-eight injured.</strong> That is the count in District 16 over the last year. The numbers do not bleed, but the streets do. In the last twelve months, three people died in just the 35–44 age group. Seventy-eight children were hurt. The old and the young, all at risk.</p><p>On July 11, a 79-year-old driver crashed into two cars and a pole. His passenger, Stella Nyarko-Dei, 71, died. Seven others were hurt. &ldquo;I saw one lady was out on the ground. They was giving her medical attention, checking her body. She was laid out,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/op-city-crash-multiple-people-injured-including-1-critically-bronx/17075710/>said Samuel Cherry</a>. The cause is still under investigation. No arrests. No answers. Only loss.</p><h2 id=patterns-that-kill>Patterns That Kill</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> In three years, they killed seven and injured over 350 people walking or biking. Trucks and buses killed one, injured dozens. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes hurt many more. The street is a gauntlet. The most vulnerable—children, elders, people on foot—pay the price.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h2><p>Council Member Althea Stevens has voted for some safety bills: clearing abandoned cars, warning decals for taxis, more pavement markings. She co-sponsored a bill to give students cheaper bike share, and another to remove derelict vehicles fast. These are steps, but not leaps. <strong>No bold push for lower speeds, protected bike lanes, or real accountability for reckless drivers.</strong></p><p>The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not. The council can demand more. It has not. &ldquo;It was a terrible sound &ndash; it was a terrible incident that happened,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/op-city-crash-multiple-people-injured-including-1-critically-bronx/17075710/>said Jennifer</a>. The sound echoes. The silence from leadership does too.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Stevens. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings and bike lanes. Demand action for the living, not memorials for the dead. The toll will not stop until the council does more than vote. It must fight.</p><p><strong>Call. Demand. Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bus crashed into the wall, breaking through and leaving debris below. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz said, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." No injuries were reported, but the crash caused structural damage. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz noted, "That’s a very big bus, so even going very slowly, it can do a lot of damage," highlighting the risk of lax parking enforcement. The incident underscores systemic issues: double-parking and weak infrastructure can combine to threaten lives, even when no one is hurt.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan keeps parking, speeds up buses, and centers people, not cars.</p><p class=mb3>The Department of Transportation (DOT) announced a new two-way busway for East Tremont Avenue between Third Avenue and Southern Boulevard, to be installed in spring 2025. The proposal was presented to the Municipal Services Committee of Bronx Community Board 5. DOT’s plan, first floated in June 2024, restricts the 0.6-mile stretch to buses and trucks, forcing cars to turn off at the first opportunity. The matter summary notes, 'Bronx bus riders are about to get a short stretch of relief.' Council Member Oswald Feliz represents the district but has not publicly supported or opposed this project. Bronx Borough President Vanessa Gibson, however, called for better bus service, stating, 'We need better buses to move across our borough from east to west.' DOT’s outreach found most shoppers and workers use transit or walk, not drive. The agency chose not to remove parking, responding to business concerns. The busway aims to speed up the Bx36, the Bronx’s fifth-busiest bus, and serve a low-income, car-free majority.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals.
