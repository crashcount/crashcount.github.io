No injuries were reported, but the crash caused structural damage and scattered debris below.

She said, "If we're seeing that these stations aren't being used adequately ... is there another option, can we make the docks smaller?" The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, defended the current system. Bike-share experts like David Eddington countered that full docks signal popularity, not neglect. Citi Bike General Manager Patrick Knoth explained that point-in-time observations mislead, as ridership is strong and docks are planned based on trends. Citi Bike usage in Stevens's district rose 48 percent from 2022 to 2023, with most riders using reduced fares. The hearing highlighted the need for a comprehensive, accessible bike-share network, especially as e-bikes make hilly areas more reachable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
