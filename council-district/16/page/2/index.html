In 2022, Bronx Borough President Vanessa Gibson joined a letter urging DOT to widen paths and add protection on the Washington Bridge for people on foot and on bikes. “<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/exclusive-bps-levine-and-gibson-pen-letter-to-dot-calling-for-upgrades-to-washington-bridge/>The bridge has just two very narrow, poorly lit lanes for foot and bike traffic</a>,” the letter said. Work was urged. The danger remained.</p><p>City Hall and the Council have passed smaller fixes: towing derelict cars faster, adding taxi door warnings, decriminalizing jaywalking, and reporting on pavement markings. Vote records and bill texts are on the Council’s <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Legistar</a>. Whether these save a life at Webster and 168th tonight is a different measure.</p><h3 id=what-would-stem-the-next-siren-here>What would stem the next siren here?</h3><ul><li>Daylight every corner on Webster and Jerome. Pull parking back from crosswalks so a person can be seen. Install hardened left turns at the worst intersections. Use leading pedestrian intervals. These are standard tools; the district map already flags the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>repeat hotspots</a>.</li><li>Calm speeds at night on the Major Deegan and the Cross Bronx service roads. Target the overnight hours where deaths spike in the city’s own charts. Focus on speed and impairment where the harm clusters.</li><li>Keep trucks and buses in check on local streets. The pedestrian casualty roll‑up shows heavy vehicles killing and maiming here; prioritize routes and turns that avoid crosswalk conflicts.</li></ul><h3 id=citywide-moves-that-would-matter-on-these-blocks>Citywide moves that would matter on these blocks</h3><ul><li>Lower the default limit.

The plan keeps parking, speeds up buses, and centers people, not cars.</p><p class=mb3>The Department of Transportation (DOT) announced a new two-way busway for East Tremont Avenue between Third Avenue and Southern Boulevard, to be installed in spring 2025. The proposal was presented to the Municipal Services Committee of Bronx Community Board 5. DOT’s plan, first floated in June 2024, restricts the 0.6-mile stretch to buses and trucks, forcing cars to turn off at the first opportunity. The matter summary notes, 'Bronx bus riders are about to get a short stretch of relief.' Council Member Oswald Feliz represents the district but has not publicly supported or opposed this project. Bronx Borough President Vanessa Gibson, however, called for better bus service, stating, 'We need better buses to move across our borough from east to west.' DOT’s outreach found most shoppers and workers use transit or walk, not drive. The agency chose not to remove parking, responding to business concerns. The busway aims to speed up the Bx36, the Bronx’s fifth-busiest bus, and serve a low-income, car-free majority.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Neither wore seat belts. The crash, marked by metal screams and shattered heads, left the street silent beneath green traffic lights.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a violent head-on collision occurred on Park Avenue near Claremont Parkway in the Bronx, involving a sedan and an SUV. Two men, ages 24 and 32, were passengers in the sedan and suffered fatal head injuries. Both were not wearing seat belts at the time of the crash. The vehicles collided front-to-front while traveling straight ahead. The report cites 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as a contributing factor in the death of the 32-year-old passenger, indicating driver failure to obey traffic signals or signs. The narrative describes the aftermath: 'Metal screamed. Lights stayed green. Their heads took the blow. The street went quiet.' No other driver errors or victim behaviors are listed as contributing factors. The crash highlights the deadly impact of driver disregard for traffic controls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
