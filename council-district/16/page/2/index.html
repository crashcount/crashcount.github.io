Their names: Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19, and Enrique Martinez, 21. The driver was charged with vehicular manslaughter and DWI.

In 2022, Bronx Borough President Vanessa Gibson joined a letter urging DOT to widen paths and add protection on the Washington Bridge for people on foot and on bikes. “<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/exclusive-bps-levine-and-gibson-pen-letter-to-dot-calling-for-upgrades-to-washington-bridge/>The bridge has just two very narrow, poorly lit lanes for foot and bike traffic</a>,” the letter said. Work was urged. The danger remained.</p><p>City Hall and the Council have passed smaller fixes: towing derelict cars faster, adding taxi door warnings, decriminalizing jaywalking, and reporting on pavement markings. Vote records and bill texts are on the Council’s <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Legistar</a>. Whether these save a life at Webster and 168th tonight is a different measure.</p><h3 id=what-would-stem-the-next-siren-here>What would stem the next siren here?</h3><ul><li>Daylight every corner on Webster and Jerome. Pull parking back from crosswalks so a person can be seen. Install hardened left turns at the worst intersections. Use leading pedestrian intervals. These are standard tools; the district map already flags the <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>repeat hotspots</a>.</li><li>Calm speeds at night on the Major Deegan and the Cross Bronx service roads. Target the overnight hours where deaths spike in the city’s own charts. Focus on speed and impairment where the harm clusters.</li><li>Keep trucks and buses in check on local streets. The pedestrian casualty roll‑up shows heavy vehicles killing and maiming here; prioritize routes and turns that avoid crosswalk conflicts.</li></ul><h3 id=citywide-moves-that-would-matter-on-these-blocks>Citywide moves that would matter on these blocks</h3><ul><li>Lower the default limit. Albany gave the city the power. Use it. A 20 mph floor can cut death risk. Make it the rule, not the pilot. Then enforce it. See our call to action: <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>.</li><li>Stop the worst repeat speeders. Mandate intelligent speed assistance for chronic offenders, as proposed in the Stop Super Speeders Act. Details and contacts are in <a href=../../take_action/>our guide</a>.</li></ul><p>The Bronx River Parkway deaths were not a bolt from the blue. They landed in a district where nights are loud with crashes, where SUVs roll through people in the crosswalk, where speed keeps winning.

Cars must turn off; only buses and trucks allowed. The move targets slow, crowded buses. Most locals ride transit. The plan keeps parking, speeds up buses, and centers people, not cars.</p><p class=mb3>The Department of Transportation (DOT) announced a new two-way busway for East Tremont Avenue between Third Avenue and Southern Boulevard, to be installed in spring 2025. The proposal was presented to the Municipal Services Committee of Bronx Community Board 5. DOT’s plan, first floated in June 2024, restricts the 0.6-mile stretch to buses and trucks, forcing cars to turn off at the first opportunity. The matter summary notes, 'Bronx bus riders are about to get a short stretch of relief.' Council Member Oswald Feliz represents the district but has not publicly supported or opposed this project. Bronx Borough President Vanessa Gibson, however, called for better bus service, stating, 'We need better buses to move across our borough from east to west.' DOT’s outreach found most shoppers and workers use transit or walk, not drive. The agency chose not to remove parking, responding to business concerns. The busway aims to speed up the Bx36, the Bronx’s fifth-busiest bus, and serve a low-income, car-free majority.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
