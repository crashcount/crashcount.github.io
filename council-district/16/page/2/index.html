Twenty-four left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 2,200 hurt since 2022. The dead include children, parents, neighbors. They are not statistics. They are the empty chair at dinner, the silence on a basketball court, the father who will not come home.</p><p>On a May night, a black Mercedes sped down Webster Avenue. It hit Kelvin Mitchell, a 43-year-old father, and dragged him half a block. His mother <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/14/police-chase-linked-to-fatal-hit-and-run-in-bronx>said, &ldquo;They killed my son. I need justice for my son.&rdquo;</a> The driver did not stop. The street did not forgive. The city moved on.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-cost-of-speed>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Cost of Speed</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs killed six. Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left others broken.</strong> The numbers are steady, the pain is not. Speed is the constant. A sedan, a truck, a bus—each can end a life in a second. The victims are most often on foot, in the crosswalk, or riding a bike. They are not shielded by steel or speed. They are exposed.</p><p>Mitchell’s sister <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/11/sister-of-bronx-man-killed-by-hit-and-run-mercedes-driver-has-faith-driver-will-be-caught/>said, &ldquo;We shouldn’t be afraid to come outside and not make it back home.&rdquo;</a> The fear is real. The risk is not shared equally.</p><h3 id=the-response-what-althea-stevens-has-doneand-not-done>The Response: What Althea Stevens Has Done—and Not Done</h3><p>Council Member Althea Stevens has backed some measures that matter. She <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>voted to legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the vulnerable and did nothing to stop drivers from killing. She co-sponsored bills for <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>bollards</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>curb extensions</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>greenway planning</a>. She joined calls for <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/exclusive-bps-levine-and-gibson-pen-letter-to-dot-calling-for-upgrades-to-washington-bridge/>safer crossings on the Washington Bridge</a>. These are steps. But the blood on the street says it is not enough.</p><p>Stevens has also supported bills that raise fines for sidewalk cycling and e-scooter violations. These laws target the least protected, not the most dangerous. They do not stop cars from killing. They do not slow the traffic that takes lives.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day without action is another day of risk.</strong> The city can lower speed limits. It can build more protected crossings. It can put people before parking. Call Council Member Stevens. Demand more. Demand streets where children can cross without fear, where parents come home. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to bus lane restrictions.' Council Members Althea V. Stevens (primary sponsor), Kevin C. Riley, Chris Banks, Chi A. Ossé, Nantasha M. Williams, Carmen N. De La Rosa, Amanda Farías, and Yusef Salaam co-sponsored. The bill aims to end confusion for all street users.

Introduced February 28, 2024, it calls for an advisory board on school crossing guard deployment. The board would include the NYPD, Department of Transportation, and Department of Education. According to the bill summary: 'Such advisory board would be responsible for submitting biannual reports, relating to recommended deployment of school crossing guards, to the Mayor, the City Council Speaker and the Police Commissioner.' Council Member Kamillah Hanks leads as primary sponsor, joined by Stevens, Schulman, Salaam, Won, Cabán, Riley, Farías, Restler, Williams, Narcisse, Banks, Louis, Brooks-Powers, Marmorato, and the Bronx Borough President. The bill demands city agencies work together, but it does not guarantee more guards or safer crossings.

The 18-year-old cyclist, traveling straight, was struck by a Jeep making a left turn. According to the police report, 'Unsafe Speed' was listed as a contributing factor. The cyclist suffered severe lacerations to his arm and was partially ejected from his bike but remained conscious. The report notes the cyclist was not wearing safety equipment, but this is mentioned only after the primary driver error. The crash highlights the danger when drivers turn across the path of vulnerable road users at unsafe speeds.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill also ordered a study comparing these devices to unlit signs, probing their power to deter traffic violations and mapping out logistical hurdles. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the installation of solar-powered crosswalks.' Council Member Lincoln Restler led as primary sponsor, joined by Menin, Brooks-Powers, Rivera, and over thirty others. The bill was filed at session’s end on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst note was provided. The city’s crosswalks remain unchanged.
