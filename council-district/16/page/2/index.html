The dead do not speak. The injured carry scars. Just weeks ago, a driver in a Ford Mustang failed a left turn at East 149th and Courtlandt. He mounted the curb and plowed into six people. He ran. The victims went to Lincoln Hospital. Police said they were in stable condition. The man who did it is still out there. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/driver-plows-into-six-people-after-botching-left-turn-in-the-bronx/>&ldquo;Cops are looking for a man who rammed into six people after botching a turn at an intersection in the Bronx,&rdquo; NY Daily News reported.</a></p><p>Last fall, a pedestrian fell at a Bronx gas station. The driver rolled over him, dragged him 950 feet, then stopped in a bike lane. She looked under her car. She left him there. The Bronx DA called it &ldquo;egregious and show[ing] a lack of humanity.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/23/bronx-hit-run-driver-arrested-2-years-after-dragging-pedestrian-950-feet-to-death-da/>&ldquo;The defendant allegedly drove her car over the victim&mldr; then after looking under her vehicle&mldr; she allegedly drove away without reporting what happened,&rdquo; said DA Darcel Clark.</a></p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> In three years, 18 people have died, 2,503 have been injured, and 28 have suffered serious injuries. Cars and SUVs killed seven. Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left dozens more hurt. The numbers do not flinch. They do not grieve. They only grow.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h3><p>Council Member Althea Stevens has voted for some safety bills. She backed laws to remove abandoned vehicles, add taxi dooring warnings, and decriminalize jaywalking. She co-sponsored a bill for discounted bike share for students. But Stevens also signed onto bills that raise fines and registration burdens for e-bikes—measures that fall hardest on the people who have the least and do the least harm. The council passed laws. The bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=the-work-ahead>The Work Ahead</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call Council Member Stevens. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people on foot and bike. Demand action before another name becomes a number.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bus crashed into the wall, breaking through and leaving debris below. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz said, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." No injuries were reported, but the crash caused structural damage. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz noted, "That’s a very big bus, so even going very slowly, it can do a lot of damage," highlighting the risk of lax parking enforcement. The incident underscores systemic issues: double-parking and weak infrastructure can combine to threaten lives, even when no one is hurt.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan keeps parking, speeds up buses, and centers people, not cars.</p><p class=mb3>The Department of Transportation (DOT) announced a new two-way busway for East Tremont Avenue between Third Avenue and Southern Boulevard, to be installed in spring 2025. The proposal was presented to the Municipal Services Committee of Bronx Community Board 5. DOT’s plan, first floated in June 2024, restricts the 0.6-mile stretch to buses and trucks, forcing cars to turn off at the first opportunity. The matter summary notes, 'Bronx bus riders are about to get a short stretch of relief.' Council Member Oswald Feliz represents the district but has not publicly supported or opposed this project. Bronx Borough President Vanessa Gibson, however, called for better bus service, stating, 'We need better buses to move across our borough from east to west.' DOT’s outreach found most shoppers and workers use transit or walk, not drive. The agency chose not to remove parking, responding to business concerns. The busway aims to speed up the Bx36, the Bronx’s fifth-busiest bus, and serve a low-income, car-free majority.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The narrative describes the aftermath: 'Metal screamed. Lights stayed green. Their heads took the blow. The street went quiet.' No other driver errors or victim behaviors are listed as contributing factors.

Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals.
