The dead do not speak. The injured carry scars. Just weeks ago, a driver in a Ford Mustang failed a left turn at East 149th and Courtlandt. He mounted the curb and plowed into six people. He ran. The victims went to Lincoln Hospital. Police said they were in stable condition. The man who did it is still out there. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/driver-plows-into-six-people-after-botching-left-turn-in-the-bronx/>&ldquo;Cops are looking for a man who rammed into six people after botching a turn at an intersection in the Bronx,&rdquo; NY Daily News reported.</a></p><p>Last fall, a pedestrian fell at a Bronx gas station. The driver rolled over him, dragged him 950 feet, then stopped in a bike lane. She looked under her car. She left him there. The Bronx DA called it &ldquo;egregious and show[ing] a lack of humanity.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/23/bronx-hit-run-driver-arrested-2-years-after-dragging-pedestrian-950-feet-to-death-da/>&ldquo;The defendant allegedly drove her car over the victim&mldr; then after looking under her vehicle&mldr; she allegedly drove away without reporting what happened,&rdquo; said DA Darcel Clark.</a></p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> In three years, 18 people have died, 2,503 have been injured, and 28 have suffered serious injuries. Cars and SUVs killed seven. Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left dozens more hurt. The numbers do not flinch. They do not grieve. They only grow.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h3><p>Council Member Althea Stevens has voted for some safety bills. She backed laws to remove abandoned vehicles, add taxi dooring warnings, and decriminalize jaywalking. She co-sponsored a bill for discounted bike share for students. But Stevens also signed onto bills that raise fines and registration burdens for e-bikes—measures that fall hardest on the people who have the least and do the least harm. The council passed laws. The bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=the-work-ahead>The Work Ahead</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call Council Member Stevens. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people on foot and bike. Demand action before another name becomes a number.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
