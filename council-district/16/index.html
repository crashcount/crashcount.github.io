Twenty-eight suffered wounds so grave they may never walk the same. These are not numbers. They are lives ended or broken on the way to work, to school, to the store.</p><p>Just last month, a driver in a Mustang failed a left turn and <strong>plowed onto the sidewalk, striking six people</strong>. The driver ran. The victims went to the hospital. Police are still looking for the man who <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/driver-plows-into-six-people-after-botching-left-turn-in-the-bronx/>rammed into six people after botching a turn at an intersection in the Bronx</a>.</p><p>In May, a pedestrian crossing with the signal at East 167th and Washington was crushed by a line of SUVs. She died at the intersection. No warning. No chance.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-delay-leadership-and-policy>The Cost of Delay: Leadership and Policy</h3><p><strong>Council Member Althea Stevens has voted for some safety bills</strong>—including laws to remove abandoned vehicles and warn taxi passengers about dooring. She co-sponsored a bill for discounted bike share for students, and voted to decriminalize jaywalking. But Stevens also backed bills that raise fines and registration requirements for e-bikes, which can make life harder for delivery workers and young riders, not drivers.</p><p>The city just funded a long-overdue fix for the deadly intersection at East 177th, Devoe, and Tremont. <strong>&ldquo;We are excited to make progress on this key corridor, which will make incredible pedestrian and vehicular safety improvements,&rdquo;</strong> said DDC spokesperson Ian Michaels <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/city-commits-45-million-redo-dangerous-three-way-intersection-bronx>announcing the project</a>. But it took 17 years and two deaths to get here. The work is not done.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the killing.</strong> Seven deaths, 272 minor injuries, 122 moderate, four serious. Trucks and buses add more. Bikes and mopeds, far fewer. The street is not equal. The most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, children—pay the highest price.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more>Call to Action: Demand More</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Stevens. Demand a default 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes, daylighted corners, and real accountability for reckless drivers. Join forces with others who have lost too much. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice. Change it.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The state may build a connecting road across the Bronx River to keep traffic moving during bridge repairs. Critics, including environmental and transit groups, say this would widen the expressway, bringing more traffic and pollution. The officials' letter asks the state to 'fully consider' options without the new road. DOT spokesman Rolando Infante said no decision has been made.
