A child is thrown to the curb. In District 22, the violence does not stop. In the last twelve months, <strong>2 people died</strong> and <strong>630 were injured</strong> in crashes. Five suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. The dead include a child and a man in his thirties. The living carry scars.</p><p>On a spring afternoon, a driver with no license reversed onto the sidewalk outside a school in Astoria. A 7-year-old girl left with a broken femur and a head wound. A 14-year-old girl and a 58-year-old man, battered and bruised. The driver was charged with reckless endangerment, reckless driving, and driving without a license. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/04/us-news/out-of-control-nyc-driver-hits-two-kids-1-adult-during-evening-rush-leaving-girl-7-with-broken-femur-cops/>Police sources said Bah was arrested and charged with reckless endangerment, reckless driving and driving without a license.</a></p><p>A cyclist, Amanda Servedio, was killed by a man fleeing police. She went airborne. A witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>said, &ldquo;She went airborne. She flew like 30 feet. It was a lot of force.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>The numbers are not just numbers. They are broken bodies, empty chairs, and families left waiting.</strong></p><h3 id=who-bears-the-risk>Who Bears the Risk</h3><p>The violence is not random. <strong>SUVs and cars caused the most harm:</strong> 3 deaths, 204 minor injuries, 84 moderate injuries, 4 serious injuries. Trucks and buses followed. Motorcycles and mopeds left 22 people hurt. Even bikes, the smallest on the road, injured 10. No one is safe. The street does not care if you are young or old, walking or riding.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Tiffany Cabán has stood with the vulnerable. She voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the poor and the bold. She co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and demand daylight at corners. She called for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/02/26/dolmas-grieving-father-pols-seek-traffic-light-at-fatal-corner-but-larger-safety-improvements-are-needed>bigger and bolder traffic-calming measures</a> after a child was killed. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/02/26/dolmas-grieving-father-pols-seek-traffic-light-at-fatal-corner-but-larger-safety-improvements-are-needed>&ldquo;We have to be bigger and we have to be bolder. We have to be thinking about traffic-calming measures across all of our intersections.&rdquo;</a></p><p>But the blood keeps coming. Laws are passed, but cars still rule the street. Promises are made, but the curb is still a battlefield.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong></p><p>Call Council Member Cabán. Demand the city finish the job: daylight every corner, build real protected bike lanes, and slow the cars. Join the fight. Do not wait for another child’s name on a plaque.</p><p><strong>The street belongs to the living. Make them prove it.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The street, a DOT truck route, lacks bike lanes. Kao was the fourth cyclist killed in western Queens in under three years. Former Councilmember Costa Constantinides called the area a 'serious safety risk' and urged the DOT to study improvements and reroute trucks. Cabán called the crash 'devastating' and pressed city agencies for action. DOT spokesman Vin Barone promised immediate steps at the crash site and talks on protected bike lanes. Less than 1.5 percent of streets in Council District 22 have protected bike paths. Residents say the city prioritizes highway access over safety.

No law.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0556-2022 was introduced in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on June 16, 2022. The bill required owners of commercial buildings over 500,000 square feet to submit and carry out delivery and servicing plans. The matter summary reads: 'creating an office of sustainable delivery systems and requiring large generator of truck traffic buildings to produce and implement a delivery and servicing plan.' Council Member Gale A. Brewer sponsored the bill, joined by Rivera, Gutiérrez, Restler, Won, Sanchez, and Cabán. The bill called for on-site loading, delivery reservations, and off-peak scheduling to cut truck traffic and street loading. It would have created a new city office to oversee compliance and penalize violators. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. No safety analyst note was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal, discussed in Streetsblog NYC, highlights failures in the current system: 'We should have public snow removal from sidewalks. Currently, we are placing undue burdens on pedestrians, especially those who use wheelchairs, canes, or walkers, or who push strollers,' Cabán said. Levine noted, 'This is a serious challenge for disabled and elderly New Yorkers, as well as their caregivers.' Community Board 4 and pedestrian advocates echoed these concerns, citing blocked bus stops and curb ramps. The Department of Sanitation expressed readiness if given more funding. The push aims to end patchwork clearance and protect those most at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
