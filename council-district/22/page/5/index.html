Three people died at the scene: two men standing by the cart and the 84-year-old driver who officers say was at the wheel (<a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/queens/carnage-queens-senior-driver-stroke-crash/>amNY, 2025-08-13</a>; crash record: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). An eyewitness said, “I have never seen anything like this.”</p><p>Last year, a 36-year-old bicyclist died on 2024-10-22 at 34th Avenue and 37th Street — a reminder that these streets were supposed to be safer (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Since 2022, District 22 has recorded 16 deaths and about 2,200 injuries on city streets. Year to date, recorded deaths climbed from 3 last year to 6 this year — a 100% increase (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-pattern>The pattern</h3><p>The toll concentrates at a few intersections. Data point to 34th Avenue and 42nd Street as repeat hotspots. Crashes spike in the early morning around 08:00 and several fatal crashes occur overnight and at dawn. Contributing factors logged by NYPD and DOT cluster in a few buckets: “other” and “vulnerable road‑user error,” with driver inattention and failure to yield also frequent. Cars and SUVs cause the majority of pedestrian injuries and deaths in the district (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>small area analysis</a>).</p><p>These are fixable streets. Daylighting the corners will restore sightlines. Leading pedestrian intervals and hardened left turns will protect people crossing. Protected bike lanes on 31st Street must be installed now. Target enforcement and better lighting for overnight and early-morning hours will stop repeat offenders.</p><h3 id=what-tiffany-cabán-and-agencies-have-done>What Tiffany Cabán and agencies have done</h3><p>Council Member Tiffany Cabán publicly backed the 31st Street protected‑lane plan and called for universal daylighting and full use of Sammy’s Law to lower speeds after the Astoria crash (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/12/speeding-senior-kills-self-and-two-pedestrians-in-astoria>Streetsblog, 2025-08-12</a>). DOT has said the 31st Street protected lanes remain scheduled after summer repaving (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/20/dot-stands-by-astoria-bike-lane-plan-despite-foes-childish-outbursts>Streetsblog, 2025-06-20</a>).</p><p>Cabán co‑sponsored a bill to speed school‑area safety installs to 60 days (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1353-2025</a>). She also backed daylighting legislation to keep crosswalks clear and voted for faster removal of derelict vehicles ([Int 1138-2024]; [Int 0857-2024]) and for taxi door‑warning decals to reduce dooring ([Int 0193-2024]) — measures that help, but do not stop drivers who run down people.</p><h3 id=action-the-city-must-take-now>Action the city must take now</h3><ol><li>Install the 31st Street protected bike lanes now and finish them after repaving. DOT promised the lanes; finish the work.</li><li>Daylight every crossing along 34th Avenue and at 42nd Street with curb extensions and bollards that block illegal parking and restore sightlines.</li><li>Give leading pedestrian intervals and harden left turns at the district’s worst intersections. Add focused lighting and nighttime enforcement for early‑morning and late‑night hours.</li></ol><p>No more waiting.</p><h3 id=citywide-fixes-this-must-feed-into>Citywide fixes this must feed into</h3><p>Local patterns here mirror a citywide problem. NYC should use Sammy’s Law to lower the default speed limit to 20 mph and make it standard citywide — slower streets save lives (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/12/speeding-senior-kills-self-and-two-pedestrians-in-astoria>Streetsblog, 2025-08-12</a>). The city and state must also require intelligent speed‑assistance devices for habitual speeders — a targeted tool to stop the small group of drivers who cause disproportionate harm. These are the two policy levers that would change the calculus across all boroughs.</p><p>Call Council Member Tiffany Cabán and the Mayor now. Demand a 20 mph default, protected lanes on 31st Street, daylighted corners on 34th Avenue and 42nd Street, and speed limiters for repeat speeders — before the next meal ends in blood.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter, titled 'Workers, City Coffers Will Lose Out if Council Ditches Year-Round Street Dining, Experts Say,' drew strong opinions. Council Member Chi Ossé called for a study, warning that small businesses would suffer if forced to remove and rebuild sheds each year. Council Members Jennifer Gutiérrez, Lincoln Restler, and Tiffany Cabán also supported a 12-month program. Speaker Adrienne Adams praised the program’s transformation of city streets, though she suggested moving dining to sidewalks. Advocates like Majora Carter argued that seasonal limits would make outdoor seating a luxury, not a public good. No formal safety impact for vulnerable road users was provided or analyzed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The street, a DOT truck route, lacks bike lanes. Kao was the fourth cyclist killed in western Queens in under three years. Former Councilmember Costa Constantinides called the area a 'serious safety risk' and urged the DOT to study improvements and reroute trucks. Cabán called the crash 'devastating' and pressed city agencies for action. DOT spokesman Vin Barone promised immediate steps at the crash site and talks on protected bike lanes. Less than 1.5 percent of streets in Council District 22 have protected bike paths. Residents say the city prioritizes highway access over safety.

Currently, we are placing undue burdens on pedestrians, especially those who use wheelchairs, canes, or walkers, or who push strollers,' Cabán said. Levine noted, 'This is a serious challenge for disabled and elderly New Yorkers, as well as their caregivers.'
