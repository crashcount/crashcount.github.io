Three people died at the scene: two men standing by the cart and the 84-year-old driver who officers say was at the wheel (<a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/queens/carnage-queens-senior-driver-stroke-crash/>amNY, 2025-08-13</a>; crash record: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). An eyewitness said, “I have never seen anything like this.”</p><p>Last year, a 36-year-old bicyclist died on 2024-10-22 at 34th Avenue and 37th Street — a reminder that these streets were supposed to be safer (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Since 2022, District 22 has recorded 16 deaths and about 2,200 injuries on city streets. Year to date, recorded deaths climbed from 3 last year to 6 this year — a 100% increase (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-pattern>The pattern</h3><p>The toll concentrates at a few intersections. Data point to 34th Avenue and 42nd Street as repeat hotspots. Crashes spike in the early morning around 08:00 and several fatal crashes occur overnight and at dawn. Contributing factors logged by NYPD and DOT cluster in a few buckets: “other” and “vulnerable road‑user error,” with driver inattention and failure to yield also frequent. Cars and SUVs cause the majority of pedestrian injuries and deaths in the district (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>small area analysis</a>).</p><p>These are fixable streets. Daylighting the corners will restore sightlines. Leading pedestrian intervals and hardened left turns will protect people crossing. Protected bike lanes on 31st Street must be installed now. Target enforcement and better lighting for overnight and early-morning hours will stop repeat offenders.</p><h3 id=what-tiffany-cabán-and-agencies-have-done>What Tiffany Cabán and agencies have done</h3><p>Council Member Tiffany Cabán publicly backed the 31st Street protected‑lane plan and called for universal daylighting and full use of Sammy’s Law to lower speeds after the Astoria crash (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/12/speeding-senior-kills-self-and-two-pedestrians-in-astoria>Streetsblog, 2025-08-12</a>). DOT has said the 31st Street protected lanes remain scheduled after summer repaving (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/20/dot-stands-by-astoria-bike-lane-plan-despite-foes-childish-outbursts>Streetsblog, 2025-06-20</a>).</p><p>Cabán co‑sponsored a bill to speed school‑area safety installs to 60 days (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1353-2025</a>). She also backed daylighting legislation to keep crosswalks clear and voted for faster removal of derelict vehicles ([Int 1138-2024]; [Int 0857-2024]) and for taxi door‑warning decals to reduce dooring ([Int 0193-2024]) — measures that help, but do not stop drivers who run down people.</p><h3 id=action-the-city-must-take-now>Action the city must take now</h3><ol><li>Install the 31st Street protected bike lanes now and finish them after repaving. DOT promised the lanes; finish the work.</li><li>Daylight every crossing along 34th Avenue and at 42nd Street with curb extensions and bollards that block illegal parking and restore sightlines.</li><li>Give leading pedestrian intervals and harden left turns at the district’s worst intersections. Add focused lighting and nighttime enforcement for early‑morning and late‑night hours.</li></ol><p>No more waiting.</p><h3 id=citywide-fixes-this-must-feed-into>Citywide fixes this must feed into</h3><p>Local patterns here mirror a citywide problem. NYC should use Sammy’s Law to lower the default speed limit to 20 mph and make it standard citywide — slower streets save lives (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/12/speeding-senior-kills-self-and-two-pedestrians-in-astoria>Streetsblog, 2025-08-12</a>). The city and state must also require intelligent speed‑assistance devices for habitual speeders — a targeted tool to stop the small group of drivers who cause disproportionate harm. These are the two policy levers that would change the calculus across all boroughs.</p><p>Call Council Member Tiffany Cabán and the Mayor now. Demand a 20 mph default, protected lanes on 31st Street, daylighted corners on 34th Avenue and 42nd Street, and speed limiters for repeat speeders — before the next meal ends in blood.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The crash threw Berney from his car, killing him at the scene. The other driver was injured. Vennitti, unlicensed, abandoned his Mercedes and fled on foot. Police arrested him a year later. A grand jury indicted Vennitti for leaving the scene of a fatal crash and driving without a license.

The measure, under review in committee, aimed to end NYPD enforcement that disproportionately targets people of color. The bill’s summary states, 'NYPD issues hundreds of jaywalking tickets a year. Vast majority go to people of color.' Cabán, a key sponsor, argued police use jaywalking as a pretext for stop-and-frisk, calling the law archaic and motorist-centered. Advocates raised concerns that the bill’s language might let drivers escape liability for hitting pedestrians, prompting its withdrawal.

The matter, covered by the New York Post, states: 'Cabán—who was elected to office on a platform advocating less car use and cracking down on dangerous driving—received four tickets in the past 13 months for speeding her vehicle in school zones.' Ariola, joined by Councilman Robert Holden, accused Cabán of hypocrisy, highlighting the disconnect between Cabán’s advocacy for street safety and her own driving record. Cabán’s policy platform includes converting 25% of city roadways for people, building 1,000 miles of car-free streets, and expanding bus and bike lanes. No formal council bill or committee action is attached to this event, but the public dispute underscores tensions in the city’s push for safer, less car-dominated streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Honda’s 56-year-old driver suffered severe neck bleeding but remained conscious. The report states, 'Alcohol Involvement' as a contributing factor. The narrative describes the Jeep 'tore into a Honda, metal folding like paper,' and notes, 'Alcohol hung in the air.' No seatbelt was used by the injured driver, but this is mentioned only after the primary driver error. The crash underscores the lethal mix of alcohol and speed on city streets, with parked vehicles and bystanders left vulnerable to the violence of impact.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The fight over his confirmation has begun.</p><p class=mb3>""No way in hell I vote to confirm Randy Mastro."" -- Tiffany Cabán</p><p class=mb3>On April 18, 2024, a New York Times report revealed Mayor Adams’s intent to appoint Randy Mastro, former Giuliani deputy mayor, as head of the city’s Law Department. Mastro is known for opposing bike lanes and congestion pricing, having fought the Prospect Park West bike lane and represented New Jersey against congestion pricing. Council Members Sandy Nurse and Tiffany Caban voiced strong opposition, with Caban declaring, 'No way in hell I vote to confirm Randy Mastro.' Joe Borelli, a congestion pricing opponent, supported the move, saying, 'I want more people who think like me on congestion pricing in City Hall.' The appointment signals a car-first agenda. Council resistance is fierce. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, bus riders—face greater risk if Mastro’s priorities shape city policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It was introduced April 11, 2024, and became law September 14, 2024, as Local Law 88. The law’s title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code...requiring the department of transportation to provide information about bicycle and other micromobility device activity.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers led as primary sponsor, joined by Farías, Schulman, Hudson, Restler, and others. The law forces DOT to publish monthly and annual data on bike and micromobility use, plus crash and safety project details. The city must show where riders go, where danger lurks, and what it does to fix it.
