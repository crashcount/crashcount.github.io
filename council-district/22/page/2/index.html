A car came fast. Two men died on the sidewalk. The driver died too. It happened just days ago, at 42nd Street and 19th Avenue. The street was quiet, then it was not. A witness <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/astoria-queens-crash-kills-2-leaves-critical-condition-cars-collide-local-road-new-york/17512236/>described the crash</a>: &ldquo;Must have been going at least 60+ miles an hour just right through the stop sign and within seconds I heard the crash and screams and just dropped everything and ran over there, it was instant.&rdquo;</p><p>This is not rare. In the last twelve months, District 22 saw 1,330 crashes. Five people died. Seven hundred fifty-seven were hurt. Five were left with injuries that change a life. The dead do not get a second chance. The living carry scars.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-cost>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Cost</h2><p>Cars and SUVs killed three. Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds, none. Bikes, none. The numbers are small until you know the names. The numbers grow each year. The pain does not fade.</p><p>A brother stood at the scene. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/car-hits-food-truck-in-queens-3-dead/>He spoke about the loss</a>: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very bad feeling because. It&rsquo;s hard, it&rsquo;s hard. Nobody deserves this type of end, you know? Maybe this time it was my brother. Maybe next time it could be anybody.&rdquo; The street is a lottery. The odds are not in your favor if you walk or work outside.</p><h2 id=leadership-words-votes-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Votes, and Waiting</h2><p>Council Member Tiffany Cabán has called for change. After the crash, she demanded a 20 mph speed limit, protected bike lanes, and daylighting at corners. She said she supports <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/12/speeding-senior-kills-self-and-two-pedestrians-in-astoria>the full implementation of Sammy’s Law and other traffic calming measures</a>. She co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks and to mark danger zones on pavement. She voted to clear abandoned cars from streets. The bills are steps. The deaths keep coming.</p><p>But the city has not lowered the speed limit. The city has not built enough barriers. The city has not made the street safe for the next man at the food truck.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-make-them-hear-you>Call to Action: Make Them Hear You</h2><p>This will not stop until you make it stop. Call Council Member Cabán. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes and daylighting at every corner. Demand action before another brother, another friend, another worker dies. The street belongs to the living.
