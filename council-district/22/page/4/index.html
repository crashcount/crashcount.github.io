A child is thrown to the curb. In District 22, the violence does not stop. In the last twelve months, <strong>2 people died</strong> and <strong>630 were injured</strong> in crashes. Five suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. The dead include a child and a man in his thirties. The living carry scars.</p><p>On a spring afternoon, a driver with no license reversed onto the sidewalk outside a school in Astoria. A 7-year-old girl left with a broken femur and a head wound. A 14-year-old girl and a 58-year-old man, battered and bruised. The driver was charged with reckless endangerment, reckless driving, and driving without a license. <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/04/us-news/out-of-control-nyc-driver-hits-two-kids-1-adult-during-evening-rush-leaving-girl-7-with-broken-femur-cops/>Police sources said Bah was arrested and charged with reckless endangerment, reckless driving and driving without a license.</a></p><p>A cyclist, Amanda Servedio, was killed by a man fleeing police. She went airborne. A witness <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/ex-con-who-killed-queens-bicyclist-while-being-chased-by-cops-arrested-8-months-later-nypd/>said, &ldquo;She went airborne. She flew like 30 feet. It was a lot of force.&rdquo;</a></p><p><strong>The numbers are not just numbers. They are broken bodies, empty chairs, and families left waiting.</strong></p><h3 id=who-bears-the-risk>Who Bears the Risk</h3><p>The violence is not random. <strong>SUVs and cars caused the most harm:</strong> 3 deaths, 204 minor injuries, 84 moderate injuries, 4 serious injuries. Trucks and buses followed. Motorcycles and mopeds left 22 people hurt. Even bikes, the smallest on the road, injured 10. No one is safe. The street does not care if you are young or old, walking or riding.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Tiffany Cabán has stood with the vulnerable. She voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the poor and the bold. She co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and demand daylight at corners. She called for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/02/26/dolmas-grieving-father-pols-seek-traffic-light-at-fatal-corner-but-larger-safety-improvements-are-needed>bigger and bolder traffic-calming measures</a> after a child was killed. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/02/26/dolmas-grieving-father-pols-seek-traffic-light-at-fatal-corner-but-larger-safety-improvements-are-needed>&ldquo;We have to be bigger and we have to be bolder. We have to be thinking about traffic-calming measures across all of our intersections.&rdquo;</a></p><p>But the blood keeps coming. Laws are passed, but cars still rule the street. Promises are made, but the curb is still a battlefield.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong></p><p>Call Council Member Cabán. Demand the city finish the job: daylight every corner, build real protected bike lanes, and slow the cars. Join the fight. Do not wait for another child’s name on a plaque.</p><p><strong>The street belongs to the living. Make them prove it.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

City failed to meet legal safety mandates.</p><p class=mb3>On April 11, 2023, a hit-and-run driver killed Jaydan McLaurin, a teenage cyclist, on 21st Street in Astoria, Queens. This corridor is a Vision Zero priority but only has an unprotected bike lane. The crash marks the 11th cyclist death in New York City this year, a record high for this point in the year. Council Member Tiffany Cabán called the loss 'wave after wave of grief and heartbreak' and demanded safer streets for pedestrians and cyclists. Transportation Alternatives Executive Director Danny Harris urged Mayor Adams and DOT Commissioner Rodriguez to invest in safe streets and fulfill the NYC Streets Plan’s legal requirements. Advocates noted the Department of Transportation failed to expand bike and bus lanes as required last year. The call is clear: the city must act now to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

We have to be thinking about traffic-calming measures across all of our intersections.” Advocates and officials criticized DOT’s reactive approach and urged proactive, community-driven safety changes.

The lawmakers wrote, “Nothing can bring back Dolma Naadhun, but we can prevent further loss of life so that no family must experience the loss of a loved one.” DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez opposed a Council bill mandating 100 daylighted intersections per year, arguing for flexibility and physical infrastructure in daylit spaces. Advocates and experts agree: daylighting without barriers is flawed. They call for curb extensions to slow drivers and protect people.
