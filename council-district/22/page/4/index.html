A car came fast. Two men died on the sidewalk. The driver died too. It happened just days ago, at 42nd Street and 19th Avenue. The street was quiet, then it was not. A witness <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/astoria-queens-crash-kills-2-leaves-critical-condition-cars-collide-local-road-new-york/17512236/>described the crash</a>: &ldquo;Must have been going at least 60+ miles an hour just right through the stop sign and within seconds I heard the crash and screams and just dropped everything and ran over there, it was instant.&rdquo;</p><p>This is not rare. In the last twelve months, District 22 saw 1,330 crashes. Five people died. Seven hundred fifty-seven were hurt. Five were left with injuries that change a life. The dead do not get a second chance. The living carry scars.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-cars-trucks-and-the-cost>The Pattern: Cars, Trucks, and the Cost</h2><p>Cars and SUVs killed three. Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds, none. Bikes, none. The numbers are small until you know the names. The numbers grow each year. The pain does not fade.</p><p>A brother stood at the scene. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/car-hits-food-truck-in-queens-3-dead/>He spoke about the loss</a>: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very bad feeling because. It&rsquo;s hard, it&rsquo;s hard. Nobody deserves this type of end, you know? Maybe this time it was my brother. Maybe next time it could be anybody.&rdquo; The street is a lottery. The odds are not in your favor if you walk or work outside.</p><h2 id=leadership-words-votes-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Votes, and Waiting</h2><p>Council Member Tiffany Cabán has called for change. After the crash, she demanded a 20 mph speed limit, protected bike lanes, and daylighting at corners. She said she supports <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/12/speeding-senior-kills-self-and-two-pedestrians-in-astoria>the full implementation of Sammy’s Law and other traffic calming measures</a>. She co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks and to mark danger zones on pavement. She voted to clear abandoned cars from streets. The bills are steps. The deaths keep coming.</p><p>But the city has not lowered the speed limit. The city has not built enough barriers. The city has not made the street safe for the next man at the food truck.</p><h2 id=call-to-action-make-them-hear-you>Call to Action: Make Them Hear You</h2><p>This will not stop until you make it stop. Call Council Member Cabán. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes and daylighting at every corner. Demand action before another brother, another friend, another worker dies. The street belongs to the living.

The event, covered on September 18, 2023, drew over 200 residents and was organized by Western Queens elected officials. The workshop addressed a 'significant increase in traffic-related deaths, including several high-profile fatalities involving cyclists and pedestrians.' Councilwoman Tiffany Cabán, State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, and Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani called the deaths preventable and demanded urgent changes. Cabán stated, 'If it saves lives, it’s worth doing.' DOT officials, including Queens Borough Commissioner Nicole Garcia and senior program manager Kyle Gorman, presented plans for 31st Avenue and collected resident feedback on dangerous driving, lack of protected bike lanes, and unsafe intersections. The DOT pledged to return with a proposal. No formal bill number or committee was cited; the event focused on immediate community engagement and systemic change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

We have to be thinking about traffic-calming measures across all of our intersections ... because quite simply, if it saves lives, it's worth doing."" -- Tiffany Cabán</p><p class=mb3>After the death of 7-year-old Dolma Naadhun at Newtown Road and 45th Street, Council Member Julie Won and Dolma’s father, Tsering Wangdu, called for a traffic light. The Department of Transportation (DOT) declined, offering only daylighting and crosswalk improvements. The matter, highlighted on February 26, 2023, drew support from Council Member Tiffany Caban, State Sen. Mike Gianaris, and Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez Rojas. Caban said, “We have to be bigger and we have to be bolder. We have to be thinking about traffic-calming measures across all of our intersections.” Advocates and officials criticized DOT’s reactive approach and urged proactive, community-driven safety changes. They stressed that only street design and physical infrastructure—not piecemeal fixes—can prevent deaths and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
