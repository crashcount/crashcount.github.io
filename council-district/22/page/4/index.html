A car, driven by someone without a license, jumped the curb and struck her, a 14-year-old, and a man. The girl’s femur snapped. Her head hit the pavement. The driver was charged with reckless endangerment, reckless driving, and driving without a license, according to <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/04/us-news/out-of-control-nyc-driver-hits-two-kids-1-adult-during-evening-rush-leaving-girl-7-with-broken-femur-cops/>police sources</a>.</p><p>In the last year, <strong>District 22 saw 3 deaths, 5 serious injuries, and 636 people hurt</strong>. Two of the dead were children. The numbers do not heal. They do not explain. They only count the bodies.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs caused the most pain:</strong> 3 deaths, 83 moderate injuries, 4 serious injuries. Trucks and buses added more. Motorcycles and mopeds left bodies and blood. Bikes, too, but the toll is smaller. The street is a gauntlet. No one is safe.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Council Member Tiffany Cabán has stood with the grieving. She called for more than band-aids after a child was killed at Newtown Road. “We have to be bigger and we have to be bolder. We have to be thinking about traffic-calming measures across all of our intersections,” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/02/26/dolmas-grieving-father-pols-seek-traffic-light-at-fatal-corner-but-larger-safety-improvements-are-needed>Cabán said</a>.</p><p>Cabán has co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and legalize jaywalking. She voted to end the criminalization of crossing the street, a law that too often blamed the dead. But the pace is slow. Promises pile up. The street stays the same.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day a child risks never coming home.</strong></p><p>Call Council Member Cabán. Demand real change—protected crossings, slower speeds, and streets that put people before cars. Join <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a> and <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a>. Stand with the wounded. Refuse to let the next name be someone you love.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The danger remains, unyielding.</p><p class=mb3>On January 6, 2023, Astoria residents and Council Member Tiffany Cabán renewed demands for safety on 24th Avenue after a cement truck killed Citi Bike rider Tamara Chuchi Kao. The street, a DOT truck route, lacks bike lanes. Kao was the fourth cyclist killed in western Queens in under three years. Former Councilmember Costa Constantinides called the area a 'serious safety risk' and urged the DOT to study improvements and reroute trucks. Cabán called the crash 'devastating' and pressed city agencies for action. DOT spokesman Vin Barone promised immediate steps at the crash site and talks on protected bike lanes. Less than 1.5 percent of streets in Council District 22 have protected bike paths. Residents say the city prioritizes highway access over safety. The city plans to add leading pedestrian intervals at the intersection.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She died alone on the cold street.' The crash data lists no specific driver errors or contributing factors beyond the truck’s right turn. The cyclist was not wearing a helmet, as noted in the report, but this detail appears only after the sequence of impact.
