Over 2,100 injured.</strong> Sixteen left with wounds so deep they are called serious, not just by doctors but by the city itself. These are not numbers. They are lives ended or broken on the streets of Astoria, Ditmars, and Queensbridge.</p><p>Just last month, a cyclist was killed at 37th Street and 34th Avenue. A bus, a truck, and a bike. The cyclist did not walk away.

They left 219 with minor injuries, 91 with moderate, and four with wounds that will not heal. Trucks and buses killed one and hurt dozens more. Motorcycles and mopeds, ten more injuries. Bikes, too, are in the count, but the toll is lower. The street is not safe for anyone who is not behind a windshield.</p><h2 id=leadership-words-votes-and-the-slow-grind>Leadership: Words, Votes, and the Slow Grind</h2><p>Council Member Tiffany Cabán has spoken after tragedy. When a teenage cyclist was killed on 21st Street, she called it &ldquo;wave after wave of grief and heartbreak&rdquo; and demanded safer streets for those on foot and bike. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/04/11/teen-cyclist-killed-by-hit-and-run-driver-in-queens-11th-to-die-this-year>Streetsblog NYC</a>.

She voted to remove abandoned vehicles and to require taxi warning decals. But the pace is slow. The deaths do not wait for committee meetings.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>Every day, the street takes another.</strong> Call Council Member Cabán. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes and daylighted corners. Demand action, not delay. The dead cannot speak.

The proposal, discussed at a heated community board meeting, remains active and is set for installation after summer repaving. Council Member Tiffany Caban, State Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, and Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas endorsed the plan in a letter, stating it would 'protect pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers while making our streets safer and less congested.' DOT spokesman Will Livingston said the design improves safety and supports local businesses. Despite opposition from some business owners, the plan moves forward. Safety analysts note: 'Protected bike lanes are proven to reduce injuries and fatalities for cyclists and pedestrians, encourage mode shift, and improve street equity by reallocating space from cars to vulnerable users.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article states, 'More than 50 delivery workers have had their accounts deactivated by Grubhub in the past two weeks, and they're blaming the company's new owner, Wonder.' Council Member Tiffany Cabán’s 'Secure Jobs Act' is cited as a possible remedy, requiring companies to give reason for termination, even for gig workers. The safety analyst warns: deactivating accounts pushes workers into riskier, informal jobs, increases unsafe cycling, and erodes safety in numbers for vulnerable road users.

Council Members Yusef Salaam, Tiffany Caban, and Lincoln Restler pressed NYPD Director Joshua Levin about stark racial disparities. The matter: 'Council members criticized NYPD leadership over racial disparities in traffic enforcement after the department refused to acknowledge evidence of bias.' Restler called the disparity 'extreme.' Caban said, 'Black and brown people are being beaten up, searched, arrested, 10 times more than white people.' The NYPD claimed disparities stem from policing high-crime areas. Lawmakers rejected this, citing data showing Black and Latinx drivers are disproportionately stopped, searched, and arrested. The hearing referenced the city’s long record of racially biased enforcement, including jaywalking laws once used to target Black and Latinx New Yorkers. Experts, including the NYCLU, say the Adams administration’s surge in traffic stops continues a pattern of racist policing.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
