A car, driven by someone without a license, jumped the curb and struck her, a 14-year-old, and a man. The girl’s femur snapped. Her head hit the pavement. The driver was charged with reckless endangerment, reckless driving, and driving without a license, according to <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/04/04/us-news/out-of-control-nyc-driver-hits-two-kids-1-adult-during-evening-rush-leaving-girl-7-with-broken-femur-cops/>police sources</a>.</p><p>In the last year, <strong>District 22 saw 3 deaths, 5 serious injuries, and 636 people hurt</strong>. Two of the dead were children. The numbers do not heal. They do not explain. They only count the bodies.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs caused the most pain:</strong> 3 deaths, 83 moderate injuries, 4 serious injuries. Trucks and buses added more. Motorcycles and mopeds left bodies and blood. Bikes, too, but the toll is smaller. The street is a gauntlet. No one is safe.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Council Member Tiffany Cabán has stood with the grieving. She called for more than band-aids after a child was killed at Newtown Road. “We have to be bigger and we have to be bolder. We have to be thinking about traffic-calming measures across all of our intersections,” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/02/26/dolmas-grieving-father-pols-seek-traffic-light-at-fatal-corner-but-larger-safety-improvements-are-needed>Cabán said</a>.</p><p>Cabán has co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and legalize jaywalking. She voted to end the criminalization of crossing the street, a law that too often blamed the dead. But the pace is slow. Promises pile up. The street stays the same.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day a child risks never coming home.</strong></p><p>Call Council Member Cabán. Demand real change—protected crossings, slower speeds, and streets that put people before cars. Join <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a> and <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a>. Stand with the wounded. Refuse to let the next name be someone you love.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Data shows Black drivers face more searches and arrests. NYPD blamed crime patterns. Lawmakers called it an excuse. The city’s history of biased policing loomed large.</p><p class=mb3>On April 29, 2025, the City Council held an oversight hearing on NYPD traffic enforcement and racial bias. Council Members Yusef Salaam, Tiffany Caban, and Lincoln Restler pressed NYPD Director Joshua Levin about stark racial disparities. The matter: 'Council members criticized NYPD leadership over racial disparities in traffic enforcement after the department refused to acknowledge evidence of bias.' Restler called the disparity 'extreme.' Caban said, 'Black and brown people are being beaten up, searched, arrested, 10 times more than white people.' The NYPD claimed disparities stem from policing high-crime areas. Lawmakers rejected this, citing data showing Black and Latinx drivers are disproportionately stopped, searched, and arrested. The hearing referenced the city’s long record of racially biased enforcement, including jaywalking laws once used to target Black and Latinx New Yorkers. Experts, including the NYCLU, say the Adams administration’s surge in traffic stops continues a pattern of racist policing.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Ossé (primary sponsor), Crystal Hudson, Lincoln Restler, and Tiffany Cabán back the measure. The cards, handed out by NYPD union members, let friends and relatives skirt penalties for traffic violations. The practice breeds unequal enforcement. A 2024 lawsuit exposed how officers faced pressure to honor these cards, even after a $175,000 city settlement. The bill demands an end to this shadow system.

Lawmakers clashed over driver liability. Advocates withdrew support after amendments weakened pedestrian protections. Speaker Adrienne Adams delayed a vote. The city’s streets remain dangerous. Enforcement falls hardest on people of color. The fight continues.</p><p class=mb3>Bill 2024, aimed at decriminalizing jaywalking, stalled in the City Council on September 12, 2024. The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee had advanced the bill, but Speaker Adrienne Adams held it back from a full vote, citing ongoing debate. The bill’s summary: ending NYPD tickets for crossing outside crosswalks, a practice disproportionately enforced against New Yorkers of color. Councilmember Tiffany Cabán, a sponsor, condemned the law’s discriminatory impact and its failure to reduce traffic violence. After lawmakers amended the bill to shield drivers from liability in pedestrian crashes, advocates like Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives withdrew support, insisting the law should 'clearly protect [pedestrians’] right to safety and security.' The latest version still exposes jaywalkers to civil suits and mandates a city safety education campaign. The bill’s future is uncertain. Advocates demand stronger protections for people on foot.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cabán’s platform promised safer streets and fewer cars. Ariola and others say the tickets show a gap between words and actions.</p><p class=mb3>On August 10, 2024, Councilwoman Joann Ariola (District 32) publicly criticized Councilwoman Tiffany Cabán after media reports revealed Cabán received four school-zone speeding tickets and three other violations since November 2022. The matter, covered by the New York Post, states: 'Cabán—who was elected to office on a platform advocating less car use and cracking down on dangerous driving—received four tickets in the past 13 months for speeding her vehicle in school zones.' Ariola, joined by Councilman Robert Holden, accused Cabán of hypocrisy, highlighting the disconnect between Cabán’s advocacy for street safety and her own driving record. Cabán’s policy platform includes converting 25% of city roadways for people, building 1,000 miles of car-free streets, and expanding bus and bike lanes. No formal council bill or committee action is attached to this event, but the public dispute underscores tensions in the city’s push for safer, less car-dominated streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states the teen was 'unlicensed and bareheaded' when he struck the bus and was ejected from his motorscooter, suffering fatal head injuries. The bus, registered in New Jersey, was traveling west and was struck on its right front bumper. The police report lists the boy as unlicensed and not wearing any safety equipment. Contributing factors are marked as 'Unspecified' in the report. The narrative emphasizes the severity of the impact and the absence of a helmet, but does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor before listing the lack of helmet use. The focus remains on the systemic dangers present when young, unlicensed individuals operate motor vehicles on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
