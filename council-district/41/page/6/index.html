Since 2022, five people have died in crashes here. Thirty-two more suffered serious injuries. The numbers do not tell you about the blood on the asphalt, the sirens at night, the families waiting for news that will break them. In the last year alone, three people were killed and 942 injured. Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians—no one is spared.</p><h2 id=recent-crashes-no-end-in-sight>Recent Crashes: No End in Sight</h2><p>On May 14, a 68-year-old woman was killed crossing with the signal at Rutland Road. The driver was distracted. She died in the crosswalk. On May 10, a 72-year-old man was struck and killed at Sutter Avenue. He was crossing with the light. He did not make it to the other side. The stories repeat. The pain does not fade.</p><h2 id=what-leadership-has-doneand-not-done>What Leadership Has Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Council Member Darlene Mealy has voted for some safety bills. She backed laws to clear abandoned vehicles from streets, to mark pavement, and to make city safety projects more transparent. She co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, aiming to keep sightlines clear. But the pace is slow. The danger remains. The city still allows cars to park close to corners, hiding children from view. The council passes bills. The dead do not return.</p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>A family member <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>described the aftermath</a>: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating. It&rsquo;s affecting everyone in our family, especially (Ruiz&rsquo;s) mom. Maddy was her only daughter.&rdquo; Another relative <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>remembered her kindness</a>: &ldquo;She was a nice and kind girl, always smiling. They went out to take her nephews to eat and play at Dave & Busters.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Mealy. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighting at every corner. Demand action, not delay. Every day without change is another day someone does not come home.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another siren.
