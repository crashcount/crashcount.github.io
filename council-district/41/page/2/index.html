Since 2022, four people were killed in District 41. Most were on foot. Another 3,422 were hurt. The city logged 5,804 crashes in this span, with injuries peaking around the rush into night.</p><blockquote><p>“A driver struck and killed a 47-year-old pedestrian… then left the scene,” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/cops-looking-for-driver-who-fatally-struck-man-on-brooklyn-street/>police said</a>.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“As the fight escalated, he landed on the train tracks and was struck by an oncoming train,” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/30/man-fatally-struck-by-train-after-tumbling-onto-brooklyn-subway-tracks-during-fight/>police said</a>.

The pattern does not blink.</p><h3 id=where-the-bodies-fall>Where the bodies fall</h3><p>At Rutland Road and E. 95th Street, a left-turning sedan hit a 68-year-old woman who was crossing with the signal. She died. The NYPD coded the cause as driver distraction. The car’s front end took her chest. The record is bare and cold. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a> lists it as CrashID 4812813.</p><p>At Sutter Avenue and Osborn Street, two months earlier, a 72-year-old man crossing with the signal was killed at the intersection. Three vehicles are in the file. The sheet does not say who had the light. It does not need to. He is dead. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4811811</a>.</p><p>On Church Avenue in 2022, a 79-year-old woman was struck by an unlicensed van driver while she was getting on or off a vehicle. She never woke up. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4579422</a>.</p><h3 id=turning-cars-heavy-fronts>Turning cars, heavy fronts</h3><p>Pedestrians take the brunt from sedans and SUVs. In this district, sedans account for the largest share of pedestrian harm — at least 263 injured and two killed — with SUVs close behind, including one death. Trucks and buses maim too. The counts come straight from the city’s rollups. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Speed is a knife edge. In one crash on Pitkin Avenue at Strauss Street, a 29-year-old on a motorcycle died. Unsafe speed is written into the file. He was ejected. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4833031</a>.</p><p>The clock matters too. Injuries stack up as day turns to night. From 6 p.m. to 9 p.m., the map goes red: one death at 6 p.m., three at 7 p.m., then heavy injury counts through 9 p.m. That is when families cross for dinner and workers head home. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>District stats</a>.</p><h3 id=corridors-that-keep-breaking-people>Corridors that keep breaking people</h3><p>Ralph Avenue leads the district in injuries. So do Linden Boulevard, Eastern Parkway, East New York Avenue, and E. 98th Street. They are wide. They invite speed. People get hit. See the city’s list of top harm corridors. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>The records also show a hit-and-run at Broadway and Suydam Street just outside the line. A man was dragged more than 50 feet. He died where he fell.

Keep cars 20 feet back at corners so people can see and be seen. A Council bill would scale this up citywide; local members have co-sponsored stronger daylighting and backed clearing derelict cars fast, which block sightlines. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int. 1138-2024</a> (laid over); <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int. 0857-2024</a> (passed).</li><li>Harden left turns at intersections where turning cars killed people, including Rutland Rd at E. 95th St. Use slow-turn treatments and protection so drivers can’t sweep wide. The victims above were crossing with the signal. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashIDs 4812813, 4811811</a>.</li><li>Target evening hours with enforcement and calming on Ralph Ave, Linden Blvd, and East New York Ave. That’s when and where bodies stack up. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>District hourly and corridor data</a>.</li></ul><h3 id=stop-the-repeat-harm>Stop the repeat harm</h3><p>The Council has moved some pieces. It also passed a law to track DOT’s safety work under the streets master plan, so delays are visible. The mayor left it unsigned; it became law. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int. 1105-2024</a>.</p><p>Citywide, two steps would cut deeper:</p><ul><li>Lower the default speed limit on our streets. Slower crashes spare lives. New York now has the power. The question is will, not how. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action</a>.</li><li>Put speed limiters on the worst repeat offenders. Mandate intelligent speed assistance for drivers who rack up violations before they kill again. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action</a>.</li></ul><p>Names become numbers in the files. Four dead in this district since 2022. Evening comes. The light changes. The car turns.

The lane stays for now. Cyclists and pedestrians remain shielded. The fight over safety and street space continues. The city must wait for court.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist reported on June 18, 2025, that Brooklyn Supreme Court Judge Carolyn Walker-Diallo blocked Mayor Adams from removing the protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue. The city must wait until an August hearing before making changes. The ruling follows a lawsuit by Transportation Alternatives, who argued Adams 'abused his discretion' by ordering the lane reverted to its unprotected design. The city had cited community feedback and a viral video of a child struck by an e-bike as reasons for removal. The Department of Transportation installed the protected lane after five pedestrian deaths in 2021 and 2022. Local lawmakers protested the removal, calling the process hasty. The judge’s order keeps the safety improvements in place, pausing the city’s plan to restore curbside parking and expose cyclists to traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The lane calmed a deadly stretch. Drivers still parked illegally. Children darted into traffic. Now, cyclists and pedestrians face more danger. Policy shifts, safety slips. Streets stay lethal.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC reported on June 13, 2025, that Mayor Adams will remove the protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue, a corridor known for high crash rates. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'before this bike lane from 2018 to 2022 this is the area that had the second largest numbers of pedestrian fatalities and crashes in the city.' The lane faced opposition from some Hasidic leaders, citing children running into the lane from illegally parked cars and buses. Despite tweaks—school bus zones, daylighted corners, no standing areas—drivers kept parking illegally, blocking sightlines and endangering children. The city rarely removes protected lanes, but Adams acted after political pressure. Moving the lane to Classon Avenue, as some demand, would force cyclists onto a chaotic BQE ramp. The decision highlights persistent driver violations and policy gaps that leave vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
