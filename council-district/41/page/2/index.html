In the last year, <strong>873 people were injured</strong> and <strong>one person was killed</strong> in crashes. Six suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors. They are elders and children.</p><p>Maurette Lafleur, 68, crossed Rutland Road with the walk signal. A Mercedes turned left and struck her down. She died at the hospital. A witness <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/16/fridays-headlines-east-flatbush-tragedy-edition>described the crash</a>: &ldquo;The lady spin around and sped through.&rdquo; The driver stayed. No charges. The bones broke. The city moved on.</p><p>Larry Maxwell, 72, was heading to a family cookout. A driver fleeing another crash hit him on Sutter Avenue. The driver vanished.

So why is he still at large?&rdquo; The cameras blinked. The street stayed the same.</p><h2 id=who-gets-protected>Who Gets Protected?</h2><p><strong>Most injuries come from cars and SUVs.</strong> In three years, cars and SUVs killed two, trucks killed one, and motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left dozens more hurt. Pedestrians and cyclists take the blows. Drivers walk away.</p><h2 id=what-has-darlene-mealy-done>What Has Darlene Mealy Done?</h2><p>Council Member Darlene Mealy has voted for some safety bills. She backed the law that <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalized jaywalking</a>, ending a policy that blamed the dead for their own deaths. She voted for a <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>citywide greenway plan</a>, and supported <a href=https://nypost.com/2022/05/26/nyc-council-signs-off-on-24-7-speed-enforcement-cameras/>24/7 speed cameras</a>. These are steps. But she also co-sponsored bills that would <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>target e-bike riders</a>, shifting blame to those with the least power. The street stays deadly. The bills pile up. The bodies do too.</p><h2 id=what-next>What Next?</h2><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> Lower the speed limit. Build real protection at crossings. Demand the city use its new power to set 20 mph limits. Call your council member. Call the mayor. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
