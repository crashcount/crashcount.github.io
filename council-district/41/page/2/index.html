Since 2022, five people have died in crashes here. Thirty-two more suffered serious injuries. The numbers do not tell you about the blood on the asphalt, the sirens at night, the families waiting for news that will break them. In the last year alone, three people were killed and 942 injured. Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians—no one is spared.</p><h2 id=recent-crashes-no-end-in-sight>Recent Crashes: No End in Sight</h2><p>On May 14, a 68-year-old woman was killed crossing with the signal at Rutland Road. The driver was distracted. She died in the crosswalk. On May 10, a 72-year-old man was struck and killed at Sutter Avenue. He was crossing with the light. He did not make it to the other side. The stories repeat. The pain does not fade.</p><h2 id=what-leadership-has-doneand-not-done>What Leadership Has Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Council Member Darlene Mealy has voted for some safety bills. She backed laws to clear abandoned vehicles from streets, to mark pavement, and to make city safety projects more transparent. She co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, aiming to keep sightlines clear. But the pace is slow. The danger remains. The city still allows cars to park close to corners, hiding children from view. The council passes bills. The dead do not return.</p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>A family member <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>described the aftermath</a>: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating. It&rsquo;s affecting everyone in our family, especially (Ruiz&rsquo;s) mom. Maddy was her only daughter.&rdquo; Another relative <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>remembered her kindness</a>: &ldquo;She was a nice and kind girl, always smiling. They went out to take her nephews to eat and play at Dave & Busters.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Mealy. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighting at every corner. Demand action, not delay. Every day without change is another day someone does not come home.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another siren.

The move follows complaints from local residents, especially after a viral video showed a child running into the lane from a double-parked car and colliding with an e-bike. Adams stated, 'we listened to community concerns and decided to adjust the current design to better reflect community feedback.' The Department of Transportation will revert the protected lane to its previous unprotected state between Willoughby and Flushing avenues. The article highlights ongoing political battles over street design and notes that double-parking and chaotic traffic remain unaddressed. Deputy Mayor Randy Mastro cited 'lack of action' on e-bike safety as a barrier to safer infrastructure. The decision removes a key safety measure for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan uses 'hardened daylighting'—physical barriers, granite blocks, and planters—to stop cars from parking near corners. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' Nearly half of city traffic deaths happen at intersections, often due to blocked sightlines and turning vehicles. The redesign targets high-crash Brooklyn intersections first, including Ocean Avenue at Church Avenue. The move highlights the city's shift from painted lines to physical infrastructure, aiming to reduce systemic risk for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city holds its breath.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC (2025-06-09) reports the Department of Transportation plans a center-running bus lane on Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn. The project aims to connect neighborhoods and calm traffic. DOT Assistant Director Dustin Khuu said the goal is a 'high performing transit priority street.' The plan includes concrete bus boarding islands and may reduce car lanes, giving more space to pedestrians and buses. However, the article notes gaps: 'DOT didn't share a block-by-block breakdown,' and curbside parking may remain, risking bus lane obstruction by double-parked vehicles. The city may physically protect the lane, but details are pending. The B41 bus, serving 28,000 daily trips, crawls at 4 mph during rush hour. The proposal highlights the need for clear enforcement and design to keep cars out of bus lanes and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
