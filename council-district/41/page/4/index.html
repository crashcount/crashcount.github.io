One man killed on his way to a family cookout. In the last twelve months, District 41 saw 1,395 crashes. 875 people were hurt. Six suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. One never walked again.</p><p>Maurette Lafleur, 68, crossed Rutland Road with the signal. A Mercedes turned left and struck her. She died at the hospital. A witness <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/16/fridays-headlines-east-flatbush-tragedy-edition>described the scene</a>: &ldquo;The lady spin around and sped through.&rdquo; The driver stayed. No charges. The bones broke. The city moved on.</p><p>Larry Maxwell, 72, was crossing Sutter Avenue. A driver fleeing another crash hit him and kept going.

In three years, cars and SUVs killed two. A van killed one. Trucks, motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left dozens more with broken bodies. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. The numbers are steady. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Darlene Mealy has voted for safer streets. She backed the law <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalizing jaywalking</a>, ending a tool used to blame the dead. She voted for <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>greener medians</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>citywide greenways</a>. She supported <a href=https://nypost.com/2022/05/26/nyc-council-signs-off-on-24-7-speed-enforcement-cameras/>24/7 speed cameras</a>. But she also co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>register e-bikes</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>punish repeat bike riders</a>, shifting the burden to those most at risk. The streets remain deadly. The bills pile up. The bodies do too.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call Council Member Mealy. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand that every life counts. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

It called on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to ensure any subway station undergoing enhancement or renovation becomes fully accessible to people with disabilities. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling upon the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to make any subway stations undergoing enhancement or renovation fully accessible to people with disabilities.' Council Member Darlene Mealy sponsored the resolution, joined by Brannan, Menin, Louis, Yeger, Hanif, Hudson, Marte, Joseph, Riley, and Brooks-Powers. The resolution was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. Only 117 out of 493 subway stations are accessible. The Council’s action highlights the city’s failure to guarantee safe, equal passage for all riders. Elevators and upgrades are overdue.
