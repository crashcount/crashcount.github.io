Since 2022, four people were killed in District 41. Most were on foot. Another 3,422 were hurt. The city logged 5,804 crashes in this span, with injuries peaking around the rush into night.</p><blockquote><p>“A driver struck and killed a 47-year-old pedestrian… then left the scene,” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/cops-looking-for-driver-who-fatally-struck-man-on-brooklyn-street/>police said</a>.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“As the fight escalated, he landed on the train tracks and was struck by an oncoming train,” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/30/man-fatally-struck-by-train-after-tumbling-onto-brooklyn-subway-tracks-during-fight/>police said</a>.

The pattern does not blink.</p><h3 id=where-the-bodies-fall>Where the bodies fall</h3><p>At Rutland Road and E. 95th Street, a left-turning sedan hit a 68-year-old woman who was crossing with the signal. She died. The NYPD coded the cause as driver distraction. The car’s front end took her chest. The record is bare and cold. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a> lists it as CrashID 4812813.</p><p>At Sutter Avenue and Osborn Street, two months earlier, a 72-year-old man crossing with the signal was killed at the intersection. Three vehicles are in the file. The sheet does not say who had the light. It does not need to. He is dead. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4811811</a>.</p><p>On Church Avenue in 2022, a 79-year-old woman was struck by an unlicensed van driver while she was getting on or off a vehicle. She never woke up. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4579422</a>.</p><h3 id=turning-cars-heavy-fronts>Turning cars, heavy fronts</h3><p>Pedestrians take the brunt from sedans and SUVs. In this district, sedans account for the largest share of pedestrian harm — at least 263 injured and two killed — with SUVs close behind, including one death. Trucks and buses maim too. The counts come straight from the city’s rollups. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><p>Speed is a knife edge. In one crash on Pitkin Avenue at Strauss Street, a 29-year-old on a motorcycle died. Unsafe speed is written into the file. He was ejected. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4833031</a>.</p><p>The clock matters too. Injuries stack up as day turns to night. From 6 p.m. to 9 p.m., the map goes red: one death at 6 p.m., three at 7 p.m., then heavy injury counts through 9 p.m. That is when families cross for dinner and workers head home. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>District stats</a>.</p><h3 id=corridors-that-keep-breaking-people>Corridors that keep breaking people</h3><p>Ralph Avenue leads the district in injuries. So do Linden Boulevard, Eastern Parkway, East New York Avenue, and E. 98th Street. They are wide. They invite speed. People get hit.

Keep cars 20 feet back at corners so people can see and be seen. A Council bill would scale this up citywide; local members have co-sponsored stronger daylighting and backed clearing derelict cars fast, which block sightlines. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int. 1138-2024</a> (laid over); <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int. 0857-2024</a> (passed).</li><li>Harden left turns at intersections where turning cars killed people, including Rutland Rd at E. 95th St. Use slow-turn treatments and protection so drivers can’t sweep wide. The victims above were crossing with the signal. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashIDs 4812813, 4811811</a>.</li><li>Target evening hours with enforcement and calming on Ralph Ave, Linden Blvd, and East New York Ave. That’s when and where bodies stack up. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>District hourly and corridor data</a>.</li></ul><h3 id=stop-the-repeat-harm>Stop the repeat harm</h3><p>The Council has moved some pieces. It also passed a law to track DOT’s safety work under the streets master plan, so delays are visible. The mayor left it unsigned; it became law. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int. 1105-2024</a>.</p><p>Citywide, two steps would cut deeper:</p><ul><li>Lower the default speed limit on our streets. Slower crashes spare lives. New York now has the power. The question is will, not how. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action</a>.</li><li>Put speed limiters on the worst repeat offenders.

Both men suffered head injuries and severe bleeding but remained conscious at the scene. The report lists 'Traffic Control Disregarded' and 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as contributing factors, highlighting critical driver errors.

Council Member Tiffany Cabán led, joined by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, Restler, Mealy, Louis, and Bottcher. The law bans summonses for jaywalking and orders the Department of Transportation to educate the public on new rights and responsibilities. The mayor returned it unsigned.

The law mandates clear warning decals on all rear passenger doors of taxis and for-hire vehicles. The Taxi and Limousine Commission will provide the signs at no cost. The measure aims to cut down on 'dooring'—a threat to cyclists citywide.
