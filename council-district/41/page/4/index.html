In three years, cars and SUVs killed two. A van killed one. Trucks, motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes left dozens more with broken bodies. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. The numbers are steady. The pain is not.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Darlene Mealy has voted for safer streets. She backed the law <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalizing jaywalking</a>, ending a tool used to blame the dead. She voted for <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>greener medians</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>citywide greenways</a>. She supported <a href=https://nypost.com/2022/05/26/nyc-council-signs-off-on-24-7-speed-enforcement-cameras/>24/7 speed cameras</a>. But she also co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>register e-bikes</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>punish repeat bike riders</a>, shifting the burden to those most at risk. The streets remain deadly. The bills pile up. The bodies do too.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call Council Member Mealy. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected crossings. Demand that every life counts.

The bill came through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, first introduced April 28, 2022. The law's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to a citywide greenway plan.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors including Rivera, Hudson, and others. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor on October 27, 2022. The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law. The measure compels the city to plan and maintain safe routes for non-drivers, with regular public reporting and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
