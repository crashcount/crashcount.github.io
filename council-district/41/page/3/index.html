Since 2022, five people have died in crashes here. Thirty-two more suffered serious injuries. The numbers do not tell you about the blood on the asphalt, the sirens at night, the families waiting for news that will break them. In the last year alone, three people were killed and 942 injured. Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians—no one is spared.</p><h2 id=recent-crashes-no-end-in-sight>Recent Crashes: No End in Sight</h2><p>On May 14, a 68-year-old woman was killed crossing with the signal at Rutland Road. The driver was distracted. She died in the crosswalk. On May 10, a 72-year-old man was struck and killed at Sutter Avenue. He was crossing with the light. He did not make it to the other side. The stories repeat. The pain does not fade.</p><h2 id=what-leadership-has-doneand-not-done>What Leadership Has Done—and Not Done</h2><p>Council Member Darlene Mealy has voted for some safety bills. She backed laws to clear abandoned vehicles from streets, to mark pavement, and to make city safety projects more transparent. She co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, aiming to keep sightlines clear. But the pace is slow. The danger remains. The city still allows cars to park close to corners, hiding children from view. The council passes bills. The dead do not return.</p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>A family member <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>described the aftermath</a>: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating. It&rsquo;s affecting everyone in our family, especially (Ruiz&rsquo;s) mom. Maddy was her only daughter.&rdquo; Another relative <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>remembered her kindness</a>: &ldquo;She was a nice and kind girl, always smiling. They went out to take her nephews to eat and play at Dave & Busters.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Mealy. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighting at every corner. Demand action, not delay. Every day without change is another day someone does not come home.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another siren.

An e-scooter, operated by a 47-year-old woman, was making a left turn when the collision occurred. The report states, 'A bus lunged from its parking spot. The e-scooter turned left. Metal struck flesh.' The woman was ejected from her scooter, sustaining severe lacerations and shock, with injuries to her entire body. The police report explicitly lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor in the crash. The bus's center front end struck the left side doors of the e-scooter. The victim was unlicensed and unshielded, but the report does not cite these as contributing factors. The impact left her torn and shaking beneath a streetlamp, underscoring the consequences of driver inattention in a city street environment.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers. It shifts blame from people on foot to the system and those behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, a westbound motorcycle 'slammed into the front of a turning Audi.' The 38-year-old motorcycle rider, who wore no helmet, suffered a crushed arm. The report describes the moment: 'Metal groaned. Morning broke with the sound of bone and the echo of pain.' The Audi, a 2020 SUV, was making a left turn when the crash occurred. Police data lists the pre-crash actions as 'Going Straight Ahead' for the motorcycle and 'Making Left Turn' for the Audi. Contributing factors are marked as 'Unspecified,' and the report does not cite any specific driver errors. The only victim behavior noted is the absence of a helmet, mentioned after the sequence of driver actions. The crash highlights the persistent dangers at intersections where turning vehicles and through traffic collide.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
