Thirteen left with injuries they will carry for life.</strong> In the last year, District 6 saw 670 crashes, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. These are not just numbers. They are bodies on the street, families waiting for a call that never comes. The dead are old and young—three over 75, one just 55. A 74-year-old man on a bike, struck and killed by a bus on West 70th. An 83-year-old woman, crossing with the light, crushed by an SUV at 58th and Sixth. A 57-year-old man, dead in the crosswalk at 86th and Broadway. The street does not care who you are. It takes what it wants.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>SUVs, trucks, and cars do most of the killing.</strong> In three years, SUVs and cars took five lives and left 81 with moderate injuries. Trucks and buses killed one, injured ten more. Bikes and mopeds hurt people too, but the scale is not the same. The street belongs to the biggest, the heaviest, the fastest. The rest of us cross at our own risk.</p><h2 id=leadership-words-laws-and-silence>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Silence</h2><p>Council Member Gale A. Brewer has signed her name to many bills. She backed laws for more <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>protected bike lanes</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>solar crosswalks</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>banning parking near crosswalks</a>. She voted yes to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths. She called for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/11/23/more-money-for-delivery-workers-will-require-more-protection-for-them/>delivery worker safety</a>, saying, &ldquo;I support increasing the expense rate in the rule by $5 to address these work tools.&rdquo;</p><p>But the street is still a killing field. The city delays. The state delays. The dead do not wait.</p><h2 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay means another family broken.</strong> The NYPD cracks down on e-bikes, but the real danger rolls on four wheels. As cyclist <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/05/30/commissioner-tisch-to-city-council--pass-e-bike-regulations>Renee Baruch described</a>: &ldquo;I was knocked out immediately. I had multiple facial fractures. But more than that, I had a spinal injury.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=act-now-demand-action>Act Now: Demand Action</h2><p><strong>Call Gale Brewer. Call the Mayor. Demand 20 mph speed limits. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand protected lanes, not just for the rich, but for the delivery worker and the child on a bike.</strong></p><p>The dead cannot speak.

They reject criminal summonses for cyclists. They call the policy unjust. They demand safer streets without targeting riders. The boards stand together, refusing to punish immigrant workers for city failures.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC reported on June 6, 2025, that two West Side community boards voted overwhelmingly to oppose the NYPD’s new policy of issuing criminal summonses to cyclists. The boards argue the crackdown will not make streets safer and targets vulnerable workers. Ken Coughlin of CB7 said, “This resolution is simply saying, 'This is not the way.'” Jesse Greenwald of CB4 warned of the risks to immigrant delivery workers, stating, “We know that ICE agents are looking for any opportunity to detain and deport our immigrant workers.” The boards’ votes follow similar action by Midtown’s CB6. The article notes the NYPD has not provided evidence for the claimed surge in complaints that prompted the policy. The move highlights growing concern that enforcement strategies may harm vulnerable road users instead of addressing systemic street safety issues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article highlights the case of Renee Baruch, hospitalized after an e-bike crash left her with facial fractures and a spinal injury. The NYPD’s new Quality of Life Division targets reckless e-bike use, but without updated laws, criminal summonses remain their only tool.

The cyclist, a 55-year-old man, was ejected and suffered a head injury with severe bleeding. According to the police report, 'Unsafe Lane Changing' was a contributing factor in the collision. The pickup truck, registered in New Jersey, was traveling west and going straight ahead, while the cyclist was making a U-turn. The police report also lists 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a factor, but the primary systemic danger cited is unsafe lane changing. No injuries were reported for the truck occupants.
