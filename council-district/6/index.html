Eleven Broken. Still Waiting for Brewer.</h1><p class="byline f6 silver">Written July 8, 2025 <em>(Revised July 10, 2025 – Minor stats refresh)</em></p></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>District 6: Jan 1, 2022 - Jul 8, 2025</h2><h2 id=the-death-count-grows>The Death Count Grows</h2><p><strong>Five dead. Eleven seriously hurt.</strong> That’s just the last twelve months in District 6. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do. A 74-year-old cyclist killed by a bus at West End Avenue. An 83-year-old woman struck dead crossing with the light at Sixth and 58th. Three elders over 75, gone. The street does not care how old you are. It takes what it wants.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-no-one-is-safe>The Pattern: No One Is Safe</h2><p>In the last year, <strong>674 crashes</strong>. <strong>390 injured.</strong> The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross the street. Cars and SUVs did most of the killing—five deaths, eleven serious injuries. Bikes and mopeds hurt dozens more. The city’s own data shows the risk: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>SUVs and cars killed five, bikes seriously injured five, trucks and buses killed one</a>. The sidewalk is not a shield. The crosswalk is not a promise.</p><h2 id=council-member-brewer-action-and-silence>Council Member Brewer: Action and Silence</h2><p>Council Member Gale A. Brewer has stood up for some changes. She <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act</a>, pushed for <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>banning parking near crosswalks</a>, and voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths. She called for delivery app companies to provide safety gear and training, not more punishment for workers. “I am not supportive of criminal penalties,” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/07/eric-adamss-dept-of-sustainable-delivery-isnt-actually-a-department>she said</a>. When federal officials pushed for more cars in Central Park, Brewer was blunt: “No! And no cars are allowed in Central Park!” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/03/sean-duffys-great-america-road-trip-wants-you-to-drive-to-central-park>she said</a>.</p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The bills move slow. The streets stay deadly.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day, another crash. Every week, another family changed forever. The council can lower speed limits, daylight every corner, and build real protection for people on foot and bike. They can act now. Or they can wait for the next siren.</p><p><strong>Call Council Member Brewer. Demand action.</strong> Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand that no more names become numbers. The street will not wait. Neither should you.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The debate, covered by Streetsblog NYC, highlighted Amsterdam’s balanced approach: licensing e-bikes and expanding bike infrastructure. Celestin called the city’s crackdown 'hypocrisy' without safer streets, quoting, 'enforcement can't fix the problems of car-first design.' He opposes enforcement without redesign and supports infrastructure expansion. The safety analyst warns: 'Harsh enforcement against e-bikes without improving street design places undue burden on vulnerable users, discourages mode shift, and fails to address systemic safety issues, potentially reducing overall safety for pedestrians and cyclists.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets stayed dangerous. Cars kept coming.</p><p class=mb3>According to the New York Post (published May 22, 2025), the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) refused to halt Manhattan’s congestion pricing despite a fourth federal deadline. The MTA and state officials dismissed Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy’s threats to withdraw funding as a 'sham,' arguing that the dispute is already in court. Attorney Roberta Kaplan wrote, 'Secretary Duffy did not afford the Project Sponsors any notice or due process before that alleged termination.' The state’s response called the deadlines 'procedurally improper.' The federal government’s push to end the tolls, and the MTA’s resistance, highlight a clash over control of city streets and transit funding. No mention of driver actions, but the policy fight leaves vulnerable road users exposed as the legal battle drags on.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan aims to boost bus speeds by 15% for tens of thousands of daily riders. Private cars and taxis could enter but must turn off at the first legal opportunity. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'After seeing tremendous success on 14th Street where buses have sped up, traffic has virtually disappeared, and far fewer New Yorkers are getting hurt in crashes we are excited to propose a similar design on 34th Street.' The 14th Street busway, launched in 2019, increased bus speeds by up to 24% and reduced crashes. The 34th Street plan seeks similar safety and efficiency gains, with community input shaping the final design.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation aims to allow only buses and trucks, forcing cars to turn off quickly. The M34 bus, used by 28,000 daily riders, currently averages just 3 mph during rush hour. Officials cite the 2019 14th Street busway, which increased bus speeds by 24% and reduced crash injuries. Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'The vast majority of commuters in Midtown are traveling by transit and they deserve world-class, fast, and reliable buses.' The plan includes pedestrian improvements like shorter intersections and brighter crosswalks. The move follows previous controversies over similar projects but reflects a push for safer, more efficient streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brewer (District 6) took a public stance against the NYPD’s surge in criminal summonses for e-bike violations. In her editorial, Brewer wrote, 'Regulation, not criminal summonses, makes sense.' She condemned the 4,000% spike in summonses, highlighting the grave risks these pose to immigrant delivery workers, who face potential deportation for minor traffic infractions. Brewer argued that unsafe riding stems from unrealistic delivery deadlines set by companies like Grubhub and Uber, not from inherent recklessness. She called for regulation targeting delivery app practices and for companies to set realistic delivery times and prioritize safety. Brewer’s position: punish the companies, not the workers.

The crackdown, announced April 28, targets e-bike riders—90 percent of criminal summonses hit them. The NYPD admits the move is based on community complaints, not crash data. Brewer said, 'A civil summons is more appropriate when they are necessary. Car drivers rarely get criminal summonses even when they are deserved.' Mara Davis, speaking for Adams, called the policy 'misguided.' Rep. Dan Goldman warned of harm to immigrants: 'We need to be careful about criminal charges.'

The article quotes Darnell Sealy-McCrorey: 'This epidemic is preventable. It doesn't have to be this way.' Lawmakers show mixed support. Some cite privacy fears or question the seriousness of multiple speeding violations. Jackson Chabot notes, 'A lot of people have understood the bill because of the tragic and fatal crashes recently.'
