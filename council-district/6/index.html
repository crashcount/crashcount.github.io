Eleven Broken. Still Waiting for Brewer.</h1><p class="byline f6 silver">Written July 8, 2025 <em>(Revised July 16, 2025 – Minor stats refresh)</em></p></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>District 6: Jan 1, 2022 - Jul 8, 2025</h2><h2 id=the-death-count-grows>The Death Count Grows</h2><p><strong>Five dead. Eleven seriously hurt.</strong> That’s just the last twelve months in District 6. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do. A 74-year-old cyclist killed by a bus at West End Avenue. An 83-year-old woman struck dead crossing with the light at Sixth and 58th. Three elders over 75, gone. The street does not care how old you are. It takes what it wants.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-no-one-is-safe>The Pattern: No One Is Safe</h2><p>In the last year, <strong>674 crashes</strong>. <strong>390 injured.</strong> The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross the street. Cars and SUVs did most of the killing—five deaths, eleven serious injuries. Bikes and mopeds hurt dozens more. The city’s own data shows the risk: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>SUVs and cars killed five, bikes seriously injured five, trucks and buses killed one</a>. The sidewalk is not a shield. The crosswalk is not a promise.</p><h2 id=council-member-brewer-action-and-silence>Council Member Brewer: Action and Silence</h2><p>Council Member Gale A. Brewer has stood up for some changes. She <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act</a>, pushed for <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>banning parking near crosswalks</a>, and voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths. She called for delivery app companies to provide safety gear and training, not more punishment for workers. “I am not supportive of criminal penalties,” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/07/eric-adamss-dept-of-sustainable-delivery-isnt-actually-a-department>she said</a>. When federal officials pushed for more cars in Central Park, Brewer was blunt: “No! And no cars are allowed in Central Park!” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/03/sean-duffys-great-america-road-trip-wants-you-to-drive-to-central-park>she said</a>.</p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The bills move slow. The streets stay deadly.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day, another crash. Every week, another family changed forever. The council can lower speed limits, daylight every corner, and build real protection for people on foot and bike. They can act now. Or they can wait for the next siren.</p><p><strong>Call Council Member Brewer. Demand action.</strong> Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand that no more names become numbers. The street will not wait. Neither should you.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

According to the article, 'witnesses said the woman stepped onto the tracks shortly before the collision, but then attempted to climb back onto the platform.' She could not escape in time. Police found no suspected criminality. The incident occurred months after a state initiative promised new platform barriers at over 100 stations, but these had not yet been installed at Union Square. The tragedy highlights the ongoing risk to subway riders in stations without protective infrastructure.

The street waits for change.</p><p class=mb3>West Side Spirit reported on June 15, 2025, that the NYC Department of Transportation’s plan to convert 34th Street into a busway drew mixed reactions at a Community Board 6 meeting. The board voted 31-5 in favor. Supporters called current bus speeds 'painfully slow' and urged the city to 'prioritize pedestrians and transit users.' Critics worried about diverted car traffic clogging residential streets, with one resident calling for a 'traffic study' and 'action plan.' The DOT says the busway could boost bus speeds by 15 percent. The proposal would force cars to exit 34th Street quickly or face tickets, echoing rules on 14th Street. The debate highlights the tension between transit improvements and neighborhood traffic concerns.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Residents worry rerouted vehicles will jam local streets and worsen safety. Jessica Lavoie of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association warns, "diverting traffic from this critical corridor onto narrow residential streets would lead to increased congestion, safety hazards, and diminished quality of life." The Department of Transportation aims to replicate the 14th Street busway, which "reduced congestion, sped up bus travel and curbed accidents."

The demonstration, which began at Union Square, challenged new policies issuing criminal summonses for minor cycling offenses. Riders followed traffic laws, highlighting the crackdown’s contradictions. One cyclist, Erin Poland, said the policy 'is not actually protecting cyclists [but] putting them in more danger.' Another, Tara Pham, noted, 'I’ve been hit by vehicles twice... those drivers face no criminal charges.' The article details how police arrested a Citi Bike rider for not moving aside and lacking ID, while drivers who injure vulnerable road users often avoid serious consequences.

Cyclists and advocates argue the penalties are harsher than those faced by drivers for similar actions. As one protester said, “It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.” Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the crackdown, citing the lack of licensing for e-bikes as a challenge for enforcement, but acknowledged the need for legislative reform.
