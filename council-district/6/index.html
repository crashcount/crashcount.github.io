Eleven left with serious injuries.</strong> In the same year, 390 neighbors were hurt in crashes. The dead do not speak. The wounded carry scars the rest of us cannot see.</p><p>Just this spring, an 83-year-old woman was struck and killed by a turning SUV at West 58th and Sixth. She was crossing with the light. She did not make it to the other side. A month later, a 57-year-old man died under the wheels of an SUV on Broadway at 86th. He crossed. He did not make it home. The street does not forgive.</p><h3 id=the-policy-response-promises-and-pressure>The Policy Response: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>Council Member Gale A. Brewer has signed her name to bills that matter. She voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable and left drivers unchecked. She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, which aims to slow cars, protect walkers, and give crash victims more rights. She backed a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, to clear the sightlines where so many die. But the bills sit in committee. The deaths do not wait.</p><p>At a Council hearing, Brewer pressed the NYPD to stop parking on sidewalks. &ldquo;We would love to see less parking of police and private cars, and I won’t even get into placards,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/police-fire/top-nypd-official-cops-park-sidewalks-nowhere-else-to-park/>she said</a>. The answer from the police: there is nowhere else to park. The sidewalks stay blocked. The danger stays.</p><h3 id=the-work-left-to-do>The Work Left to Do</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> In the last three years, they killed five people and injured more than 250 in District 6. Trucks and buses killed one. Bikes injured dozens. The city has the tools to slow the carnage—lower speed limits, redesign streets, enforce the law. The council has the power to demand more. The mayor has the power to act. The people have the power to force their hand.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand action, not delay.</strong> The dead cannot call.

Ben Furans of Transportation Alternatives called it "half-baked and ill-conceived," noting that "bikes and cars sharing the same road would be subject to different speed limits and consequences."

Protesters and advocates argue the policy is discriminatory and escalates minor violations, risking severe consequences for vulnerable workers. Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives called it 'really inappropriate escalation.' The article highlights confusion over traffic rules and the risk of criminalization for actions previously handled as civil matters, raising questions about enforcement priorities and the impact on immigrant communities.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists and advocates argue the penalties are harsher than those faced by drivers for similar actions. As one protester said, “It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.” Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the crackdown, citing the lack of licensing for e-bikes as a challenge for enforcement, but acknowledged the need for legislative reform. The article highlights inconsistent enforcement and the risks faced by vulnerable road users, especially delivery workers.

The pickup truck, registered in New Jersey, was traveling west and going straight ahead, while the cyclist was making a U-turn. The police report also lists 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a factor, but the primary systemic danger cited is unsafe lane changing.

The MTA argues the legality of the tolls and seeks a court injunction, stating, 'congestion pricing is legal and proper.'
