Six people have died on these streets in the last twelve months. Four were over 65. One was a child. 485 people were injured. Thirteen were left with injuries so serious they may never walk the same again. These are not just numbers. They are lives cut short, families broken, futures erased.</p><p>Just this spring, a 74-year-old cyclist was killed at West End Avenue and 70th Street. A 57-year-old man died crossing Broadway at 86th. The city logs the deaths. The street forgets. The families do not.</p><h3 id=the-same-streets-the-same-stories>The Same Streets, The Same Stories</h3><p>The pattern is old. SUVs, sedans, trucks, and bikes all leave bodies behind. In three years, cars and trucks killed or injured 286 people walking in District 6. Bikes injured 56. Motorcycles and mopeds, 20. The city calls them accidents. But the pain is not random. It is built into the street.</p><p>Residents see it. &ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said Nita</a>.

The city moves slow. The cars do not.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-bills-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Bills, and Waiting</h3><p>Council Member Gale A. Brewer has backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks, to force delivery apps to provide safety training, and to demand more protected bike lanes. She has called for higher pay for delivery workers, but also for safer streets to match. She has stood with advocates calling for a lane on the West Side Highway for bikes. But <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>bills sit in committee</a>. Promises pile up. The dead do not wait.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Call Council Member Brewer. Demand action. Demand the city ban parking near crosswalks, build real protected bike lanes, and slow the cars.
