The suit claims, 'the city maintains a policy and practice of detaining, ticketing, and prosecuting cyclists who lawfully ride through an intersection when the pedestrian control signal indicates white/walk.' Esparza received a $190 summons at Third Avenue and East 42nd Street, Manhattan, despite acting within the law. The lawsuit names current and former NYPD commissioners, accusing them of knowingly violating civil rights. The article notes a sharp rise in tickets for cyclists in early 2025.

Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing.

He died at Bellevue Hospital.</p><p class=mb3>NY Daily News reported on May 1, 2025, that an e-bike rider died in Manhattan after being doored by a Mercedes van and then run over by a box truck. The crash happened around 10:10 a.m. on Broome Street near Centre Street. The van driver told the outlet, "I opened the door. I didn’t even see the guy. I only saw the accident." The collision forced the cyclist into the path of a red delivery truck, which then struck him. The 54-year-old truck driver stayed at the scene. Police had not determined if charges would be filed. The article highlights the lethal risk of dooring and the vulnerability of cyclists in mixed traffic. The incident underscores systemic dangers at curbside and the consequences of inattentive door opening.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The program opened three delivery hubs at Amsterdam Avenue at 85th Street, Amsterdam at 73rd Street, and Broadway at 77th Street. According to the DOT, these hubs are part of a three-year pilot under the Curb Management Action Plan. The official matter summary states: 'The DOT unveiled three new microhubs to promote cleaner, greener, last-mile deliveries.' Council Member Gale A. Brewer, representing District 6, applauded the initiative, saying, 'It is incredibly important to have these hubs where we can pull the trucks off the streets and get the delivery via bicycle.' The pilot aims to cut truck congestion, reduce double parking, and shift deliveries to low-emission modes. Delivery giants like Amazon and UPS will use the hubs.
