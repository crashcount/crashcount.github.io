Six people have died on these streets in the last twelve months. Four were over 65. One was a child. 485 people were injured. Thirteen were left with injuries so serious they may never walk the same again. These are not just numbers. They are lives cut short, families broken, futures erased.</p><p>Just this spring, a 74-year-old cyclist was killed at West End Avenue and 70th Street. A 57-year-old man died crossing Broadway at 86th. The city logs the deaths. The street forgets. The families do not.</p><h3 id=the-same-streets-the-same-stories>The Same Streets, The Same Stories</h3><p>The pattern is old. SUVs, sedans, trucks, and bikes all leave bodies behind. In three years, cars and trucks killed or injured 286 people walking in District 6. Bikes injured 56. Motorcycles and mopeds, 20. The city calls them accidents. But the pain is not random. It is built into the street.</p><p>Residents see it. &ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said Nita</a>.

The city moves slow. The cars do not.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-bills-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Bills, and Waiting</h3><p>Council Member Gale A. Brewer has backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks, to force delivery apps to provide safety training, and to demand more protected bike lanes. She has called for higher pay for delivery workers, but also for safer streets to match. She has stood with advocates calling for a lane on the West Side Highway for bikes. But <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>bills sit in committee</a>. Promises pile up. The dead do not wait.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Call Council Member Brewer. Demand action. Demand the city ban parking near crosswalks, build real protected bike lanes, and slow the cars. Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The span breathes easier.</p><p class=mb3>amNY reported on May 13, 2025, that New York City will separate cyclists and pedestrians on the Ed Koch-Queensboro Bridge. Starting May 18, the north outer roadway becomes bike-only, while the south outer roadway, once for vehicles, opens to pedestrians. The article notes, “Advocates have fought to open a separate pedestrian path, citing dangerous overcrowding that has led to conflicts among cyclists, pedestrians and micromobility users.” The bridge was the last city-owned East River crossing without split paths. Manhattan Community Board 6 urged the city to act, pressing DOT to open the path despite construction delays. The change doubles space for non-drivers and removes a vehicle lane, addressing years of systemic risk from forced mixing of vulnerable users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The pursuit ended when the SUV crashed near Dyckman Street and caught fire. The officers 'approached the burning SUV, then drove off without attempting to help the driver or calling an ambulance.' The driver died at the scene, unidentified and burned beyond recognition. The officers failed to report the crash to supervisors and signed off for the day. Both were suspended as the NYPD and Attorney General investigate. The incident follows a recent NYPD policy change that bars pursuits for non-violent crimes. Commissioner Jessica Tisch stated, 'The NYPD's enforcement efforts must never put the public or the police at undue risk.' The case highlights risks of police pursuits and questions about adherence to new policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
