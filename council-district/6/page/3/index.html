Fear lingered.</p><p class=mb3>According to the New York Post (2025-05-19), a carriage horse ran loose through Central Park after its bridle came off and the driver was separated. Eyewitness Hayley said, "I was there with my friend walking on the sidewalk and almost got trampled by the poor horse. It was so terrifying." Parkgoers scrambled for safety, some jumping fences. Cyclists chased the horse, warning others. The horse was not tethered to a hitching post, as none was nearby. Christina Hansen, union rep for carriage horses, stated, "There were no injuries or property damage reported, and there's currently no indication the horse's driver was negligent." The incident highlights gaps in securing procedures and the absence of hitching posts, raising questions about safety for pedestrians and park users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He claims police issue red-light summonses to cyclists who cross intersections with the white pedestrian walk signal, despite a 2019 law permitting this. The article quotes Transportation Alternatives: “That 5-7 second head start can mean the difference between being hit by a turning car and being seen by a turning car.” Esparza says officers ignore the rule, issuing criminal summonses instead of traffic tickets. The suit highlights a gap between city policy and street enforcement, raising questions about NYPD training and the city’s commitment to safe cycling.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brewer (District 6) took a public stance against the NYPD’s surge in criminal summonses for e-bike violations. In her editorial, Brewer wrote, 'Regulation, not criminal summonses, makes sense.' She condemned the 4,000% spike in summonses, highlighting the grave risks these pose to immigrant delivery workers, who face potential deportation for minor traffic infractions. Brewer argued that unsafe riding stems from unrealistic delivery deadlines set by companies like Grubhub and Uber, not from inherent recklessness. She called for regulation targeting delivery app practices and for companies to set realistic delivery times and prioritize safety. Brewer’s position: punish the companies, not the workers.

NYPD acts on vibes, not facts.</p><p class=mb3>On May 14, 2025, Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and Manhattan Council Member Gale Brewer opposed the NYPD’s new policy turning minor cycling infractions into criminal court summonses. The crackdown, announced April 28, targets e-bike riders—90 percent of criminal summonses hit them. The NYPD admits the move is based on community complaints, not crash data. Brewer said, 'A civil summons is more appropriate when they are necessary. Car drivers rarely get criminal summonses even when they are deserved.' Mara Davis, speaking for Adams, called the policy 'misguided.' Rep. Dan Goldman warned of harm to immigrants: 'We need to be careful about criminal charges.' Advocates say the policy increases fear among delivery workers and does not address real road danger. The council calls for education, civil penalties, and action on app companies, not criminalization.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council members and advocates push back. They say the crackdown is not backed by crash data. Delivery workers and immigrants bear the brunt. Calls grow for civil, not criminal, penalties.</p><p class=mb3>On May 14, 2025, the NYPD admitted its e-bike crackdown was driven by community complaints, not data. The policy, announced April 28, 2025, issues criminal—not civil—summonses for minor cycling infractions like running red lights. Ninety percent of these summonses hit e-bike riders, mainly delivery workers and immigrants. Council Member Gale Brewer opposes the move: 'A civil summons is more appropriate.' Mara Davis, for Speaker Adrienne Adams, calls it 'misguided.' Rep. Dan Goldman urges civil fines first, warning of harm to immigrants. The council’s stance: criminalizing minor cycling violations does not protect vulnerable road users. Data shows e-bikes are a minor source of injuries and deaths. Lawmakers demand fair, data-driven enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
