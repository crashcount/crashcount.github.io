Twelve seriously hurt.</strong> In the last year alone, District 6 has seen 434 crashes, 236 injuries, and seven lives lost, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors: a 74-year-old cyclist killed on West End Avenue, a 57-year-old man crushed at Broadway and 86th, an 83-year-old woman struck at 58th and Sixth. The old, the young, the ones just crossing the street. <strong>SUVs killed four. Trucks, buses, bikes, and mopeds took others.</strong></p><h3 id=the-latest-wounds>The Latest Wounds</h3><p>Just months ago, a cyclist was killed in Central Park, another on West End Avenue. A pedestrian died at Broadway and 86th. The pattern is the same: a person steps out, a car or truck or bike does not stop. The street stays open. The blood washes away. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>Council Member Gale A. Brewer has backed some safety bills. She co-sponsored a law to ban parking near crosswalks, aiming to clear sightlines and protect people on foot and bike. The bill would force the city to install daylighting barriers at 1,000 intersections each year, not just 100, as detailed in <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council legislation</a>. But the bill sits in committee, waiting. Brewer has also pushed for delivery app companies to provide safety gear and training, saying, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/14/council-passes-battery-buy-back-program-and-other-bills-to-curb-lithium-ion-fires>&ldquo;My bill will make sure the situation changes.&rdquo;</a> She has spoken against criminal penalties for delivery workers, stating, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/07/eric-adamss-dept-of-sustainable-delivery-isnt-actually-a-department>&ldquo;I am not supportive of criminal penalties.&rdquo;</a></p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The city delays. The council debates. The streets do not forgive.</p><h3 id=what-next-the-work-is-not-done>What Next? The Work Is Not Done</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a failure. Call Council Member Brewer. Demand the council pass the daylighting bill. Demand real protected bike lanes, not just promises. Demand that delivery workers get the protection they need. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p><p><strong>Contact your leaders. Demand action. Lives depend on it.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The editorial, titled "With politicians fearful of the TWU, a public referendum is the answer," criticizes the City Council’s failure to act on a bill that would replace horses with electric carriages. Schulman highlights that only 18 of 51 council members sponsor the bill, despite strong public support and past campaign promises. She names Justin Brennan, Gale Brewer, Julie Menin, and herself among those who have not advanced the legislation. Schulman blames union influence for the council’s inaction, citing 115 accidents and 27 horse deaths over decades. She calls for a citizen ballot initiative to bypass political gridlock and protect both horses and the public from ongoing street danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brewer emphasized, 'I don't hear people calling me up, saying, I need a charging station for my electric car.' Advocates Jackson Chabot and Samir Lavingia argued that curbside EV chargers for cars would 'lock in' car use and block future bike lanes or outdoor dining. Eric McClure of StreetsPAC warned against re-privatizing the curb for car owners. Both Chabot and Lavingia backed Council Member Justin Brannan's bill to require EV-ready parking in garages. Despite city plans, no e-bike charging stations have been installed yet.

The contract was approved under Mayor Adams and Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, while Verra was under Department of Investigation monitorship. Manhattan Councilwoman Gale A. Brewer questioned the decision, stating, 'It is bewildering how you end up with a $1.3 million settlement... and then you get a new contract for more than $300 million.'

The Independent Budget Office found $1.02 billion in unpaid traffic fines from 2017 to 2022, including camera tickets for speeding and red lights. The matter, titled 'Ticket to slide: NYC owed more than $1 billion in unpaid parking, speeding fines, report finds,' highlights growing debt as enforcement lags. Adams, along with Comptroller Brad Lander, criticized further city agency budget cuts, urging the city to collect owed fines instead. The report notes that while 24/7 school-zone speed cameras have reduced speeding, the city has failed to stop drivers from evading cameras with defaced or fake plates—letting dangerous drivers escape accountability. The city’s inaction leaves vulnerable pedestrians and cyclists at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brewer stated, 'We don’t do a good job of collecting this money. We have to do a better job.' The Independent Budget Office found over $1 billion in uncollected parking and red light camera fines, with the backlog rising as the city increases automated enforcement.

The Council also moved bills from Oswald Feliz, Gale Brewer, Alexa Avilés, and Robert Holden. These measures ban uncertified batteries, require fireproof charging containers, mandate public education, and order FDNY reporting on battery fires. Speaker Adrienne Adams clarified the bills target commercial sellers, not workers. Shahana Hanif urged that policy must "keep workers" at the center. The Council and delivery workers’ union stressed that tech companies, not workers, should bear costs. The FDNY opposed the reporting bill over resource concerns. The legislation aims to curb battery fires while protecting delivery workers who depend on e-bikes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The woman suffered facial injuries and was in shock. The e-scooter driver, a 40-year-old man, was cited for 'Driver Inattention/Distraction.' The taxi was parked and not involved in the impact.

The proposal, still in early stages, aims to let delivery workers exchange unsafe batteries for certified, inspected ones. The matter summary states: 'Advocates and experts are calling for a trade-in program that would allow delivery workers to exchange faulty, damaged or second-hand batteries for safe, certified ones.' Brewer said, 'I definitely think it's a good idea.' Melinda Hanson, founder of Brightside, warned that bans only punish workers and fail to solve the root danger. Gustavo Ajche of Los Deliveristas Unidos stressed the need for education on safe disposal. The program would target the source of deadly fires, offering a path to safety without criminalizing vulnerable workers.

Restler declared, 'This isn't just a quality of life issue — it's about climate justice. 1 helicopter idling is the equivalent of 40 cars!' Council Member Gale Brewer and State Senator Brad Hoylman joined calls for action. Despite advocacy and testimony from residents, significant policy changes have not passed.
