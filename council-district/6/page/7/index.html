Thirteen left with injuries they will carry for life.</strong> In the last year, District 6 saw 670 crashes, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. These are not just numbers. They are bodies on the street, families waiting for a call that never comes. The dead are old and young—three over 75, one just 55. A 74-year-old man on a bike, struck and killed by a bus on West 70th. An 83-year-old woman, crossing with the light, crushed by an SUV at 58th and Sixth. A 57-year-old man, dead in the crosswalk at 86th and Broadway. The street does not care who you are. It takes what it wants.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>SUVs, trucks, and cars do most of the killing.</strong> In three years, SUVs and cars took five lives and left 81 with moderate injuries. Trucks and buses killed one, injured ten more. Bikes and mopeds hurt people too, but the scale is not the same. The street belongs to the biggest, the heaviest, the fastest. The rest of us cross at our own risk.</p><h2 id=leadership-words-laws-and-silence>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Silence</h2><p>Council Member Gale A. Brewer has signed her name to many bills. She backed laws for more <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>protected bike lanes</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>solar crosswalks</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>banning parking near crosswalks</a>. She voted yes to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths. She called for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/11/23/more-money-for-delivery-workers-will-require-more-protection-for-them/>delivery worker safety</a>, saying, &ldquo;I support increasing the expense rate in the rule by $5 to address these work tools.&rdquo;</p><p>But the street is still a killing field. The city delays. The state delays. The dead do not wait.</p><h2 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay means another family broken.</strong> The NYPD cracks down on e-bikes, but the real danger rolls on four wheels. As cyclist <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/05/30/commissioner-tisch-to-city-council--pass-e-bike-regulations>Renee Baruch described</a>: &ldquo;I was knocked out immediately. I had multiple facial fractures. But more than that, I had a spinal injury.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=act-now-demand-action>Act Now: Demand Action</h2><p><strong>Call Gale Brewer. Call the Mayor. Demand 20 mph speed limits. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand protected lanes, not just for the rich, but for the delivery worker and the child on a bike.</strong></p><p>The dead cannot speak. You can. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Delivery workers’ safety and livelihoods hung in the balance. Lawmakers targeted sellers, not riders. The bills aimed to stop deadly fires without punishing those who rely on e-bikes to survive.</p><p class=mb3>On March 2, 2023, the New York City Council advanced a package of lithium-ion battery safety bills. Council Member Keith Powers introduced the buy-back bill, which creates a citywide program for defective or uncertified batteries. Powers said, "We don't want to penalize businesses and workers without thinking about this strategically." The Council also moved bills from Oswald Feliz, Gale Brewer, Alexa Avilés, and Robert Holden. These measures ban uncertified batteries, require fireproof charging containers, mandate public education, and order FDNY reporting on battery fires. Speaker Adrienne Adams clarified the bills target commercial sellers, not workers. Shahana Hanif urged that policy must "keep workers" at the center. The Council and delivery workers’ union stressed that tech companies, not workers, should bear costs. The FDNY opposed the reporting bill over resource concerns. The legislation aims to curb battery fires while protecting delivery workers who depend on e-bikes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The woman suffered facial injuries and was in shock. The e-scooter driver, a 40-year-old man, was cited for 'Driver Inattention/Distraction.' The taxi was parked and not involved in the impact. The report notes the pedestrian was not wearing a helmet, but this is mentioned only after the driver’s inattention.

The proposal, still in early stages, aims to let delivery workers exchange unsafe batteries for certified, inspected ones. The matter summary states: 'Advocates and experts are calling for a trade-in program that would allow delivery workers to exchange faulty, damaged or second-hand batteries for safe, certified ones.' Brewer said, 'I definitely think it's a good idea.' Melinda Hanson, founder of Brightside, warned that bans only punish workers and fail to solve the root danger. Gustavo Ajche of Los Deliveristas Unidos stressed the need for education on safe disposal. The program would target the source of deadly fires, offering a path to safety without criminalizing vulnerable workers.
