Eleven left with serious injuries.</strong> In the same year, 390 neighbors were hurt in crashes. The dead do not speak. The wounded carry scars the rest of us cannot see.</p><p>Just this spring, an 83-year-old woman was struck and killed by a turning SUV at West 58th and Sixth. She was crossing with the light. She did not make it to the other side. A month later, a 57-year-old man died under the wheels of an SUV on Broadway at 86th. He crossed. He did not make it home. The street does not forgive.</p><h3 id=the-policy-response-promises-and-pressure>The Policy Response: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>Council Member Gale A. Brewer has signed her name to bills that matter. She voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable and left drivers unchecked. She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, which aims to slow cars, protect walkers, and give crash victims more rights. She backed a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, to clear the sightlines where so many die. But the bills sit in committee. The deaths do not wait.</p><p>At a Council hearing, Brewer pressed the NYPD to stop parking on sidewalks. &ldquo;We would love to see less parking of police and private cars, and I won’t even get into placards,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/police-fire/top-nypd-official-cops-park-sidewalks-nowhere-else-to-park/>she said</a>. The answer from the police: there is nowhere else to park. The sidewalks stay blocked. The danger stays.</p><h3 id=the-work-left-to-do>The Work Left to Do</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> In the last three years, they killed five people and injured more than 250 in District 6. Trucks and buses killed one. Bikes injured dozens. The city has the tools to slow the carnage—lower speed limits, redesign streets, enforce the law. The council has the power to demand more. The mayor has the power to act. The people have the power to force their hand.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand action, not delay.</strong> The dead cannot call.

Council Member Keith Powers introduced the buy-back bill, which creates a citywide program for defective or uncertified batteries. Powers said, "We don't want to penalize businesses and workers without thinking about this strategically." The Council also moved bills from Oswald Feliz, Gale Brewer, Alexa Avilés, and Robert Holden. These measures ban uncertified batteries, require fireproof charging containers, mandate public education, and order FDNY reporting on battery fires. Speaker Adrienne Adams clarified the bills target commercial sellers, not workers. Shahana Hanif urged that policy must "keep workers" at the center. The Council and delivery workers’ union stressed that tech companies, not workers, should bear costs. The FDNY opposed the reporting bill over resource concerns. The legislation aims to curb battery fires while protecting delivery workers who depend on e-bikes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The official summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to conducting a study of the impact that truck and delivery traffic generated by last mile facilities have on local communities and infrastructure.' The bill required the Department of Transportation to report on delivery vehicle volumes, parking, congestion, collisions, and pedestrian injuries near these hubs. It called for identifying the most affected streets and estimating the costs and possible fixes.

The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection projects a 35% jump in deliveries by 2025, raising safety concerns. The report summary states, 'the number of deliveries made per hour will increase, leading to more delivery workers on city streets.' Hildalyn Colón Hernández of Los Deliveristas/Workers Justice Project and Council Member Gale Brewer both called for more protected bike lanes, higher expense rates, and better charging infrastructure. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives said, 'Workers have the right to a safe workplace: for our city's delivery workers, this means a network of safe, protected bike lanes that help prevent crashes.' Advocates insist a wage hike alone is not enough.
