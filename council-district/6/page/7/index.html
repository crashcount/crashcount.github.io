Thirteen left with injuries they will carry for life.</strong> In the last year, District 6 saw 670 crashes, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. These are not just numbers. They are bodies on the street, families waiting for a call that never comes. The dead are old and young—three over 75, one just 55. A 74-year-old man on a bike, struck and killed by a bus on West 70th. An 83-year-old woman, crossing with the light, crushed by an SUV at 58th and Sixth. A 57-year-old man, dead in the crosswalk at 86th and Broadway. The street does not care who you are. It takes what it wants.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>SUVs, trucks, and cars do most of the killing.</strong> In three years, SUVs and cars took five lives and left 81 with moderate injuries. Trucks and buses killed one, injured ten more. Bikes and mopeds hurt people too, but the scale is not the same. The street belongs to the biggest, the heaviest, the fastest. The rest of us cross at our own risk.</p><h2 id=leadership-words-laws-and-silence>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Silence</h2><p>Council Member Gale A. Brewer has signed her name to many bills. She backed laws for more <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>protected bike lanes</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>solar crosswalks</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>banning parking near crosswalks</a>. She voted yes to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths. She called for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/11/23/more-money-for-delivery-workers-will-require-more-protection-for-them/>delivery worker safety</a>, saying, &ldquo;I support increasing the expense rate in the rule by $5 to address these work tools.&rdquo;</p><p>But the street is still a killing field. The city delays. The state delays. The dead do not wait.</p><h2 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay means another family broken.</strong> The NYPD cracks down on e-bikes, but the real danger rolls on four wheels. As cyclist <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/05/30/commissioner-tisch-to-city-council--pass-e-bike-regulations>Renee Baruch described</a>: &ldquo;I was knocked out immediately. I had multiple facial fractures. But more than that, I had a spinal injury.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=act-now-demand-action>Act Now: Demand Action</h2><p><strong>Call Gale Brewer. Call the Mayor. Demand 20 mph speed limits. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand protected lanes, not just for the rich, but for the delivery worker and the child on a bike.</strong></p><p>The dead cannot speak.

In a letter to NYCHA CEO Greg Russ, Avilés urged targeted battery safety rules instead of a broad ban, warning, 'NYCHA's all-out ban could hurt workers and residents more.' She offered eight recommendations, including federal study, safe battery storage, and clear rules for mobility devices. Bronx Council Member Oswald Feliz announced plans for legislation requiring certified batteries, while Manhattan’s Gale Brewer is drafting a ban on second-hand batteries and pushing for delivery app accountability. The matter is under review after the comment period closed September 6. NYCHA declined to comment. Avilés’s stance centers on protecting delivery workers and vulnerable residents while addressing real fire risks from faulty batteries.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, not yet numbered, is in early stages. Brewer’s proposal would ban second-hand or refurbished batteries, boost Fire Department outreach, and require delivery apps like Uber and DoorDash to pay for safer batteries. The matter summary warns that a blanket ban 'would worsen the city’s homelessness crisis by forcing residents to choose between a roof over their head and a job, and still not solve the problem of lithium-ion batteries catching fire.' Council Member Alexa Avilés called for a citywide approach. Tenant leader Cynthia Tibbs and Hildalyn Colón Hernández of Los Deliveristas/Workers Justice Project also oppose the ban, urging secure charging hubs. Senator Chuck Schumer highlighted federal funding for safer infrastructure. The public can comment on the NYCHA policy until September 6.

The matter summary reads: 'creating an office of sustainable delivery systems and requiring large generator of truck traffic buildings to produce and implement a delivery and servicing plan.' Council Member Gale A. Brewer sponsored the bill, joined by Rivera, Gutiérrez, Restler, Won, Sanchez, and Cabán. The bill called for on-site loading, delivery reservations, and off-peak scheduling to cut truck traffic and street loading. It would have created a new city office to oversee compliance and penalize violators. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023.

The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to hazardous obstruction by vehicles and civilian complaints to the department of transportation for hazardous obstruction violations,' aimed to create a new civil penalty for vehicles blocking bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or hydrants within 1,320 feet of a school. The penalty: $175 per violation, enforced through the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings. Civilians, except city employees, could file complaints and receive 25% of collected fines. The Department of Transportation would support this with a phased-in reporting program and annual public reports. Council Member Carlina Rivera led as primary sponsor, joined by over two dozen co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law.

The law requires weekly checks of at least 25 blocks for placard abuse and illegal parking, plus monthly reports to city officials. Brewer’s letter to Commissioner Keechant Sewell stated, "The Department has not been in compliance with this law, and I respectfully ask the Department to treat illegal parking and placard abuse with the level of urgency it deserves." Brewer dismissed NYPD’s pandemic excuses, insisting, "If it's a law, you got to follow it." She warned that placard abuse endangers road users, clogs streets, and erodes trust. The NYPD has not responded. The Department of Investigation confirmed the NYPD’s failure to meet legal requirements. Brewer’s push highlights the city’s ongoing struggle to protect streets from lawless parking and official neglect.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
