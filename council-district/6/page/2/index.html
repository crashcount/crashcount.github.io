Eleven seriously hurt.</strong> That’s just the last twelve months in District 6. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do. A 74-year-old cyclist killed by a bus at West End Avenue. An 83-year-old woman struck dead crossing with the light at Sixth and 58th. Three elders over 75, gone. The street does not care how old you are. It takes what it wants.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-no-one-is-safe>The Pattern: No One Is Safe</h2><p>In the last year, <strong>674 crashes</strong>. <strong>390 injured.</strong> The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross the street. Cars and SUVs did most of the killing—five deaths, eleven serious injuries. Bikes and mopeds hurt dozens more. The city’s own data shows the risk: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>SUVs and cars killed five, bikes seriously injured five, trucks and buses killed one</a>. The sidewalk is not a shield. The crosswalk is not a promise.</p><h2 id=council-member-brewer-action-and-silence>Council Member Brewer: Action and Silence</h2><p>Council Member Gale A. Brewer has stood up for some changes. She <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act</a>, pushed for <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>banning parking near crosswalks</a>, and voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths. She called for delivery app companies to provide safety gear and training, not more punishment for workers. “I am not supportive of criminal penalties,” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/07/eric-adamss-dept-of-sustainable-delivery-isnt-actually-a-department>she said</a>. When federal officials pushed for more cars in Central Park, Brewer was blunt: “No! And no cars are allowed in Central Park!” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/03/sean-duffys-great-america-road-trip-wants-you-to-drive-to-central-park>she said</a>.</p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The bills move slow. The streets stay deadly.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day, another crash. Every week, another family changed forever. The council can lower speed limits, daylight every corner, and build real protection for people on foot and bike. They can act now. Or they can wait for the next siren.</p><p><strong>Call Council Member Brewer. Demand action.</strong> Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand that no more names become numbers. The street will not wait. Neither should you.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The MTA argues the legality of the tolls and seeks a court injunction, stating, 'congestion pricing is legal and proper.' The system, operational since January 2025, has reduced daily vehicle entries into Manhattan’s core by 76,000 in April and raised $159 million in the first quarter.
