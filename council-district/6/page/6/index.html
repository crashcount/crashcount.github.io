Thirteen left with injuries they will carry for life.</strong> In the last year, District 6 saw 670 crashes, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. These are not just numbers. They are bodies on the street, families waiting for a call that never comes. The dead are old and young—three over 75, one just 55. A 74-year-old man on a bike, struck and killed by a bus on West 70th. An 83-year-old woman, crossing with the light, crushed by an SUV at 58th and Sixth. A 57-year-old man, dead in the crosswalk at 86th and Broadway. The street does not care who you are. It takes what it wants.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>SUVs, trucks, and cars do most of the killing.</strong> In three years, SUVs and cars took five lives and left 81 with moderate injuries. Trucks and buses killed one, injured ten more. Bikes and mopeds hurt people too, but the scale is not the same. The street belongs to the biggest, the heaviest, the fastest. The rest of us cross at our own risk.</p><h2 id=leadership-words-laws-and-silence>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Silence</h2><p>Council Member Gale A. Brewer has signed her name to many bills. She backed laws for more <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>protected bike lanes</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>solar crosswalks</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>banning parking near crosswalks</a>. She voted yes to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths. She called for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/11/23/more-money-for-delivery-workers-will-require-more-protection-for-them/>delivery worker safety</a>, saying, &ldquo;I support increasing the expense rate in the rule by $5 to address these work tools.&rdquo;</p><p>But the street is still a killing field. The city delays. The state delays. The dead do not wait.</p><h2 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay means another family broken.</strong> The NYPD cracks down on e-bikes, but the real danger rolls on four wheels. As cyclist <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/05/30/commissioner-tisch-to-city-council--pass-e-bike-regulations>Renee Baruch described</a>: &ldquo;I was knocked out immediately. I had multiple facial fractures. But more than that, I had a spinal injury.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=act-now-demand-action>Act Now: Demand Action</h2><p><strong>Call Gale Brewer. Call the Mayor. Demand 20 mph speed limits. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand protected lanes, not just for the rich, but for the delivery worker and the child on a bike.</strong></p><p>The dead cannot speak. You can. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The policy, not a council bill but a mayoral action, follows months of warnings and public debate. Mayor Adams said, "Tourists and New Yorkers alike deserve to walk across it and enjoy its beauty without being packed together like sardines or risking their safety." The Department of Transportation cited overcrowding and safety risks on the Brooklyn Bridge, where daily pedestrian numbers have doubled since 2021. Vendors and advocates, including Mohamed Attia of the Street Vendor Project, condemned the ban for stripping workers—many disabled or veterans—of income with no safety net. Upper West Side Council Member Gale Brewer proposed a compromise bill to allow regulated vending on wider bridge sections, but the administration pushed ahead with a total ban. The city claims the measure will protect pedestrians, but offers no new space or support for displaced vendors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, not yet passed, would require every e-bike in New York City to be registered with the Department of Transportation. Brewer stated, “I do not believe a blanket e-bike registration rule will make streets safer, nor is NYC DOT equipped to establish, manage or enforce it.” She instead sponsors Intro. 1168, mandating safe lithium-ion batteries for delivery workers, and Intro. 1163, requiring worker training and identification. Thirty-one organizations endorsed Brewer’s approach, calling Holden’s bill “ineffective, dangerous, expensive, short-sighted, and bureaucratically complicated.” Council Members Rita Joseph and Sandy Nurse also withdrew support. Opponents argue the registration bill could suppress e-bike use, increase police stops in communities of color, and worsen traffic violence.

Brewer also called for the Department of Transportation to update its safety course. Powers said, "We will provide them the opportunity to surrender that unsafe equipment and receive a safe replacement." The Council's action follows 180 battery fire incidents, 14 deaths, and over 100 injuries this year. Lawmakers push for delivery companies to take responsibility for worker safety and equipment standards.

The bill sought to amend the city code by 'increasing civil penalties for operating a bicycle, bicycle with electric assist, or electric scooter on the sidewalk.' The measure would have raised fines up to $510 for endangering others, with double penalties for repeat violations and extra penalties for physical contact. Council Member Gale A. Brewer sponsored the bill, joined by Gennaro, Lee, Brannan, Yeger, Kagan, Vernikov, and Ariola. The bill was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law. No safety analyst assessed its impact on vulnerable road users. The bill focused on sidewalk riding, but left the core danger—cars on city streets—untouched.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report notes neither wore helmets. The sedan’s left front bumper and the motorscooter’s right side took the impact.

The city misses the real threat.</p><p class=mb3>On July 14, 2023, NYPD officers from Brooklyn’s 78th Precinct seized illegal mopeds from delivery workers outside fast-food chains. The enforcement action follows years of crackdowns dating back to Mayor Bloomberg, ramped up under Mayor de Blasio. Police say the seizures make streets safer, but city crash data show cars and trucks—not e-bikes or mopeds—cause most pedestrian injuries. Delivery worker Roziev Akmal warned, 'Livelihoods will be ruined because of the seizure.' Ligia Guallpa of the Worker’s Justice Project called it 'another example where you see deliveristas being economically impacted.' State Sen. Brad Hoylman and Council Member Gale Brewer cited constituent complaints, but advocates and legal experts argue enforcement targets workers, not the root causes. The crackdown leaves low-paid, mostly immigrant workers exposed to fines, lost income, and road danger, while app companies escape responsibility.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The editorial, titled "With politicians fearful of the TWU, a public referendum is the answer," criticizes the City Council’s failure to act on a bill that would replace horses with electric carriages. Schulman highlights that only 18 of 51 council members sponsor the bill, despite strong public support and past campaign promises. She names Justin Brennan, Gale Brewer, Julie Menin, and herself among those who have not advanced the legislation. Schulman blames union influence for the council’s inaction, citing 115 accidents and 27 horse deaths over decades. She calls for a citizen ballot initiative to bypass political gridlock and protect both horses and the public from ongoing street danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
