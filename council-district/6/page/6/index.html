Twelve seriously hurt.</strong> In the last year alone, District 6 has seen 434 crashes, 236 injuries, and seven lives lost, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors: a 74-year-old cyclist killed on West End Avenue, a 57-year-old man crushed at Broadway and 86th, an 83-year-old woman struck at 58th and Sixth. The old, the young, the ones just crossing the street. <strong>SUVs killed four. Trucks, buses, bikes, and mopeds took others.</strong></p><h3 id=the-latest-wounds>The Latest Wounds</h3><p>Just months ago, a cyclist was killed in Central Park, another on West End Avenue. A pedestrian died at Broadway and 86th. The pattern is the same: a person steps out, a car or truck or bike does not stop. The street stays open. The blood washes away. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>Council Member Gale A. Brewer has backed some safety bills. She co-sponsored a law to ban parking near crosswalks, aiming to clear sightlines and protect people on foot and bike. The bill would force the city to install daylighting barriers at 1,000 intersections each year, not just 100, as detailed in <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council legislation</a>. But the bill sits in committee, waiting. Brewer has also pushed for delivery app companies to provide safety gear and training, saying, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/09/14/council-passes-battery-buy-back-program-and-other-bills-to-curb-lithium-ion-fires>&ldquo;My bill will make sure the situation changes.&rdquo;</a> She has spoken against criminal penalties for delivery workers, stating, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/07/eric-adamss-dept-of-sustainable-delivery-isnt-actually-a-department>&ldquo;I am not supportive of criminal penalties.&rdquo;</a></p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The city delays. The council debates. The streets do not forgive.</p><h3 id=what-next-the-work-is-not-done>What Next? The Work Is Not Done</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a failure. Call Council Member Brewer. Demand the council pass the daylighting bill. Demand real protected bike lanes, not just promises. Demand that delivery workers get the protection they need. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p><p><strong>Contact your leaders. Demand action. Lives depend on it.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The DOT failed to meet 2023’s legal benchmarks: just 5.2 miles of protected bus lanes built out of 30 required, and 32 miles of protected bike lanes out of 50 mandated by 2019 law. Council Member Chi Ossé (District 36) was mentioned, but only six of 51 council members responded to DOT’s call for safety project suggestions. The matter centers on the DOT’s report and council inaction: 'Out of 51 City Council members, only six responded to a request from DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez for recommended locations where street safety improvements should be made in their districts.' Mayor Adams slashed DOT’s budget and weakened projects, while council leaders deflected responsibility. Advocates like Jon Orcutt and Elizabeth Adams demanded decisive action, warning that delays and excuses cost lives. More than half of New Yorkers remain far from protected bike lanes as daily cycling surges. The city’s vulnerable road users remain at risk while officials pass the buck.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The legislation, heard in committee and passed on this date, increases penalties for businesses selling uncertified e-bikes and scooters with dangerous lithium-ion batteries. Brewer said, 'We are not only going after the batteries, we are going after the stores that are selling the batteries.' The FDNY will now assist the Department of Consumer and Worker Protections in enforcement. Fines for repeat violators can reach $2,000. Brewer’s second bill requires e-bike sellers to post safety information in stores and online, with fines up to $350. Councilmember Julie Menin sponsored additional reforms easing street vendor regulations and banning vending in bike lanes. The bills respond to a deadly spike in battery fires—18 killed in 2023, triple the previous year.

Vendors, many disabled or veterans, say the ban guts their livelihoods overnight.</p><p class=mb3>On January 2, 2024, City Hall announced a blanket ban on street vendors from city bridges, effective January 3. The policy, not a council bill but a mayoral action, follows months of warnings and public debate. Mayor Adams said, "Tourists and New Yorkers alike deserve to walk across it and enjoy its beauty without being packed together like sardines or risking their safety." The Department of Transportation cited overcrowding and safety risks on the Brooklyn Bridge, where daily pedestrian numbers have doubled since 2021. Vendors and advocates, including Mohamed Attia of the Street Vendor Project, condemned the ban for stripping workers—many disabled or veterans—of income with no safety net. Upper West Side Council Member Gale Brewer proposed a compromise bill to allow regulated vending on wider bridge sections, but the administration pushed ahead with a total ban. The city claims the measure will protect pedestrians, but offers no new space or support for displaced vendors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Chuck Schumer and Mayor Adams, would convert old newsstands at W. 72nd Street and Broadway into rest stops with bike parking, seating, and charging stations. Community Board 7 voted against the plan, citing safety and congestion fears. Katina Ellison of the West 71st Street Block Association called the idea 'clearly terrible and dangerous.' CB 7’s Andrew Albert, also on the MTA board, supports charging stations but wants a different site. Ken Coughlin of CB 7 called the opposition hypocritical, noting the neighborhood’s reliance on delivery workers. Council Member Gale Brewer supports smaller, less invasive infrastructure. The Parks Department plans to proceed, but no timeline is set. Vulnerable road users—delivery workers—remain exposed, with no safe place to rest or recharge.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, debated in committee, would permit vendors only on bridge walkways at least 16 feet wide and require 20 feet between each seller. Bridge approaches would remain off-limits. Brewer stated, 'I believe strongly that a full ban on vendors is not necessary,' and argued for clear, enforceable rules. The Department of Transportation had proposed a total ban on vending across all city-owned bridges, citing overcrowding. Brewer’s bill seeks a middle ground, allowing limited vending while addressing safety and crowding. Vendor advocates welcomed relief from a total ban but warned the spacing rule would be hard to enforce. The bill’s fate remains undecided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, not yet passed, would require every e-bike in New York City to be registered with the Department of Transportation. Brewer stated, “I do not believe a blanket e-bike registration rule will make streets safer, nor is NYC DOT equipped to establish, manage or enforce it.” She instead sponsors Intro. 1168, mandating safe lithium-ion batteries for delivery workers, and Intro. 1163, requiring worker training and identification. Thirty-one organizations endorsed Brewer’s approach, calling Holden’s bill “ineffective, dangerous, expensive, short-sighted, and bureaucratically complicated.” Council Members Rita Joseph and Sandy Nurse also withdrew support. Opponents argue the registration bill could suppress e-bike use, increase police stops in communities of color, and worsen traffic violence. Holden dismissed these concerns, insisting his bill is vital for safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brewer</p><p class=mb3>On September 14, 2023, the New York City Council passed a package of bills to fight lithium-ion battery fires. The main bill, introduced by Council Member Keith Powers, creates a city-funded buy-back program for delivery workers to exchange faulty batteries and devices for safe, certified ones. The matter summary states the program aims to address the high cost of certified batteries, which can be prohibitive for low-paid workers. Council Members Oswald Feliz and Gale Brewer sponsored additional bills: Feliz's requires safe bikes and batteries for deliveries, while Brewer's mandates delivery apps provide safety training and equipment. Brewer also called for the Department of Transportation to update its safety course. Powers said, "We will provide them the opportunity to surrender that unsafe equipment and receive a safe replacement." The Council's action follows 180 battery fire incidents, 14 deaths, and over 100 injuries this year. Lawmakers push for delivery companies to take responsibility for worker safety and equipment standards. Enforcement against uncertified battery sales will begin soon.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The enforcement action follows years of crackdowns dating back to Mayor Bloomberg, ramped up under Mayor de Blasio. Police say the seizures make streets safer, but city crash data show cars and trucks—not e-bikes or mopeds—cause most pedestrian injuries. Delivery worker Roziev Akmal warned, 'Livelihoods will be ruined because of the seizure.' Ligia Guallpa of the Worker’s Justice Project called it 'another example where you see deliveristas being economically impacted.' State Sen. Brad Hoylman and Council Member Gale Brewer cited constituent complaints, but advocates and legal experts argue enforcement targets workers, not the root causes. The crackdown leaves low-paid, mostly immigrant workers exposed to fines, lost income, and road danger, while app companies escape responsibility.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
