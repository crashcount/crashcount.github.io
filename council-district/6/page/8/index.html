Eleven seriously hurt.</strong> That’s just the last twelve months in District 6. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do. A 74-year-old cyclist killed by a bus at West End Avenue. An 83-year-old woman struck dead crossing with the light at Sixth and 58th. Three elders over 75, gone. The street does not care how old you are. It takes what it wants.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-no-one-is-safe>The Pattern: No One Is Safe</h2><p>In the last year, <strong>674 crashes</strong>. <strong>390 injured.</strong> The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross the street. Cars and SUVs did most of the killing—five deaths, eleven serious injuries. Bikes and mopeds hurt dozens more. The city’s own data shows the risk: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>SUVs and cars killed five, bikes seriously injured five, trucks and buses killed one</a>. The sidewalk is not a shield. The crosswalk is not a promise.</p><h2 id=council-member-brewer-action-and-silence>Council Member Brewer: Action and Silence</h2><p>Council Member Gale A. Brewer has stood up for some changes. She <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act</a>, pushed for <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>banning parking near crosswalks</a>, and voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths. She called for delivery app companies to provide safety gear and training, not more punishment for workers. “I am not supportive of criminal penalties,” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/07/eric-adamss-dept-of-sustainable-delivery-isnt-actually-a-department>she said</a>. When federal officials pushed for more cars in Central Park, Brewer was blunt: “No! And no cars are allowed in Central Park!” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/03/sean-duffys-great-america-road-trip-wants-you-to-drive-to-central-park>she said</a>.</p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The bills move slow. The streets stay deadly.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day, another crash. Every week, another family changed forever. The council can lower speed limits, daylight every corner, and build real protection for people on foot and bike. They can act now. Or they can wait for the next siren.</p><p><strong>Call Council Member Brewer. Demand action.</strong> Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand that no more names become numbers. The street will not wait. Neither should you.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Brewer vows investigation.</p><p class=mb3>On October 5, 2022, Council Member Gale Brewer, chair of the Council's oversight committee, announced plans to investigate the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) street safety claims. Brewer questioned DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez’s assertion that 750 of 1,000 intersections were redesigned, citing public data showing fewer than 400. Brewer said, “I love the idea of using her committee's investigatory power to explore whether the Adams administration has indeed redesigned 750 of the promised 1,000 intersections... or whether it done fewer than that, as the agency's own public data shows.” She confirmed her intent to use committee investigators and hold an oversight hearing. The matter, titled “City Council oversight inquiry into DOT street safety implementation and data transparency,” highlights DOT’s lack of documentation and reliance on signal retiming over physical improvements. Advocates and Brewer demand full transparency and real progress. Road deaths remain high, and the city lags on legal mandates for bus and bike lanes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

In a letter to NYCHA CEO Greg Russ, Avilés urged targeted battery safety rules instead of a broad ban, warning, 'NYCHA's all-out ban could hurt workers and residents more.' She offered eight recommendations, including federal study, safe battery storage, and clear rules for mobility devices. Bronx Council Member Oswald Feliz announced plans for legislation requiring certified batteries, while Manhattan’s Gale Brewer is drafting a ban on second-hand batteries and pushing for delivery app accountability. The matter is under review after the comment period closed September 6. NYCHA declined to comment. Avilés’s stance centers on protecting delivery workers and vulnerable residents while addressing real fire risks from faulty batteries.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, not yet numbered, is in early stages. Brewer’s proposal would ban second-hand or refurbished batteries, boost Fire Department outreach, and require delivery apps like Uber and DoorDash to pay for safer batteries. The matter summary warns that a blanket ban 'would worsen the city’s homelessness crisis by forcing residents to choose between a roof over their head and a job, and still not solve the problem of lithium-ion batteries catching fire.' Council Member Alexa Avilés called for a citywide approach. Tenant leader Cynthia Tibbs and Hildalyn Colón Hernández of Los Deliveristas/Workers Justice Project also oppose the ban, urging secure charging hubs. Senator Chuck Schumer highlighted federal funding for safer infrastructure. The public can comment on the NYCHA policy until September 6.
