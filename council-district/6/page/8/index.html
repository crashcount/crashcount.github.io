Six people have died on these streets in the last twelve months. Four were over 65. One was a child. 485 people were injured. Thirteen were left with injuries so serious they may never walk the same again. These are not just numbers. They are lives cut short, families broken, futures erased.</p><p>Just this spring, a 74-year-old cyclist was killed at West End Avenue and 70th Street. A 57-year-old man died crossing Broadway at 86th. The city logs the deaths. The street forgets. The families do not.</p><h3 id=the-same-streets-the-same-stories>The Same Streets, The Same Stories</h3><p>The pattern is old. SUVs, sedans, trucks, and bikes all leave bodies behind. In three years, cars and trucks killed or injured 286 people walking in District 6. Bikes injured 56. Motorcycles and mopeds, 20. The city calls them accidents. But the pain is not random. It is built into the street.</p><p>Residents see it. &ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs.

Brewer has backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks, to force delivery apps to provide safety training, and to demand more protected bike lanes. She has called for higher pay for delivery workers, but also for safer streets to match. She has stood with advocates calling for a lane on the West Side Highway for bikes. But <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>bills sit in committee</a>. Promises pile up. The dead do not wait.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Call Council Member Brewer. Demand action. Demand the city ban parking near crosswalks, build real protected bike lanes, and slow the cars.

The matter, requested by Councilwoman Gale A. Brewer (District 6), revealed that 'delinquents owe New York City a staggering $2.1 billion in bills racked up since 2017 for parking, traffic, safety code, and property-related violations.' Brewer stated, 'We don’t do a good job of collecting this money. We have to do a better job.' The Independent Budget Office found over $1 billion in uncollected parking and red light camera fines, with the backlog rising as the city increases automated enforcement. The unpaid fines represent a systemic failure to hold dangerous drivers accountable, leaving pedestrians and cyclists at risk. The discussion underscores the urgent need for action to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Councilmember Gale Brewer also pressed the NYPD, calling for fewer police and private cars parked illegally. Transit advocates and the public questioned why officers do not use public transit. The Adams administration claims it will crack down on illegal parking, but past actions suggest otherwise.

Council Member Keith Powers introduced the buy-back bill, which creates a citywide program for defective or uncertified batteries. Powers said, "We don't want to penalize businesses and workers without thinking about this strategically." The Council also moved bills from Oswald Feliz, Gale Brewer, Alexa Avilés, and Robert Holden. These measures ban uncertified batteries, require fireproof charging containers, mandate public education, and order FDNY reporting on battery fires. Speaker Adrienne Adams clarified the bills target commercial sellers, not workers. Shahana Hanif urged that policy must "keep workers" at the center. The Council and delivery workers’ union stressed that tech companies, not workers, should bear costs. The FDNY opposed the reporting bill over resource concerns. The legislation aims to curb battery fires while protecting delivery workers who depend on e-bikes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal, still in early stages, aims to let delivery workers exchange unsafe batteries for certified, inspected ones. The matter summary states: 'Advocates and experts are calling for a trade-in program that would allow delivery workers to exchange faulty, damaged or second-hand batteries for safe, certified ones.' Brewer said, 'I definitely think it's a good idea.' Melinda Hanson, founder of Brightside, warned that bans only punish workers and fail to solve the root danger. Gustavo Ajche of Los Deliveristas Unidos stressed the need for education on safe disposal. The program would target the source of deadly fires, offering a path to safety without criminalizing vulnerable workers.

The bill, discussed in oversight hearings, remains stalled. The matter summary states: 'Noise complaints from helicopters over New York City have soared in recent years, but lawmakers at city, state, and federal levels have failed to significantly reduce non-essential helicopter flights.' Restler declared, 'This isn't just a quality of life issue — it's about climate justice. 1 helicopter idling is the equivalent of 40 cars!' Council Member Gale Brewer and State Senator Brad Hoylman joined calls for action. Despite advocacy and testimony from residents, significant policy changes have not passed. The Federal Aviation Administration’s authority blocks local control. Helicopter noise and pollution continue to harm New Yorkers, especially in vulnerable neighborhoods.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives said, 'Workers have the right to a safe workplace: for our city's delivery workers, this means a network of safe, protected bike lanes that help prevent crashes.'

The matter, titled “City Council oversight inquiry into DOT street safety implementation and data transparency,” highlights DOT’s lack of documentation and reliance on signal retiming over physical improvements.
