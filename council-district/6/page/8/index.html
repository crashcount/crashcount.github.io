Eleven Broken. Still Waiting for Brewer.</h1><p class="byline f6 silver">Written July 8, 2025 <em>(Revised July 10, 2025 – Minor stats refresh)</em></p></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>District 6: Jan 1, 2022 - Jul 8, 2025</h2><h2 id=the-death-count-grows>The Death Count Grows</h2><p><strong>Five dead. Eleven seriously hurt.</strong> That’s just the last twelve months in District 6. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do. A 74-year-old cyclist killed by a bus at West End Avenue. An 83-year-old woman struck dead crossing with the light at Sixth and 58th. Three elders over 75, gone. The street does not care how old you are. It takes what it wants.</p><h2 id=the-pattern-no-one-is-safe>The Pattern: No One Is Safe</h2><p>In the last year, <strong>674 crashes</strong>. <strong>390 injured.</strong> The old, the young, the ones just trying to cross the street. Cars and SUVs did most of the killing—five deaths, eleven serious injuries. Bikes and mopeds hurt dozens more. The city’s own data shows the risk: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>SUVs and cars killed five, bikes seriously injured five, trucks and buses killed one</a>. The sidewalk is not a shield. The crosswalk is not a promise.</p><h2 id=council-member-brewer-action-and-silence>Council Member Brewer: Action and Silence</h2><p>Council Member Gale A. Brewer has stood up for some changes. She <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act</a>, pushed for <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>banning parking near crosswalks</a>, and voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths. She called for delivery app companies to provide safety gear and training, not more punishment for workers. “I am not supportive of criminal penalties,” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/07/eric-adamss-dept-of-sustainable-delivery-isnt-actually-a-department>she said</a>. When federal officials pushed for more cars in Central Park, Brewer was blunt: “No! And no cars are allowed in Central Park!” <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/03/sean-duffys-great-america-road-trip-wants-you-to-drive-to-central-park>she said</a>.</p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The bills move slow. The streets stay deadly.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day, another crash. Every week, another family changed forever. The council can lower speed limits, daylight every corner, and build real protection for people on foot and bike. They can act now. Or they can wait for the next siren.</p><p><strong>Call Council Member Brewer. Demand action.</strong> Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand that no more names become numbers. The street will not wait. Neither should you.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Brewer questioned DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez’s assertion that 750 of 1,000 intersections were redesigned, citing public data showing fewer than 400. Brewer said, “I love the idea of using her committee's investigatory power to explore whether the Adams administration has indeed redesigned 750 of the promised 1,000 intersections... or whether it done fewer than that, as the agency's own public data shows.” She confirmed her intent to use committee investigators and hold an oversight hearing. The matter, titled “City Council oversight inquiry into DOT street safety implementation and data transparency,” highlights DOT’s lack of documentation and reliance on signal retiming over physical improvements. Advocates and Brewer demand full transparency and real progress.

Council Member Alexa Avilés called for a citywide approach. Tenant leader Cynthia Tibbs and Hildalyn Colón Hernández of Los Deliveristas/Workers Justice Project also oppose the ban, urging secure charging hubs.

State senators, assembly members, and council members signed a letter urging the same. Levine and supporters argue the new lane would ease crowding and give e-bike delivery workers—many of them immigrants—a safe, legal route. The state DOT has resisted, citing car congestion. Advocates say more space for cyclists is overdue.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, hosted by State Senator Liz Krueger, featured DOT Manhattan Borough Commissioner Ed Pincar, who said, “We are looking very closely… we may be able to present a proposal maybe even later this year.” The redesign aims to transform Third Avenue into a safer boulevard with fewer car lanes, more bus lanes, a separated bike path, and wider sidewalks. Council Member Gale Brewer and advocates like Paul Krikler have long demanded these changes. Krueger and the NYPD, however, focused on enforcement against cyclists and e-bike riders, citing constituent concerns. Krueger has previously pushed for harsher penalties for electric-vehicle riders. NYPD data shows more enforcement against cyclists than drivers, even though drivers cause most injuries. No formal safety analysis was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The cyclist was not wearing a helmet, as noted in the report, but this is mentioned only after the primary driver error.

Advocates like Cecilia Ellis and Jolyse Race joined, stressing that bus delays hurt low-income and older New Yorkers most.
