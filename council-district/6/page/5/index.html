Six people have died on these streets in the last twelve months. Four were over 65. One was a child. 485 people were injured. Thirteen were left with injuries so serious they may never walk the same again. These are not just numbers. They are lives cut short, families broken, futures erased.</p><p>Just this spring, a 74-year-old cyclist was killed at West End Avenue and 70th Street. A 57-year-old man died crossing Broadway at 86th. The city logs the deaths. The street forgets. The families do not.</p><h3 id=the-same-streets-the-same-stories>The Same Streets, The Same Stories</h3><p>The pattern is old. SUVs, sedans, trucks, and bikes all leave bodies behind. In three years, cars and trucks killed or injured 286 people walking in District 6. Bikes injured 56. Motorcycles and mopeds, 20. The city calls them accidents. But the pain is not random. It is built into the street.</p><p>Residents see it. &ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs.

Brewer has backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks, to force delivery apps to provide safety training, and to demand more protected bike lanes. She has called for higher pay for delivery workers, but also for safer streets to match. She has stood with advocates calling for a lane on the West Side Highway for bikes. But <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>bills sit in committee</a>. Promises pile up. The dead do not wait.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Call Council Member Brewer. Demand action. Demand the city ban parking near crosswalks, build real protected bike lanes, and slow the cars.

The Committee on Consumer Affairs advanced the bills, with Council Member Gale Brewer introducing both. The laws allow FDNY to close retailers who breach Local Law 39 three times in three years. The official matter summary states: 'The city can now forcibly close repeat offender shops that sell illegal lithium-ion batteries and micromobility devices.' Department of Consumer and Worker Protection Commissioner Vera Mayuga called the issue urgent. Baruch Herzfeld, CEO of Pop Wheels, backed the law but urged more incentives for certified batteries and safe charging. While fires have dropped since last year, uncertified batteries still pose danger. The city has inspected over 650 shops and issued 275 violations, but online sales remain a loophole.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brewer, speaking at an E-Vehicle Safety Alliance town hall, said, "I will sign on to that bill. That's not an issue." She attributes her change to the existence of state bills and constituent pressure, but refuses to back Council Member Bob Holden's city bill. Julie Menin also endorsed strict registration and park bans. Critics, including advocacy groups, warn these measures will hit low-wage, immigrant delivery workers hardest and undermine efforts to reduce car use. Data shows pedestrian injuries from e-bikes remain flat, while cars cause most harm.

The bus lane aims to speed up slow, crowded crosstown rides.</p><p class=mb3>On October 1, 2024, construction began on a dedicated bus lane along 96th Street in Manhattan. The project, not tied to a specific bill number, is led by the Department of Transportation and replaces a traffic lane in each direction between West End Avenue and 2nd Avenue. The matter aims to 'speed up crosstown buses like the M96 and M106.' Council Member Gale A. Brewer, representing District 6, has sided with residents opposing the change, though she did not comment for the record. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez claims the new lane will make commutes 'faster, more reliable, and safer for everyone.' The bus lane will operate 24/7, except for a short eastbound stretch. DOT notes that 74% of 96th Street residents do not own cars, and most commute by transit, bike, or foot. No formal safety analyst assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, titled 'DOT begins construction of new bus lanes along Manhattan’s 96th Street,' aims to improve service for 15,500 weekday riders. Councilmember Gale A. Brewer, representing District 6, held a rally earlier in the month expressing concerns about lost curb space and pushed for alternative solutions. Brewer sent a letter to DOT on behalf of residents, stating, 'All I can say is that I did what I did to represent them.' DOT officials countered that the redesign will reduce congestion and retain curb access. The project includes dedicated bus lanes, left-turn bays, and treatments to slow drivers. Most residents in the area rely on transit, walking, or cycling.

The matter, described as a 'City Council member public statement/rally regarding bus lane project,' saw Brewer call on DOT to remove two blocks from the crosstown bus lane plan, citing the area's 'residential character' and questioning the need due to 'current bus speeds.' Brewer, who once backed bus lanes on 14th, 34th, and 181st Streets, now argued for alternatives and said, 'I'm a bus rider who takes this bus every day. It's not slow.' DOT countered that parking would be preserved and loading zones added. Transit advocates criticized Brewer for ignoring data on slow westbound buses and the needs of 15,000 daily riders. Council Member Shaun Abreu, who represents the district, did not attend and stated he does not oppose the bus lane. No formal safety analyst assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brewer, who previously supported bus lanes elsewhere, told the crowd, 'There are concerns that we have. I think that you have to look at alternatives to making the bus go faster.' The matter, titled by Gothamist as 'Yet another NYC bus lane plan faces big fight, this time from angry Upper West Siders,' highlights tension between transit improvements and local access.

Metal met muscle. A cyclist’s leg split, blood pooling in the street. The driver never looked. The cyclist, helmeted and conscious, bore the wound. Distraction behind the wheel left flesh torn.</p><p class=mb3>A cyclist traveling east on West 68th Street in Manhattan collided with the left-side door of a parked sedan, according to the police report. The incident occurred at 19:48 and resulted in severe lacerations to the cyclist’s knee and lower leg. The report states, 'A sedan door flung open. Steel caught his leg. Flesh tore. Blood pooled on the asphalt. He wore a helmet. He stayed conscious. The driver hadn’t looked.' The police report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the contributing factor for the crash. The sedan’s driver opened the door without checking for oncoming traffic, causing the impact. The cyclist was wearing a helmet, as noted in the report, but the primary cause cited is the driver’s failure to pay attention before opening the door.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
