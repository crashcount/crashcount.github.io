Six people have died on these streets in the last twelve months. Four were over 65. One was a child. 485 people were injured. Thirteen were left with injuries so serious they may never walk the same again. These are not just numbers. They are lives cut short, families broken, futures erased.</p><p>Just this spring, a 74-year-old cyclist was killed at West End Avenue and 70th Street. A 57-year-old man died crossing Broadway at 86th. The city logs the deaths. The street forgets. The families do not.</p><h3 id=the-same-streets-the-same-stories>The Same Streets, The Same Stories</h3><p>The pattern is old. SUVs, sedans, trucks, and bikes all leave bodies behind. In three years, cars and trucks killed or injured 286 people walking in District 6. Bikes injured 56. Motorcycles and mopeds, 20. The city calls them accidents. But the pain is not random. It is built into the street.</p><p>Residents see it. &ldquo;No one stops at these stop signs. We see people go through these red lights all the time,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/washington-heights-hit-and-run-bicyclist-struck/>said Nita</a>.

The city moves slow. The cars do not.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-bills-and-waiting>Leadership: Words, Bills, and Waiting</h3><p>Council Member Gale A. Brewer has backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks, to force delivery apps to provide safety training, and to demand more protected bike lanes. She has called for higher pay for delivery workers, but also for safer streets to match. She has stood with advocates calling for a lane on the West Side Highway for bikes. But <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>bills sit in committee</a>. Promises pile up. The dead do not wait.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Call Council Member Brewer. Demand action. Demand the city ban parking near crosswalks, build real protected bike lanes, and slow the cars.

The victim suffered severe bleeding from the head but remained conscious at the scene. The cyclist sustained a contusion and upper arm injury but was wearing a helmet. The report notes the pedestrian stepped into the street against the light, but the primary driver errors cited are the cyclist's unsafe speed and unlicensed operation.

The Committee on Consumer Affairs advanced the bills, with Council Member Gale Brewer introducing both. The laws allow FDNY to close retailers who breach Local Law 39 three times in three years. The official matter summary states: 'The city can now forcibly close repeat offender shops that sell illegal lithium-ion batteries and micromobility devices.' Department of Consumer and Worker Protection Commissioner Vera Mayuga called the issue urgent. Baruch Herzfeld, CEO of Pop Wheels, backed the law but urged more incentives for certified batteries and safe charging. While fires have dropped since last year, uncertified batteries still pose danger. The city has inspected over 650 shops and issued 275 violations, but online sales remain a loophole.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brewer, speaking at an E-Vehicle Safety Alliance town hall, said, "I will sign on to that bill. That's not an issue." She attributes her change to the existence of state bills and constituent pressure, but refuses to back Council Member Bob Holden's city bill. Julie Menin also endorsed strict registration and park bans. Critics, including advocacy groups, warn these measures will hit low-wage, immigrant delivery workers hardest and undermine efforts to reduce car use. Data shows pedestrian injuries from e-bikes remain flat, while cars cause most harm.

Both 'contributing factor' fields are marked 'Unspecified,' but the sequence described highlights the systemic danger of left-turning vehicles crossing paths with cyclists traveling straight. The cyclist’s helmet use is noted in the police data, but no victim actions are listed as contributing factors.

DOT aims to speed up slow buses for 15,000 daily riders. Locals cite residential concerns. Debate pits transit needs against curb access. No clear resolution.</p><p class=mb3>On September 5, 2024, Council Member Shaun Abreu of District 7 joined Upper West Side residents in questioning the Department of Transportation's plan for a 24/7 offset bus lane on 96th Street. The DOT proposal, intended to speed up the M96 bus for 15,000 daily riders, would repurpose a travel lane in each direction while preserving curb parking. Abreu stated, "I wouldn’t say I’m opposed or in favor at this point," but called for more clarity and adjustments from DOT. The matter, described as a push to 'torpedo planned bus lane on 96th Street,' has drawn support from East Side's Community Board 8 and opposition from West Side locals and Council Member Gale Brewer, who suggested alternatives like bus signal priority. The debate centers on balancing transit improvements with residential curb access. No formal committee action or safety analysis has been reported.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states, 'An e-scooter struck a 93-year-old woman crossing with the light. She stayed conscious. Blood pooled near her head. The scooter’s front end crumpled. The rider did not yield.' The primary contributing factor listed is 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way.' The pedestrian suffered a head injury with severe bleeding but remained conscious at the scene. The data makes clear that the e-scooter operator failed to yield to a pedestrian lawfully crossing, resulting in a violent collision. The report notes the pedestrian was crossing with the signal, but only after citing the driver’s failure to yield as the cause. The focus remains on the driver’s actions and the systemic risk posed to vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
