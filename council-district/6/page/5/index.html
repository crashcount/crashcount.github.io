The bill aims to keep crosswalks clear, improve visibility, and protect people on foot and bike. No more hiding behind parked cars.

The Committee on Consumer Affairs advanced the bills, with Council Member Gale Brewer introducing both. The laws allow FDNY to close retailers who breach Local Law 39 three times in three years. The official matter summary states: 'The city can now forcibly close repeat offender shops that sell illegal lithium-ion batteries and micromobility devices.' Department of Consumer and Worker Protection Commissioner Vera Mayuga called the issue urgent. Baruch Herzfeld, CEO of Pop Wheels, backed the law but urged more incentives for certified batteries and safe charging. While fires have dropped since last year, uncertified batteries still pose danger. The city has inspected over 650 shops and issued 275 violations, but online sales remain a loophole.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brewer, speaking at an E-Vehicle Safety Alliance town hall, said, "I will sign on to that bill. That's not an issue." She attributes her change to the existence of state bills and constituent pressure, but refuses to back Council Member Bob Holden's city bill. Julie Menin also endorsed strict registration and park bans. Critics, including advocacy groups, warn these measures will hit low-wage, immigrant delivery workers hardest and undermine efforts to reduce car use. Data shows pedestrian injuries from e-bikes remain flat, while cars cause most harm.

The project, not tied to a specific bill number, is led by the Department of Transportation and replaces a traffic lane in each direction between West End Avenue and 2nd Avenue. The matter aims to 'speed up crosstown buses like the M96 and M106.' Council Member Gale A. Brewer, representing District 6, has sided with residents opposing the change, though she did not comment for the record. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez claims the new lane will make commutes 'faster, more reliable, and safer for everyone.' The bus lane will operate 24/7, except for a short eastbound stretch. DOT notes that 74% of 96th Street residents do not own cars, and most commute by transit, bike, or foot.

Work finishes later this year.</p><p class=mb3>On September 30, 2024, the Department of Transportation began construction of new bus lanes along Manhattan’s 96th Street, a project stretching from West End to Second Avenue. The matter, titled 'DOT begins construction of new bus lanes along Manhattan’s 96th Street,' aims to improve service for 15,500 weekday riders. Councilmember Gale A. Brewer, representing District 6, held a rally earlier in the month expressing concerns about lost curb space and pushed for alternative solutions. Brewer sent a letter to DOT on behalf of residents, stating, 'All I can say is that I did what I did to represent them.' DOT officials countered that the redesign will reduce congestion and retain curb access. The project includes dedicated bus lanes, left-turn bays, and treatments to slow drivers. Most residents in the area rely on transit, walking, or cycling. The city expects the redesign to make commutes faster and safer for all road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brewer, who once backed bus lanes on 14th, 34th, and 181st Streets, now argued for alternatives and said, 'I'm a bus rider who takes this bus every day. It's not slow.' DOT countered that parking would be preserved and loading zones added. Transit advocates criticized Brewer for ignoring data on slow westbound buses and the needs of 15,000 daily riders.

The matter, described as a push to 'torpedo planned bus lane on 96th Street,' has drawn support from East Side's Community Board 8 and opposition from West Side locals and Council Member Gale Brewer, who suggested alternatives like bus signal priority.
