Thirteen left with injuries they will carry for life.</strong> In the last year, District 6 saw 670 crashes, according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>. These are not just numbers. They are bodies on the street, families waiting for a call that never comes. The dead are old and young—three over 75, one just 55. A 74-year-old man on a bike, struck and killed by a bus on West 70th. An 83-year-old woman, crossing with the light, crushed by an SUV at 58th and Sixth. A 57-year-old man, dead in the crosswalk at 86th and Broadway. The street does not care who you are. It takes what it wants.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p><strong>SUVs, trucks, and cars do most of the killing.</strong> In three years, SUVs and cars took five lives and left 81 with moderate injuries. Trucks and buses killed one, injured ten more. Bikes and mopeds hurt people too, but the scale is not the same. The street belongs to the biggest, the heaviest, the fastest. The rest of us cross at our own risk.</p><h2 id=leadership-words-laws-and-silence>Leadership: Words, Laws, and Silence</h2><p>Council Member Gale A. Brewer has signed her name to many bills. She backed laws for more <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>protected bike lanes</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>solar crosswalks</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>banning parking near crosswalks</a>. She voted yes to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths. She called for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/11/23/more-money-for-delivery-workers-will-require-more-protection-for-them/>delivery worker safety</a>, saying, &ldquo;I support increasing the expense rate in the rule by $5 to address these work tools.&rdquo;</p><p>But the street is still a killing field. The city delays. The state delays. The dead do not wait.</p><h2 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay means another family broken.</strong> The NYPD cracks down on e-bikes, but the real danger rolls on four wheels. As cyclist <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/05/30/commissioner-tisch-to-city-council--pass-e-bike-regulations>Renee Baruch described</a>: &ldquo;I was knocked out immediately. I had multiple facial fractures. But more than that, I had a spinal injury.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=act-now-demand-action>Act Now: Demand Action</h2><p><strong>Call Gale Brewer. Call the Mayor. Demand 20 mph speed limits. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand protected lanes, not just for the rich, but for the delivery worker and the child on a bike.</strong></p><p>The dead cannot speak. You can. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The DOT failed to meet 2023’s legal benchmarks: just 5.2 miles of protected bus lanes built out of 30 required, and 32 miles of protected bike lanes out of 50 mandated by 2019 law. Council Member Chi Ossé (District 36) was mentioned, but only six of 51 council members responded to DOT’s call for safety project suggestions. The matter centers on the DOT’s report and council inaction: 'Out of 51 City Council members, only six responded to a request from DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez for recommended locations where street safety improvements should be made in their districts.' Mayor Adams slashed DOT’s budget and weakened projects, while council leaders deflected responsibility. Advocates like Jon Orcutt and Elizabeth Adams demanded decisive action, warning that delays and excuses cost lives. More than half of New Yorkers remain far from protected bike lanes as daily cycling surges.

The FDNY will now assist the Department of Consumer and Worker Protections in enforcement. Fines for repeat violators can reach $2,000. Brewer’s second bill requires e-bike sellers to post safety information in stores and online, with fines up to $350. Councilmember Julie Menin sponsored additional reforms easing street vendor regulations and banning vending in bike lanes.

The policy, not a council bill but a mayoral action, follows months of warnings and public debate. Mayor Adams said, "Tourists and New Yorkers alike deserve to walk across it and enjoy its beauty without being packed together like sardines or risking their safety." The Department of Transportation cited overcrowding and safety risks on the Brooklyn Bridge, where daily pedestrian numbers have doubled since 2021. Vendors and advocates, including Mohamed Attia of the Street Vendor Project, condemned the ban for stripping workers—many disabled or veterans—of income with no safety net. Upper West Side Council Member Gale Brewer proposed a compromise bill to allow regulated vending on wider bridge sections, but the administration pushed ahead with a total ban. The city claims the measure will protect pedestrians, but offers no new space or support for displaced vendors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, not yet passed, would require every e-bike in New York City to be registered with the Department of Transportation. Brewer stated, “I do not believe a blanket e-bike registration rule will make streets safer, nor is NYC DOT equipped to establish, manage or enforce it.” She instead sponsors Intro. 1168, mandating safe lithium-ion batteries for delivery workers, and Intro. 1163, requiring worker training and identification. Thirty-one organizations endorsed Brewer’s approach, calling Holden’s bill “ineffective, dangerous, expensive, short-sighted, and bureaucratically complicated.” Council Members Rita Joseph and Sandy Nurse also withdrew support. Opponents argue the registration bill could suppress e-bike use, increase police stops in communities of color, and worsen traffic violence. Holden dismissed these concerns, insisting his bill is vital for safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
