Eleven left with serious injuries.</strong> In the same year, 390 neighbors were hurt in crashes. The dead do not speak. The wounded carry scars the rest of us cannot see.</p><p>Just this spring, an 83-year-old woman was struck and killed by a turning SUV at West 58th and Sixth. She was crossing with the light. She did not make it to the other side. A month later, a 57-year-old man died under the wheels of an SUV on Broadway at 86th. He crossed. He did not make it home. The street does not forgive.</p><h3 id=the-policy-response-promises-and-pressure>The Policy Response: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>Council Member Gale A. Brewer has signed her name to bills that matter. She voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable and left drivers unchecked. She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, which aims to slow cars, protect walkers, and give crash victims more rights. She backed a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, to clear the sightlines where so many die. But the bills sit in committee. The deaths do not wait.</p><p>At a Council hearing, Brewer pressed the NYPD to stop parking on sidewalks. &ldquo;We would love to see less parking of police and private cars, and I won’t even get into placards,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/police-fire/top-nypd-official-cops-park-sidewalks-nowhere-else-to-park/>she said</a>. The answer from the police: there is nowhere else to park. The sidewalks stay blocked. The danger stays.</p><h3 id=the-work-left-to-do>The Work Left to Do</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> In the last three years, they killed five people and injured more than 250 in District 6. Trucks and buses killed one. Bikes injured dozens. The city has the tools to slow the carnage—lower speed limits, redesign streets, enforce the law. The council has the power to demand more. The mayor has the power to act. The people have the power to force their hand.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand action, not delay.</strong> The dead cannot call.
