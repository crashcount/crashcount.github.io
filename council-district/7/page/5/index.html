The ambulance turned left. She was in the crosswalk. Her leg was broken in several places. She died at the hospital. The police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/29/ambulance-driver-arrested-months-after-fatally-hitting-woman-in-manhattan/>said the accident was not Miriam’s fault at all</a>.

Both diners and officers went to the hospital. The cabbie got a summons for failure to yield. Police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/nypd-car-hits-two-pedestrians-while-trying-to-avoid-crash-into-manhattan-taxi/>said it was unclear if the officers were responding to a call when the incident occurred; an investigation is underway</a>.</p><p><strong>In the last twelve months, five people died on District 7 streets.

He co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, which pushes for lower speed limits and more rights for crash victims. He backed a <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>law to ban parking near crosswalks</a>, to keep sightlines clear. He voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable. He called out the city for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/25/eyes-on-the-street-greenway-detour-is-a-hilly-confusing-danger-zone>unsafe detours that forced cyclists into danger</a>. He did not oppose the <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/05/self-proclaimed-bus-lane-champion-gale-brewer-tries-to-tank-bus-lane>96th Street bus lane</a>, even as others tried to block it. He spoke up for <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/delivery-apps-in-nyc-could-be-held-responsible-for-workers-following-traffic-laws>holding delivery apps accountable for worker safety</a>. He pressed for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/04/pols-slam-city-for-giving-rogue-carters-permits-for-new-zones>safer waste truck contracts, saying cost should not come before lives</a>.</p><p>But laws and hearings do not bring back the dead. <strong>Every day without action is another day of risk.</strong></p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next? No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Call Council Member Abreu. Demand he push for daylighting at every corner, protected bike lanes, and a 20 mph speed limit citywide.</strong> Join with groups like <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> and <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Do not wait for another name to join the list.

The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to hazardous obstruction by vehicles and civilian complaints to the department of transportation for hazardous obstruction violations,' aimed to create a new civil penalty for vehicles blocking bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or hydrants within 1,320 feet of a school. The penalty: $175 per violation, enforced through the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings. Civilians, except city employees, could file complaints and receive 25% of collected fines. The Department of Transportation would support this with a phased-in reporting program and annual public reports. Council Member Carlina Rivera led as primary sponsor, joined by over two dozen co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law.

Council Member Rita C. Joseph sponsored the bill, joined by sixteen co-sponsors including Brooks-Powers, Narcisse, Vernikov, and others.
