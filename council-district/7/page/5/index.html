Council grilled DSNY for picking low bids over safety. Victims’ lives lost in the math. Oversight weak. Dangerous firms keep rolling. Streets stay risky for all.</p><p class=mb3>On June 4, 2024, the City Council held an oversight hearing on commercial waste zone implementation and contractor selection. The hearing spotlighted the Commercial Waste Zones law, which aims to cut crashes by limiting private trash haulers in each zone. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, author of the 2019 reform, and Council Member Shaun Abreu led the charge, questioning why companies like Cogent Waste Solutions—with poor safety records—were awarded contracts. Reynoso declared, "Saving $20 for a business is not worth five human lives." DSNY Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the process, promising to terminate contracts after multiple at-fault fatalities. BIC Commissioner Liz Crotty admitted, "Safety is not a factor" in license denial. Lawmakers condemned the city for putting cost before safety, leaving vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council members question why a company with such a record still hauls trash in city zones. The city’s new waste program promises stricter oversight, but danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>On June 3, 2024, the Department of Sanitation (DSNY) appointed an independent monitor for Cogent Waste Solutions, a private carting firm with a deadly safety record. The move comes before the city’s new Commercial Waste Zone program launches this fall. Council Members Shaun Abreu and Sandy Nurse raised alarms, asking, 'how the city awarded a contract to a company with a history of endangering workers to begin with.' Cogent’s trucks have killed one, injured four, and racked up hundreds of violations. Despite this, DSNY allowed Cogent to win contracts in four waste zones. DSNY Deputy Commissioner Joshua Goodman defended the process, stating, 'Safety was absolutely one of the weighted factors,' and promised, 'there will be consequences for lack of compliance.' The oversight hearing exposes a system that lets reckless firms operate, even as new rules loom.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The BMW's left front bumper hit the pedestrian low, causing severe lacerations to his knee and lower leg. The man remained conscious as blood pooled around him. The report notes the driver was unlicensed and did not stop after the collision. The primary contributing factors listed are 'Driverless/Runaway Vehicle' and 'Unsafe Speed.' The pedestrian was not at an intersection and was engaged in 'other actions in roadway,' but the report attributes fault to the vehicle's dangerous movement and the driver's actions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The fight is on.</p><p class=mb3>On April 9, 2024, Councilmember Shaun Abreu (District 7) introduced a bill targeting delivery app tipping practices. The bill, now before the City Council, would require apps to let customers tip at checkout and set a minimum gratuity suggestion of 10%. The measure responds to recent app changes that made tipping harder, slashing delivery workers’ earnings. Abreu called it 'the most common sense bill for not only Deliveristas but consumers.' The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection stated it does not endorse the app companies’ decisions and will review the legislation. Abreu is also working on a pay transparency bill. The legislation seeks to restore lost income for delivery workers, who rely on tips to survive.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Disabled riders face long detours. Politicians and students demand action. The university’s $13-billion endowment stays untouched. Public money must fill the gap. Progress stalls. Riders wait. Access denied.</p><p class=mb3>This debate centers on Columbia University’s refusal to pay for elevators at the 125th Street 1 train station, despite its West Harlem campus expansion. The project is not a council bill but a protracted standoff, with the MTA and local officials pressing Columbia to fund full ADA accessibility. The university will pay to widen escalators but insists public funds should cover elevators, citing project approval before the Zoning for Accessibility law (October 2021). Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine calls elevator access 'the top priority among station accessibility projects in the borough.' Assembly Member Daniel O’Donnell’s office slams Columbia’s lack of transparency and urges investment, noting the school’s $13-billion endowment and $179 million in tax breaks. Students and disabled riders face daily hardship. The MTA, Council Member Shaun Abreu, and advocates push for progress, but Columbia stalls. No elevator, no access.

Resistance remains.</p><p class=mb3>"What’s happening in West Harlem – it’s working." -- Shaun Abreu</p><p class=mb3>On October 11, 2023, Mayor Eric Adams announced support for the Sanitation Department's plan to repurpose 150,000 parking spaces for containerized garbage collection. The policy, unveiled by DSNY, aims to move trash from sidewalks into closed bins, targeting cleaner streets and less sidewalk clutter. The mayor said, 'Everyday New Yorkers are tired of the rodents, they’re tired of the trash, and this is a small price to pay on ensuring that you can have cleaner streets.' Council member Shaun Abreu, representing West Harlem, voiced strong support, citing visible improvements from the local pilot. The plan requires smaller buildings to use wheeled bins on sidewalks, while larger buildings would get shared curbside containers. The city faces pushback from some residents, but Adams insists street cleanliness is a top concern. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the move could clear sidewalks for pedestrians and reduce hazards from trash piles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
