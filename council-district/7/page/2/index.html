Eleven left with life-changing injuries.</strong> In the last year alone, District 7 saw 951 crashes. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not. A 13-year-old girl was killed crossing Cathedral Parkway last fall. An elderly woman died on Amsterdam Avenue, struck while walking with the light. A 73-year-old man was hit at West 135th. The dead do not speak, but their absence is everywhere.</p><h2 id=the-toll-on-the-most-vulnerable>The Toll on the Most Vulnerable</h2><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the highest price.</strong> Cars and SUVs killed five people and left dozens more broken. Trucks and buses injured twenty more. Bikes, mopeds, and motorcycles added to the toll. The street does not care if you are young or old. Last year, a child died. Two seniors died. The city keeps counting.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-delayed>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Delayed</h2><p>Council Member Shaun Abreu has taken some steps. He co-sponsored a law to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>, forcing the city to clear sightlines at a thousand intersections a year. He voted for <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>removing abandoned vehicles</a> and for <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>transparency on street safety projects</a>. He called the city’s Hudson River Greenway detour &ldquo;shortsighted&rdquo; and urged a safer route for cyclists <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/25/eyes-on-the-street-greenway-detour-is-a-hilly-confusing-danger-zone>last September</a>. But the pace is slow. Promises pile up.

The FDNY mourned a firefighter lost on the FDR Drive. &ldquo;We lost a true hero this morning,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/decorated-firefighter-killed-after-falling-off-motorcycle-getting-hit-by-car-on-fdr-drive-GG4877945>said Deputy Mayor Kaz Daughtry</a>.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>The crisis is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Abreu. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes and daylighted crosswalks at every corner. Demand that every death is the last.

Mayor Eric Adams said, "there’s going to be a whole rule making process to make sure that we comply and follow the laws." Critics argue the plan singles out e-bikes while ignoring faster, heavier vehicles. Ben Furans of Transportation Alternatives called it "half-baked and ill-conceived," noting that "bikes and cars sharing the same road would be subject to different speed limits and consequences." Janet Schroeder of the E-Bike Safety Alliance doubts the rule will matter without real enforcement. The NYPD already issues thousands of criminal summonses to cyclists for minor violations, raising questions about fair and effective policy.

The board voted 31-5 in favor. Supporters called current bus speeds 'painfully slow' and urged the city to 'prioritize pedestrians and transit users.' Critics worried about diverted car traffic clogging residential streets, with one resident calling for a 'traffic study' and 'action plan.'

After hitting Esiyok, Ali continued, injuring a cyclist, two more pedestrians, and crashing into a van.

As one protester said, “It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.” Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the crackdown, citing the lack of licensing for e-bikes as a challenge for enforcement, but acknowledged the need for legislative reform.

The city’s pulse slows, but the outcome is uncertain.</p><p class=mb3>West Side Spirit reported on May 23, 2025, that New York’s congestion pricing tolls remain in place despite three missed federal deadlines to remove them. The article details a standoff between the MTA, New York State, and U.S. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy, who demands the tolls be taken down, threatening to withhold highway funds. The MTA argues the legality of the tolls and seeks a court injunction, stating, 'congestion pricing is legal and proper.' The system, operational since January 2025, has reduced daily vehicle entries into Manhattan’s core by 76,000 in April and raised $159 million in the first quarter. The dispute highlights tensions over funding priorities and the impact on lower-income drivers, but the courts, not drivers or pedestrians, will decide the fate of the tolls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The suit claims, 'the city maintains a policy and practice of detaining, ticketing, and prosecuting cyclists who lawfully ride through an intersection when the pedestrian control signal indicates white/walk.' Esparza received a $190 summons at Third Avenue and East 42nd Street, Manhattan, despite acting within the law. The lawsuit names current and former NYPD commissioners, accusing them of knowingly violating civil rights. The article notes a sharp rise in tickets for cyclists in early 2025. The NYPD declined to comment. The case highlights a gap between city law and police enforcement, raising questions about policy compliance and systemic accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing.
