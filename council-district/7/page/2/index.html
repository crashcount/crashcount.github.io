Fourteen people killed. Twenty-three left with serious injuries. Over 1,600 hurt. The dead include children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians. A 13-year-old girl struck crossing Cathedral Parkway. An elderly man hit head-on by an SUV. A cyclist ejected and killed on St. Nicholas Avenue. The road does not care who you are. It only takes.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p>SUVs and cars do most of the harm. They are the ones that break bodies and end lives. Out of all pedestrian injuries, sedans and SUVs are responsible for the most deaths and serious wounds. Trucks and buses add to the toll. Bikes and mopeds hurt people too, but the numbers are smaller. The pattern is clear. The bigger the machine, the greater the damage. The street is not safe for the softest among us.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Council Member Shaun Abreu has taken some steps. He co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, which targets reckless driving and demands safer street design. He voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable and let drivers off easy. He backed a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, to keep sightlines clear for people on foot. He called the Hudson River Greenway detour &ldquo;shortsighted&rdquo; and urged a safer route for cyclists <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/25/eyes-on-the-street-greenway-detour-is-a-hilly-confusing-danger-zone>urged a safer route for cyclists</a>.

The city rerouted the Greenway, sending thousands of cyclists onto hilly, crash-prone streets. Council Member Abreu called it &ldquo;shortsighted&rdquo; and demanded a &ldquo;sustainable, workable detour&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/25/eyes-on-the-street-greenway-detour-is-a-hilly-confusing-danger-zone>demanded a &ldquo;sustainable, workable detour&rdquo;</a>.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call Council Member Shaun Abreu. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes and daylighted crosswalks. Demand action for the living, not excuses for the dead. Every day of delay is another family broken. Do not wait for the next siren. Act now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Agudela is not expected to survive, having undergone multiple brain surgeries.

The plan nearly doubles sidewalk widths and expands pedestrian zones, cutting space for vehicles. The redesign adds tree buffers, benches, and stormwater upgrades.

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
