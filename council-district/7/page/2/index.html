Police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/nypd-car-hits-two-pedestrians-while-trying-to-avoid-crash-into-manhattan-taxi/>said it was unclear if the officers were responding to a call when the incident occurred; an investigation is underway</a>.</p><p><strong>In the last twelve months, five people died on District 7 streets. Four hundred were injured. Eight were left with serious injuries.</strong> Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians—no one is spared. The numbers do not flinch.</p><h3 id=what-has-shaun-abreu-done>What Has Shaun Abreu Done?</h3><p>Council Member Shaun Abreu has signed on to bills that matter. He co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, which pushes for lower speed limits and more rights for crash victims. He backed a <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>law to ban parking near crosswalks</a>, to keep sightlines clear. He voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable. He called out the city for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/25/eyes-on-the-street-greenway-detour-is-a-hilly-confusing-danger-zone>unsafe detours that forced cyclists into danger</a>. He did not oppose the <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/05/self-proclaimed-bus-lane-champion-gale-brewer-tries-to-tank-bus-lane>96th Street bus lane</a>, even as others tried to block it. He spoke up for <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/delivery-apps-in-nyc-could-be-held-responsible-for-workers-following-traffic-laws>holding delivery apps accountable for worker safety</a>. He pressed for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/04/pols-slam-city-for-giving-rogue-carters-permits-for-new-zones>safer waste truck contracts, saying cost should not come before lives</a>.</p><p>But laws and hearings do not bring back the dead. <strong>Every day without action is another day of risk.</strong></p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next? No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Call Council Member Abreu. Demand he push for daylighting at every corner, protected bike lanes, and a 20 mph speed limit citywide.</strong> Join with groups like <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> and <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>.

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Commissioner Tisch said, “Our officers deserve clear guidance and smart protocols when determining whether to engage in a vehicle pursuit on our streets.” The pursuit was reportedly justified under new policy, which still allows chases for serious crimes.

The Department of Sanitation (DSNY) will launch the program by June 1, 2025, with nearly 80% of apartments participating. The pilot, which follows earlier bin tests, repurposes parking spots for stationary bins. Abreu, co-sponsoring a bill with Council Member Crystal Hudson, called the shift 'a necessary public good' despite the loss of parking. The bill would require on-street containers for buildings with 10 or more units citywide by 2032. Advocates and DSNY officials highlight the benefit for pedestrians: 'People don’t want garbage on the sidewalk, and it makes perfect sense to put it in the roadway.'
