Fourteen people killed. Twenty-three left with serious injuries. Over 1,600 hurt. The dead include children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians. A 13-year-old girl struck crossing Cathedral Parkway. An elderly man hit head-on by an SUV. A cyclist ejected and killed on St. Nicholas Avenue. The road does not care who you are. It only takes.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p>SUVs and cars do most of the harm. They are the ones that break bodies and end lives. Out of all pedestrian injuries, sedans and SUVs are responsible for the most deaths and serious wounds. Trucks and buses add to the toll. Bikes and mopeds hurt people too, but the numbers are smaller. The pattern is clear. The bigger the machine, the greater the damage. The street is not safe for the softest among us.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Council Member Shaun Abreu has taken some steps. He co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, which targets reckless driving and demands safer street design. He voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable and let drivers off easy. He backed a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, to keep sightlines clear for people on foot. He called the Hudson River Greenway detour &ldquo;shortsighted&rdquo; and urged a safer route for cyclists <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/25/eyes-on-the-street-greenway-detour-is-a-hilly-confusing-danger-zone>urged a safer route for cyclists</a>.

The city rerouted the Greenway, sending thousands of cyclists onto hilly, crash-prone streets. Council Member Abreu called it &ldquo;shortsighted&rdquo; and demanded a &ldquo;sustainable, workable detour&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/25/eyes-on-the-street-greenway-detour-is-a-hilly-confusing-danger-zone>demanded a &ldquo;sustainable, workable detour&rdquo;</a>.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call Council Member Shaun Abreu. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes and daylighted crosswalks. Demand action for the living, not excuses for the dead. Every day of delay is another family broken. Do not wait for the next siren. Act now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Resistance remains.</p><p class=mb3>"What’s happening in West Harlem – it’s working." -- Shaun Abreu</p><p class=mb3>On October 11, 2023, Mayor Eric Adams announced support for the Sanitation Department's plan to repurpose 150,000 parking spaces for containerized garbage collection. The policy, unveiled by DSNY, aims to move trash from sidewalks into closed bins, targeting cleaner streets and less sidewalk clutter. The mayor said, 'Everyday New Yorkers are tired of the rodents, they’re tired of the trash, and this is a small price to pay on ensuring that you can have cleaner streets.' Council member Shaun Abreu, representing West Harlem, voiced strong support, citing visible improvements from the local pilot. The plan requires smaller buildings to use wheeled bins on sidewalks, while larger buildings would get shared curbside containers. The city faces pushback from some residents, but Adams insists street cleanliness is a top concern. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the move could clear sidewalks for pedestrians and reduce hazards from trash piles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Others worry about access.</p><p class=mb3>On September 15, 2023, New York City launched a containerized garbage collection pilot in West Harlem. The Department of Sanitation (DSNY) rolled out mechanical lifts on trucks to empty curbside containers, covering ten residential blocks and fourteen schools. The pilot aims to 'eliminate sidewalk trash bags, combat rats, and reclaim public roadway space from private car storage.' Council Member Shaun Abreu and DSNY officials publicly supported the program, with Abreu stating, 'Rats are a huge problem uptown, and we’ll never get the problem under control as long as we’re just throwing bags on the sidewalk.' Jonathan Viguers, DSNY assistant commissioner, acknowledged the removal of parking spaces as necessary. The initiative is part of Mayor Adams's anti-rat campaign. While some residents praise cleaner sidewalks, others raise concerns about accessibility and overflow. The city may expand the program, but faces cost and political hurdles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
