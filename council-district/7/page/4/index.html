The ambulance turned left. She was in the crosswalk. Her leg was broken in several places. She died at the hospital. The police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/29/ambulance-driver-arrested-months-after-fatally-hitting-woman-in-manhattan/>said the accident was not Miriam’s fault at all</a>.

Both diners and officers went to the hospital. The cabbie got a summons for failure to yield. Police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/nypd-car-hits-two-pedestrians-while-trying-to-avoid-crash-into-manhattan-taxi/>said it was unclear if the officers were responding to a call when the incident occurred; an investigation is underway</a>.</p><p><strong>In the last twelve months, five people died on District 7 streets.

He co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, which pushes for lower speed limits and more rights for crash victims. He backed a <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>law to ban parking near crosswalks</a>, to keep sightlines clear. He voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable. He called out the city for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/25/eyes-on-the-street-greenway-detour-is-a-hilly-confusing-danger-zone>unsafe detours that forced cyclists into danger</a>. He did not oppose the <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/05/self-proclaimed-bus-lane-champion-gale-brewer-tries-to-tank-bus-lane>96th Street bus lane</a>, even as others tried to block it. He spoke up for <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/delivery-apps-in-nyc-could-be-held-responsible-for-workers-following-traffic-laws>holding delivery apps accountable for worker safety</a>. He pressed for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/04/pols-slam-city-for-giving-rogue-carters-permits-for-new-zones>safer waste truck contracts, saying cost should not come before lives</a>.</p><p>But laws and hearings do not bring back the dead. <strong>Every day without action is another day of risk.</strong></p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next? No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Call Council Member Abreu. Demand he push for daylighting at every corner, protected bike lanes, and a 20 mph speed limit citywide.</strong> Join with groups like <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> and <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Do not wait for another name to join the list.

The policy, unveiled by DSNY, aims to move trash from sidewalks into closed bins, targeting cleaner streets and less sidewalk clutter. The mayor said, 'Everyday New Yorkers are tired of the rodents, they’re tired of the trash, and this is a small price to pay on ensuring that you can have cleaner streets.' Council member Shaun Abreu, representing West Harlem, voiced strong support, citing visible improvements from the local pilot. The plan requires smaller buildings to use wheeled bins on sidewalks, while larger buildings would get shared curbside containers. The city faces pushback from some residents, but Adams insists street cleanliness is a top concern. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the move could clear sidewalks for pedestrians and reduce hazards from trash piles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Sanitation (DSNY) rolled out mechanical lifts on trucks to empty curbside containers, covering ten residential blocks and fourteen schools. The pilot aims to 'eliminate sidewalk trash bags, combat rats, and reclaim public roadway space from private car storage.' Council Member Shaun Abreu and DSNY officials publicly supported the program, with Abreu stating, 'Rats are a huge problem uptown, and we’ll never get the problem under control as long as we’re just throwing bags on the sidewalk.' Jonathan Viguers, DSNY assistant commissioner, acknowledged the removal of parking spaces as necessary. The initiative is part of Mayor Adams's anti-rat campaign. While some residents praise cleaner sidewalks, others raise concerns about accessibility and overflow. The city may expand the program, but faces cost and political hurdles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary notes, 'New York City can containerize its sidewalk garbage, but doing so will require a major overhaul of the sanitation system.' Advocates like Christine Berthet call it transformative; others, like car owners, bristle at lost parking.
