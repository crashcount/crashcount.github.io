Fourteen people killed. Twenty-three left with serious injuries. Over 1,600 hurt. The dead include children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians. A 13-year-old girl struck crossing Cathedral Parkway. An elderly man hit head-on by an SUV. A cyclist ejected and killed on St. Nicholas Avenue. The road does not care who you are. It only takes.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p>SUVs and cars do most of the harm. They are the ones that break bodies and end lives. Out of all pedestrian injuries, sedans and SUVs are responsible for the most deaths and serious wounds. Trucks and buses add to the toll. Bikes and mopeds hurt people too, but the numbers are smaller. The pattern is clear. The bigger the machine, the greater the damage. The street is not safe for the softest among us.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Council Member Shaun Abreu has taken some steps. He co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, which targets reckless driving and demands safer street design. He voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable and let drivers off easy. He backed a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, to keep sightlines clear for people on foot. He called the Hudson River Greenway detour &ldquo;shortsighted&rdquo; and urged a safer route for cyclists <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/25/eyes-on-the-street-greenway-detour-is-a-hilly-confusing-danger-zone>urged a safer route for cyclists</a>.

The city rerouted the Greenway, sending thousands of cyclists onto hilly, crash-prone streets. Council Member Abreu called it &ldquo;shortsighted&rdquo; and demanded a &ldquo;sustainable, workable detour&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/25/eyes-on-the-street-greenway-detour-is-a-hilly-confusing-danger-zone>demanded a &ldquo;sustainable, workable detour&rdquo;</a>.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call Council Member Shaun Abreu. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes and daylighted crosswalks. Demand action for the living, not excuses for the dead. Every day of delay is another family broken. Do not wait for the next siren. Act now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The cyclist suffered crush injuries to his arm and remained conscious at the scene. No injuries were reported for the SUV, which was parked and undamaged. The report notes the cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this is mentioned only after the contributing factors.

The bills aim to address 'myriad health and safety concerns' from e-bike crashes, battery fires, and low pay. Councilmember Lynn Schulman, District 29, spoke out: 'Right now, delivery workers are essentially incentivized for speed... This often results in driving recklessly, often putting the lives of pedestrians at risk.' Three bills would make apps like Uber Eats and DoorDash responsible for vehicle safety and compliance, require them to provide safety-compliant e-bikes, and ensure mopeds are registered. Other bills target pay transparency and tip protections. Councilmembers Shaun Abreu and Rafael Salamanca also spoke in support. The measures seek to hold companies accountable for dangers faced by vulnerable road users and delivery workers alike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The hearing spotlighted the Commercial Waste Zones law, which aims to cut crashes by limiting private trash haulers in each zone. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, author of the 2019 reform, and Council Member Shaun Abreu led the charge, questioning why companies like Cogent Waste Solutions—with poor safety records—were awarded contracts. Reynoso declared, "Saving $20 for a business is not worth five human lives." DSNY Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the process, promising to terminate contracts after multiple at-fault fatalities. BIC Commissioner Liz Crotty admitted, "Safety is not a factor" in license denial. Lawmakers condemned the city for putting cost before safety, leaving vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move comes before the city’s new Commercial Waste Zone program launches this fall. Council Members Shaun Abreu and Sandy Nurse raised alarms, asking, 'how the city awarded a contract to a company with a history of endangering workers to begin with.' Cogent’s trucks have killed one, injured four, and racked up hundreds of violations. Despite this, DSNY allowed Cogent to win contracts in four waste zones. DSNY Deputy Commissioner Joshua Goodman defended the process, stating, 'Safety was absolutely one of the weighted factors,' and promised, 'there will be consequences for lack of compliance.' The oversight hearing exposes a system that lets reckless firms operate, even as new rules loom.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, now before the City Council, would require apps to let customers tip at checkout and set a minimum gratuity suggestion of 10%. The measure responds to recent app changes that made tipping harder, slashing delivery workers’ earnings. Abreu called it 'the most common sense bill for not only Deliveristas but consumers.' The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection stated it does not endorse the app companies’ decisions and will review the legislation. Abreu is also working on a pay transparency bill. The legislation seeks to restore lost income for delivery workers, who rely on tips to survive.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project is not a council bill but a protracted standoff, with the MTA and local officials pressing Columbia to fund full ADA accessibility. The university will pay to widen escalators but insists public funds should cover elevators, citing project approval before the Zoning for Accessibility law (October 2021). Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine calls elevator access 'the top priority among station accessibility projects in the borough.' Assembly Member Daniel O’Donnell’s office slams Columbia’s lack of transparency and urges investment, noting the school’s $13-billion endowment and $179 million in tax breaks. Students and disabled riders face daily hardship. The MTA, Council Member Shaun Abreu, and advocates push for progress, but Columbia stalls. No elevator, no access.

The policy, unveiled by DSNY, aims to move trash from sidewalks into closed bins, targeting cleaner streets and less sidewalk clutter. The mayor said, 'Everyday New Yorkers are tired of the rodents, they’re tired of the trash, and this is a small price to pay on ensuring that you can have cleaner streets.' Council member Shaun Abreu, representing West Harlem, voiced strong support, citing visible improvements from the local pilot. The plan requires smaller buildings to use wheeled bins on sidewalks, while larger buildings would get shared curbside containers. The city faces pushback from some residents, but Adams insists street cleanliness is a top concern. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the move could clear sidewalks for pedestrians and reduce hazards from trash piles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
