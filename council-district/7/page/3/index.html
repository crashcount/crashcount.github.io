The ambulance turned left. She was in the crosswalk. Her leg was broken in several places. She died at the hospital. The police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/29/ambulance-driver-arrested-months-after-fatally-hitting-woman-in-manhattan/>said the accident was not Miriam’s fault at all</a>. The driver was charged with failure to yield.</p><p>Two diners sat outside on Broadway at 112th. An NYPD car swerved to avoid a taxi. The car jumped the curb. Metal and glass. Both diners and officers went to the hospital. The cabbie got a summons for failure to yield. Police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/nypd-car-hits-two-pedestrians-while-trying-to-avoid-crash-into-manhattan-taxi/>said it was unclear if the officers were responding to a call when the incident occurred; an investigation is underway</a>.</p><p><strong>In the last twelve months, five people died on District 7 streets.

The numbers do not flinch.</p><h3 id=what-has-shaun-abreu-done>What Has Shaun Abreu Done?</h3><p>Council Member Shaun Abreu has signed on to bills that matter. He co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, which pushes for lower speed limits and more rights for crash victims. He backed a <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>law to ban parking near crosswalks</a>, to keep sightlines clear. He voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable. He called out the city for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/25/eyes-on-the-street-greenway-detour-is-a-hilly-confusing-danger-zone>unsafe detours that forced cyclists into danger</a>. He did not oppose the <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/05/self-proclaimed-bus-lane-champion-gale-brewer-tries-to-tank-bus-lane>96th Street bus lane</a>, even as others tried to block it. He spoke up for <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/delivery-apps-in-nyc-could-be-held-responsible-for-workers-following-traffic-laws>holding delivery apps accountable for worker safety</a>. He pressed for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/04/pols-slam-city-for-giving-rogue-carters-permits-for-new-zones>safer waste truck contracts, saying cost should not come before lives</a>.</p><p>But laws and hearings do not bring back the dead. <strong>Every day without action is another day of risk.</strong></p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next? No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Call Council Member Abreu. Demand he push for daylighting at every corner, protected bike lanes, and a 20 mph speed limit citywide.</strong> Join with groups like <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> and <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Do not wait for another name to join the list. The street will not forgive delay.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Others worry about access.</p><p class=mb3>On September 15, 2023, New York City launched a containerized garbage collection pilot in West Harlem. The Department of Sanitation (DSNY) rolled out mechanical lifts on trucks to empty curbside containers, covering ten residential blocks and fourteen schools. The pilot aims to 'eliminate sidewalk trash bags, combat rats, and reclaim public roadway space from private car storage.' Council Member Shaun Abreu and DSNY officials publicly supported the program, with Abreu stating, 'Rats are a huge problem uptown, and we’ll never get the problem under control as long as we’re just throwing bags on the sidewalk.' Jonathan Viguers, DSNY assistant commissioner, acknowledged the removal of parking spaces as necessary. The initiative is part of Mayor Adams's anti-rat campaign. While some residents praise cleaner sidewalks, others raise concerns about accessibility and overflow. The city may expand the program, but faces cost and political hurdles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danger remains.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0549-2023, filed at session’s end, came from the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. It was introduced April 11, 2023, and pushed by Council Member Shahana K. Hanif as primary sponsor, with Jennifer Gutiérrez and over twenty others co-sponsoring. The resolution urged the State Legislature and Governor to pass S.2422 ('Sammy’s Law'), which would let New York City set lower speed limits, and A.1901, a crash victims bill of rights. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, S.2422, also known as ‘Sammy’s Law,’ ... and A.1901, enacting a crash victims bill of rights, as well as the other bills of the package known as the SAFE Streets Act.' The SAFE Streets Act package also includes safe passing for cyclists and complete street design mandates. The Council’s action highlights the city’s ongoing fight against reckless driving and the urgent need for stronger protections for people on foot, on bikes, and in cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
