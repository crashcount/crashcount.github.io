Since 2022, 13 people have died and 1,676 have been injured in crashes. Twenty-four suffered serious injuries. The dead include children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about the weather or the hour. They keep coming.</p><p>Just last month, a cyclist was left bleeding on Riverside. A distracted SUV driver did not see him. The city’s <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>open data shows the pattern</a>: cars and SUVs do most of the killing. Trucks, taxis, bikes, and mopeds add to the toll. The names fade. The pain does not.</p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>A 13-year-old girl, crossing Cathedral Parkway, was struck and killed by an SUV. She never made it to the other side. An elderly woman, walking with the signal at Amsterdam and 96th, was hit by a turning SUV and died on the street. These are not accidents. They are the result of choices—speed, distraction, blind corners, and laws that put cars first.</p><p>A witness to another Midtown crash <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/police-chase-midtown-manhattan-results-multiple-smashed-cars-drivers-arrest/17241821/>said</a>, &ldquo;It felt like he was scratching like big noise and I was honking like stop and he kept doing it.&rdquo; The driver did not stop. The city did not stop him.</p><h2 id=what-has-council-member-abreu-done>What Has Council Member Abreu Done?</h2><p>Council Member Shaun Abreu has backed some safety bills. He <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>co-sponsored a law to track street safety projects</a> and force the city to show its work. He <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>voted to ban parking near crosswalks</a> and to remove abandoned vehicles that block sightlines. He supported <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/10/council-to-close-instacart-loophole-pass-delivery-industry-regulation-bills>minimum wage and protections for delivery workers</a>. He <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/25/eyes-on-the-street-greenway-detour-is-a-hilly-confusing-danger-zone>called the city’s Greenway detour &ldquo;shortsighted&rdquo; and urged a safer route for cyclists</a>.</p><p>But the carnage continues. No law has slowed the cars enough. No council vote has brought back the dead. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not used it. The blood on the street is proof.</p><h2 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h2><p>Demand more. Call Council Member Abreu. Call the Mayor. Tell them to use Sammy’s Law and drop the speed limit to 20 mph. Tell them to redesign streets for people, not cars. Every day they wait, another family pays the price.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Abreu urged the city to create a 'sustainable, workable detour' for vulnerable riders. Cyclists voiced frustration and fear, with some riding on pedestrian paths or even the highway to avoid danger. The city’s reliance on 'Share the Road' signs and sharrows leaves riders exposed.

The matter, described as a push to 'torpedo planned bus lane on 96th Street,' has drawn support from East Side's Community Board 8 and opposition from West Side locals and Council Member Gale Brewer, who suggested alternatives like bus signal priority.

Brewer, who once backed bus lanes on 14th, 34th, and 181st Streets, now argued for alternatives and said, 'I'm a bus rider who takes this bus every day. It's not slow.' DOT countered that parking would be preserved and loading zones added. Transit advocates criticized Brewer for ignoring data on slow westbound buses and the needs of 15,000 daily riders.
