The ambulance turned left. She was in the crosswalk. Her leg was broken in several places. She died at the hospital. The police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/29/ambulance-driver-arrested-months-after-fatally-hitting-woman-in-manhattan/>said the accident was not Miriam’s fault at all</a>.

Both diners and officers went to the hospital. The cabbie got a summons for failure to yield.

He co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, which pushes for lower speed limits and more rights for crash victims. He backed a <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>law to ban parking near crosswalks</a>, to keep sightlines clear. He voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable. He called out the city for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/25/eyes-on-the-street-greenway-detour-is-a-hilly-confusing-danger-zone>unsafe detours that forced cyclists into danger</a>. He did not oppose the <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/05/self-proclaimed-bus-lane-champion-gale-brewer-tries-to-tank-bus-lane>96th Street bus lane</a>, even as others tried to block it. He spoke up for <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/delivery-apps-in-nyc-could-be-held-responsible-for-workers-following-traffic-laws>holding delivery apps accountable for worker safety</a>. He pressed for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/04/pols-slam-city-for-giving-rogue-carters-permits-for-new-zones>safer waste truck contracts, saying cost should not come before lives</a>.</p><p>But laws and hearings do not bring back the dead. <strong>Every day without action is another day of risk.</strong></p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next? No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Call Council Member Abreu. Demand he push for daylighting at every corner, protected bike lanes, and a 20 mph speed limit citywide.</strong> Join with groups like <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> and <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Do not wait for another name to join the list.

Abreu urged the city to create a 'sustainable, workable detour' for vulnerable riders. Cyclists voiced frustration and fear, with some riding on pedestrian paths or even the highway to avoid danger. The city’s reliance on 'Share the Road' signs and sharrows leaves riders exposed.

Abreu stated, "I wouldn’t say I’m opposed or in favor at this point," but called for more clarity and adjustments from DOT. The matter, described as a push to 'torpedo planned bus lane on 96th Street,' has drawn support from East Side's Community Board 8 and opposition from West Side locals and Council Member Gale Brewer, who suggested alternatives like bus signal priority.

Brewer, who once backed bus lanes on 14th, 34th, and 181st Streets, now argued for alternatives and said, 'I'm a bus rider who takes this bus every day. It's not slow.' DOT countered that parking would be preserved and loading zones added. Transit advocates criticized Brewer for ignoring data on slow westbound buses and the needs of 15,000 daily riders.

The bills aim to address 'myriad health and safety concerns' from e-bike crashes, battery fires, and low pay. Councilmember Lynn Schulman, District 29, spoke out: 'Right now, delivery workers are essentially incentivized for speed... This often results in driving recklessly, often putting the lives of pedestrians at risk.' Three bills would make apps like Uber Eats and DoorDash responsible for vehicle safety and compliance, require them to provide safety-compliant e-bikes, and ensure mopeds are registered. Other bills target pay transparency and tip protections. Councilmembers Shaun Abreu and Rafael Salamanca also spoke in support. The measures seek to hold companies accountable for dangers faced by vulnerable road users and delivery workers alike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The hearing spotlighted the Commercial Waste Zones law, which aims to cut crashes by limiting private trash haulers in each zone. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, author of the 2019 reform, and Council Member Shaun Abreu led the charge, questioning why companies like Cogent Waste Solutions—with poor safety records—were awarded contracts. Reynoso declared, "Saving $20 for a business is not worth five human lives." DSNY Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the process, promising to terminate contracts after multiple at-fault fatalities. BIC Commissioner Liz Crotty admitted, "Safety is not a factor" in license denial.

Council Members Shaun Abreu and Sandy Nurse raised alarms, asking, 'how the city awarded a contract to a company with a history of endangering workers to begin with.' Cogent’s trucks have killed one, injured four, and racked up hundreds of violations. Despite this, DSNY allowed Cogent to win contracts in four waste zones. DSNY Deputy Commissioner Joshua Goodman defended the process, stating, 'Safety was absolutely one of the weighted factors,' and promised, 'there will be consequences for lack of compliance.'
