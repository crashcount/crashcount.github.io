Fourteen people killed. Twenty-three left with serious injuries. Over 1,600 hurt. The dead include children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians. A 13-year-old girl struck crossing Cathedral Parkway. An elderly man hit head-on by an SUV. A cyclist ejected and killed on St. Nicholas Avenue. The road does not care who you are. It only takes.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p>SUVs and cars do most of the harm. They are the ones that break bodies and end lives. Out of all pedestrian injuries, sedans and SUVs are responsible for the most deaths and serious wounds. Trucks and buses add to the toll. Bikes and mopeds hurt people too, but the numbers are smaller. The pattern is clear. The bigger the machine, the greater the damage. The street is not safe for the softest among us.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Council Member Shaun Abreu has taken some steps. He co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, which targets reckless driving and demands safer street design. He voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable and let drivers off easy. He backed a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, to keep sightlines clear for people on foot. He called the Hudson River Greenway detour &ldquo;shortsighted&rdquo; and urged a safer route for cyclists <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/25/eyes-on-the-street-greenway-detour-is-a-hilly-confusing-danger-zone>urged a safer route for cyclists</a>.

The city rerouted the Greenway, sending thousands of cyclists onto hilly, crash-prone streets. Council Member Abreu called it &ldquo;shortsighted&rdquo; and demanded a &ldquo;sustainable, workable detour&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/25/eyes-on-the-street-greenway-detour-is-a-hilly-confusing-danger-zone>demanded a &ldquo;sustainable, workable detour&rdquo;</a>.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call Council Member Shaun Abreu. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes and daylighted crosswalks. Demand action for the living, not excuses for the dead. Every day of delay is another family broken. Do not wait for the next siren. Act now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The impact crushed her leg, leaving her conscious but severely injured. The police report cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the primary contributing factor. The driver’s failure to pay attention directly led to the collision. The report also notes the pedestrian was 'Getting On/Off Vehicle Other Than School Bus' and lists 'Listening/Using Headphones' as an additional factor, but only after the driver’s distraction. The cab showed no visible damage, and the narrative underscores the pain left on the street. The crash highlights the danger posed when drivers fail to remain alert, especially around vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Williams was struck, thrown, and died from his injuries. The article states, “An officer pursuing dirt bikers suddenly crossed the double yellow line into Williams' path, causing a collision.” Another NYPD vehicle attempted a similar maneuver. The family’s attorney called it a “deadly maneuver” for a minor violation. The city later billed Williams’ family for police vehicle damages. The NYPD has not commented, citing litigation.

No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities.

The detour, implemented with scant notice, lacks protected bike lanes and clear signage. Cyclists must share space with cars, cross highway ramps, and navigate steep slopes. The matter, described as 'shortsighted' by Council Member Shaun Abreu, repeats failures from a similar closure four years ago. Abreu urged the city to create a 'sustainable, workable detour' for vulnerable riders. Cyclists voiced frustration and fear, with some riding on pedestrian paths or even the highway to avoid danger. The city’s reliance on 'Share the Road' signs and sharrows leaves riders exposed. The detour has led to nearly one injury per week, highlighting the city’s disregard for cyclist safety during infrastructure work.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The DOT proposal, intended to speed up the M96 bus for 15,000 daily riders, would repurpose a travel lane in each direction while preserving curb parking. Abreu stated, "I wouldn’t say I’m opposed or in favor at this point," but called for more clarity and adjustments from DOT. The matter, described as a push to 'torpedo planned bus lane on 96th Street,' has drawn support from East Side's Community Board 8 and opposition from West Side locals and Council Member Gale Brewer, who suggested alternatives like bus signal priority. The debate centers on balancing transit improvements with residential curb access.

Brewer, who once backed bus lanes on 14th, 34th, and 181st Streets, now argued for alternatives and said, 'I'm a bus rider who takes this bus every day. It's not slow.' DOT countered that parking would be preserved and loading zones added. Transit advocates criticized Brewer for ignoring data on slow westbound buses and the needs of 15,000 daily riders.

Councilmember Shaun Abreu hails the pilot’s success. The bins cut sidewalk trash and rats. Streets change. Cars lose ground. Pedestrians and residents gain cleaner, safer space.</p><p class=mb3>On August 8, 2024, Councilmember Shaun Abreu, chair of the City Council's sanitation committee, announced the expansion of a sanitation pilot in District 7. The Department of Sanitation will install up to 1,500 large, Madrid-made bins in West Harlem parking spaces, targeting buildings with more than 31 units. The pilot, launched last year, replaces sidewalk trash bags with secure, stationary bins. Abreu said, 'I couldn’t be more thrilled that Barcelona is making its way to New York City – but unfortunately for the rats, that means no tapas for them.' The bins, emptied by new trucks, have already reduced rat complaints and cleaned up streets. Some residents worry about lost parking, but others, like Esther Yoon, praise the cleaner, safer sidewalks. The city will spend up to $700,000 annually on the program, aiming to expand across all boroughs.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
