Eleven left with life-changing injuries.</strong> In the last year alone, District 7 saw 951 crashes. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not. A 13-year-old girl was killed crossing Cathedral Parkway last fall. An elderly woman died on Amsterdam Avenue, struck while walking with the light. A 73-year-old man was hit at West 135th. The dead do not speak, but their absence is everywhere.</p><h2 id=the-toll-on-the-most-vulnerable>The Toll on the Most Vulnerable</h2><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the highest price.</strong> Cars and SUVs killed five people and left dozens more broken. Trucks and buses injured twenty more. Bikes, mopeds, and motorcycles added to the toll. The street does not care if you are young or old. Last year, a child died. Two seniors died. The city keeps counting.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-delayed>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Delayed</h2><p>Council Member Shaun Abreu has taken some steps. He co-sponsored a law to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>, forcing the city to clear sightlines at a thousand intersections a year. He voted for <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>removing abandoned vehicles</a> and for <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>transparency on street safety projects</a>. He called the city’s Hudson River Greenway detour &ldquo;shortsighted&rdquo; and urged a safer route for cyclists <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/25/eyes-on-the-street-greenway-detour-is-a-hilly-confusing-danger-zone>last September</a>. But the pace is slow. Promises pile up.

Law brings fairer pay, not safer roads.</p><p class=mb3>On July 10, 2025, the City Council advanced Intro 1133 and 1135 to close the Instacart loophole and regulate app-based delivery. The bills, led by Council Members Jennifer Gutiérrez, Sandy Nurse, and Shaun Abreu, require all apps to pay minimum wage and restore upfront tipping. The matter summary: 'regulate the app-based delivery industry.' Sophia Lebowitz supported the action. Advocates say the package strengthens 2023's pay law. A safety analyst notes: mandating minimum wage improves labor conditions but does not directly affect safety, mode shift, or street equity for pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

An illegal electric unicycle hit a cyclist, sending its operator to the hospital in critical but stable condition. The cyclist, Carolyn Backus, was wrongly charged with leaving the scene, though she "remained on scene for about 45 minutes after the crash and waited for paramedics." The Manhattan D.A. dismissed the charge, noting Backus rode a non-motorized bike. The article highlights the risk of high-speed e-vehicles in crowded park zones, where "unpredictable congestion makes it the last place...anyone should be speeding."</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
