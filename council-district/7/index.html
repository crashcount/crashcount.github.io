Eleven left with life-changing injuries.</strong> In the last year alone, District 7 saw 951 crashes. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not. A 13-year-old girl was killed crossing Cathedral Parkway last fall. An elderly woman died on Amsterdam Avenue, struck while walking with the light. A 73-year-old man was hit at West 135th. The dead do not speak, but their absence is everywhere.</p><h2 id=the-toll-on-the-most-vulnerable>The Toll on the Most Vulnerable</h2><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the highest price.</strong> Cars and SUVs killed five people and left dozens more broken. Trucks and buses injured twenty more. Bikes, mopeds, and motorcycles added to the toll. The street does not care if you are young or old. Last year, a child died. Two seniors died. The city keeps counting.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-delayed>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Delayed</h2><p>Council Member Shaun Abreu has taken some steps. He co-sponsored a law to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>, forcing the city to clear sightlines at a thousand intersections a year. He voted for <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>removing abandoned vehicles</a> and for <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>transparency on street safety projects</a>. He called the city’s Hudson River Greenway detour &ldquo;shortsighted&rdquo; and urged a safer route for cyclists <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/25/eyes-on-the-street-greenway-detour-is-a-hilly-confusing-danger-zone>last September</a>. But the pace is slow. Promises pile up.

The FDNY mourned a firefighter lost on the FDR Drive. &ldquo;We lost a true hero this morning,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/decorated-firefighter-killed-after-falling-off-motorcycle-getting-hit-by-car-on-fdr-drive-GG4877945>said Deputy Mayor Kaz Daughtry</a>.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>The crisis is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Abreu. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes and daylighted crosswalks at every corner. Demand that every death is the last.

The article details how Ruth and Valery Oistenau were knocked down by a cyclist while waiting to cross in the East Village. Their injuries were dismissed by police, reflecting a broader issue: 'Many, possibly most, incidents between bikes of all sorts and pedestrians are not reported.' NYPD policy since 2020 means only the most severe injuries get documented. Mayor Eric Adams stated, 'Bikes must follow the same laws that vehicles follow,' but enforcement and reporting lag behind reality. Dr. Jonathan Kirschner calls for better public-health data, noting, 'the incidence of injuries from encounters between pedestrians and bikes is on the rise.' The lack of accurate reporting leaves the true scope of the danger unknown and unaddressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Residents worry rerouted vehicles will jam local streets and worsen safety. Jessica Lavoie of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association warns, "diverting traffic from this critical corridor onto narrow residential streets would lead to increased congestion, safety hazards, and diminished quality of life." The Department of Transportation aims to replicate the 14th Street busway, which "reduced congestion, sped up bus travel and curbed accidents." The article highlights the ongoing struggle to balance efficient transit, tunnel access, and neighborhood safety. No specific driver errors are cited, but the plan underscores the systemic risks of shifting car traffic onto residential blocks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crackdown targets delivery workers, especially undocumented riders, for offenses like sidewalk riding and nonstandard bike setups. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the move, stating, 'When it comes to traffic safety, compliance is not optional.' Protesters and advocates argue the policy is discriminatory and escalates minor violations, risking severe consequences for vulnerable workers. Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives called it 'really inappropriate escalation.'
