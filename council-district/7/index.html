Fourteen people killed. Twenty-three left with serious injuries. Over 1,600 hurt. The dead include children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians. A 13-year-old girl struck crossing Cathedral Parkway. An elderly man hit head-on by an SUV. A cyclist ejected and killed on St. Nicholas Avenue. The road does not care who you are. It only takes.</p><h2 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h2><p>SUVs and cars do most of the harm. They are the ones that break bodies and end lives. Out of all pedestrian injuries, sedans and SUVs are responsible for the most deaths and serious wounds. Trucks and buses add to the toll. Bikes and mopeds hurt people too, but the numbers are smaller. The pattern is clear. The bigger the machine, the greater the damage. The street is not safe for the softest among us.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h2><p>Council Member Shaun Abreu has taken some steps. He co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, which targets reckless driving and demands safer street design. He voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable and let drivers off easy. He backed a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, to keep sightlines clear for people on foot. He called the Hudson River Greenway detour &ldquo;shortsighted&rdquo; and urged a safer route for cyclists <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/25/eyes-on-the-street-greenway-detour-is-a-hilly-confusing-danger-zone>urged a safer route for cyclists</a>.

The city rerouted the Greenway, sending thousands of cyclists onto hilly, crash-prone streets. Council Member Abreu called it &ldquo;shortsighted&rdquo; and demanded a &ldquo;sustainable, workable detour&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/25/eyes-on-the-street-greenway-detour-is-a-hilly-confusing-danger-zone>demanded a &ldquo;sustainable, workable detour&rdquo;</a>.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call Council Member Shaun Abreu. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes and daylighted crosswalks. Demand action for the living, not excuses for the dead. Every day of delay is another family broken. Do not wait for the next siren. Act now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Manhattan Community Board 5 called this move not a "real solution" to safety, urging a return to the 2021 plan with protected bike lanes and faster bus service. "We want a real solution to the bike and pedestrian safety issue," said CB 5 Vice Chair Samir Lavingia. The board warns that without bike lanes, cyclists will ride sidewalks, risking conflict. The plan, shaped with business interests, leaves vulnerable road users exposed and delays safer changes until at least 2028.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

In February 2024, journalist Fazil Khan died in a Harlem apartment fire started by a charging battery; 22 others were injured. The article notes, 'Fires from unregulated e-bike batteries have already caused too much harm, including tragic loss of life.' The city’s $2 million pilot lets delivery workers exchange uncertified e-bikes and batteries for certified, UL-standard models. The program also requires a safety course. While battery-related fires rose slightly from 268 in 2023 to 277 in 2024, fatalities fell from 18 to 6. The article highlights ongoing risks from uncertified batteries and the city’s push for safer equipment.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Residents worry rerouted vehicles will jam local streets and worsen safety. Jessica Lavoie of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association warns, "diverting traffic from this critical corridor onto narrow residential streets would lead to increased congestion, safety hazards, and diminished quality of life." The Department of Transportation aims to replicate the 14th Street busway, which "reduced congestion, sped up bus travel and curbed accidents."
