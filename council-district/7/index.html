Eleven left with life-changing injuries.</strong> In the last year alone, District 7 saw 951 crashes. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not. A 13-year-old girl was killed crossing Cathedral Parkway last fall. An elderly woman died on Amsterdam Avenue, struck while walking with the light. A 73-year-old man was hit at West 135th. The dead do not speak, but their absence is everywhere.</p><h2 id=the-toll-on-the-most-vulnerable>The Toll on the Most Vulnerable</h2><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the highest price.</strong> Cars and SUVs killed five people and left dozens more broken. Trucks and buses injured twenty more. Bikes, mopeds, and motorcycles added to the toll. The street does not care if you are young or old. Last year, a child died. Two seniors died. The city keeps counting.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-delayed>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Delayed</h2><p>Council Member Shaun Abreu has taken some steps. He co-sponsored a law to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>, forcing the city to clear sightlines at a thousand intersections a year. He voted for <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>removing abandoned vehicles</a> and for <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>transparency on street safety projects</a>. He called the city’s Hudson River Greenway detour &ldquo;shortsighted&rdquo; and urged a safer route for cyclists <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/25/eyes-on-the-street-greenway-detour-is-a-hilly-confusing-danger-zone>last September</a>. But the pace is slow. Promises pile up.

The FDNY mourned a firefighter lost on the FDR Drive. &ldquo;We lost a true hero this morning,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/decorated-firefighter-killed-after-falling-off-motorcycle-getting-hit-by-car-on-fdr-drive-GG4877945>said Deputy Mayor Kaz Daughtry</a>.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>The crisis is not fate.
