The ambulance turned left. She was in the crosswalk. Her leg was broken in several places. She died at the hospital. The police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/29/ambulance-driver-arrested-months-after-fatally-hitting-woman-in-manhattan/>said the accident was not Miriam’s fault at all</a>. The driver was charged with failure to yield.</p><p>Two diners sat outside on Broadway at 112th. An NYPD car swerved to avoid a taxi. The car jumped the curb. Metal and glass. Both diners and officers went to the hospital. The cabbie got a summons for failure to yield. Police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/nypd-car-hits-two-pedestrians-while-trying-to-avoid-crash-into-manhattan-taxi/>said it was unclear if the officers were responding to a call when the incident occurred; an investigation is underway</a>.</p><p><strong>In the last twelve months, five people died on District 7 streets.

The numbers do not flinch.</p><h3 id=what-has-shaun-abreu-done>What Has Shaun Abreu Done?</h3><p>Council Member Shaun Abreu has signed on to bills that matter. He co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, which pushes for lower speed limits and more rights for crash victims. He backed a <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>law to ban parking near crosswalks</a>, to keep sightlines clear. He voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable. He called out the city for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/25/eyes-on-the-street-greenway-detour-is-a-hilly-confusing-danger-zone>unsafe detours that forced cyclists into danger</a>. He did not oppose the <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/05/self-proclaimed-bus-lane-champion-gale-brewer-tries-to-tank-bus-lane>96th Street bus lane</a>, even as others tried to block it. He spoke up for <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/delivery-apps-in-nyc-could-be-held-responsible-for-workers-following-traffic-laws>holding delivery apps accountable for worker safety</a>. He pressed for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/06/04/pols-slam-city-for-giving-rogue-carters-permits-for-new-zones>safer waste truck contracts, saying cost should not come before lives</a>.</p><p>But laws and hearings do not bring back the dead. <strong>Every day without action is another day of risk.</strong></p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next? No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Call Council Member Abreu. Demand he push for daylighting at every corner, protected bike lanes, and a 20 mph speed limit citywide.</strong> Join with groups like <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> and <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Do not wait for another name to join the list. The street will not forgive delay.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The collision occurred at 2:54 a.m. Both the Jeep SUV and the e-bike were traveling north. The report states the cyclist was 'crushed in the face,' her blood spreading on the asphalt, while the Jeep showed 'no damage.' Police cited 'Following Too Closely' as a contributing factor on the part of the SUV driver. The report also lists 'Other Vehicular' as a contributing factor. The cyclist was not ejected.

The focus remains on the SUV driver’s failure to maintain a safe distance, resulting in devastating injuries to the vulnerable road user.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The city aims for citywide rollout.</p><p class=mb3>On February 24, 2025, Council Member Shaun Abreu announced support for a pilot in Manhattan’s Community Board 9, replacing sidewalk garbage bags with curbside containers. The Department of Sanitation (DSNY) will launch the program by June 1, 2025, with nearly 80% of apartments participating. The pilot, which follows earlier bin tests, repurposes parking spots for stationary bins. Abreu, co-sponsoring a bill with Council Member Crystal Hudson, called the shift 'a necessary public good' despite the loss of parking. The bill would require on-street containers for buildings with 10 or more units citywide by 2032. Advocates and DSNY officials highlight the benefit for pedestrians: 'People don’t want garbage on the sidewalk, and it makes perfect sense to put it in the roadway.' The pilot will run for a year, aiming to clear sidewalks and improve safety for those on foot.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No clear resolution.</p><p class=mb3>On September 5, 2024, Council Member Shaun Abreu of District 7 joined Upper West Side residents in questioning the Department of Transportation's plan for a 24/7 offset bus lane on 96th Street. The DOT proposal, intended to speed up the M96 bus for 15,000 daily riders, would repurpose a travel lane in each direction while preserving curb parking. Abreu stated, "I wouldn’t say I’m opposed or in favor at this point," but called for more clarity and adjustments from DOT. The matter, described as a push to 'torpedo planned bus lane on 96th Street,' has drawn support from East Side's Community Board 8 and opposition from West Side locals and Council Member Gale Brewer, who suggested alternatives like bus signal priority. The debate centers on balancing transit improvements with residential curb access. No formal committee action or safety analysis has been reported.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She cited parking and speed concerns. DOT said parking stays. Advocates called her out for ignoring slow buses and 15,000 daily riders. Brewer claimed support for bus lanes elsewhere.</p><p class=mb3>On September 5, 2024, Council Member Gale Brewer publicly opposed a dedicated bus lane on West 96th Street at a rally. The matter, described as a 'City Council member public statement/rally regarding bus lane project,' saw Brewer call on DOT to remove two blocks from the crosstown bus lane plan, citing the area's 'residential character' and questioning the need due to 'current bus speeds.' Brewer, who once backed bus lanes on 14th, 34th, and 181st Streets, now argued for alternatives and said, 'I'm a bus rider who takes this bus every day. It's not slow.' DOT countered that parking would be preserved and loading zones added. Transit advocates criticized Brewer for ignoring data on slow westbound buses and the needs of 15,000 daily riders. Council Member Shaun Abreu, who represents the district, did not attend and stated he does not oppose the bus lane. No formal safety analyst assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
