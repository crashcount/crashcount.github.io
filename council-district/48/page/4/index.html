Nine were seriously hurt. Six people died in the same period last year. The victims are not just numbers. They are children, elders, cyclists, neighbors. <strong>SUVs and cars did most of the harm</strong>—six deaths, 376 minor injuries, 122 moderate injuries, and four serious injuries. Trucks and buses killed three more. Bikes and mopeds injured, but did not kill. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data tracks these crashes</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-delays-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Votes, Delays, and Missed Chances</h3><p>Council Member Inna Vernikov has voted for some safety bills—removing abandoned vehicles, speeding up traffic studies, and requiring pavement markings. She co-sponsored a bill to add speed humps near parks. But when it mattered most, she stood in the way. Vernikov <strong>opposed 24/7 speed cameras in school zones</strong> and called them a scheme to &ldquo;take away more of our hard-earned money&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/15/trump-loving-anti-camera-pol-has-23-school-zone-speeding-tickets>according to Streetsblog NYC</a>.

Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers. It shifts blame from people on foot to the system and those behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The police report lists the contributing factors as 'unspecified' and does not identify any specific driver errors or actions by other vehicles. The victim's behavior—seatbelt nonuse—is noted in the report, but no evidence is provided that this contributed to the fatality. The circumstances surrounding the impact and the source of the collision remain unaddressed in the police report, leaving the systemic dangers of parked-vehicle crashes and the vulnerability of occupants in the urban landscape starkly evident.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The collision occurred as the e-bike rider was making a left turn, while the BMW was traveling straight ahead. The report lists 'Turning Improperly' as a contributing factor in the crash. The impact ejected the cyclist, causing fatal head injuries described as 'crush injuries.' The police report notes the victim was not wearing a helmet, but this detail is mentioned only after the driver error.
