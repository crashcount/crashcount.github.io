On May 21, 2025, Council Member Inna Vernikov posted that DOT was “PAUSING” lanes after “conversations and advocacy.” The project had years behind it. Streetsblog documented the halt and the board’s earlier support. Read the report: <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/proudly-anti-safety-brooklyn-pol-boasts-of-getting-dot-to-pause-long-promised-bike-lanes>“Proudly Anti-Safety”</a>.</p><p>Cameras that catch speeders? Vernikov voted against expanding them in 2022, even as her vehicle amassed school-zone speeding tickets. The record: <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/15/trump-loving-anti-camera-pol-has-23-school-zone-speeding-tickets>23 tickets and a no vote</a>. The Council still advanced 24/7 cameras that year, as covered by the <a href=https://nypost.com/2022/05/26/nyc-council-signs-off-on-24-7-speed-enforcement-cameras/>Post</a>.</p><p>On daylighting, DOT pushed a report that claimed high costs and little gain, which fueled fresh opposition from Vernikov and others.

Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers.
