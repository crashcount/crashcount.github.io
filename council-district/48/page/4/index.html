The incident occurred mid-block, away from any intersection or signal. The report describes head trauma and severe bleeding, with the victim dying at the scene, caught between the curb and the car’s front end. The police narrative states the pedestrian was 'crossing mid-block without a signal.' The vehicle’s point of impact and damage were both centered on the front end, consistent with a direct collision. The report lists 'unspecified' as the contributing factor for both driver and pedestrian, offering no further detail on driver actions. The focus remains on the lethal interaction between a moving sedan and a vulnerable pedestrian in daylight, with the system’s gaps leaving another life lost on Brooklyn’s streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
