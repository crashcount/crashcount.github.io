The board demanded more parking, ignoring transit and non-drivers. Council Member Vernikov opposed the project. More parking means more cars, more danger for people on foot and bike.</p><p class=mb3>On February 18, 2025, Brooklyn Community Board 15 rejected a rezoning proposal at 2510 Coney Island Ave. The board’s vote came after the developer slashed housing units and promised a one-to-one parking ratio. The official matter focused on 'excessive illegal parking—including by the local police precinct.' CB15 Chair Theresa Scavo said, 'If we allow this rezoning every property owner on that block will continue to do the same thing, causing more backups and more traffic.' Council Member Inna Vernikov, through her legislative director, voiced strong opposition, prioritizing parking over new housing. Borough President Antonio Reynoso criticized the parking mandate, warning it 'traps neighborhoods in car dependent development patterns.' Advocates argued the board ignored transit options and the needs of non-drivers.
