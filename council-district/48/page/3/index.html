An officer’s pelvis shattered in a midnight crash on Coney Island Avenue. A cyclist thrown from his bike, dead before the ambulance arrived. In District 48, the violence is not sudden. It is steady. <strong>Fifteen people have died on these streets since 2022.</strong> Over 2,100 have been injured. Five suffered wounds so grave they may never walk the same. The numbers are not just numbers. They are mothers, brothers, children, neighbors.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars did most of the damage.</strong> Trucks and buses followed. Bikes and mopeds, almost none. The old and the young are not spared. In the last year, 78 children were hurt. The elderly are struck crossing the same corners they have known for decades. The city records the facts, but the pain lingers in hospital rooms and empty chairs.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-delays-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Votes, Delays, and Missed Chances</h3><p>Council Member Inna Vernikov has acted, but not always for the most vulnerable. She voted <strong>against ending jaywalking enforcement</strong>, a law that would have stopped blaming walkers for their own deaths. She worked to <strong>pause bike lanes</strong> that would have given cyclists a fighting chance. Vernikov’s car has been caught speeding in school zones <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/15/trump-loving-anti-camera-pol-has-23-school-zone-speeding-tickets>23 times</a>. She called speed cameras a scheme to &ldquo;take away more of our hard-earned money.&rdquo; Still, she has backed some safety bills—like adding speed humps near parks and supporting a citywide greenway plan. But when it matters most, she stands in the way. As one safety analyst <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/proudly-anti-safety-brooklyn-pol-boasts-of-getting-dot-to-pause-long-promised-bike-lanes>warned</a>, <strong>&ldquo;Opposition to even basic bike infrastructure like painted lanes discourages mode shift, reduces safety in numbers, and maintains street conditions that are inequitable and dangerous for vulnerable road users.&rdquo;</strong></p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay, every vote against safety, every blocked bike lane is a choice. <strong>Call your council member. Demand safer streets. Demand action.</strong> Do not wait for another siren in the night. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill seeks to amend city law to "establish a reward for individuals who provide information leading to the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of a person who seriously injures or kills another individual in a hit-and-run accident." Council Member Rita C. Joseph leads as primary sponsor, joined by Brooks-Powers, Narcisse, Vernikov, Louis, Bottcher, Hudson, Gennaro, and Williams. The bill authorizes the mayor, on the police commissioner's recommendation, to offer up to $1,000 for actionable tips. Law enforcement and city or state employees are excluded. The bill responds to the grim fact that many hit-and-runs go unsolved, leaving victims and families without answers. It aims to break the code of silence and help bring reckless drivers to justice.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident occurred mid-block, away from any intersection or signal. The report describes head trauma and severe bleeding, with the victim dying at the scene, caught between the curb and the car’s front end. The police narrative states the pedestrian was 'crossing mid-block without a signal.' The vehicle’s point of impact and damage were both centered on the front end, consistent with a direct collision. The report lists 'unspecified' as the contributing factor for both driver and pedestrian, offering no further detail on driver actions. The focus remains on the lethal interaction between a moving sedan and a vulnerable pedestrian in daylight, with the system’s gaps leaving another life lost on Brooklyn’s streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
