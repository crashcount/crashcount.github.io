An officer’s pelvis shattered in a midnight crash on Coney Island Avenue. A cyclist thrown from his bike, dead before the ambulance arrived. In District 48, the violence is not sudden. It is steady. <strong>Fifteen people have died on these streets since 2022.</strong> Over 2,100 have been injured. Five suffered wounds so grave they may never walk the same. The numbers are not just numbers. They are mothers, brothers, children, neighbors.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars did most of the damage.</strong> Trucks and buses followed. Bikes and mopeds, almost none. The old and the young are not spared. In the last year, 78 children were hurt. The elderly are struck crossing the same corners they have known for decades. The city records the facts, but the pain lingers in hospital rooms and empty chairs.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-delays-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Votes, Delays, and Missed Chances</h3><p>Council Member Inna Vernikov has acted, but not always for the most vulnerable. She voted <strong>against ending jaywalking enforcement</strong>, a law that would have stopped blaming walkers for their own deaths. She worked to <strong>pause bike lanes</strong> that would have given cyclists a fighting chance. Vernikov’s car has been caught speeding in school zones <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/15/trump-loving-anti-camera-pol-has-23-school-zone-speeding-tickets>23 times</a>. She called speed cameras a scheme to &ldquo;take away more of our hard-earned money.&rdquo; Still, she has backed some safety bills—like adding speed humps near parks and supporting a citywide greenway plan. But when it matters most, she stands in the way. As one safety analyst <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/proudly-anti-safety-brooklyn-pol-boasts-of-getting-dot-to-pause-long-promised-bike-lanes>warned</a>, <strong>&ldquo;Opposition to even basic bike infrastructure like painted lanes discourages mode shift, reduces safety in numbers, and maintains street conditions that are inequitable and dangerous for vulnerable road users.&rdquo;</strong></p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay, every vote against safety, every blocked bike lane is a choice. <strong>Call your council member. Demand safer streets. Demand action.</strong> Do not wait for another siren in the night. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable.

The police report lists the contributing factors as 'unspecified' and does not identify any specific driver errors or actions by other vehicles. The victim's behavior—seatbelt nonuse—is noted in the report, but no evidence is provided that this contributed to the fatality. The circumstances surrounding the impact and the source of the collision remain unaddressed in the police report, leaving the systemic dangers of parked-vehicle crashes and the vulnerability of occupants in the urban landscape starkly evident.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The collision occurred as the e-bike rider was making a left turn, while the BMW was traveling straight ahead. The report lists 'Turning Improperly' as a contributing factor in the crash. The impact ejected the cyclist, causing fatal head injuries described as 'crush injuries.' The police report notes the victim was not wearing a helmet, but this detail is mentioned only after the driver error. The violence of the crash and the fatal outcome underscore the lethal consequences when drivers fail to yield or turn improperly. The report makes no mention of any contributing actions by the cyclist beyond his direction of travel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The narrative states, 'A westbound Kia struck him head-on. He flew from the bike. No helmet. Head trauma. Blood on the pavement. The SUV’s bumper cracked. He died where he fell.' The police report lists the contributing factors for both parties as 'Unspecified.' The cyclist was ejected from his bike and suffered fatal head injuries. The SUV’s point of impact was the left front bumper, consistent with a direct, forceful collision. The report does not cite any cyclist behavior as a contributing factor before listing helmet use. The crash underscores the lethal consequences when drivers and vulnerable road users collide on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
