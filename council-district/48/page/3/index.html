He survived. The street did not yield. Police are still investigating. There is no word yet on how it happened. The boy is in stable condition. The driver kept going.

No deaths this year, but six last year. The dead are mostly old, mostly walking. The injured are everyone. SUVs and cars did the most harm—six deaths, over 500 injuries. Trucks and buses killed three. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes hurt fewer, but the toll is steady.</p><h3 id=council-member-vernikov-votes-delays-and-missed-chances>Council Member Vernikov: Votes, Delays, and Missed Chances</h3><p>Council Member Inna Vernikov has voted for some safety bills—removing abandoned cars, speeding up traffic studies, and requiring pavement markings. She co-sponsored a bill to force faster removal of sidewalk hazards. But when it mattered most, she stood in the way. She boasted of getting DOT to pause long-promised bike lanes in Southern Brooklyn. &ldquo;Happy to say as a result of our conversations and advocacy, @NYC_DOT is PAUSING implementation of bike lanes,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/proudly-anti-safety-brooklyn-pol-boasts-of-getting-dot-to-pause-long-promised-bike-lanes>she announced</a>.

The official matter focused on 'excessive illegal parking—including by the local police precinct.' CB15 Chair Theresa Scavo said, 'If we allow this rezoning every property owner on that block will continue to do the same thing, causing more backups and more traffic.' Council Member Inna Vernikov, through her legislative director, voiced strong opposition, prioritizing parking over new housing. Borough President Antonio Reynoso criticized the parking mandate, warning it 'traps neighborhoods in car dependent development patterns.' Advocates argued the board ignored transit options and the needs of non-drivers.
