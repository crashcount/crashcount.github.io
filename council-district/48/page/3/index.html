He survived. The street did not yield. Police are still investigating. There is no word yet on how it happened. The boy is in stable condition. The driver kept going.

No deaths this year, but six last year. The dead are mostly old, mostly walking. The injured are everyone. SUVs and cars did the most harm—six deaths, over 500 injuries. Trucks and buses killed three. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes hurt fewer, but the toll is steady.</p><h3 id=council-member-vernikov-votes-delays-and-missed-chances>Council Member Vernikov: Votes, Delays, and Missed Chances</h3><p>Council Member Inna Vernikov has voted for some safety bills—removing abandoned cars, speeding up traffic studies, and requiring pavement markings. She co-sponsored a bill to force faster removal of sidewalk hazards. But when it mattered most, she stood in the way. She boasted of getting DOT to pause long-promised bike lanes in Southern Brooklyn. &ldquo;Happy to say as a result of our conversations and advocacy, @NYC_DOT is PAUSING implementation of bike lanes,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/proudly-anti-safety-brooklyn-pol-boasts-of-getting-dot-to-pause-long-promised-bike-lanes>she announced</a>.

The article notes this intersection is known for frequent stop sign violations: "It's not a unicorn incident. It's happened a lot." The piece highlights systemic issues, including delivery app pressures and gaps in e-bike regulation. City data shows e-bikes account for less than 2% of traffic deaths, but the policy debate continues.

More parking means more cars, more danger for people on foot and bike.</p><p class=mb3>On February 18, 2025, Brooklyn Community Board 15 rejected a rezoning proposal at 2510 Coney Island Ave. The board’s vote came after the developer slashed housing units and promised a one-to-one parking ratio. The official matter focused on 'excessive illegal parking—including by the local police precinct.' CB15 Chair Theresa Scavo said, 'If we allow this rezoning every property owner on that block will continue to do the same thing, causing more backups and more traffic.' Council Member Inna Vernikov, through her legislative director, voiced strong opposition, prioritizing parking over new housing. Borough President Antonio Reynoso criticized the parking mandate, warning it 'traps neighborhoods in car dependent development patterns.' Advocates argued the board ignored transit options and the needs of non-drivers. The City Council is expected to reject the project, blocking new homes and locking in car dominance.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
