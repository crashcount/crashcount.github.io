Over two thousand injured. In District 48, the numbers do not lie. They do not soften. They do not forgive. In the last twelve months, <strong>776 people were hurt in 1,149 crashes</strong>. Five were left with injuries so grave they may never walk the same. The dead include the old, the young, the ones who never saw it coming. A man, 87, pinned under an MTA bus at East 12th and Avenue Z. He was standing near the corner. The bus turned. He did not get up. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-87-is-critically-injured-after-mta-bus-driver-strikes-him-in-brooklyn-nypd>Police found him there</a>.</p><p>On Ocean Parkway, a mother and her two daughters were killed by a driver with <strong>93 violations and a suspended license</strong>. The family that survived is left with pain, fear, and scars that will not heal. &ldquo;Shakhzod described ongoing back pain and fears of another accident,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/brooklyn-deadly-crash-family-survived-accident-midwood-weekend-left-traumatized/16117277/>reported ABC7</a>.</p><p><strong>SUVs and trucks do most of the killing.</strong> They crush, they do not yield. The city’s own data shows it. The blood dries, but the danger stays.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-delays-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Votes, Delays, and Missed Chances</h3><p>Council Member Inna Vernikov has stood on both sides of the line. She voted for a citywide greenway plan—<strong>a step toward safer routes for those not in cars</strong>. She co-sponsored bills for speed humps near parks and for rewards to catch hit-and-run drivers. But when it mattered most, she voted <strong>against ending jaywalking enforcement</strong>—a law that would have stopped blaming people for crossing the street and started blaming the street for killing them. She opposed the expansion of bike lanes, calling it a &ldquo;woke agenda,&rdquo; and celebrated when the city paused a long-promised safety project. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/proudly-anti-safety-brooklyn-pol-boasts-of-getting-dot-to-pause-long-promised-bike-lanes>She said so herself</a>.</p><p>Her own car has been caught speeding in school zones <strong>23 times</strong>.

It can build the bike lanes, redesign the deadly intersections, and keep the cameras rolling. But it will not happen unless the people demand it. Call your council member. Call the mayor. Stand with the families who have lost too much. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The boy screamed in pain, his foot run over. The intersection is notorious for crashes. Streets near schools remain deadly, especially for children of color.</p><p class=mb3>On September 15, 2022, a hit-and-run driver injured a 10-year-old boy at W. 20th Street and Mermaid Avenue in Coney Island. The boy, walking home from school with his grandmother, was struck as the driver sped through a red light and fled the scene. Witnesses described chaos and pain. Streetsblog reports, 'streets near schools are more dangerous on average than other city streets.' Council Member Inna Vernikov, whose district includes the area, was recently caught speeding in school zones 23 times. Data shows a 57% higher crash rate and 25% more injuries per mile near schools during peak hours. The danger is worse outside schools serving mostly students of color. The 60th Precinct, where the crash occurred, has seen 711 crashes this year, injuring 57 pedestrians and 26 cyclists. Systemic neglect and reckless driving keep children at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She voted against the Council’s home rule message to expand New York’s speed camera program, which would allow 24/7 automated enforcement. Vernikov called speed cameras a scheme to 'take away more of our hard-earned money.' The bill, debated in September 2022, was opposed by Vernikov and others, despite rising traffic deaths. Her car also received 31 non-moving violations, including parking at fire hydrants and in bus lanes. Democratic challenger Amber Adler and StreetsPAC’s Eric McClure condemned Vernikov’s driving and her vote, saying she endangers constituents. Vernikov has advocated for armed guards and mental health reforms in schools, but opposes proven traffic safety measures.

The bill aimed to amend the city code to 'establish a reward for individuals who provide information leading to the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of a person who seriously injures or kills another individual in a hit-and-run accident.' Council Member Rita C. Joseph sponsored the bill, joined by sixteen co-sponsors including Brooks-Powers, Narcisse, Vernikov, and others. The bill would have authorized up to $1,000 for information leading to the capture of hit-and-run drivers, but excluded law enforcement and city employees from eligibility. The measure was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023.
