He survived. The street did not yield. Police are still investigating. There is no word yet on how it happened. The boy is in stable condition. The driver kept going.

No deaths this year, but six last year. The dead are mostly old, mostly walking. The injured are everyone. SUVs and cars did the most harm—six deaths, over 500 injuries. Trucks and buses killed three. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes hurt fewer, but the toll is steady.</p><h3 id=council-member-vernikov-votes-delays-and-missed-chances>Council Member Vernikov: Votes, Delays, and Missed Chances</h3><p>Council Member Inna Vernikov has voted for some safety bills—removing abandoned cars, speeding up traffic studies, and requiring pavement markings. She co-sponsored a bill to force faster removal of sidewalk hazards. But when it mattered most, she stood in the way. She boasted of getting DOT to pause long-promised bike lanes in Southern Brooklyn. &ldquo;Happy to say as a result of our conversations and advocacy, @NYC_DOT is PAUSING implementation of bike lanes,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/proudly-anti-safety-brooklyn-pol-boasts-of-getting-dot-to-pause-long-promised-bike-lanes>she announced</a>.

Vernikov announced, 'Happy to say as a result of our conversations and advocacy, @NYC_DOT is PAUSING implementation of bike lanes.' Despite near-unanimous community board support and DOT's safety pledges, Vernikov opposed the project, calling it a 'woke agenda.' Only a portion of the lanes will proceed. Safety analysts warn: 'Opposition to even basic bike infrastructure like painted lanes discourages mode shift, reduces safety in numbers, and maintains street conditions that are inequitable and dangerous for vulnerable road users.'

Police set a roadblock. An officer fired. The driver crashed, then died at the hospital. Sirens filled the night. The chase ended in blood and broken glass on Brooklyn streets.</p><p class=mb3>CBS New York reported on April 30, 2025, that a New York City police officer shot and killed a driver near the Belt Parkway in Brooklyn. Police identified a stolen Porsche, attempted a traffic stop, and set up a roadblock after the car evaded officers. According to the article, "Police say that officer fired one shot, striking the driver." The driver then crashed into an NYPD vehicle and later died at the hospital. A passenger was taken into custody. The incident drew a large police response, with one witness describing, "30 cops, oh my god, 40 cops, that's insane." The report highlights high-speed movement, a roadblock, and the use of deadly force. No officers were struck, but the event underscores risks in police pursuits and the dangers posed by fleeing vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article notes, 'A few weeks ago, one of those [recidivist] drivers sped through a red light and killed a mother and her two young daughters.' Most fines go unpaid. Advocates urge Albany to pass the 'Stop Super Speeders Bill,' which would require speed limiters for drivers with six or more automated tickets in a year. Data show vehicles with over 20 violations are five times likelier to cause deadly or severe crashes. Some legislators resist, arguing ticket thresholds are too low.
