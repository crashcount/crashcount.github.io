On May 21, 2025, Council Member Inna Vernikov posted that DOT was “PAUSING” lanes after “conversations and advocacy.” The project had years behind it. Streetsblog documented the halt and the board’s earlier support. Read the report: <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/proudly-anti-safety-brooklyn-pol-boasts-of-getting-dot-to-pause-long-promised-bike-lanes>“Proudly Anti-Safety”</a>.</p><p>Cameras that catch speeders? Vernikov voted against expanding them in 2022, even as her vehicle amassed school-zone speeding tickets. The record: <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/15/trump-loving-anti-camera-pol-has-23-school-zone-speeding-tickets>23 tickets and a no vote</a>. The Council still advanced 24/7 cameras that year, as covered by the <a href=https://nypost.com/2022/05/26/nyc-council-signs-off-on-24-7-speed-enforcement-cameras/>Post</a>.</p><p>On daylighting, DOT pushed a report that claimed high costs and little gain, which fueled fresh opposition from Vernikov and others.

Barriers force drivers to slow, protect cyclists, and clear sightlines. Seventy-nine crashes last year on Ocean Avenue alone. The city moves slow, but hard edges cut risk where cars once ruled.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC reported on June 12, 2025, that the Department of Transportation will install hard barriers at six Brooklyn intersections to protect cyclists and pedestrians. The new design 'daylights' corners, using concrete, granite, and planters to keep cars back and create mini-protected bike lanes. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' The agency targeted intersections with a history of turning crashes—Ocean Avenue saw 79 crashes in 2024, injuring 75 people, including 15 pedestrians and 13 cyclists. Advocates praised the move but called for faster, broader use of hard infrastructure. The article notes that most pedestrian injuries and deaths in New York occur at intersections, and that keeping corners clear is standard in other states. DOT opposes removing parking without barriers, citing risks of faster, more dangerous turns.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Despite near-unanimous community board support and DOT's safety pledges, Vernikov opposed the project, calling it a 'woke agenda.' Only a portion of the lanes will proceed.

Grief and anger fill Brooklyn.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC (May 2, 2025) reports on the fatal crash that killed a mother and two children on Ocean Parkway. The driver, Miriam Yarimi, had 'a lengthy record of speeding' and a recent camera violation. Despite her suspended license, no law prevented her from driving. The article highlights the 'Stop Super Speeders' bill, which would require speed limiter devices for drivers with six or more camera violations in a year. Amber Adler, a local advocate, calls Ocean Parkway a 'safety menace' and urges passage of the bill. The crash exposes gaps in enforcement and policy, leaving repeat offenders unchecked and vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
