He survived. The street did not yield. Police are still investigating. There is no word yet on how it happened. The boy is in stable condition. The driver kept going.

No deaths this year, but six last year. The dead are mostly old, mostly walking. The injured are everyone. SUVs and cars did the most harm—six deaths, over 500 injuries. Trucks and buses killed three. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes hurt fewer, but the toll is steady.</p><h3 id=council-member-vernikov-votes-delays-and-missed-chances>Council Member Vernikov: Votes, Delays, and Missed Chances</h3><p>Council Member Inna Vernikov has voted for some safety bills—removing abandoned cars, speeding up traffic studies, and requiring pavement markings. She co-sponsored a bill to force faster removal of sidewalk hazards. But when it mattered most, she stood in the way. She boasted of getting DOT to pause long-promised bike lanes in Southern Brooklyn. &ldquo;Happy to say as a result of our conversations and advocacy, @NYC_DOT is PAUSING implementation of bike lanes,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/proudly-anti-safety-brooklyn-pol-boasts-of-getting-dot-to-pause-long-promised-bike-lanes>she announced</a>.

The project, four years in the making, aimed to address high crash rates and poor bike network coverage. Vernikov announced, 'Happy to say as a result of our conversations and advocacy, @NYC_DOT is PAUSING implementation of bike lanes.' Despite near-unanimous community board support and DOT's safety pledges, Vernikov opposed the project, calling it a 'woke agenda.' Only a portion of the lanes will proceed. Safety analysts warn: 'Opposition to even basic bike infrastructure like painted lanes discourages mode shift, reduces safety in numbers, and maintains street conditions that are inequitable and dangerous for vulnerable road users.' Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The driver, Miriam Yarimi, had 'a lengthy record of speeding' and a recent camera violation. Despite her suspended license, no law prevented her from driving. The article highlights the 'Stop Super Speeders' bill, which would require speed limiter devices for drivers with six or more camera violations in a year. Amber Adler, a local advocate, calls Ocean Parkway a 'safety menace' and urges passage of the bill.
