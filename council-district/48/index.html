On May 21, 2025, Council Member Inna Vernikov posted that DOT was “PAUSING” lanes after “conversations and advocacy.” The project had years behind it. Streetsblog documented the halt and the board’s earlier support.

Vernikov voted against expanding them in 2022, even as her vehicle amassed school-zone speeding tickets. The record: <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/15/trump-loving-anti-camera-pol-has-23-school-zone-speeding-tickets>23 tickets and a no vote</a>. The Council still advanced 24/7 cameras that year, as covered by the <a href=https://nypost.com/2022/05/26/nyc-council-signs-off-on-24-7-speed-enforcement-cameras/>Post</a>.</p><p>On daylighting, DOT pushed a report that claimed high costs and little gain, which fueled fresh opposition from Vernikov and others.

Cyclists described the decision as political, with one saying, "There’s a very important voting bloc that’s using their leverage over the mayor to remove the bike lane."
