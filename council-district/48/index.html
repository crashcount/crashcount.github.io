An officer’s pelvis shattered in a midnight crash on Coney Island Avenue. A cyclist thrown from his bike, dead before the ambulance arrived. In District 48, the violence is not sudden. It is steady. <strong>Fifteen people have died on these streets since 2022.</strong> Over 2,100 have been injured. Five suffered wounds so grave they may never walk the same. The numbers are not just numbers. They are mothers, brothers, children, neighbors.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars did most of the damage.</strong> Trucks and buses followed. Bikes and mopeds, almost none. The old and the young are not spared. In the last year, 78 children were hurt. The elderly are struck crossing the same corners they have known for decades. The city records the facts, but the pain lingers in hospital rooms and empty chairs.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-delays-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Votes, Delays, and Missed Chances</h3><p>Council Member Inna Vernikov has acted, but not always for the most vulnerable. She voted <strong>against ending jaywalking enforcement</strong>, a law that would have stopped blaming walkers for their own deaths. She worked to <strong>pause bike lanes</strong> that would have given cyclists a fighting chance. Vernikov’s car has been caught speeding in school zones <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/15/trump-loving-anti-camera-pol-has-23-school-zone-speeding-tickets>23 times</a>. She called speed cameras a scheme to &ldquo;take away more of our hard-earned money.&rdquo; Still, she has backed some safety bills—like adding speed humps near parks and supporting a citywide greenway plan. But when it matters most, she stands in the way. As one safety analyst <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/proudly-anti-safety-brooklyn-pol-boasts-of-getting-dot-to-pause-long-promised-bike-lanes>warned</a>, <strong>&ldquo;Opposition to even basic bike infrastructure like painted lanes discourages mode shift, reduces safety in numbers, and maintains street conditions that are inequitable and dangerous for vulnerable road users.&rdquo;</strong></p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay, every vote against safety, every blocked bike lane is a choice. <strong>Call your council member. Demand safer streets. Demand action.</strong> Do not wait for another siren in the night. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The official matter focused on 'excessive illegal parking—including by the local police precinct.' CB15 Chair Theresa Scavo said, 'If we allow this rezoning every property owner on that block will continue to do the same thing, causing more backups and more traffic.' Council Member Inna Vernikov, through her legislative director, voiced strong opposition, prioritizing parking over new housing. Borough President Antonio Reynoso criticized the parking mandate, warning it 'traps neighborhoods in car dependent development patterns.' Advocates argued the board ignored transit options and the needs of non-drivers.

The driver was licensed.</p><p class=mb3>A 70-year-old pedestrian was killed on Kings Highway when an eastbound SUV struck him head-on, according to the police report. The incident occurred as the man stepped into the street, not at an intersection and without a crossing signal, as detailed in the report: 'A 70-year-old man stepped into the street without a signal. An eastbound SUV struck him head-on. He died from head and internal wounds. The driver held a license. The bumper bore the mark where he fell.' The vehicle involved was a 2023 Acura SUV, traveling straight ahead with two occupants. The point of impact was the center front end, and the right front bumper showed damage. The police report lists 'Unspecified' as the contributing factors for both the driver and the pedestrian, and does not cite any specific driver error. The pedestrian’s action—crossing without a signal or crosswalk—is noted after the absence of identified driver errors. The report does not mention any additional contributing factors or behaviors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

No contributing factors are attributed to the victim. The report details the impact sequence and the fatal consequences for the elderly driver, underscoring the lethal risk when control of a vehicle is lost.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
