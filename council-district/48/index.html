On May 21, 2025, Council Member Inna Vernikov posted that DOT was “PAUSING” lanes after “conversations and advocacy.” The project had years behind it. Streetsblog documented the halt and the board’s earlier support. Read the report: <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/proudly-anti-safety-brooklyn-pol-boasts-of-getting-dot-to-pause-long-promised-bike-lanes>“Proudly Anti-Safety”</a>.</p><p>Cameras that catch speeders? Vernikov voted against expanding them in 2022, even as her vehicle amassed school-zone speeding tickets. The record: <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/15/trump-loving-anti-camera-pol-has-23-school-zone-speeding-tickets>23 tickets and a no vote</a>. The Council still advanced 24/7 cameras that year, as covered by the <a href=https://nypost.com/2022/05/26/nyc-council-signs-off-on-24-7-speed-enforcement-cameras/>Post</a>.</p><p>On daylighting, DOT pushed a report that claimed high costs and little gain, which fueled fresh opposition from Vernikov and others.

According to the police report, the contributing factor was “Driver Inattention/Distraction.” The sedan showed left-front bumper impact; the scooter took a center-front hit. Driver inattention is the cited error. The scooter operator is listed as unlicensed, and no safety equipment was recorded for him; these follow the driver error in the report’s findings.

The lane, installed in October, had reduced crashes, according to DOT data. Plaintiffs argued removal would increase danger and violated city rules on public notice. The city’s lawyers dismissed its own safety data, claiming it was unreliable. Alexa Sledge of Transportation Alternatives warned, “Mayor Adams is exposing the City of New York...to significant financial and legal liability.” Attorney Peter Beadle urged Adams to let DOT implement safer alternatives.

The lane calmed a deadly stretch. Drivers still parked illegally. Children darted into traffic. Now, cyclists and pedestrians face more danger. Policy shifts, safety slips. Streets stay lethal.</p><p class=mb3>Streetsblog NYC reported on June 13, 2025, that Mayor Adams will remove the protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue, a corridor known for high crash rates. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'before this bike lane from 2018 to 2022 this is the area that had the second largest numbers of pedestrian fatalities and crashes in the city.' The lane faced opposition from some Hasidic leaders, citing children running into the lane from illegally parked cars and buses. Despite tweaks—school bus zones, daylighted corners, no standing areas—drivers kept parking illegally, blocking sightlines and endangering children. The city rarely removes protected lanes, but Adams acted after political pressure. Moving the lane to Classon Avenue, as some demand, would force cyclists onto a chaotic BQE ramp. The decision highlights persistent driver violations and policy gaps that leave vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT’s Chris Brunson said, “The narrower street width for vehicles will de-incentivize double parking on the corridor.” The redesign removes a travel lane, adds a protected bike lane, and aims to curb driver behavior that leads to crashes. Between 2022 and 2024, 165 crashes on this mile-long stretch caused one death and injured 15 cyclists and 23 pedestrians. Most pedestrian injuries happened while crossing with the light, showing drivers failed to yield. The plan targets excess road capacity and prioritizes vulnerable users on a Vision Zero Priority Corridor.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
