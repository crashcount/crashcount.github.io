An officer’s pelvis shattered in a midnight crash on Coney Island Avenue. A cyclist thrown from his bike, dead before the ambulance arrived. In District 48, the violence is not sudden. It is steady. <strong>Fifteen people have died on these streets since 2022.</strong> Over 2,100 have been injured. Five suffered wounds so grave they may never walk the same. The numbers are not just numbers. They are mothers, brothers, children, neighbors.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars did most of the damage.</strong> Trucks and buses followed. Bikes and mopeds, almost none. The old and the young are not spared. In the last year, 78 children were hurt. The elderly are struck crossing the same corners they have known for decades. The city records the facts, but the pain lingers in hospital rooms and empty chairs.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-delays-and-missed-chances>Leadership: Votes, Delays, and Missed Chances</h3><p>Council Member Inna Vernikov has acted, but not always for the most vulnerable. She voted <strong>against ending jaywalking enforcement</strong>, a law that would have stopped blaming walkers for their own deaths. She worked to <strong>pause bike lanes</strong> that would have given cyclists a fighting chance. Vernikov’s car has been caught speeding in school zones <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/15/trump-loving-anti-camera-pol-has-23-school-zone-speeding-tickets>23 times</a>. She called speed cameras a scheme to &ldquo;take away more of our hard-earned money.&rdquo; Still, she has backed some safety bills—like adding speed humps near parks and supporting a citywide greenway plan. But when it matters most, she stands in the way. As one safety analyst <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/21/proudly-anti-safety-brooklyn-pol-boasts-of-getting-dot-to-pause-long-promised-bike-lanes>warned</a>, <strong>&ldquo;Opposition to even basic bike infrastructure like painted lanes discourages mode shift, reduces safety in numbers, and maintains street conditions that are inequitable and dangerous for vulnerable road users.&rdquo;</strong></p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay, every vote against safety, every blocked bike lane is a choice. <strong>Call your council member. Demand safer streets. Demand action.</strong> Do not wait for another siren in the night. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The city issued over 3,000 warnings during a 90-day grace period. Similar enforcement on Queens-bound trucks led to a 60% drop in overweight vehicles.

The judge found City Hall 'acted arbitrarily, capriciously, and illegally' by failing to consult local officials or the community. The city cited 'several dangerous incidents—many of which involved children getting seriously hurt' as the reason for the proposed removal, after a 3-year-old was struck by an e-bike in May.

The project aims to connect neighborhoods and calm traffic. DOT Assistant Director Dustin Khuu said the goal is a 'high performing transit priority street.' The plan includes concrete bus boarding islands and may reduce car lanes, giving more space to pedestrians and buses. However, the article notes gaps: 'DOT didn't share a block-by-block breakdown,' and curbside parking may remain, risking bus lane obstruction by double-parked vehicles. The city may physically protect the lane, but details are pending. The B41 bus, serving 28,000 daily trips, crawls at 4 mph during rush hour.

The city moves to fix a deadly, clogged corridor.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist reported on June 4, 2025, that New York City's Department of Transportation plans to overhaul Flatbush Avenue between Livingston Street and Grand Army Plaza. The redesign replaces two car lanes with 24/7 bus-only lanes and adds pedestrian islands. DOT officials said, 'almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles.' Since 2019, 55 people have been killed or severely injured in crashes along this stretch. The plan removes curbside parking and bans cars from bus lanes, aiming to speed up twelve bus routes and protect people on foot. Most residents in the area do not own cars and depend on slow buses. The proposal reflects a shift toward prioritizing vulnerable road users and addressing systemic danger on one of Brooklyn's busiest corridors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Vernikov announced, 'Happy to say as a result of our conversations and advocacy, @NYC_DOT is PAUSING implementation of bike lanes.' Despite near-unanimous community board support and DOT's safety pledges, Vernikov opposed the project, calling it a 'woke agenda.' Only a portion of the lanes will proceed. Safety analysts warn: 'Opposition to even basic bike infrastructure like painted lanes discourages mode shift, reduces safety in numbers, and maintains street conditions that are inequitable and dangerous for vulnerable road users.'
