Since 2022, District 25 has seen <strong>11 people killed</strong> and 1,737 injured in 3,470 crashes, with pedestrians hit in 481 of those injuries and four deaths. SUVs and cars led the harm to people on foot: 414 pedestrian injuries and eight serious injuries, including three deaths, came from them alone, per city data covering 2022–08/25/2025 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>On Northern Boulevard and 37th Avenue, the numbers don’t blink. Three people died around <a href=#>37th Avenue</a> and one around <a href=#>Northern Boulevard</a> in this period, with dozens more injured, according to the district roll‑up (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Broadway adds one death and 51 injuries. These are not anomalies. They are the map.</p><p>Speed and control failures run through the files. “Unsafe speed” appears in fatal records. “Traffic control disregarded.” “Distraction.” They’re small boxes on a form. They add up to funerals (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-corner-where-people-go-down>The corner where people go down</h3><p>At 90th Street and 37th Avenue, a 60‑year‑old woman was killed at the intersection. The report lists “Unsafe Speed” and “Traffic Control Disregarded.” She is marked “Apparent Death.” Time: 06:42. Date: Feb. 1, 2024 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data – CrashID 4699492</a>).</p><p>Five months later and a block off, a 44‑year‑old pedestrian died near 90th Street on 37th Avenue. The motorcycle entry shows “Passing Too Closely.” The sheet says “Killed.” Date: June 10, 2024 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data – CrashID 4731762</a>).</p><p>On Broadway at Roosevelt Avenue, a 75‑year‑old man was killed at the intersection by an e‑bike. The form says “Killed.” Time: 12:13. Date: Dec. 27, 2023 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data – CrashID 4695751</a>).</p><h3 id=when-the-day-turns-mean>When the day turns mean</h3><p>Crashes climb as the afternoon fills. Injuries peak from 2 p.m. through the commute. The 6 p.m. hour alone shows 121 injuries and three serious injuries in this district’s span. Deaths appear at 5 p.m., 6 p.m., and 7 p.m., too. The night is not kinder: deaths also hit at midnight, 1 a.m., and 11 p.m. (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data hourly distribution</a>).</p><p>Drivers hit people most. In this period, pedestrians suffered 481 injuries and nine serious injuries. Bicyclists were injured 233 times. “Failure to yield.” “Disregarded traffic control.” “Aggressive driving.” These are check marks in the city’s ledger. They match the street stories families tell later (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=known-danger-slow-fixes>Known danger, slow fixes</h3><p>Some fixes are on paper. The city’s open street on 34th Avenue—Paseo Park—cut injuries during hours it’s car‑free. DOT called the plan “bold.” Council Member Shekar Krishnan backed it: “This design improves pedestrian safety and expands accessibility for all people” (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/04/28/34th-ave-update-dot-presents-bold-plan-for-the-permanent-open-street-called-paseo-park>Streetsblog: 34th Avenue plan</a>).</p><p>Krishnan also pushed a bill to require vegetation on new bike‑lane medians, aiming to separate people from traffic flows (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1233-2025</a>). He voted to clear derelict cars faster—“abandoned vehicles” that block sightlines and crosswalks (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 0857-2024</a>). He co‑sponsored a daylighting bill to keep cars 20 feet back from crosswalks, and boost barriers from 100 to 1,000 intersections a year. The committee laid it over this spring (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1138-2024</a>).</p><p>The data says where to start here: daylight corners on <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>37th Avenue</a>, harden turns and add leading intervals on <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Northern Boulevard</a>, and enforce speed where evening injuries spike. Repeat the treatments at Broadway and 82nd Street, where injuries and serious injuries pile up in the logs (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=a-citywide-brake>A citywide brake</h3><p>The habit of speed is the through‑line. Two citywide levers stand within reach. Lower the default speed limit. Install speed limiters on the worst repeat offenders. These are the moves that meet the harm.</p><p>Albany renewed 24/7 school‑zone speed cameras through 2030. Advocates point to the next steps: use the city’s power to set lower limits and force technology onto the small group of drivers who do outsize damage. “Just 1.5% of motorists cause 21% of pedestrian deaths,” and vehicles with 16 camera tickets in a year are twice as likely to kill or seriously injure; at 30+ tickets the risk rises fifty‑fold (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/20/the-1-5-percent-of-drivers-who-cause-21-percent-of-pedestrian-deaths>Streetsblog analysis and call to action</a>).</p><p>We do not need another graph. We need less speed. Fewer chances to run a light. Fewer names in the log.</p><h3 id=what-officials-said>What officials said</h3><p>“Joseph Lee terrorized other drivers as he purposefully drove the wrong way on a busy Queens highway and crashed into multiple cars,” Queens DA Melinda Katz said after an eight‑year sentence in a separate Queens case of wrong‑way driving and intentional crashes (<a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY</a>).</p><p>Police on a different Queens fatal hit‑and‑run said: “The operator of the vehicle fled the scene after hitting the man.” No arrests. A body to claim. A car that kept going (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/police-investigate-hit-run-death-springfield-gardens-queens-john-kennedy-international-airport/17524816/>ABC7</a>; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-in-hit-and-run-near-jfk-airport-police-say>Gothamist</a>).</p><p>Take one step that matters.

She called for better enforcement. Other voices, including union leaders, echoed her concerns.

The Department of Transportation said all projects include emergency routes and are monitored. FDNY officials attributed delays to increased post-pandemic traffic, not street safety measures.

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'I am incredibly excited to build on the triumph of our thriving Open Streets program ... this Halloween, providing greater access to safer, shared community spaces.' Assembly Member Catalina Cruz and Council Member Shekar Krishnan backed the move, stressing the deadly risk cars pose to children. DOT data shows a 42% drop in pedestrian injury crashes on 34th Avenue since it went car-free. The city cites national spikes in child pedestrian deaths on Halloween.

The plan, described as 'bold,' creates a 1.3-mile stretch where vehicles are guests on shared streets, with two blocks and five half-blocks fully pedestrianized. Councilmember Shekar Krishnan, who campaigned for this change, voiced strong support: 'This design improves pedestrian safety and expands accessibility for all people.' DOT officials committed to ongoing collaboration. Some Community Board 3 leaders raised concerns about transparency, scooters, disability access, and environmental review, but DOT called these minor and solvable. The plan has broad support from local advocates and is set to begin implementation in June, with more improvements in 2023. The move marks a major shift for Jackson Heights, prioritizing people over cars and setting a new standard for city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, passed in 2019, requires hundreds of miles of protected bike lanes, bus lanes, and safer sidewalks. Council Member Alexa Avilés led the call: "We want $3.1 billion, a little tiny fraction of the [nearly $100-billion] city budget, to make sure our streets belong to us, and to make sure New Yorkers are safe." Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers, Carlina Rivera, Lincoln Restler, Sandy Nurse, Chi Ossé, Crystal Hudson, Shekar Krishnan, and Amanda Farías joined her. Traffic fatalities rose 44 percent in the first quarter of 2022, the deadliest start since Vision Zero began. The mayor’s proposed $98.5-billion budget did not allocate significant funds for the plan. Advocates say the city must act now to stem the bloodshed on its streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as a 'broken promise and failure of the prior administration,' centers on the city’s failure to ban cars from the full length of 78th Street between 34th Avenue and Northern Boulevard. Council Member Shekar Krishnan led the charge, criticizing the city for allowing Koeppel Mazda to use park space as a service entrance. Krishnan called this 'offensive to the notion of parks equity' and demanded urgent action to remove car access. Parks Commissioner Susan Donoghue acknowledged the issue and committed to working with DOT and City Hall to resolve it. The push aims to reclaim public space for pedestrians and children, not cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
