SUVs and cars did most of the damage. Bikes killed one person. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC data</a></p></li><li><p>Pedestrians were hit most often by SUVs and sedans.

It shows up as a top corridor, with one death and 79 injuries in this period. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC data</a></p><p>A 23-year-old passenger died at 82nd Street and Northern. Ejected. Unconscious. The SUV showed “no damage” in the report. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash record</a></p><p>On 37th Avenue at 90th Street, a 60-year-old woman was killed at the intersection. The database marks unsafe speed and a blown signal. She is listed as crossing against the light. Only one person died. It wasn’t the driver. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash record</a></p><h3 id=37th-avenue-and-broadway-names-and-corners>37th Avenue and Broadway: names and corners</h3><p>The district’s worst cluster sits along <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>37th Avenue</a>. Three deaths. Thirty injuries. One more death and 51 injuries on <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Broadway</a>.</p><p>At Broadway and Roosevelt, a 75-year-old man died after a collision with an e-bike operator going straight. The man is marked “semiconscious” in the file, then “killed.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash record</a></p><p>On 37th Avenue and 90th, a separate case lists a 44-year-old woman struck by a motorcycle.

Crashes stack up at school release and rush: 2 p.m. through 7 p.m. bring the highest injury counts, with a spike at 6 p.m. Nights hurt too; midnight and 1 a.m. each carry a death. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Hourly pattern</a></p><p>“Speed kills” is not a slogan.

Unsafe speed appears in fatal files. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>District rollup</a></li><li>Pedestrians bear the brunt: 4 deaths and 481 injuries to people on foot; cyclists 234 injuries.

A Council bill would ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and scale up barriers to 1,000 intersections a year. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Council file</a></li><li>Give long lead times and harden turns at 37th/90th and along the 82nd–90th Street run on Northern. Protect people where the numbers pile up. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC data</a></li><li>Tow the junk that blocks sightlines fast.

The matter, described as 'Let New York City lower its own speed limits,' has strong support from the mayor, DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, and advocates like Families for Safe Streets. Restler’s action was public advocacy. The Assembly is the final hurdle; the bill is already in the governor’s and Senate’s budgets.

Officials say car-free streets mean fewer dead children.</p><p class=mb3>On October 24, 2022, the NYC Department of Transportation announced a major expansion of car-free streets for Halloween. The initiative, called 'Trick-or-Streets,' will close 100 streets—across all boroughs except Staten Island—from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. The DOT will extend hours on 40 existing open streets and keep another 60 car-free through the evening, partnering with the Street Activity Permit Office for more pedestrian zones. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'I am incredibly excited to build on the triumph of our thriving Open Streets program ... this Halloween, providing greater access to safer, shared community spaces.' Assembly Member Catalina Cruz and Council Member Shekar Krishnan backed the move, stressing the deadly risk cars pose to children. DOT data shows a 42% drop in pedestrian injury crashes on 34th Avenue since it went car-free. The city cites national spikes in child pedestrian deaths on Halloween. The message is clear: car-free streets save lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Shekar Krishnan and Borough President Donovan Richards condemned the hate, with Krishnan stating, 'Hate, homophobia, bigotry, threats have no place in our community.' Richards, a supporter of Paseo Park, said, 'We can disagree, but we need to be adults.' DOT spokesman Scott Gastel said the open street benefits the entire community, prioritizing pedestrians and children.

Councilmember Shekar Krishnan, who campaigned for this change, voiced strong support: 'This design improves pedestrian safety and expands accessibility for all people.' DOT officials committed to ongoing collaboration. Some Community Board 3 leaders raised concerns about transparency, scooters, disability access, and environmental review, but DOT called these minor and solvable. The plan has broad support from local advocates and is set to begin implementation in June, with more improvements in 2023.

The plan, passed in 2019, requires hundreds of miles of protected bike lanes, bus lanes, and safer sidewalks. Council Member Alexa Avilés led the call: "We want $3.1 billion, a little tiny fraction of the [nearly $100-billion] city budget, to make sure our streets belong to us, and to make sure New Yorkers are safe." Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers, Carlina Rivera, Lincoln Restler, Sandy Nurse, Chi Ossé, Crystal Hudson, Shekar Krishnan, and Amanda Farías joined her. Traffic fatalities rose 44 percent in the first quarter of 2022, the deadliest start since Vision Zero began. The mayor’s proposed $98.5-billion budget did not allocate significant funds for the plan.
