The discussion, reported by nypost.com, focused on rising fire deaths and slower FDNY response times. The matter summary reads: 'Rising NYC fire deaths, response times blamed on traffic measures.' Councilmember Joann Ariola (District 32) argued that open street programs, bike lanes, and traffic islands hinder emergency vehicles, especially when illegal parking blocks access. She called for better enforcement. Other voices, including union leaders, echoed her concerns. However, Councilmember Shekar Krishnan defended new street designs, stating they were built with emergency input. The Department of Transportation said all projects include emergency routes and are monitored. FDNY officials attributed delays to increased post-pandemic traffic, not street safety measures. The debate highlights the ongoing conflict between car-free streets for vulnerable users and emergency vehicle access.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Assembly Member Catalina Cruz and Council Member Shekar Krishnan backed the move, stressing the deadly risk cars pose to children.

Councilmember Shekar Krishnan, who campaigned for this change, voiced strong support: 'This design improves pedestrian safety and expands accessibility for all people.' DOT officials committed to ongoing collaboration. Some Community Board 3 leaders raised concerns about transparency, scooters, disability access, and environmental review, but DOT called these minor and solvable. The plan has broad support from local advocates and is set to begin implementation in June, with more improvements in 2023.

The plan, passed in 2019, requires hundreds of miles of protected bike lanes, bus lanes, and safer sidewalks. Council Member Alexa Avilés led the call: "We want $3.1 billion, a little tiny fraction of the [nearly $100-billion] city budget, to make sure our streets belong to us, and to make sure New Yorkers are safe." Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers, Carlina Rivera, Lincoln Restler, Sandy Nurse, Chi Ossé, Crystal Hudson, Shekar Krishnan, and Amanda Farías joined her. Traffic fatalities rose 44 percent in the first quarter of 2022, the deadliest start since Vision Zero began. The mayor’s proposed $98.5-billion budget did not allocate significant funds for the plan.

The matter, described as a 'broken promise and failure of the prior administration,' centers on the city’s failure to ban cars from the full length of 78th Street between 34th Avenue and Northern Boulevard. Council Member Shekar Krishnan led the charge, criticizing the city for allowing Koeppel Mazda to use park space as a service entrance. Krishnan called this 'offensive to the notion of parks equity' and demanded urgent action to remove car access. Parks Commissioner Susan Donoghue acknowledged the issue and committed to working with DOT and City Hall to resolve it. The push aims to reclaim public space for pedestrians and children, not cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Shekar Krishnan, a supporter of the park conversion, said, 'We are so excited to work on transforming it into a linear park for a community that needs it so badly.' Krishnan also called for the Parks budget to be raised to 1 percent of the city budget. Donoghue made no firm commitment, repeating the administration’s focus on collaboration.

Krishnan said, 'I advocated for a linear park and how transformative it would be for our city.' Despite Adams’ past support—he once signed a petition for the park—he made no commitments during the visit. Funding for the conversion and for Citi Bike expansion was left out of the Department of Transportation budget. DOT and City Hall offered no clear answers on future plans or funding.

The Department of Transportation and Council Member Shekar Krishnan back a permanent car-free linear park. Mayor Adams has signed the petition. The article states: 'When cars are banished from roadways, total crashes drop dramatically and injuries to pedestrians and cyclists almost entirely disappear.' Luz Maria Mercado and Transportation Alternatives support expanding open streets citywide. DOT spokesman Seth Stein says, 'by reclaiming space from cars we make our streets safer.' The data is stark: from 2019 to 2021, crashes during open street hours fell from 26 to 6, injuries from 19 to 2. The evidence is clear—removing cars saves lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
