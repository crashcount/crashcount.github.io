The matter, described as 'Let New York City lower its own speed limits,' has strong support from the mayor, DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, and advocates like Families for Safe Streets. Restler’s action was public advocacy. The Assembly is the final hurdle; the bill is already in the governor’s and Senate’s budgets.

Bike and pedestrian paths rot while repairs stall for years. Lawmakers demand answers. The city’s oldest greenways stay cracked. Cyclists and walkers wait. Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>On December 8, 2022, Council Member Shekar Krishnan introduced legislation targeting the Parks Department’s slow capital project timelines. The bills, discussed at an oversight hearing, would force Parks to devise a plan by December 1, 2023, to reduce project durations by 25 percent and improve online transparency about delays and costs. Krishnan said, “The infrastructure projects, the transportation and green space projects, need to be progressing at a much much faster rate.” The legislation responds to years-long delays on vital bike and pedestrian greenways, like Ocean Parkway, where repairs have lagged since 2019. Parks officials blame pandemic pauses and contractor reviews. The bills aim to end the cycle of neglect that leaves vulnerable road users at risk on crumbling paths. Parks spokesperson Meghan Lalor said the agency is open to working with the Council on reforms.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
