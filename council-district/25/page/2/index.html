But the wounds are deep and many. In just twelve months, 274 people were hurt in crashes. Three suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. A 14-year-old girl, crossing with the light, was crushed by an SUV at 82nd Street and 37th Avenue this March. A 75-year-old man, walking with the signal, was struck by a Ford SUV at 75th Street and 37th Avenue in April. A baby boy was hit at Roosevelt Avenue and 81st Street just weeks ago. The numbers are relentless. The pain is not abstract.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hurt-us>The Machines That Hurt Us</h3><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage. In the last year, SUVs and cars injured at least 68 pedestrians. Trucks and buses hurt three more. Motorcycles and mopeds, four. Even bikes, four. The street is a gauntlet. The curb is no refuge. &ldquo;I have a baby with me. That would be scary. I&rsquo;ll be more cautious of my surroundings,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>said a mother after a bus jumped the curb in Flushing, injuring eight</a>.</p><h3 id=what-has-council-member-krishnan-done>What Has Council Member Krishnan Done?</h3><p>Council Member Shekar Krishnan has backed some real changes. He co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks and force the city to daylight 1,000 intersections a year (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>co-sponsored a bill</a>). He led a push to plant trees and build green medians between bike lanes and traffic (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>led a push</a>). He voted to remove abandoned cars fast, clearing sightlines for people on foot and bike. He has called for faster parks and greenway projects, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/12/08/council-wants-to-speed-up-parks-projects-like-those-much-delayed-greenways/>saying, &ldquo;The infrastructure projects, the transportation and green space projects, need to be progressing at a much much faster rate&rdquo;</a>.</p><p>But the pace is slow. The danger is not. Every week brings new injuries.</p><h3 id=the-call-demand-more-demand-it-now>The Call: Demand More, Demand It Now</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call Council Member Krishnan. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand more daylighted intersections. Demand streets where a child can cross without fear. Do not wait for the first death.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

DOT Chief of Staff Ryan Lynch told advocates the agency is lobbying for replacement funds. Council Member Shekar Krishnan criticized the mayor’s stance, saying, “It’s deeply misguided to cut funds from the open street program, especially at this moment.” The City Comptroller’s office also faulted the administration for poor planning.
