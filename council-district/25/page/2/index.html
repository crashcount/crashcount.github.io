An SUV driver went around another car, ran the red, and hit them. The girls were rushed to Elmhurst Hospital. The driver fled. The girls survived.

He voted for a citywide greenway plan and supported car-free streets for children. He co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act and pushed for curb extensions, daylighting, and better lighting. He called out city failures to protect park space from cars. But the blood on the street says more is needed. Laws passed, but the cars keep coming.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> Call your council member. Demand 20 mph speed limits. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand enforcement that protects the child in the crosswalk, not the car in the lane. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
