Four summers. The hurt does not stop.</p><ul><li><p>Since 2022, at least <strong>11 people have died</strong> and 1,739 have been injured on District 25 streets, with 19 seriously hurt, across 3,474 crashes. SUVs and cars did most of the damage. Bikes killed one person. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC data</a></p></li><li><p>Pedestrians were hit most often by SUVs and sedans.

It shows up as a top corridor, with one death and 79 injuries in this period. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC data</a></p><p>A 23-year-old passenger died at 82nd Street and Northern. Ejected. Unconscious. The SUV showed “no damage” in the report. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash record</a></p><p>On 37th Avenue at 90th Street, a 60-year-old woman was killed at the intersection. The database marks unsafe speed and a blown signal. She is listed as crossing against the light. Only one person died. It wasn’t the driver. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash record</a></p><h3 id=37th-avenue-and-broadway-names-and-corners>37th Avenue and Broadway: names and corners</h3><p>The district’s worst cluster sits along <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>37th Avenue</a>. Three deaths. Thirty injuries. One more death and 51 injuries on <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Broadway</a>.</p><p>At Broadway and Roosevelt, a 75-year-old man died after a collision with an e-bike operator going straight. The man is marked “semiconscious” in the file, then “killed.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash record</a></p><p>On 37th Avenue and 90th, a separate case lists a 44-year-old woman struck by a motorcycle.

Crashes stack up at school release and rush: 2 p.m. through 7 p.m. bring the highest injury counts, with a spike at 6 p.m. Nights hurt too; midnight and 1 a.m. each carry a death. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Hourly pattern</a></p><p>“Speed kills” is not a slogan. It’s a ledger. Citywide, lowering speeds to 20 mph is on the table now. The city has the authority. Use it. <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a></p><h3 id=why-these-blocks-break-people>Why these blocks break people</h3><p>The city’s own fields point to what keeps going wrong here:</p><ul><li>“Other” factors lead the list, but named causes include signal running, distraction, alcohol, and failure to yield. Unsafe speed appears in fatal files. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>District rollup</a></li><li>Pedestrians bear the brunt: 4 deaths and 481 injuries to people on foot; cyclists 234 injuries. Motor vehicle occupants die inside their cars too. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>District rollup</a></li></ul><p>Local fixes are not mysteries:</p><ul><li>Daylight every crosswalk on 37th Avenue, Broadway, and Northern. A Council bill would ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and scale up barriers to 1,000 intersections a year. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Council file</a></li><li>Give long lead times and harden turns at 37th/90th and along the 82nd–90th Street run on Northern. Protect people where the numbers pile up. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC data</a></li><li>Tow the junk that blocks sightlines fast.

Federal funds are gone. Mayor Adams offers no city money. DOT warns of shrinking hours and scope. Council Member Krishnan blasts the move. Streets once safe for walkers and riders now risk return to cars. The future is uncertain.</p><p class=mb3>On April 3, 2025, New York City’s Open Streets program entered crisis. The program, legislated by the City Council, lost its federal Covid funding. Mayor Adams has not allocated city funds. The Department of Transportation (DOT) says $5 million is needed to maintain current operations, but the Council’s preliminary budget omits this. DOT Chief of Staff Ryan Lynch told advocates the agency is lobbying for replacement funds. Council Member Shekar Krishnan criticized the mayor’s stance, saying, “It’s deeply misguided to cut funds from the open street program, especially at this moment.” The City Comptroller’s office also faulted the administration for poor planning. The funding gap has already led to reduced hours and fewer open streets. Council members are pushing for restoration, but the program’s future hangs in the balance.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
