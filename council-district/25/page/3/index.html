SUVs and cars did most of the damage. Bikes killed one person. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC data</a></p></li><li><p>Pedestrians were hit most often by SUVs and sedans.

It shows up as a top corridor, with one death and 79 injuries in this period. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC data</a></p><p>A 23-year-old passenger died at 82nd Street and Northern. Ejected. Unconscious. The SUV showed “no damage” in the report. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash record</a></p><p>On 37th Avenue at 90th Street, a 60-year-old woman was killed at the intersection. The database marks unsafe speed and a blown signal. She is listed as crossing against the light. Only one person died. It wasn’t the driver. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash record</a></p><h3 id=37th-avenue-and-broadway-names-and-corners>37th Avenue and Broadway: names and corners</h3><p>The district’s worst cluster sits along <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>37th Avenue</a>. Three deaths. Thirty injuries. One more death and 51 injuries on <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Broadway</a>.</p><p>At Broadway and Roosevelt, a 75-year-old man died after a collision with an e-bike operator going straight. The man is marked “semiconscious” in the file, then “killed.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash record</a></p><p>On 37th Avenue and 90th, a separate case lists a 44-year-old woman struck by a motorcycle.

Crashes stack up at school release and rush: 2 p.m. through 7 p.m. bring the highest injury counts, with a spike at 6 p.m. Nights hurt too; midnight and 1 a.m. each carry a death. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Hourly pattern</a></p><p>“Speed kills” is not a slogan.

Use it. <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a></p><h3 id=why-these-blocks-break-people>Why these blocks break people</h3><p>The city’s own fields point to what keeps going wrong here:</p><ul><li>“Other” factors lead the list, but named causes include signal running, distraction, alcohol, and failure to yield. Unsafe speed appears in fatal files. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>District rollup</a></li><li>Pedestrians bear the brunt: 4 deaths and 481 injuries to people on foot; cyclists 234 injuries. Motor vehicle occupants die inside their cars too. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>District rollup</a></li></ul><p>Local fixes are not mysteries:</p><ul><li>Daylight every crosswalk on 37th Avenue, Broadway, and Northern. A Council bill would ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and scale up barriers to 1,000 intersections a year. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Council file</a></li><li>Give long lead times and harden turns at 37th/90th and along the 82nd–90th Street run on Northern. Protect people where the numbers pile up. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC data</a></li><li>Tow the junk that blocks sightlines fast.

Pedestrians now cross anywhere, any time. No summons. Law strips drivers of excuses. Streets shift. Power tilts to people on foot.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0346-2024, now enacted, rewrites New York’s pedestrian rules. The bill, heard by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, passed on September 26, 2024, and became law on October 26, 2024. Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers. It shifts blame from people on foot to the system and those behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lawmakers say this closes loopholes, shifts blame from workers, and aims to cut rising crashes. Streets see more mopeds, more injuries, more tension.</p><p class=mb3>On July 12, 2024, Governor Hochul signed a package of eight bills into law, including new moped and e-bike safety regulations. The legislation, sponsored by State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assemblymember Alex Bores, requires retailers to register mopeds at the point of sale, provide safety information, and prohibit the sale of substandard lithium-ion batteries. The law also mandates crash reporting and new safety training for first responders. Hoylman-Sigal said, 'I've received more complaints about the hazards these mopeds cause than just about any other issue.' Bores added, 'By requiring the registration of mopeds at point of sale and the collection of e-bike collision data, we are making our streets safer and increasing accountability.' The law shifts accountability to retailers, aiming to improve street safety without penalizing delivery workers. Council Member Shekar Krishnan and State Senator Liz Kruger also voiced support, highlighting the dangers of unregistered mopeds and the need for better buyer education. The law responds to a sharp rise in moped-related injuries and community complaints across New York City.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The meeting followed a deadly year: a 75-year-old man killed by an e-bike, two injured in a dirt bike crash. Residents described near-misses and constant danger on the 34th Avenue open street. The matter, titled 'On Jackson Heights’ open street, NYC’s ‘moped crisis’ is in full throttle,' drew city officials, including DOT and Mayor Adams, who backed enforcement and moped registration. Krishnan slammed DOT’s reliance on signage, pushing instead for a dedicated micromobility lane. Delivery worker advocates opposed criminalization, demanding labor protections and safe infrastructure. Despite new signs and vehicle seizures, mopeds still speed through.

At a 'Moped Crisis' town hall, Krishnan called the area a 'moped highway' and said, 'The biggest problem that we have is poor design by the DOT.' He demanded a redesign that separates speeding vehicles from people and creates safe corridors for mopeds away from recreational spaces. Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas echoed the call for engineering solutions, stating, 'We must design the roads to ensure that mopeds are not getting on [Paseo Park], and are not driving recklessly.' DOT staff highlighted enforcement efforts, but Krishnan and others insisted that design, not enforcement, must come first.
