But the wounds are deep and many. In just twelve months, 274 people were hurt in crashes. Three suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. A 14-year-old girl, crossing with the light, was crushed by an SUV at 82nd Street and 37th Avenue this March. A 75-year-old man, walking with the signal, was struck by a Ford SUV at 75th Street and 37th Avenue in April. A baby boy was hit at Roosevelt Avenue and 81st Street just weeks ago. The numbers are relentless. The pain is not abstract.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hurt-us>The Machines That Hurt Us</h3><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage. In the last year, SUVs and cars injured at least 68 pedestrians. Trucks and buses hurt three more. Motorcycles and mopeds, four. Even bikes, four. The street is a gauntlet. The curb is no refuge. &ldquo;I have a baby with me. That would be scary. I&rsquo;ll be more cautious of my surroundings,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>said a mother after a bus jumped the curb in Flushing, injuring eight</a>.</p><h3 id=what-has-council-member-krishnan-done>What Has Council Member Krishnan Done?</h3><p>Council Member Shekar Krishnan has backed some real changes. He co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks and force the city to daylight 1,000 intersections a year (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>co-sponsored a bill</a>). He led a push to plant trees and build green medians between bike lanes and traffic (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>led a push</a>). He voted to remove abandoned cars fast, clearing sightlines for people on foot and bike. He has called for faster parks and greenway projects, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/12/08/council-wants-to-speed-up-parks-projects-like-those-much-delayed-greenways/>saying, &ldquo;The infrastructure projects, the transportation and green space projects, need to be progressing at a much much faster rate&rdquo;</a>.</p><p>But the pace is slow. The danger is not. Every week brings new injuries.</p><h3 id=the-call-demand-more-demand-it-now>The Call: Demand More, Demand It Now</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call Council Member Krishnan. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand more daylighted intersections. Demand streets where a child can cross without fear. Do not wait for the first death.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The legislation, sponsored by State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assemblymember Alex Bores, requires retailers to register mopeds at the point of sale, provide safety information, and prohibit the sale of substandard lithium-ion batteries. The law also mandates crash reporting and new safety training for first responders. Hoylman-Sigal said, 'I've received more complaints about the hazards these mopeds cause than just about any other issue.' Bores added, 'By requiring the registration of mopeds at point of sale and the collection of e-bike collision data, we are making our streets safer and increasing accountability.' The law shifts accountability to retailers, aiming to improve street safety without penalizing delivery workers. Council Member Shekar Krishnan and State Senator Liz Kruger also voiced support, highlighting the dangers of unregistered mopeds and the need for better buyer education. The law responds to a sharp rise in moped-related injuries and community complaints across New York City.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The meeting followed a deadly year: a 75-year-old man killed by an e-bike, two injured in a dirt bike crash. Residents described near-misses and constant danger on the 34th Avenue open street. The matter, titled 'On Jackson Heights’ open street, NYC’s ‘moped crisis’ is in full throttle,' drew city officials, including DOT and Mayor Adams, who backed enforcement and moped registration. Krishnan slammed DOT’s reliance on signage, pushing instead for a dedicated micromobility lane. Delivery worker advocates opposed criminalization, demanding labor protections and safe infrastructure. Despite new signs and vehicle seizures, mopeds still speed through. The call for urgent, systemic change grows louder.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

At a 'Moped Crisis' town hall, Krishnan called the area a 'moped highway' and said, 'The biggest problem that we have is poor design by the DOT.' He demanded a redesign that separates speeding vehicles from people and creates safe corridors for mopeds away from recreational spaces. Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas echoed the call for engineering solutions, stating, 'We must design the roads to ensure that mopeds are not getting on [Paseo Park], and are not driving recklessly.' DOT staff highlighted enforcement efforts, but Krishnan and others insisted that design, not enforcement, must come first. DOT claims a drop in pedestrian crashes, but the current layout leaves pedestrians and cyclists exposed to danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No evidence in the report attributes any contributing actions to the victim; the only cited factor is the inattention of the chassis cab driver.
