An SUV driver went around another car, ran the red, and hit them. The driver fled. The girls survived, but the street did not forgive. Police said the children suffered minor injuries and were taken to Elmhurst Hospital. The driver remains at large. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/two-little-girls-4-and-8-struck-by-driver-who-blew-red-light-in-queens/>The SUV driver fled after the collision and remains on the loose, police said.</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>District 25 saw 837 crashes, 450 injuries, and 5 people seriously hurt</strong>. One person died. In three years, 11 people have died. The numbers do not bleed, but the streets do.</p><p>A firefighter ran a red at 107th Street and Northern Boulevard. The crash killed a 23-year-old man. The firefighter was suspended. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/26/man-24-behind-wheel-of-bmw-fatally-struck-by-queens-mercedes-driver/>The FDNY stated Pena will be suspended without pay for 28 days during the investigation.</a></p><p>SUVs, sedans, and trucks do most of the damage. In three years, cars and SUVs killed three pedestrians here. Bikes killed one. The rest—mopeds, trucks, buses—leave bruises and broken bones, but the big vehicles take the most lives.</p><p>Council Member Shekar Krishnan has backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks, legalize jaywalking, and demand protected bike lanes. He voted for a citywide greenway plan. He co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, which targets reckless driving and calls for safer design. He has spoken for car-free streets on Halloween, and for moped registration and education. But the blood keeps coming.</p><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits, redesign deadly crossings, and hold repeat offenders off the road. But power unused is as good as no power at all. <strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand action before another child’s name is added to the list.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another siren.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Action lags.</p><p class=mb3>On June 11, 2024, Councilmember Shekar Krishnan (District 25) convened a town hall in Jackson Heights to address what he called a 'moped crisis.' The meeting followed a deadly year: a 75-year-old man killed by an e-bike, two injured in a dirt bike crash. Residents described near-misses and constant danger on the 34th Avenue open street. The matter, titled 'On Jackson Heights’ open street, NYC’s ‘moped crisis’ is in full throttle,' drew city officials, including DOT and Mayor Adams, who backed enforcement and moped registration. Krishnan slammed DOT’s reliance on signage, pushing instead for a dedicated micromobility lane. Delivery worker advocates opposed criminalization, demanding labor protections and safe infrastructure. Despite new signs and vehicle seizures, mopeds still speed through. The call for urgent, systemic change grows louder.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

At a 'Moped Crisis' town hall, Krishnan called the area a 'moped highway' and said, 'The biggest problem that we have is poor design by the DOT.' He demanded a redesign that separates speeding vehicles from people and creates safe corridors for mopeds away from recreational spaces. Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas echoed the call for engineering solutions, stating, 'We must design the roads to ensure that mopeds are not getting on [Paseo Park], and are not driving recklessly.' DOT staff highlighted enforcement efforts, but Krishnan and others insisted that design, not enforcement, must come first. DOT claims a drop in pedestrian crashes, but the current layout leaves pedestrians and cyclists exposed to danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to installation of pedestrian lighting fixtures,' would require the transportation commissioner to install sidewalk lighting in at least 500 commercial corridors per year, each lit to a minimum of 1 footcandle (11 lux). At least 450 corridors must be contiguous to others with new or existing lighting. Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers leads as primary sponsor, joined by Restler, Krishnan, Bottcher, and many others. The bill aims to cut through the city’s darkness, demanding light for those on foot. It remains stalled in committee, its promise unrealized.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states the SUV was traveling at an 'Unsafe Speed.' The narrative describes the vehicle coming fast, with the impact causing fatal injuries to the pedestrian, who died before emergency responders arrived. The police report lists 'Unsafe Speed' as the contributing factor for the driver. The report also notes the pedestrian was 'Crossing Against Signal,' but this is mentioned only after the driver’s excessive speed is cited. The collision underscores the lethal consequences when drivers operate at unsafe speeds, especially at intersections where pedestrians are present.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
