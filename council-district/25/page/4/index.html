An SUV driver went around another car, ran the red, and hit them. The driver fled. The girls survived, but the street did not forgive. Police said the children suffered minor injuries and were taken to Elmhurst Hospital. The driver remains at large. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/two-little-girls-4-and-8-struck-by-driver-who-blew-red-light-in-queens/>The SUV driver fled after the collision and remains on the loose, police said.</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>District 25 saw 837 crashes, 450 injuries, and 5 people seriously hurt</strong>. One person died. In three years, 11 people have died. The numbers do not bleed, but the streets do.</p><p>A firefighter ran a red at 107th Street and Northern Boulevard. The crash killed a 23-year-old man. The firefighter was suspended. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/26/man-24-behind-wheel-of-bmw-fatally-struck-by-queens-mercedes-driver/>The FDNY stated Pena will be suspended without pay for 28 days during the investigation.</a></p><p>SUVs, sedans, and trucks do most of the damage. In three years, cars and SUVs killed three pedestrians here. Bikes killed one. The rest—mopeds, trucks, buses—leave bruises and broken bones, but the big vehicles take the most lives.</p><p>Council Member Shekar Krishnan has backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks, legalize jaywalking, and demand protected bike lanes. He voted for a citywide greenway plan. He co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, which targets reckless driving and calls for safer design. He has spoken for car-free streets on Halloween, and for moped registration and education. But the blood keeps coming.</p><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits, redesign deadly crossings, and hold repeat offenders off the road. But power unused is as good as no power at all. <strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand action before another child’s name is added to the list.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another siren.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
