SUVs and cars did most of the damage. Bikes killed one person. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC data</a></p></li><li><p>Pedestrians were hit most often by SUVs and sedans.

It shows up as a top corridor, with one death and 79 injuries in this period. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC data</a></p><p>A 23-year-old passenger died at 82nd Street and Northern. Ejected. Unconscious. The SUV showed “no damage” in the report. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash record</a></p><p>On 37th Avenue at 90th Street, a 60-year-old woman was killed at the intersection. The database marks unsafe speed and a blown signal. She is listed as crossing against the light. Only one person died. It wasn’t the driver. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash record</a></p><h3 id=37th-avenue-and-broadway-names-and-corners>37th Avenue and Broadway: names and corners</h3><p>The district’s worst cluster sits along <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>37th Avenue</a>. Three deaths. Thirty injuries. One more death and 51 injuries on <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Broadway</a>.</p><p>At Broadway and Roosevelt, a 75-year-old man died after a collision with an e-bike operator going straight. The man is marked “semiconscious” in the file, then “killed.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash record</a></p><p>On 37th Avenue and 90th, a separate case lists a 44-year-old woman struck by a motorcycle.

Crashes stack up at school release and rush: 2 p.m. through 7 p.m. bring the highest injury counts, with a spike at 6 p.m. Nights hurt too; midnight and 1 a.m. each carry a death. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Hourly pattern</a></p><p>“Speed kills” is not a slogan.

Unsafe speed appears in fatal files. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>District rollup</a></li><li>Pedestrians bear the brunt: 4 deaths and 481 injuries to people on foot; cyclists 234 injuries. Motor vehicle occupants die inside their cars too. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>District rollup</a></li></ul><p>Local fixes are not mysteries:</p><ul><li>Daylight every crosswalk on 37th Avenue, Broadway, and Northern. A Council bill would ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and scale up barriers to 1,000 intersections a year. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Council file</a></li><li>Give long lead times and harden turns at 37th/90th and along the 82nd–90th Street run on Northern. Protect people where the numbers pile up. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC data</a></li><li>Tow the junk that blocks sightlines fast.

The matter, described as 'Let New York City lower its own speed limits,' has strong support from the mayor, DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, and advocates like Families for Safe Streets. Restler’s action was public advocacy. The Assembly is the final hurdle; the bill is already in the governor’s and Senate’s budgets.
