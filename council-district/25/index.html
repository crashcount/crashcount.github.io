Four summers. The hurt does not stop.</p><ul><li><p>Since 2022, at least <strong>11 people have died</strong> and 1,739 have been injured on District 25 streets, with 19 seriously hurt, across 3,474 crashes. SUVs and cars did most of the damage. Bikes killed one person. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC data</a></p></li><li><p>Pedestrians were hit most often by SUVs and sedans. They account for the bulk of the injuries to people on foot. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC data</a></p></li></ul><h3 id=northern-boulevard-hard-numbers-soft-bodies>Northern Boulevard: hard numbers, soft bodies</h3><p>Northern Boulevard keeps taking. It shows up as a top corridor, with one death and 79 injuries in this period. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC data</a></p><p>A 23-year-old passenger died at 82nd Street and Northern. Ejected. Unconscious. The SUV showed “no damage” in the report. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash record</a></p><p>On 37th Avenue at 90th Street, a 60-year-old woman was killed at the intersection. The database marks unsafe speed and a blown signal. She is listed as crossing against the light. Only one person died. It wasn’t the driver. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash record</a></p><h3 id=37th-avenue-and-broadway-names-and-corners>37th Avenue and Broadway: names and corners</h3><p>The district’s worst cluster sits along <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>37th Avenue</a>. Three deaths. Thirty injuries. One more death and 51 injuries on <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Broadway</a>.</p><p>At Broadway and Roosevelt, a 75-year-old man died after a collision with an e-bike operator going straight. The man is marked “semiconscious” in the file, then “killed.” <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Crash record</a></p><p>On 37th Avenue and 90th, a separate case lists a 44-year-old woman struck by a motorcycle.

Crashes stack up at school release and rush: 2 p.m. through 7 p.m. bring the highest injury counts, with a spike at 6 p.m. Nights hurt too; midnight and 1 a.m. each carry a death. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Hourly pattern</a></p><p>“Speed kills” is not a slogan. It’s a ledger. Citywide, lowering speeds to 20 mph is on the table now. The city has the authority. Use it. <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a></p><h3 id=why-these-blocks-break-people>Why these blocks break people</h3><p>The city’s own fields point to what keeps going wrong here:</p><ul><li>“Other” factors lead the list, but named causes include signal running, distraction, alcohol, and failure to yield. Unsafe speed appears in fatal files. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>District rollup</a></li><li>Pedestrians bear the brunt: 4 deaths and 481 injuries to people on foot; cyclists 234 injuries. Motor vehicle occupants die inside their cars too. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>District rollup</a></li></ul><p>Local fixes are not mysteries:</p><ul><li>Daylight every crosswalk on 37th Avenue, Broadway, and Northern. A Council bill would ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and scale up barriers to 1,000 intersections a year. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Council file</a></li><li>Give long lead times and harden turns at 37th/90th and along the 82nd–90th Street run on Northern. Protect people where the numbers pile up. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC data</a></li><li>Tow the junk that blocks sightlines fast.

The driver, Bekim Fiseku, was wanted for burglary and had tape over his license plate. Police chased him nearly a mile through residential streets. A witness said, "She went airborne. She flew like 30 feet. It was a lot of force." The article highlights concerns about NYPD's pursuit tactics, quoting the victim's father: "It was probably not the place to be doing a high-speed chase, in the residential neighborhood." Fiseku faces murder and manslaughter charges. The case raises questions about the risks of police chases in dense city neighborhoods.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, discussed with Council Member Shekar Krishnan and groups like the Alliance for Paseo Park, aims to move fast e-bikes and mopeds to a new lane on Northern Boulevard. The matter summary reads: 'Supporters of the 34th Avenue open street hope design changes can help calm the strip and redirect faster riders to a safer Northern Boulevard.' Dawn Siff and Jim Burke spoke for more park space and bike access. The safety analyst warns: 'Redirecting faster riders away from an open street may discourage cycling and reduce safety in numbers, while failing to address the root causes of unsafe speeds through infrastructure or traffic calming for all users.' The redesign risks pushing danger elsewhere, not solving it.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crash happened at Northern Boulevard and East 107th Street as Diaz drove to work. Prosecutors cited Peña’s firing from the FDNY and prior legal issues to argue for remand, but the appellate court released him with minimal bail conditions. Peña faces manslaughter and other charges, with a possible 15-year sentence if convicted.
