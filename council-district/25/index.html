Pedestrians, cyclists, and kids wait for real protection.</p><p class=mb3>On June 17, 2025, Streetsblog NYC covered the city’s $89-million redesign proposal for the 34th Avenue open street. The plan, discussed with Council Member Shekar Krishnan and groups like the Alliance for Paseo Park, aims to move fast e-bikes and mopeds to a new lane on Northern Boulevard. The matter summary reads: 'Supporters of the 34th Avenue open street hope design changes can help calm the strip and redirect faster riders to a safer Northern Boulevard.' Dawn Siff and Jim Burke spoke for more park space and bike access. The safety analyst warns: 'Redirecting faster riders away from an open street may discourage cycling and reduce safety in numbers, while failing to address the root causes of unsafe speeds through infrastructure or traffic calming for all users.' The redesign risks pushing danger elsewhere, not solving it.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states, 'A sedan turns left. A motorbike goes straight. Metal strikes metal.' The motorbike driver, age 34, was ejected and suffered severe bleeding from the leg, remaining conscious at the scene. Police cite 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' and 'Driver Inexperience' as contributing factors. The impact was to the right side doors of the motorbike and the left front bumper of the sedan. The report notes the motorbike rider was not wearing a helmet, but this detail is listed after the driver errors.

The pedestrian was crossing with the signal when the collision occurred. The report states the man suffered severe lacerations to his knee and lower leg. The SUV’s point of impact was the right front bumper, which showed no visible damage. The contributing factor listed by police is 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' on the part of the SUV driver.

The program, legislated by the City Council, lost its federal Covid funding. Mayor Adams has not allocated city funds. The Department of Transportation (DOT) says $5 million is needed to maintain current operations, but the Council’s preliminary budget omits this. DOT Chief of Staff Ryan Lynch told advocates the agency is lobbying for replacement funds. Council Member Shekar Krishnan criticized the mayor’s stance, saying, “It’s deeply misguided to cut funds from the open street program, especially at this moment.” The City Comptroller’s office also faulted the administration for poor planning. The funding gap has already led to reduced hours and fewer open streets.

Hoylman-Sigal said, 'I've received more complaints about the hazards these mopeds cause than just about any other issue.' Bores added, 'By requiring the registration of mopeds at point of sale and the collection of e-bike collision data, we are making our streets safer and increasing accountability.' The law shifts accountability to retailers, aiming to improve street safety without penalizing delivery workers. Council Member Shekar Krishnan and State Senator Liz Kruger also voiced support, highlighting the dangers of unregistered mopeds and the need for better buyer education.

Action lags.</p><p class=mb3>On June 11, 2024, Councilmember Shekar Krishnan (District 25) convened a town hall in Jackson Heights to address what he called a 'moped crisis.' The meeting followed a deadly year: a 75-year-old man killed by an e-bike, two injured in a dirt bike crash. Residents described near-misses and constant danger on the 34th Avenue open street. The matter, titled 'On Jackson Heights’ open street, NYC’s ‘moped crisis’ is in full throttle,' drew city officials, including DOT and Mayor Adams, who backed enforcement and moped registration. Krishnan slammed DOT’s reliance on signage, pushing instead for a dedicated micromobility lane. Delivery worker advocates opposed criminalization, demanding labor protections and safe infrastructure. Despite new signs and vehicle seizures, mopeds still speed through. The call for urgent, systemic change grows louder.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT touts safety, but danger remains for those on foot.</p><p class=mb3>On June 11, 2024, Council Member Shekar Krishnan publicly condemned the Department of Transportation’s design of Paseo Park, also known as the 34th Avenue open street. At a 'Moped Crisis' town hall, Krishnan called the area a 'moped highway' and said, 'The biggest problem that we have is poor design by the DOT.' He demanded a redesign that separates speeding vehicles from people and creates safe corridors for mopeds away from recreational spaces. Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas echoed the call for engineering solutions, stating, 'We must design the roads to ensure that mopeds are not getting on [Paseo Park], and are not driving recklessly.' DOT staff highlighted enforcement efforts, but Krishnan and others insisted that design, not enforcement, must come first. DOT claims a drop in pedestrian crashes, but the current layout leaves pedestrians and cyclists exposed to danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The impact hit her center-front, shattering her legs and causing fatal injuries. The report states she was conscious after the collision but ultimately died from her wounds. Police cite 'Accelerator Defective' as the contributing factor, pointing to a mechanical failure that led to the loss of control. The pedestrian was not in the roadway and was not crossing at an intersection, according to the report. No driver errors by the victim are listed.

According to the police report, a chassis cab traveling west struck the rear quarter panel of a southbound sedan. The impact tore metal and left a 72-year-old woman, the sedan’s sole occupant, with an amputation injury. She was conscious and restrained by a lap belt. The police report cites 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the primary contributing factor. The driver of the chassis cab failed to maintain focus, resulting in catastrophic harm to the sedan’s occupant. No evidence in the report attributes any contributing actions to the victim; the only cited factor is the inattention of the chassis cab driver. The crash underscores the systemic danger posed by distracted driving on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
