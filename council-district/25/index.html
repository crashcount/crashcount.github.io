But the wounds are deep and many. In just twelve months, 274 people were hurt in crashes. Three suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. A 14-year-old girl, crossing with the light, was crushed by an SUV at 82nd Street and 37th Avenue this March. A 75-year-old man, walking with the signal, was struck by a Ford SUV at 75th Street and 37th Avenue in April. A baby boy was hit at Roosevelt Avenue and 81st Street just weeks ago. The numbers are relentless. The pain is not abstract.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-hurt-us>The Machines That Hurt Us</h3><p>SUVs and sedans do most of the damage. In the last year, SUVs and cars injured at least 68 pedestrians. Trucks and buses hurt three more. Motorcycles and mopeds, four. Even bikes, four. The street is a gauntlet. The curb is no refuge. &ldquo;I have a baby with me. That would be scary. I&rsquo;ll be more cautious of my surroundings,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>said a mother after a bus jumped the curb in Flushing, injuring eight</a>.</p><h3 id=what-has-council-member-krishnan-done>What Has Council Member Krishnan Done?</h3><p>Council Member Shekar Krishnan has backed some real changes. He co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks and force the city to daylight 1,000 intersections a year (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>co-sponsored a bill</a>). He led a push to plant trees and build green medians between bike lanes and traffic (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>led a push</a>). He voted to remove abandoned cars fast, clearing sightlines for people on foot and bike. He has called for faster parks and greenway projects, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/12/08/council-wants-to-speed-up-parks-projects-like-those-much-delayed-greenways/>saying, &ldquo;The infrastructure projects, the transportation and green space projects, need to be progressing at a much much faster rate&rdquo;</a>.</p><p>But the pace is slow. The danger is not. Every week brings new injuries.</p><h3 id=the-call-demand-more-demand-it-now>The Call: Demand More, Demand It Now</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Call Council Member Krishnan. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand more daylighted intersections. Demand streets where a child can cross without fear. Do not wait for the first death.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Advocates and organizers say the current funding is inadequate, calling it a "token show of support" and demanding $48 million over three years. The City Council will address the issue in upcoming budget hearings. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, children, families—remain at risk as the city hesitates to commit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The street remembers the impact.</p><p class=mb3>ABC7 reported on May 2, 2025, that Michael Peña, a former FDNY probationary firefighter, was released on $75,000 bail after a deadly Queens crash. Police allege Peña was 'drunk and high on cocaine and marijuana' and speeding at 83 mph when he 'ran a red light and T-boned a car driven by 24-year-old Justin Diaz.' The crash happened at Northern Boulevard and East 107th Street as Diaz drove to work. Prosecutors cited Peña’s firing from the FDNY and prior legal issues to argue for remand, but the appellate court released him with minimal bail conditions. Peña faces manslaughter and other charges, with a possible 15-year sentence if convicted. The case highlights the lethal risk of impaired, reckless driving and the limits of pretrial detention policy.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
