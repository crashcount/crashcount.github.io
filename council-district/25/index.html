An SUV driver went around another car, ran the red, and hit them. The driver fled. The girls survived, but the street did not forgive. Police said the children suffered minor injuries and were taken to Elmhurst Hospital. The driver remains at large. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/26/two-little-girls-4-and-8-struck-by-driver-who-blew-red-light-in-queens/>The SUV driver fled after the collision and remains on the loose, police said.</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>District 25 saw 837 crashes, 450 injuries, and 5 people seriously hurt</strong>. One person died. In three years, 11 people have died. The numbers do not bleed, but the streets do.</p><p>A firefighter ran a red at 107th Street and Northern Boulevard. The crash killed a 23-year-old man. The firefighter was suspended. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/26/man-24-behind-wheel-of-bmw-fatally-struck-by-queens-mercedes-driver/>The FDNY stated Pena will be suspended without pay for 28 days during the investigation.</a></p><p>SUVs, sedans, and trucks do most of the damage. In three years, cars and SUVs killed three pedestrians here. Bikes killed one. The rest—mopeds, trucks, buses—leave bruises and broken bones, but the big vehicles take the most lives.</p><p>Council Member Shekar Krishnan has backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks, legalize jaywalking, and demand protected bike lanes. He voted for a citywide greenway plan. He co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, which targets reckless driving and calls for safer design. He has spoken for car-free streets on Halloween, and for moped registration and education. But the blood keeps coming.</p><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits, redesign deadly crossings, and hold repeat offenders off the road. But power unused is as good as no power at all. <strong>Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand action before another child’s name is added to the list.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another siren.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Mark Levine, who called for bold highway changes, won the Comptroller race.

The matter summary reads: 'Supporters of the 34th Avenue open street hope design changes can help calm the strip and redirect faster riders to a safer Northern Boulevard.' Dawn Siff and Jim Burke spoke for more park space and bike access.

Federal funds are gone. Mayor Adams offers no city money. DOT warns of shrinking hours and scope. Council Member Krishnan blasts the move. Streets once safe for walkers and riders now risk return to cars. The future is uncertain.</p><p class=mb3>On April 3, 2025, New York City’s Open Streets program entered crisis. The program, legislated by the City Council, lost its federal Covid funding. Mayor Adams has not allocated city funds. The Department of Transportation (DOT) says $5 million is needed to maintain current operations, but the Council’s preliminary budget omits this. DOT Chief of Staff Ryan Lynch told advocates the agency is lobbying for replacement funds. Council Member Shekar Krishnan criticized the mayor’s stance, saying, “It’s deeply misguided to cut funds from the open street program, especially at this moment.” The City Comptroller’s office also faulted the administration for poor planning. The funding gap has already led to reduced hours and fewer open streets. Council members are pushing for restoration, but the program’s future hangs in the balance.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
