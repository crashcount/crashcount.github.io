No one died.</p><p class=mb3>On March 19, 2024, Supreme Court Justice Michelle Johnson sentenced Frank Cavalluzzi to 14 years in prison for nine counts of attempted murder. The case stemmed from a June 2020 incident, when Cavalluzzi, wearing a 'Wolverine' glove with blades, threatened and then drove at Black Lives Matter protesters on a Whitestone overpass above the Cross Island Parkway. The matter summary states Cavalluzzi 'taunted, then attempted to run over nine Black Lives Matter protesters.' Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz called the sentence 'justice,' emphasizing Cavalluzzi's use of racial slurs and his attack on peaceful demonstrators. Cavalluzzi's lawyer, Jason Russo, argued the case was overcharged, but the court rejected this. The sentence holds a dangerous driver accountable for targeting vulnerable people using the street to protest.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Jessica Ramos led a rally, citing 'reckless drivers who refuse to yield to pedestrians' and called for stronger pedestrian safety, saying, 'driving is a privilege that can, and should be, taken away.' Adam White, a lawyer for crash victims, said the DA should have insisted Barcia not drive. The rally highlighted rising road deaths—48 killed citywide in early 2024—and called out the city’s failure to protect its most vulnerable.

The street remains dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On January 22, 2024, Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz’s office quietly downgraded charges against Claudia Mendez-Vasquez, who killed 7-year-old Dolma Naadhun in Astoria. Mendez-Vasquez, initially charged with criminally negligent homicide, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor reckless driving and received probation. The DA’s office cited the family’s wishes, but advocates and family friends called the outcome a slap on the wrist. The crash sparked local activism: the community board passed a resolution for universal daylighting—removing parked cars from corners to improve visibility. Mayor Adams pledged to daylight 1,000 intersections a year, but the Department of Transportation has resisted full implementation, citing concerns about driver behavior. The city installed a traffic signal and banned parking at two corners, but systemic danger remains. The case highlights how lenient prosecution and slow policy change leave vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
