On August 12, a car tore through 42nd Street in Queens, slammed into a food truck, and killed two men standing outside. The driver died too. The street was left scattered with broken glass and spilled coffee. A brother stood by the curb and said, &ldquo;He was always happy. He would make you happy. He would make happy any person in the world&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/car-hits-food-truck-in-queens-3-dead/>CBS New York</a>.</p><p>A witness watched the car fly through the stop sign. &ldquo;Must have been going at least 60+ miles an hour just right through the stop sign and within seconds I heard the crash and screams and just dropped everything and ran over there, it was instant&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/astoria-queens-crash-kills-2-leaves-critical-condition-cars-collide-local-road-new-york/17512236/>ABC7</a>.</p><p><strong>In the last 12 months, District 29 saw 3 deaths, 798 injuries, and 8 serious injuries</strong> from crashes. The dead are mostly men, mostly on foot. The numbers do not stop. They only grow.</p><h3 id=the-system-fails-the-vulnerable>The System Fails the Vulnerable</h3><p>The killers are cars and trucks. Sedans alone caused 2 deaths and 130 injuries. SUVs, trucks, and motorcycles add more to the toll. The victims are not just numbers. They are brothers, fathers, workers. Some were just buying coffee. Some were crossing with the light. Some were children.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Lynn Schulman has voted for bills to speed up pavement markings and remove abandoned vehicles <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>. These are steps, but they do not slow the cars or protect the people at the curb. There is no record of Schulman leading on lower speed limits, on daylighting, or on the laws that would keep repeat speeders off the street. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</h3><p><strong>Speed kills. Delay kills.</strong> Call Council Member Schulman. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people on foot and bike. Do not wait for the next crash. The street will not wait for you.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Mendez-Vasquez, initially charged with criminally negligent homicide, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor reckless driving and received probation. The DA’s office cited the family’s wishes, but advocates and family friends called the outcome a slap on the wrist. The crash sparked local activism: the community board passed a resolution for universal daylighting—removing parked cars from corners to improve visibility. Mayor Adams pledged to daylight 1,000 intersections a year, but the Department of Transportation has resisted full implementation, citing concerns about driver behavior. The city installed a traffic signal and banned parking at two corners, but systemic danger remains. The case highlights how lenient prosecution and slow policy change leave vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The car had received at least 12 school-zone speeding tickets since June 21, but authorities failed to intervene until this incident. Council Member Justin Brannan reported the arrest, saying, "It seems the various systems currently in place to deter this type of behavior have failed here." Brannan and Queens DA Melinda Katz both criticized the current penalties, calling them too weak to deter dangerous drivers. Katz said, "There is a strong need for tougher penalties for those who choose to use our city streets as raceways." The article notes that only after 15 camera-issued speeding tickets in a year must drivers take a safety course, and few cars are seized under the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program. Community complaints led to the arrest, but most reckless drivers still evade real consequences.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Soriano faces manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, and leaving the scene charges. The crash happened when Soriano, driving a Toyota Camry, swerved into oncoming traffic and struck Durazno, who later died from severe head trauma. The car, a rental, was found nearby. Witnesses described Soriano as he fled on foot. Despite these leads, it took eight months to make an arrest. The matter highlights systemic failure: in 2020, NYPD made arrests in only 0.8 percent of hit-and-run cases involving injuries or property damage. Even in serious injury cases, arrests are rare.
