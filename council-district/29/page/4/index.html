But the silence is not peace. In twelve months, 670 people were hurt, seven left with injuries so grave they may never walk the same. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. A man in his fifties lies in a hospital bed, struck down by a black SUV that kept going, leaving him unresponsive on the road. Police say the driver never stopped <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/ozone-park-hit-run-crash-pedestrian-struck-critically-injured-collision-queens-nyc/16780134/>according to ABC7</a>. The city calls these numbers progress. For the families, it is a wound that does not close.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h2><p>Council Member Lynn Schulman has signed her name to bills that matter. She voted to legalize crossing the street outside the lines, ending the old blame game against walkers <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>on the NYC Council Legistar</a>. She backed the SAFE Streets Act, pushing Albany to let the city set lower speed limits and give crash victims more rights <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>through the same legislative platform</a>. She called out delivery apps, saying, “Right now, delivery workers are essentially incentivized for speed&mldr; This often results in driving recklessly, often putting the lives of pedestrians at risk” <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/delivery-apps-in-nyc-could-be-held-responsible-for-workers-following-traffic-laws>as reported by Gothamist</a>.</p><p>But not every vote protects the most vulnerable. Schulman co-sponsored a helmet mandate for cyclists and a bill to restrict scooter-share, moves that shift the burden to those outside the car and threaten to cut off safe, affordable ways to move <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/17/queens-pols-have-lots-of-claims-about-the-evils-of-scooter-share-but-few-facts>according to Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p><h2 id=the-road-ahead-what-residents-must-demand>The Road Ahead: What Residents Must Demand</h2><p>The violence is not fate. It is policy, speed, and the weight of inaction. The city now has the power to lower speed limits. It has the tools to redesign streets and keep cameras running. But power unused is as deadly as a car left in gear. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand that every bill put people first, not cars.</p><p>Do not wait for the next siren.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The car had received at least 12 school-zone speeding tickets since June 21, but authorities failed to intervene until this incident. Council Member Justin Brannan reported the arrest, saying, "It seems the various systems currently in place to deter this type of behavior have failed here." Brannan and Queens DA Melinda Katz both criticized the current penalties, calling them too weak to deter dangerous drivers. Katz said, "There is a strong need for tougher penalties for those who choose to use our city streets as raceways." The article notes that only after 15 camera-issued speeding tickets in a year must drivers take a safety course, and few cars are seized under the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program. Community complaints led to the arrest, but most reckless drivers still evade real consequences.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the driver was unlicensed and traveling at unsafe speed. The impact caused severe lacerations to the pedestrian’s lower leg, leaving him conscious but bleeding on the pavement. The report lists 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' as contributing factors. The sedan’s center front end took the brunt of the crash. No injuries were reported for the occupants inside the vehicle. The system failed the man on the street.

Most hit-and-run drivers in New York escape justice.</p><p class=mb3>On February 9, 2022, NYPD arrested Christian Soriano, 27, for the June 4, 2021 hit-and-run crash that killed 16-year-old cyclist Darwin Durazno in College Point, Queens. Soriano faces manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, and leaving the scene charges. The crash happened when Soriano, driving a Toyota Camry, swerved into oncoming traffic and struck Durazno, who later died from severe head trauma. The car, a rental, was found nearby. Witnesses described Soriano as he fled on foot. Despite these leads, it took eight months to make an arrest. The matter highlights systemic failure: in 2020, NYPD made arrests in only 0.8 percent of hit-and-run cases involving injuries or property damage. Even in serious injury cases, arrests are rare. Vulnerable road users remain at risk while most drivers evade consequences.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The case never reached criminal court. Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz declined to prosecute, citing Andrianou’s claim that her car accelerated uncontrollably after a minor rear tap. Video evidence contradicted this, showing only a light bump. In a December 8, 2021, deposition for a civil suit, Andrianou showed little remorse, blaming her car and denying responsibility. Attorneys for Lin’s family called her defense 'fabricated.' Katz’s decision left the victim’s family with only civil recourse. The case underscores how drivers who kill often escape criminal accountability, leaving vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
