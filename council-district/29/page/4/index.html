But the silence is not peace. In twelve months, 670 people were hurt, seven left with injuries so grave they may never walk the same. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. A man in his fifties lies in a hospital bed, struck down by a black SUV that kept going, leaving him unresponsive on the road. Police say the driver never stopped <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/ozone-park-hit-run-crash-pedestrian-struck-critically-injured-collision-queens-nyc/16780134/>according to ABC7</a>. The city calls these numbers progress. For the families, it is a wound that does not close.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h2><p>Council Member Lynn Schulman has signed her name to bills that matter. She voted to legalize crossing the street outside the lines, ending the old blame game against walkers <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>on the NYC Council Legistar</a>. She backed the SAFE Streets Act, pushing Albany to let the city set lower speed limits and give crash victims more rights <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>through the same legislative platform</a>. She called out delivery apps, saying, “Right now, delivery workers are essentially incentivized for speed&mldr; This often results in driving recklessly, often putting the lives of pedestrians at risk” <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/delivery-apps-in-nyc-could-be-held-responsible-for-workers-following-traffic-laws>as reported by Gothamist</a>.</p><p>But not every vote protects the most vulnerable. Schulman co-sponsored a helmet mandate for cyclists and a bill to restrict scooter-share, moves that shift the burden to those outside the car and threaten to cut off safe, affordable ways to move <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/17/queens-pols-have-lots-of-claims-about-the-evils-of-scooter-share-but-few-facts>according to Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p><h2 id=the-road-ahead-what-residents-must-demand>The Road Ahead: What Residents Must Demand</h2><p>The violence is not fate. It is policy, speed, and the weight of inaction. The city now has the power to lower speed limits. It has the tools to redesign streets and keep cameras running. But power unused is as deadly as a car left in gear. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand that every bill put people first, not cars.</p><p>Do not wait for the next siren.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Mendez-Vasquez, initially charged with criminally negligent homicide, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor reckless driving and received probation. The DA’s office cited the family’s wishes, but advocates and family friends called the outcome a slap on the wrist. The crash sparked local activism: the community board passed a resolution for universal daylighting—removing parked cars from corners to improve visibility. Mayor Adams pledged to daylight 1,000 intersections a year, but the Department of Transportation has resisted full implementation, citing concerns about driver behavior. The city installed a traffic signal and banned parking at two corners, but systemic danger remains. The case highlights how lenient prosecution and slow policy change leave vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The car had received at least 12 school-zone speeding tickets since June 21, but authorities failed to intervene until this incident. Council Member Justin Brannan reported the arrest, saying, "It seems the various systems currently in place to deter this type of behavior have failed here." Brannan and Queens DA Melinda Katz both criticized the current penalties, calling them too weak to deter dangerous drivers. Katz said, "There is a strong need for tougher penalties for those who choose to use our city streets as raceways." The article notes that only after 15 camera-issued speeding tickets in a year must drivers take a safety course, and few cars are seized under the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program. Community complaints led to the arrest, but most reckless drivers still evade real consequences.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
