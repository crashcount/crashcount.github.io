The car had received at least 12 school-zone speeding tickets since June 21, but authorities failed to intervene until this incident. Council Member Justin Brannan reported the arrest, saying, "It seems the various systems currently in place to deter this type of behavior have failed here." Brannan and Queens DA Melinda Katz both criticized the current penalties, calling them too weak to deter dangerous drivers. Katz said, "There is a strong need for tougher penalties for those who choose to use our city streets as raceways." The article notes that only after 15 camera-issued speeding tickets in a year must drivers take a safety course, and few cars are seized under the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program. Community complaints led to the arrest, but most reckless drivers still evade real consequences.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Soriano faces manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, and leaving the scene charges. The crash happened when Soriano, driving a Toyota Camry, swerved into oncoming traffic and struck Durazno, who later died from severe head trauma. The car, a rental, was found nearby. Witnesses described Soriano as he fled on foot. Despite these leads, it took eight months to make an arrest. The matter highlights systemic failure: in 2020, NYPD made arrests in only 0.8 percent of hit-and-run cases involving injuries or property damage. Even in serious injury cases, arrests are rare.

The DA declined charges. In deposition, the driver showed little remorse. She blamed her car, denied fault, and dodged questions. The victim’s family pursues civil justice. Systemic failures shield deadly drivers.</p><p class=mb3>On April 29, 2021, Maro Andrianou, driving a Mercedes-Benz, struck and killed delivery worker Xing Long Lin on 35th Street near Ditmars Boulevard in Queens. The case never reached criminal court. Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz declined to prosecute, citing Andrianou’s claim that her car accelerated uncontrollably after a minor rear tap. Video evidence contradicted this, showing only a light bump. In a December 8, 2021, deposition for a civil suit, Andrianou showed little remorse, blaming her car and denying responsibility. Attorneys for Lin’s family called her defense 'fabricated.' Katz’s decision left the victim’s family with only civil recourse. The case underscores how drivers who kill often escape criminal accountability, leaving vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
