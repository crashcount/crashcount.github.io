The crash was caught on camera. The owner waited months for repairs. Only public pressure forced Amazon to pay. The system failed the victim, not the driver.</p><p class=mb3>ABC7 reported on May 20, 2025, that a doorbell camera recorded an Amazon delivery truck striking a parked car in Queens and leaving the scene. The owner, Jose DeAguiar, described, "He rams right into the side of the car." The driver exited, inspected the damage, then left without leaving a note. Despite clear video evidence, DeAguiar spent three months seeking accountability as insurers denied responsibility. Only after ABC7's intervention did Amazon respond, covering $6,000 in repairs and $5,000 in storage fees. The incident highlights gaps in corporate accountability and insurance processes when commercial drivers strike parked vehicles and leave, leaving victims to navigate a maze of denials and delays.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure calls for 'requiring the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices for repeated violation of maximum speed limits.' Council Member Lincoln Restler leads, joined by nine co-sponsors including Yusef Salaam and Shahana Hanif. The bill landed in committee on April 24, 2025, with no vote yet. If passed at the state level, it would force repeat speeders to install devices that block speeding. The Council’s action highlights the ongoing risk to vulnerable road users as reckless drivers remain unchecked.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
