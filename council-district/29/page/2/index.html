Seventeen left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 2,000 hurt since 2022. The youngest, a child. The oldest, a grandparent. Most never make the news. Their pain is quiet, but it does not fade.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the worst of it.</strong> In the last year alone, 669 people were injured on these streets. No deaths in the past twelve months, but the wounds run deep. Nine people were struck in a single crash on Liberty Avenue this April. Police said, &ldquo;None of the victims suffered life-threatening injuries&rdquo;—but that is cold comfort to the families waiting in hospital halls <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/queens-pedestrians-struck-several-people-injured-being-hit-south-richmond-hill/16124727/>reported ABC7</a>.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h2><p>Council Member Lynn Schulman has signed on to bills that matter. She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, pushing for lower speed limits and a crash victims bill of rights. She voted to end jaywalking enforcement, a move that stops blaming the dead for their own deaths. She backed new greenways and better lighting for crossings.</p><p>But not every step is forward. Schulman joined the push to ban the Queens e-scooter share, despite no deaths or serious injuries and 290,000 safe trips. The city’s own data shows the program works, but politics got in the way <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/17/queens-pols-have-lots-of-claims-about-the-evils-of-scooter-share-but-few-facts>according to Streetsblog</a>.</p><p>She called out delivery apps for pushing workers to speed, saying, &ldquo;Right now, delivery workers are essentially incentivized for speed&mldr; This often results in driving recklessly, often putting the lives of pedestrians at risk&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/delivery-apps-in-nyc-could-be-held-responsible-for-workers-following-traffic-laws>as reported by Gothamist</a>.</p><h2 id=the-system-grinds-on>The System Grinds On</h2><p><strong>Cars and trucks do the most harm.</strong> In three years, they killed three, seriously injured four, and left dozens more with broken bones and bleeding heads. Motorcycles and mopeds killed one, seriously injured none. Bikes caused no deaths.</p><p>When an Amazon truck hit a parked car and fled, the owner watched the video: &ldquo;He rams right into the side of the car&mldr; He comes out, looks at it, shrugs his shoulders, and leaves. No note, nothing. No care for anyone else&rsquo;s property&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/7-side-helps-get-repairs-covered-amazon-driver-allegedly-crashed-parked-car-drove-off/16474908/>the owner told ABC7</a>.</p><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong></p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>Contact Lynn Schulman. Demand she fight for lower speed limits, more protected crossings, and real accountability for reckless drivers.</strong> Join groups like Transportation Alternatives and Families for Safe Streets. Show up. Speak out. <strong>Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Vulnerable New Yorkers wait for action.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0724-2024, now in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, was introduced on March 19, 2024. The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring that the department of transportation repair broken curbs as part of resurfacing projects,' demands DOT fix hazardous curbs during any resurfacing work. Council Members Schulman, Gennaro (primary sponsor), Gutiérrez, Louis, Brewer, and Avilés back the measure. The bill aims to close a deadly gap: broken curbs force pedestrians, wheelchair users, and parents with strollers into traffic. The law would take effect 120 days after passage.

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the posting of signs notifying operators of bicycles, bicycles with electric assist, and electric scooters of the prohibition against operating such devices on sidewalks, park walkways, and boardwalks, and of related fines and penalties," would require the Department of Transportation and the Department of Parks and Recreation to post signs warning riders of these restrictions and the consequences. Council Member Lincoln Restler led as primary sponsor, joined by Hudson, Hanif, Brewer, Ung, Abreu, Brooks-Powers, Gutiérrez, and Schulman. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. No direct safety analysis was provided.

The measure urges the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, A.1679/S.561, which would 'increase the penalty for leaving the scene of an accident involving an e-scooter and further calls upon the New York State Legislature to include e-bikes in such legislation.' Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary sponsor), Gale A. Brewer, Shaun Abreu, Lynn C. Schulman, and Amanda Farías backed the resolution. The bill would raise penalties for e-scooter hit-and-runs from a violation to a misdemeanor or felony, and seeks to add e-bikes to the law. The council argues this could keep more crash-involved riders at the scene, helping protect pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
