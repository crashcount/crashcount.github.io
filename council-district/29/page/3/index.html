But the silence is not peace. In twelve months, 670 people were hurt, seven left with injuries so grave they may never walk the same. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. A man in his fifties lies in a hospital bed, struck down by a black SUV that kept going, leaving him unresponsive on the road. Police say the driver never stopped <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/ozone-park-hit-run-crash-pedestrian-struck-critically-injured-collision-queens-nyc/16780134/>according to ABC7</a>. The city calls these numbers progress. For the families, it is a wound that does not close.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h2><p>Council Member Lynn Schulman has signed her name to bills that matter. She voted to legalize crossing the street outside the lines, ending the old blame game against walkers <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>on the NYC Council Legistar</a>. She backed the SAFE Streets Act, pushing Albany to let the city set lower speed limits and give crash victims more rights <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>through the same legislative platform</a>. She called out delivery apps, saying, “Right now, delivery workers are essentially incentivized for speed&mldr; This often results in driving recklessly, often putting the lives of pedestrians at risk” <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/delivery-apps-in-nyc-could-be-held-responsible-for-workers-following-traffic-laws>as reported by Gothamist</a>.</p><p>But not every vote protects the most vulnerable. Schulman co-sponsored a helmet mandate for cyclists and a bill to restrict scooter-share, moves that shift the burden to those outside the car and threaten to cut off safe, affordable ways to move <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/17/queens-pols-have-lots-of-claims-about-the-evils-of-scooter-share-but-few-facts>according to Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p><h2 id=the-road-ahead-what-residents-must-demand>The Road Ahead: What Residents Must Demand</h2><p>The violence is not fate. It is policy, speed, and the weight of inaction. The city now has the power to lower speed limits. It has the tools to redesign streets and keep cameras running. But power unused is as deadly as a car left in gear. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand that every bill put people first, not cars.</p><p>Do not wait for the next siren.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary sponsor), Lynn C. Schulman, Sandra Ung, Crystal Hudson, and Selvena N. Brooks-Powers back the bill.
