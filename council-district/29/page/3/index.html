On August 12, a car tore through 42nd Street in Queens, slammed into a food truck, and killed two men standing outside. The driver died too. The street was left scattered with broken glass and spilled coffee. A brother stood by the curb and said, &ldquo;He was always happy. He would make you happy. He would make happy any person in the world&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/car-hits-food-truck-in-queens-3-dead/>CBS New York</a>.</p><p>A witness watched the car fly through the stop sign. &ldquo;Must have been going at least 60+ miles an hour just right through the stop sign and within seconds I heard the crash and screams and just dropped everything and ran over there, it was instant&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/astoria-queens-crash-kills-2-leaves-critical-condition-cars-collide-local-road-new-york/17512236/>ABC7</a>.</p><p><strong>In the last 12 months, District 29 saw 3 deaths, 798 injuries, and 8 serious injuries</strong> from crashes. The dead are mostly men, mostly on foot. The numbers do not stop. They only grow.</p><h3 id=the-system-fails-the-vulnerable>The System Fails the Vulnerable</h3><p>The killers are cars and trucks. Sedans alone caused 2 deaths and 130 injuries. SUVs, trucks, and motorcycles add more to the toll. The victims are not just numbers. They are brothers, fathers, workers. Some were just buying coffee. Some were crossing with the light. Some were children.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Lynn Schulman has voted for bills to speed up pavement markings and remove abandoned vehicles <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>. These are steps, but they do not slow the cars or protect the people at the curb. There is no record of Schulman leading on lower speed limits, on daylighting, or on the laws that would keep repeat speeders off the street. The silence is loud.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-than-words>Call to Action: Demand More Than Words</h3><p><strong>Speed kills. Delay kills.</strong> Call Council Member Schulman. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people on foot and bike. Do not wait for the next crash. The street will not wait for you.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities.

The report states the rider, a 30-year-old man, was unlicensed and wore no helmet or protective gear. The impact crushed his leg, leaving him conscious but in severe pain. The police report describes the scene: 'A motorscooter slammed into a sedan’s rear. The rider, unlicensed and unarmored, crushed his leg on impact. No helmet. Just flesh meeting steel.' The scooter’s front end folded from the force. The sedan sustained damage to its right rear bumper. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified.' The focus remains on the systemic danger of unlicensed, unprotected operation and the unforgiving violence of car-dominated streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The case stemmed from a June 2020 incident, when Cavalluzzi, wearing a 'Wolverine' glove with blades, threatened and then drove at Black Lives Matter protesters on a Whitestone overpass above the Cross Island Parkway. The matter summary states Cavalluzzi 'taunted, then attempted to run over nine Black Lives Matter protesters.' Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz called the sentence 'justice,' emphasizing Cavalluzzi's use of racial slurs and his attack on peaceful demonstrators. Cavalluzzi's lawyer, Jason Russo, argued the case was overcharged, but the court rejected this.
