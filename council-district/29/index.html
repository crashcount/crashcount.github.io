But the silence is not peace. In twelve months, 670 people were hurt, seven left with injuries so grave they may never walk the same. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. A man in his fifties lies in a hospital bed, struck down by a black SUV that kept going, leaving him unresponsive on the road. Police say the driver never stopped <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/ozone-park-hit-run-crash-pedestrian-struck-critically-injured-collision-queens-nyc/16780134/>according to ABC7</a>. The city calls these numbers progress. For the families, it is a wound that does not close.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h2><p>Council Member Lynn Schulman has signed her name to bills that matter. She voted to legalize crossing the street outside the lines, ending the old blame game against walkers <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>on the NYC Council Legistar</a>. She backed the SAFE Streets Act, pushing Albany to let the city set lower speed limits and give crash victims more rights <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>through the same legislative platform</a>. She called out delivery apps, saying, “Right now, delivery workers are essentially incentivized for speed&mldr; This often results in driving recklessly, often putting the lives of pedestrians at risk” <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/delivery-apps-in-nyc-could-be-held-responsible-for-workers-following-traffic-laws>as reported by Gothamist</a>.</p><p>But not every vote protects the most vulnerable. Schulman co-sponsored a helmet mandate for cyclists and a bill to restrict scooter-share, moves that shift the burden to those outside the car and threaten to cut off safe, affordable ways to move <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/09/17/queens-pols-have-lots-of-claims-about-the-evils-of-scooter-share-but-few-facts>according to Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p><h2 id=the-road-ahead-what-residents-must-demand>The Road Ahead: What Residents Must Demand</h2><p>The violence is not fate. It is policy, speed, and the weight of inaction. The city now has the power to lower speed limits. It has the tools to redesign streets and keep cameras running. But power unused is as deadly as a car left in gear. Call your council member. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand that every bill put people first, not cars.</p><p>Do not wait for the next siren.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Introduced January 23, 2025, it urges the state to pass A10660/S9915, the Protecting Animals Walking on the Street (PAWS) Act. The resolution states: 'add the term companion animals to the list of possible victim classes should a driver fail to exercise due care to avoid striking pedestrians and to increase the fine for striking a pet with a vehicle and leaving the scene without reporting the incident.' Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary sponsor), Lynn C. Schulman, Carlina Rivera, and Justin L. Brannan back the measure. The PAWS Act would raise fines for drivers who hit pets and leave, and would recognize companion animals as protected victims under traffic law. The move targets a gap in current law, where penalties for striking animals are minor—on par with an illegal U-turn. The Council’s action signals a push for stronger accountability when vehicles harm the city’s most vulnerable, including its animals.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill was introduced on September 12, 2024, and referred to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure the same day. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting the operation of shared electric scooter systems on certain streets in the Borough of Queens.' Council Members Lynn C. Schulman (District 29, primary sponsor) and Sandra Ung (District 20, co-sponsor) back the measure. The bill would stop shared e-scooter organizations from operating in a dense, contested part of Queens. No safety analysis was provided. The legislation draws a hard line on who can move—and how—on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bills aim to address 'myriad health and safety concerns' from e-bike crashes, battery fires, and low pay. Councilmember Lynn Schulman, District 29, spoke out: 'Right now, delivery workers are essentially incentivized for speed... This often results in driving recklessly, often putting the lives of pedestrians at risk.' Three bills would make apps like Uber Eats and DoorDash responsible for vehicle safety and compliance, require them to provide safety-compliant e-bikes, and ensure mopeds are registered. Other bills target pay transparency and tip protections. Councilmembers Shaun Abreu and Rafael Salamanca also spoke in support. The measures seek to hold companies accountable for dangers faced by vulnerable road users and delivery workers alike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
