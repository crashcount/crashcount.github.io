Sixteen people have died on these streets since 2022. Fifty-two more have suffered serious injuries. The dead include children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians. The living carry scars you cannot see.</p><p>Last spring, a cyclist was killed on India Street by a man on an e-bike. The city record says only: &ldquo;Severe bleeding. Apparent death.&rdquo; No more details. No comfort. Just a name on a list. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><p>A woman was crushed in the back seat of an SUV on Flatbush Avenue. The record reads: &ldquo;Crush injuries. Apparent death.&rdquo; The car kept moving.

They killed at least six people and injured hundreds more. SUVs, sedans, and trucks together account for the majority of deaths and injuries. Bikes and mopeds killed two, injured dozens. The numbers do not lie. The danger is not abstract. It is steel and speed.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has taken some steps. He voted to remove abandoned vehicles that block sightlines and endanger walkers and riders. He co-sponsored a bill to require warning decals on taxi doors, a small move against the threat of dooring. He backed a crackdown on illegal placard parking, which steals space from people and gives it to cars. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/24/police-finally-remove-cars-from-plaza-in-downtown-brooklyn>Cracking down on placard abuse reduces illegal parking, especially in bike lanes, crosswalks, and sidewalks, improving safety and accessibility for pedestrians and cyclists by reclaiming public space and reducing driver entitlement.</a></p><p>But the council has also spent time on bills that shift the burden to cyclists and pedestrians. Decals and data collection do not stop speeding cars. The streets are still not safe.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p>Every death is preventable. The city has the power to lower speed limits, redesign streets, and end the reign of reckless drivers. Call Council Member Restler. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes and daylighted crosswalks. Demand action, not excuses.</p><p>No more names on a list. No more blood in the gutter. The time is now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Judge Ventura issued a restraining order after Transportation Alternatives and Baruch Herzfeld appealed the city’s move. The city had planned to start demolition after complaints from local leaders, but the court’s order blocks any changes until further review. Streetsblog quotes Ben Furnas: 'The Adams administration is going to have to spend their night preparing their legal case, not ripping out a critical safety project.' The article highlights weak enforcement of parking rules and the city’s reversal against its own DOT’s safety plan. The case underscores how political pressure and lax enforcement can threaten vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The action, coordinated with Council Member Lincoln Restler, followed community complaints. Officers issued 40 summonses and towed 10 vehicles. The NYPD stated, "Following community complaints about illegal parking... the NYPD Transportation Bureau and Council Member Lincoln Restler coordinated... to address the parking condition and clear the area." Council Members Restler and Crystal Hudson represent the district but did not claim credit. The crackdown targets city employees who abused parking privileges for years.

The court found the city may have acted "arbitrarily, capriciously, and illegally" by ordering the removal without proper legal notice. City law requires the Department of Transportation to notify local officials and allow time for public discussion, but, as the court papers state, "DOT did not provide the required notice." Plaintiffs argued that removing the lane would "irreparably" harm cyclists, especially children. The city claimed it would only shift the lane, not remove it, but advocates countered that any removal increases danger.

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'before this bike lane from 2018 to 2022 this is the area that had the second largest numbers of pedestrian fatalities and crashes in the city.' The lane faced opposition from some Hasidic leaders, citing children running into the lane from illegally parked cars and buses. Despite tweaks—school bus zones, daylighted corners, no standing areas—drivers kept parking illegally, blocking sightlines and endangering children. The city rarely removes protected lanes, but Adams acted after political pressure. Moving the lane to Classon Avenue, as some demand, would force cyclists onto a chaotic BQE ramp.
