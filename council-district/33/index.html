Eighteen left with wounds that will not heal. In the last twelve months, District 33 saw <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>1,745 crashes</a>. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>Four children were seriously hurt</a>. A cyclist was killed on Lynch Street. A pedestrian bled out on India Street. These are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors. The street does not care if you are young or old. It takes what it wants.</p><p>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage. In three years, they killed five. Bikes killed two. Trucks and buses killed two more. The rest were left broken, sometimes for life. The pain is not spread evenly. The old, the young, the ones on foot or bike—they pay the highest price.</p><h3 id=the-politics-of-safety>The Politics of Safety</h3><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has not been silent. He voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths. He co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>speed up protected bike lanes</a>. He stood with families when the mayor tried to <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/breaking-activists-sue-city-to-prevent-erasure-of-bedford-avenue-bike-lane>rip out the Bedford Avenue bike lane</a>. “For months, the Mayor has repeatedly ignored our recommendations for ensuring the safety of children on Bedford Avenue,” <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/adams-dot-remove-bedford-avenue-bike-lane/>Restler said</a>. “Instead of identifying solutions that enhance safety for pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers, the Mayor is making a purely political decision to rip out a bike lane with no alternative.”</p><p>When the city tried to erase the lane, a judge <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/court-stops-bedford-avenue-bike-lane-removal/>stopped them</a>. Restler filed an affidavit to keep the protection in place. The fight is not over. The city will try again. The street will claim more lives if nothing changes.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>The disaster is not fate. Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. The council can pass more laws. The mayor can build more barriers. The police can enforce the rules. But none of it matters if the public stays quiet. Contact your council member. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand protected bike lanes that cannot be erased by a backroom deal. Demand that every child can cross the street and come home.</p><p>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The street is hungry. It will not stop on its own.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Department of Transportation will fine violators $650 per incident, using in-road sensors to detect excess weight. Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "Overweight trucks cause wear and tear on our roadways and we all pay the price through expensive repairs to our infrastructure." The city issued over 3,000 warnings during a 90-day grace period. Similar enforcement on Queens-bound trucks led to a 60% drop in overweight vehicles. Albany has approved expanding this automated system to more city roadways. The BQE’s aging structure faces risk from trucks exceeding its design limits, raising safety and infrastructure concerns.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter states: 'The city is enjoined and restrained from implementing and commencing/performing any construction or other acts related to the Removal at least until a hearing scheduled for August.' Council Member Lincoln Restler said he was not notified of the plans. Transportation Alternatives and Baruch Herzfeld filed the lawsuit, arguing the city failed to analyze the effects or consult the community.

Riders and workers face new limits.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist reported on June 5, 2025, that Mayor Adams ordered Citi Bike to limit e-bike speeds to 15 mph, citing an 'emergency threat to life and property.' The city rejected Lyft’s plan to add speedometers, demanding immediate compliance. Deputy Mayor Mastro wrote, 'We have requested that you immediately implement this new 15 mph speed limit for Citi Bike e-bikes, and you declined to do so.' Citi Bike agreed to the mandate, though previously voiced concerns. In 2021, e-bike injuries (1,170) and deaths (9) far outpaced those on pedal bikes (236 injuries, 2 deaths). The order follows a crash where a 3-year-old was struck by an e-bike in South Williamsburg. The city will collect public comments before finalizing the rule. The move highlights rising e-bike use and the city’s struggle to manage micromobility safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The safety analyst notes: the event describes a new member joining an advocacy group, which does not directly affect pedestrian or cyclist safety at the population level.

Council Members Yusef Salaam, Tiffany Caban, and Lincoln Restler pressed NYPD Director Joshua Levin about stark racial disparities. The matter: 'Council members criticized NYPD leadership over racial disparities in traffic enforcement after the department refused to acknowledge evidence of bias.' Restler called the disparity 'extreme.' Caban said, 'Black and brown people are being beaten up, searched, arrested, 10 times more than white people.' The NYPD claimed disparities stem from policing high-crime areas. Lawmakers rejected this, citing data showing Black and Latinx drivers are disproportionately stopped, searched, and arrested. The hearing referenced the city’s long record of racially biased enforcement, including jaywalking laws once used to target Black and Latinx New Yorkers. Experts, including the NYCLU, say the Adams administration’s surge in traffic stops continues a pattern of racist policing.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
