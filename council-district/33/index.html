Fifty-two left with injuries that change a life.</strong> In District 33, the numbers do not lie. Since 2022, the streets have claimed children, elders, cyclists, and walkers. The wounds are not just numbers. They are names, faces, empty chairs at dinner tables. <strong>Cars and SUVs killed three. Trucks and buses killed two.

He voted to require taxis and for-hire vehicles to display warning decals about cyclists, a law meant to fight dooring <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>voted</a>. He co-sponsored bills to remove abandoned vehicles, clear crosswalks, and boost plate enforcement. He pushed for daylighting—banning parking near crosswalks to keep sightlines open. But the pace is slow. The committee laid the daylighting bill over in April. The cars still block the corners. The danger waits.</p><p>Restler has also called out the NYPD for racial bias in traffic enforcement, calling the disparity &ldquo;extreme&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/29/council-pols-fume-as-nypd-disputes-report-of-racial-bias-in-traffic-enforcement>called out</a>.

He has supported crackdowns on illegal placard parking that blocks bike lanes and sidewalks <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/24/police-finally-remove-cars-from-plaza-in-downtown-brooklyn>supported crackdowns</a>.</p><h3 id=the-work-left-undone>The Work Left Undone</h3><p><strong>The dead do not care about decals.</strong> They need streets that do not kill. The bills are a start, but they are not enough. The corners are still blind. The lanes are still blocked. The speed is still too high. The city has the power to lower the limit to 20 mph. It has not used it. Every day of delay is another day a mother, a child, or a neighbor does not come home.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Parks should be for people, not for parking.&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/02/28/parking-or-parkland-brooklyn-judges-could-lose-their-perk>Restler said</a>.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Restler called the racial disparity in traffic enforcement &ldquo;extreme.&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/29/council-pols-fume-as-nypd-disputes-report-of-racial-bias-in-traffic-enforcement>Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Call your council member.

The action, coordinated with Council Member Lincoln Restler, followed community complaints. Officers issued 40 summonses and towed 10 vehicles. The NYPD stated, "Following community complaints about illegal parking... the NYPD Transportation Bureau and Council Member Lincoln Restler coordinated... to address the parking condition and clear the area." Council Members Restler and Crystal Hudson represent the district but did not claim credit. The crackdown targets city employees who abused parking privileges for years. Safety analysts note: "Cracking down on placard abuse reduces illegal parking, especially in bike lanes, crosswalks, and sidewalks, improving safety and accessibility for pedestrians and cyclists by reclaiming public space and reducing driver entitlement."</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'before this bike lane from 2018 to 2022 this is the area that had the second largest numbers of pedestrian fatalities and crashes in the city.' The lane faced opposition from some Hasidic leaders, citing children running into the lane from illegally parked cars and buses. Despite tweaks—school bus zones, daylighted corners, no standing areas—drivers kept parking illegally, blocking sightlines and endangering children. The city rarely removes protected lanes, but Adams acted after political pressure. Moving the lane to Classon Avenue, as some demand, would force cyclists onto a chaotic BQE ramp. The decision highlights persistent driver violations and policy gaps that leave vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The redesign replaces two car lanes with 24/7 bus-only lanes and adds pedestrian islands. DOT officials said, 'almost 70,000 daily bus riders are stuck waiting too long for slow buses, drivers are caught in a mess of traffic and pedestrians are left crossing intersections clogged with vehicles.' Since 2019, 55 people have been killed or severely injured in crashes along this stretch. The plan removes curbside parking and bans cars from bus lanes, aiming to speed up twelve bus routes and protect people on foot. Most residents in the area do not own cars and depend on slow buses. The proposal reflects a shift toward prioritizing vulnerable road users and addressing systemic danger on one of Brooklyn's busiest corridors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
