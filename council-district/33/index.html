Res 1024-2025 urges Albany to pass A.5440. Cameras ticket owners who flout posted rules. Fines escalate. Goal: clear lanes and crosswalks. Make streets less hostile to people, not cars.</p><p class=mb3>Res 1024-2025 sits in Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced and referred August 14, 2025. The resolution urges passage of State bill A.5440, which, in the Council’s words, "imposes owner liability for failure of an operator to comply with traffic control indicators within the city of New York." Sponsor: Council Member Lincoln Restler. A.5440, by Assemblymember Steven Raga, authorizes a six-year camera pilot to ticket owners for posted parking-rule violations caught by street or vehicle-mounted cameras. Fines start at $50 and rise to $250 for repeaters, with a $25 late penalty. DOT must publish a two-year report. The aim: fewer illegal blockers, safer space for people outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Primary sponsor: Council Member Lincoln Restler. Co-sponsor: Robert F. Holden. The bill quotes its aim as the “revocation of city‑issued parking permits” for “obscured or defaced license plates.” It would also revoke permits for three misuse violations, any §19‑166 violation, or unpaid violations over $350. Status: Committee. Agenda date: August 14, 2025. Obscured plates block identification and undermine camera enforcement that protects people walking and cycling.

Council Member Lincoln Restler confirmed no timeline for reopening. The Department of Buildings cited the owners for 'Failure to maintain' and ordered demolition. DOB Commissioner James Oddo said engineers are inspecting a second awning showing 'poor maintenance.' The collapse put pedestrians in harm's way.
