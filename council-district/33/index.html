He co-sponsored bills to remove abandoned vehicles, clear crosswalks, and boost plate enforcement. He pushed for daylighting—banning parking near crosswalks to keep sightlines open. But the pace is slow. The committee laid the daylighting bill over in April. The cars still block the corners. The danger waits.</p><p>Restler has also called out the NYPD for racial bias in traffic enforcement, calling the disparity &ldquo;extreme&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/29/council-pols-fume-as-nypd-disputes-report-of-racial-bias-in-traffic-enforcement>called out</a>.

He has supported crackdowns on illegal placard parking that blocks bike lanes and sidewalks <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/24/police-finally-remove-cars-from-plaza-in-downtown-brooklyn>supported crackdowns</a>.</p><h3 id=the-work-left-undone>The Work Left Undone</h3><p><strong>The dead do not care about decals.</strong> They need streets that do not kill. The bills are a start, but they are not enough. The corners are still blind. The lanes are still blocked. The speed is still too high. The city has the power to lower the limit to 20 mph. It has not used it. Every day of delay is another day a mother, a child, or a neighbor does not come home.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Parks should be for people, not for parking.&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/02/28/parking-or-parkland-brooklyn-judges-could-lose-their-perk>Restler said</a>.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Restler called the racial disparity in traffic enforcement &ldquo;extreme.&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/29/council-pols-fume-as-nypd-disputes-report-of-racial-bias-in-traffic-enforcement>Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Call your council member.

The city planned to move cyclists next to car traffic, but the court granted an emergency restraining order after advocates appealed. Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives called the lane a 'critical safety project.' City Hall insists the reconfiguration is legal and claims the appeal delays 'easing the safety concerns plaguing Williamsburg parents.' The protected lane, installed in October 2024, separates cyclists from moving vehicles.

The NYPD stated, "Following community complaints about illegal parking... the NYPD Transportation Bureau and Council Member Lincoln Restler coordinated... to address the parking condition and clear the area." Council Members Restler and Crystal Hudson represent the district but did not claim credit. The crackdown targets city employees who abused parking privileges for years.

The court found the city may have acted "arbitrarily, capriciously, and illegally" by ordering the removal without proper legal notice. City law requires the Department of Transportation to notify local officials and allow time for public discussion, but, as the court papers state, "DOT did not provide the required notice." Plaintiffs argued that removing the lane would "irreparably" harm cyclists, especially children.

The plan uses 'hardened daylighting'—physical barriers, granite blocks, and planters—to stop cars from parking near corners. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' Nearly half of city traffic deaths happen at intersections, often due to blocked sightlines and turning vehicles.

The project aims to connect neighborhoods and calm traffic. DOT Assistant Director Dustin Khuu said the goal is a 'high performing transit priority street.' The plan includes concrete bus boarding islands and may reduce car lanes, giving more space to pedestrians and buses. However, the article notes gaps: 'DOT didn't share a block-by-block breakdown,' and curbside parking may remain, risking bus lane obstruction by double-parked vehicles. The city may physically protect the lane, but details are pending. The B41 bus, serving 28,000 daily trips, crawls at 4 mph during rush hour.
