Forty-six seriously injured. In the last three years, District 33 has seen 6,556 crashes. <strong>Children limp home. Cyclists do not.</strong> A man steps from his car in Greenpoint. An e-bike runs the stop sign. He dies on the spot. The rider stays. No arrest. The street stays the same.</p><p><strong>SUVs, trucks, bikes, buses—each leaves its mark.</strong> Cars and SUVs killed three. Trucks and buses killed two. Bikes killed two. The rest are numbers, but each number is a life cut short. The city counts. The city moves on.</p><p>The toll grows. Eight more crashes. Four more injuries. The numbers climb. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-bills-and-the-slow-grind>Leadership: Votes, Bills, and the Slow Grind</h3><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has voted and sponsored bills. He backed the law that ended jaywalking tickets, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>voting yes to legalize crossing wherever you walk</a>. He called for more slow zones, <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/speed-limit-lowered-dumbo-slow-zone/>praising the new 20 mph limit in DUMBO</a>: “Data has shown that a one mile per hour increase in speed results in a nearly three percent increase in mortality.”</p><p>Restler co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and raise SUV fees. He stood with advocates for speed limiters on repeat offenders. He supports the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane, even as party bosses <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/28/democratic-party-machine-joins-the-bikelash-on-bedford-avenue>try to kill it</a>. But the deaths keep coming. The bills sit in committee. The paint dries. The blood does not.</p><h3 id=the-work-ahead-no-more-waiting>The Work Ahead: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not. The council can pass daylighting, speed limiters, and real bike lane protection. It has not. The dead cannot wait. The living should not have to.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighting at every crosswalk.

Rodriguez said DOT supports the intent but opposes the bills, citing staffing shortages and a need for flexibility. Brooks-Powers expressed disappointment: 'It sounds, unfortunately, like DOT is not supporting any of the bills.' Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized city austerity and shrinking staff. Advocates, including Amy Cohen, said the bills 'don’t go nearly far enough.'

Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint.

Despite City Hall’s claim that 'obscuring and defacing license plates is against the law' and that enforcement is increasing, the streets tell a different story. Unreadable plates let reckless drivers escape detection. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, passengers—face greater risk.

Lives stay safe.</p><p class=mb3>Intro 501, sponsored by Council Member Lincoln Restler, is pending before the City Council. The bill imposes a $175 penalty for parking, stopping, or standing in bike lanes, bus lanes, or in front of hydrants within 1,320 feet of a school. Civilians who report violations receive 25% of collected fines. The measure has 26 co-sponsors, a council majority. Restler introduced the bill to address what he calls a 'public safety risk' from illegal parking: 'These cars illegally obstruct pedestrian space, endanger cyclists, and block accessibility.' He stresses, 'The point of Intro 501 is to effectively deter dangerous parking that block bike lanes, bus lanes and sidewalks—not to generate revenue.' The bill aims to swiftly address the widespread danger posed by cars obstructing vulnerable road users. Debate continues, but the council is expected to vote next year.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill sits before the council, aiming to let civilians report illegal parking in bike lanes, bus lanes, and near hydrants within 1,320 feet of schools. The matter summary reads: 'The point of Intro 501 is to effectively deter dangerous parking that block bike lanes, bus lanes and sidewalks – not to generate revenue.' Restler calls illegal parking and placard abuse a public safety risk, saying, 'These cars illegally obstruct pedestrian space, endanger cyclists, and block accessibility.' The bill proposes a $175 penalty, with 25% paid to the reporting civilian. While some question civilian enforcement, Restler insists the measure targets safety, not profit.

The bill is under City Council review as of December 6, 2022. The matter summary reads: 'A proposed City Council bill would let civilians report cars illegally and unsafely parked in crosswalks and bike lanes and then collect 25 percent of the resulting ticket fees.' Restler is the lead sponsor. In a published opinion, critics argue the bill creates conflict, erodes trust, and places the burden of enforcement on vulnerable road users. The statement warns, 'By devolving responsibility for street safety to cyclists and pedestrians, Restler abdicates the role of government and places the burden—and by extension, the blame—back on the victims.' The piece calls for systemic design changes, not citizen-led enforcement, to protect pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city stalls on bold action.</p><p class=mb3>Intro 501, introduced by Council Member Lincoln Restler (D-Williamsburg), proposes letting civilians report cars illegally parked in crosswalks and bike lanes, collecting 25 percent of ticket fees. The bill draws fire in a December 6, 2022 Streetsblog opinion, which warns, 'turning citizens against one another, even in the name of pedestrian safety, is a terrible mistake.' The writer opposes both citizen and NYPD enforcement, urging proven street design instead. The piece notes, 'Bills like Intro 501 further the trend toward mutual mistrust... by creating a narc economy.' Restler and co-sponsors are criticized for supporting increased NYPD budgets while sidestepping systemic solutions. The bill’s intent is clear: empower vulnerable road users.
