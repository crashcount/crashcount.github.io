Eighteen seriously hurt.</strong> In the last year alone, District 33 has seen 1,731 crashes, 794 injuries, and 18 people left with wounds that will not heal. The dead do not speak. The living carry scars.</p><p>Last week, a 17-year-old boy died after his moped collided with a car. His passenger is fighting for life. Police said the moped &ldquo;slammed into&rdquo; a turning car. There were no arrests. The street was quiet again, except for the sirens (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/teen-boy-dead-man-critically-injured-in-moped-crash-in-brooklyn/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>Days before, another moped rider, Joel Mota, was killed by a drunk, unlicensed driver. His brother said, &ldquo;He was a hardworking man. He had a lot of love for his family&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p><strong>The pattern is old. The pain is fresh.</strong></p><h2 id=who-pays-who-acts>Who Pays, Who Acts</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs killed three. Trucks and buses killed two. Bikes killed two.</strong> The numbers are small until it is your family. In District 33, the most vulnerable—children, cyclists, the old—are the first to fall.</p><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has not stood still. He backed the <a href=https://www.bkreader.com/policy-government/brooklyn-cycling-advocates-sue-to-block-mayor-from-removing-bedford-avenue-bike-lane-10826886>lawsuit that stopped the city from tearing out the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane</a>. He filed an affidavit to keep the lane in place, citing the law that demands notice before safety is stripped away.</p><p>Restler has co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and push for lower speed limits. He has called for more enforcement against illegal parking and reckless driving. But the deaths keep coming.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every delay is a choice. The city has the power to lower speed limits, redesign streets, and end the bloodshed. But power unused is no comfort to the dead.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand action.</strong> Do not wait for another name on the list. The streets will not change themselves. Only people can do that.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The resolution calls on the New York State Legislature and Governor to 'fully fund the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) in the State’s upcoming Fiscal Year 2024 Budget.' Council Member Farah N. Louis sponsored the measure, joined by over thirty co-sponsors. The committee vote was unanimous among present members. The resolution highlights the MTA’s critical role for millions of New Yorkers and warns of a 'looming fiscal cliff' as federal aid dries up. The Council insists that full funding is needed to prevent service cuts and keep transit affordable and frequent.

The bill seeks to repeal an old law that forces the Department of Transportation (DOT) to give extended notice to community boards before installing bike lanes. The current rule requires a 90-day notice and a 45-day wait after a hearing. Intro 417 would cut this to just 14 days. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez told the Council, 'We love Lincoln Restler's bill,' and called the old law 'unnecessarily burdensome.' The bill's summary states it would 'put bike lanes on the same community outreach and installation schedule as other street projects.' Council Member Farah Louis raised concerns about less community input, but DOT officials stressed that the process would still involve boards and electeds—just faster. Bike advocates and DOT say the change is vital to meet safety targets and reduce cyclist injuries, which drop by over 30 percent where bike lanes are built.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Chell insisted he has led 5,000 inspections and issued 39 command disciplines in four months, but Restler dismissed these efforts as inadequate. Restler used the hearing to highlight his bill allowing citizen reporting of parking infractions, bypassing the broken 311 system. He argued, 'A failure of the NYPD to enforce against this issue over many years makes our streets unsafe. So why not empower citizens to do the work that the NYPD has refused to do?'

The bill, named for Sammy Cohen Eckstein, killed by a reckless driver in 2013, has stalled in Albany despite mounting pressure. Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez introduced a resolution urging passage, co-sponsored by Shahana Hanif and Lincoln Restler. Adams, however, said, 'We’re going to let the state do what the state does in response to Sammy’s Law,' and focused on other budget priorities. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, chair of the Transportation Committee, called for pairing lower speed limits with street redesigns in neglected neighborhoods. As children and cyclists die in record numbers, the council’s inaction leaves vulnerable New Yorkers at risk. The law would not lower limits automatically, but grant the city authority to act.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
