Forty-six left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 3,100 hurt since 2022. The dead include a 49-year-old man struck by an e-bike on India Street, a 45-year-old woman crushed as a passenger on Flatbush, and a 46-year-old cyclist killed on Lynch Street. Each number is a name, a family, a hole in the world.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs are the main threat.</strong> Three killed by SUVs or sedans. Two more by trucks. Two by bikes. The violence is steady. It does not care if you are walking, riding, or waiting for a light to change. It comes for the young and the old. It comes for children. It comes for you.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-the-battle-for-bedford-avenue>Leadership: Words, Laws, and the Battle for Bedford Avenue</h3><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has not been silent. He has voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable for crossing the street (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Restler votes yes to legalize jaywalking, improving overall pedestrian safety</a>). He has backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and support 20 MPH slow zones. He stood with advocates when the mayor tried to rip out the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane. &ldquo;For months, the Mayor has repeatedly ignored our recommendations for ensuring the safety of children on Bedford Avenue. And now, instead of identifying solutions that enhance safety for pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers, the Mayor is making a purely political decision to rip out a bike lane with no alternative,&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/adams-dot-remove-bedford-avenue-bike-lane/>Restler said</a>).</p><p>When the city tried to erase the lane, a judge stopped them. The fight is not over. The lane stands, for now. But the threat remains. &ldquo;Tearing out portions of the Bedford Avenue bike lane will only make our streets more dangerous for everyone who uses them, including children,&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/18/breaking-judge-halts-mayor-adamss-plan-to-tear-out-bedford-av-bike-lane>said Baruch Herzfeld</a>).</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>The carnage is not fate.</strong> It is policy. It is choice. Every day without change is another day of blood on the street. <strong>Call your council member. Demand daylighted corners. Demand protected lanes. Demand a 20 MPH speed limit. Demand action.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name to become a number. The street will not wait for you.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The event, organized by Riders Alliance, followed Governor Kathy Hochul’s last-minute decision to halt the Manhattan toll plan. The protest drew bus and subway riders, who chanted for immediate action and held signs demanding clean air and reliable transit. Restler declared, 'Kathy Hochul has betrayed us,' and called for more frequent bus service, better trains, and less dependence on cars and trucks. The demonstrators warned that without congestion pricing, the MTA faces a funding crisis. This threatens repairs and improvements, especially in Black, Brown, and low-income neighborhoods, and risks worsening traffic and delays for emergency services. The protest highlights the systemic danger: when transit funding is gutted, vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, led by Council Member Lincoln Restler, follows internal debate and negotiation, with some members pushing for 1,325 intersections and others preferring fewer. The final number represents a four-fold increase, covering about 4 percent of city intersections. The Council's resolution, described as a 'home rule' message, aims to prevent the program from sunsetting and to improve safety for all road users. Restler stated, 'This will expand it to about 4 percent of intersections, and it will make our city safer.' Assembly Member Jeff Dinowitz called the expansion a victory, while advocates like Sara Lind of Open Plans noted no deaths at camera-protected intersections since 1994. Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers highlighted the need to ensure cameras improve communities and street safety, raising concerns about fairness in enforcement. The Department of Transportation called the Council's action a critical step.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring the department of transportation to consider placement of traffic enforcement agents in developing an interagency roadway safety plan," requires DOT to consider where traffic enforcement agents are stationed when drafting the city’s five-year safety plan. Sponsors include Council Member Justin L. Brannan (primary), Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, Farah N. Louis, Lincoln Restler, and the Queens Borough President (by request). The bill responds to Local Law 12 of 2011, which already mandates a safety plan, but this measure sharpens the focus: DOT must show where agents will be placed to protect the most dangerous corridors. The bill awaits further action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Karczag faces charges for failure to yield, running a red light, and not exercising due care. The intersection, plagued by 42 injury crashes since 2019, sits near schools and playgrounds. Council Member Lincoln Restler, representing the area, offered condolences: "My heart breaks for her family and loved ones." Local activist Brent Bovenzi called for urgent action, saying, "We must have greater safety for our most vulnerable New Yorkers. The city already has the tools to make our intersections safer, we just need the political will to do it." Advocates demand reinstated crossing guards and daylighting. Mayor Adams pledged to daylight 1,000 intersections in 2024, but critics say the pace is glacial. The city’s inaction keeps children at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Street safety advocates, including Kathy Park Price of Transportation Alternatives, demanded a full corridor redesign to protect pedestrians, cyclists, and bus riders.
