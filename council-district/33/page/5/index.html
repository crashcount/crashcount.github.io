Restler stated, 'this is a decision that enhances safety in our community, and that's what matters.'

Restler, the bill's sponsor, argues, 'Bike share is an essential part of transit in NYC. It needs to be affordable & accessible for all.' He criticizes the current model, where e-bike rides can cost up to $7.20 for a half-hour, far above the $2.90 subway fare.

Assembly Member Emily Gallagher called the compromise 'a plan that does nothing to address the central safety concerns of our community.'

Nydia Velázquez, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, Comptroller Brad Lander, and Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso—called for a more thorough redesign, arguing the current plan preserves dangerous elements. DOT spokesperson Vincent Barone claimed the redesign will make the corridor safer for all users, with new bike lanes and sidewalk extensions.

The new plan converts the outer lane to parking overnight, a design that has led to illegal parking and safety hazards for cyclists. Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized the plan, saying, 'this plan fails to dramatically slow down traffic on this dangerous boulevard.' The advocacy group Make McGuinness Safe accused the mayor of breaking his promise to prioritize safety. The compromise removes some parking, which local businesses oppose. Despite DOT claims, the redesign does not slow traffic or protect vulnerable road users as promised.

The closure united two halves of the park, creating 1.5 acres of new open space. Organizers and residents, including Katie Denny Horowitz of the North Brooklyn Parks Alliance, called for a permanent ban on cars. Since 2020, city data shows 42 crashes on this stretch, injuring six cyclists and one pedestrian. The move echoes past car bans in Central and Prospect Parks, but faces resistance from city officials.

Restler, who has long pushed for these changes, praised the progress: 'Atlantic Avenue has been extremely dangerous my whole life.

The matter centers on repeated illegal parking by NYPD and municipal workers, which blocks safety measures and shrinks space for pedestrians. Restler stated, "It has been really frustrating that our city agencies that should be partners in this effort have undermined it." Kelly Carroll, Executive Director of the Atlantic Avenue BID, added, "We can't even set up a table if the cars are parked there. It renders the open street moot."
