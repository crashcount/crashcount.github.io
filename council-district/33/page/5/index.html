Twenty seriously hurt.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, there have been 1,722 crashes, leaving 777 injured. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. A 45-year-old passenger crushed in a car on Flatbush. A 49-year-old man killed by an e-bike on Franklin. A 74-year-old thrown from his bike on Tillary. The street does not forgive.</p><h3 id=the-faces-behind-the-numbers>The Faces Behind the Numbers</h3><p>The horror is not abstract. &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/brooklyn-90-year-old-man-hit-run-rider/>said an eyewitness</a> after a moped struck a 90-year-old man in Brooklyn. The driver wore a mask. He hit the man and left. The city keeps searching for footage, for justice, for a reason. But the street stays silent.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most harm</strong>—three killed, 269 left with wounds. Trucks and buses killed two, bikes killed two more. Mopeds and motorcycles left dozens more battered. The old, the young, the ones on foot—they pay the price. <strong>Every crash is preventable. Every death is a failure.</strong></p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—and What Hasn’t</h3><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has backed laws to clear sightlines at intersections, redesign truck routes, and legalize crossing the street outside the lines—measures that chip away at the old order. He voted yes to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>redesign truck routes</a>, to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, and to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>. But the bodies keep coming. The pace is slow. The street is faster.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Restler. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people, not just promises. <strong>Every day of delay is another family broken.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Steel and flesh meet, the city absorbs the pain.</p><p class=mb3>A head-on collision between a motorcycle and an SUV unfolded near 181 York Street in Brooklyn at 6:55 p.m., according to the police report. The report states both vehicles were traveling east when they collided. The motorcycle rider, a 40-year-old man, remained conscious but suffered a crushed lower leg. His helmet stayed on. The SUV’s front left quarter panel was severely damaged. Police cite 'Reaction to Uninvolved Vehicle' as the contributing factor, highlighting a systemic hazard where sudden, unpredictable roadway events can trigger violent impacts. No driver errors beyond this are listed in the report. The focus remains on the chain reaction that left a vulnerable rider injured, underscoring the persistent danger for those outside steel cages on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring the department of transportation to consider placement of traffic enforcement agents in developing an interagency roadway safety plan," requires DOT to consider where traffic enforcement agents are stationed when drafting the city’s five-year safety plan. Sponsors include Council Member Justin L. Brannan (primary), Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, Farah N. Louis, Lincoln Restler, and the Queens Borough President (by request). The bill responds to Local Law 12 of 2011, which already mandates a safety plan, but this measure sharpens the focus: DOT must show where agents will be placed to protect the most dangerous corridors.

Introduced February 28, 2024, it calls for an advisory board on school crossing guard deployment. The board would include the NYPD, Department of Transportation, and Department of Education. According to the bill summary: 'Such advisory board would be responsible for submitting biannual reports, relating to recommended deployment of school crossing guards, to the Mayor, the City Council Speaker and the Police Commissioner.' Council Member Kamillah Hanks leads as primary sponsor, joined by Stevens, Schulman, Salaam, Won, Cabán, Riley, Farías, Restler, Williams, Narcisse, Banks, Louis, Brooks-Powers, Marmorato, and the Bronx Borough President. The bill demands city agencies work together, but it does not guarantee more guards or safer crossings. The danger for children at city intersections remains.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Introduced February 28, 2024, it amends city law to require the Department of Transportation to expand Open Streets hours on holidays with heavy foot traffic.

Council Member Shekar Krishnan leads as primary sponsor, joined by Rivera, Brooks-Powers, Louis, Nurse, Ossé, Sanchez, Cabán, Banks, Avilés, Riley, Salaam, Hanif, Feliz, Won, Restler, and Joseph.
