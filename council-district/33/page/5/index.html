Forty-six seriously hurt.</strong> In the last three and a half years, District 33 has seen 6,601 crashes. The bodies pile up: 3,104 injured, many for life. The dead include a 49-year-old man struck by an e-bike on India Street, a 74-year-old cyclist crushed by a bus on Tillary, and a 46-year-old cyclist killed by an SUV on Lynch Street. These numbers are not just statistics. They are parents, children, neighbors. The street does not care who you are.</p><h2 id=the-politics-of-protection>The Politics of Protection</h2><p><strong>Leadership matters.</strong> Council Member Lincoln Restler has not been silent. He voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the vulnerable for crossing the street. He co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>require protected bike lanes</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>push for speed limiters</a> on dangerous vehicles. When Mayor Adams tried to rip out the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane, Restler called it &ldquo;a purely political decision to rip out a bike lane with no alternative&rdquo; and warned, &ldquo;He is going to make this area less safe for pedestrians, for cyclists&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/bedford-avenue-protected-bike-lane-removal/>CBS New York</a>).</p><p>Restler stood with advocates and parents in court, backing a lawsuit that stopped the city from removing the lane—at least for now (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/breaking-activists-sue-city-to-prevent-erasure-of-bedford-avenue-bike-lane>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><h2 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h2><p><strong>Every delay is a death sentence for someone.</strong> The city’s own numbers show that SUVs and cars are the main killers, but every mode—bikes, trucks, buses—has left blood on the street. The law says streets are for people. The reality says otherwise. The fight is not over. The judge’s order is only temporary. The paint fades. The barriers come down. The danger returns.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>Call Restler. Call the Mayor. Demand more.</strong> Demand real protection for the most vulnerable. Demand daylighted corners, protected bike lanes, lower speed limits, and enforcement that targets the reckless, not the walking. <strong>Don’t wait for another name to become a number.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The measure, led by Council Member Lincoln Restler, follows internal debate and negotiation, with some members pushing for 1,325 intersections and others preferring fewer. The final number represents a four-fold increase, covering about 4 percent of city intersections. The Council's resolution, described as a 'home rule' message, aims to prevent the program from sunsetting and to improve safety for all road users. Restler stated, 'This will expand it to about 4 percent of intersections, and it will make our city safer.' Assembly Member Jeff Dinowitz called the expansion a victory, while advocates like Sara Lind of Open Plans noted no deaths at camera-protected intersections since 1994. Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers highlighted the need to ensure cameras improve communities and street safety, raising concerns about fairness in enforcement. The Department of Transportation called the Council's action a critical step.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Karczag faces charges for failure to yield, running a red light, and not exercising due care. The intersection, plagued by 42 injury crashes since 2019, sits near schools and playgrounds. Council Member Lincoln Restler, representing the area, offered condolences: "My heart breaks for her family and loved ones." Local activist Brent Bovenzi called for urgent action, saying, "We must have greater safety for our most vulnerable New Yorkers. The city already has the tools to make our intersections safer, we just need the political will to do it." Advocates demand reinstated crossing guards and daylighting. Mayor Adams pledged to daylight 1,000 intersections in 2024, but critics say the pace is glacial. The city’s inaction keeps children at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Lincoln Restler attended, supporting a redesign and urging the city to study broader changes, but stopped short of endorsing lane reductions. Street safety advocates, including Kathy Park Price of Transportation Alternatives, demanded a full corridor redesign to protect pedestrians, cyclists, and bus riders. The Department of Transportation acknowledged the board’s input and pointed to ongoing safety projects.
