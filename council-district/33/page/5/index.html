The report states she was 'crossing with the light' when a speeding e-bike struck her, causing 'severe lacerations' to her entire body. She remained conscious after the impact. The e-bike operator, described as unlicensed, did not stop at the scene. The police report lists 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' as contributing factors. The e-bike showed no visible damage.

The narrative states the man was 'crushed and killed beneath steel and rubber,' and that 'a box truck, a pickup, and two others passed through.' The police report lists the contributing factor as 'Unspecified' for the drivers involved. No driver errors are explicitly cited in the report, but the involvement of multiple large vehicles and the presence of a worker in the roadway underscore the systemic dangers faced by those laboring in active traffic lanes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
