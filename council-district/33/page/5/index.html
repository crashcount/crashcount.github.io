Eighteen left with wounds that will not heal. In the last twelve months, District 33 saw <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>1,745 crashes</a>. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>Four children were seriously hurt</a>. A cyclist was killed on Lynch Street. A pedestrian bled out on India Street. These are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors. The street does not care if you are young or old. It takes what it wants.</p><p>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage. In three years, they killed five. Bikes killed two. Trucks and buses killed two more. The rest were left broken, sometimes for life. The pain is not spread evenly. The old, the young, the ones on foot or bike—they pay the highest price.</p><h3 id=the-politics-of-safety>The Politics of Safety</h3><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has not been silent. He voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths. He co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>speed up protected bike lanes</a>. He stood with families when the mayor tried to <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/breaking-activists-sue-city-to-prevent-erasure-of-bedford-avenue-bike-lane>rip out the Bedford Avenue bike lane</a>. “For months, the Mayor has repeatedly ignored our recommendations for ensuring the safety of children on Bedford Avenue,” <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/adams-dot-remove-bedford-avenue-bike-lane/>Restler said</a>. “Instead of identifying solutions that enhance safety for pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers, the Mayor is making a purely political decision to rip out a bike lane with no alternative.”</p><p>When the city tried to erase the lane, a judge <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/court-stops-bedford-avenue-bike-lane-removal/>stopped them</a>. Restler filed an affidavit to keep the protection in place. The fight is not over. The city will try again. The street will claim more lives if nothing changes.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>The disaster is not fate. Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. The council can pass more laws. The mayor can build more barriers. The police can enforce the rules. But none of it matters if the public stays quiet. Contact your council member. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand protected bike lanes that cannot be erased by a backroom deal. Demand that every child can cross the street and come home.</p><p>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The street is hungry. It will not stop on its own.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Governor Hochul paused congestion pricing, stalling a major funding plan. Lawmakers passed Sammy’s Law, letting New York City lower speed limits, but exempted some roads. The city can now expand red light cameras from 150 to 600 intersections. Other measures, like parking enforcement cameras on sweepers and the Idaho Stop for cyclists, passed only one chamber. Speed governors for reckless drivers and daylighting did not advance. Advocates like Eric McClure called Sammy’s Law a 'huge victory,' but noted, 'there’s so much more the legislature could be doing.' Council Member Lincoln Restler called the failure to pass sweeper camera enforcement 'super disappointing.' The congestion pricing drama overshadowed progress.

The protest drew bus and subway riders, who chanted for immediate action and held signs demanding clean air and reliable transit. Restler declared, 'Kathy Hochul has betrayed us,' and called for more frequent bus service, better trains, and less dependence on cars and trucks.

The measure, led by Council Member Lincoln Restler, follows internal debate and negotiation, with some members pushing for 1,325 intersections and others preferring fewer. The final number represents a four-fold increase, covering about 4 percent of city intersections. The Council's resolution, described as a 'home rule' message, aims to prevent the program from sunsetting and to improve safety for all road users. Restler stated, 'This will expand it to about 4 percent of intersections, and it will make our city safer.' Assembly Member Jeff Dinowitz called the expansion a victory, while advocates like Sara Lind of Open Plans noted no deaths at camera-protected intersections since 1994. Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers highlighted the need to ensure cameras improve communities and street safety, raising concerns about fairness in enforcement. The Department of Transportation called the Council's action a critical step.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The narrative states, 'The front struck her. She fell, crushed and silent. Her whole body broken. The bus showed no damage. The street held her small, still form.' The report lists the pedestrian's action as 'Crossing, No Signal, or Crosswalk' and her location as 'Not at Intersection.' Both contributing factors for the driver and the pedestrian are marked as 'Unspecified.' The bus was going straight ahead at the time of the crash, and the point of impact was the center front end. The baby girl suffered crush injuries to her entire body and was found unconscious. The report does not cite any specific driver errors or additional contributing factors, but the collision underscores the lethal risk posed by large vehicles to vulnerable pedestrians, especially children.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The measure, discussed in committee, requires a Council vote for citywide changes and a six-month warning period for drivers. Kamillah Hanks (District 49) was mentioned in the debate. Assemblymember Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas stressed urgency, citing recent deaths. Brooklyn Councilmember Lincoln Restler pledged to push the measure forward. Advocates like Transportation Alternatives called for a citywide approach, not piecemeal action. The Department of Transportation thanked lawmakers but did not commit to a timeline. The debate highlights the tension between urgent safety needs and political delays.

It would allow New York City to mount enforcement cameras on street sweepers to ticket cars parked illegally during street cleaning hours. The bill summary states it 'fulfills the Sanitation Department's longstanding ask for help getting vehicles out of the way of road-cleaning operations.' Cunningham, who sponsors the bill, said, 'Dirty streets are totally unacceptable.' Sanitation Commissioner Jessica Tisch supports the change, noting that state law must allow automated ticketing. Uptown Manhattan State Senator Robert Jackson introduced a similar Senate bill. The law would phase in after a year and expire by mid-2029, giving officials time to assess its impact.
