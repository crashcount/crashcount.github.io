The driver did not stop. Police found the body at 3:45 a.m. and said only, &ldquo;A driver struck and killed a 47-year-old pedestrian&mldr; then left the scene&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/cops-looking-for-driver-who-fatally-struck-man-on-brooklyn-street/>NY Daily News</a>). The victim died before help could arrive. The driver is still out there.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>eight people have died</strong> in District 33. <strong>Twenty-five more suffered serious injuries.</strong> Nearly a thousand were hurt. The numbers do not slow. They pile up. Each one is a name, a family, a life cut short.</p><h3 id=the-slow-grind-of-change>The Slow Grind of Change</h3><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has taken some steps. He voted to require taxis to warn passengers about opening doors into cyclists (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Legistar legislation</a>). He backed a bill to clear abandoned cars from the street within 72 hours, to keep sightlines open for people on foot and bike. He co-sponsored a law to post safety rules at bike share stations. These are small moves. The street stays the same.</p><p>Restler has also called out the NYPD for racial bias in traffic enforcement, calling the disparity &ldquo;extreme&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/29/council-pols-fume-as-nypd-disputes-report-of-racial-bias-in-traffic-enforcement>Streetsblog NYC</a>). He pushed to remove illegal placard parking that blocks sidewalks and bike lanes (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/24/police-finally-remove-cars-from-plaza-in-downtown-brooklyn>police finally remove cars</a>). He wants parks for people, not for parking (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/02/28/parking-or-parkland-brooklyn-judges-could-lose-their-perk>parking or parkland</a>).</p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The city moves slow. The street does not forgive.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>Every day, another crash. Every week, another family broken.</strong></p><p>Call Council Member Restler. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes and crosswalks that cannot be blocked. Demand action, not words. Do not wait for another body in the road.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The driver who killed Maxwell fled and remains unidentified. The NYPD Highway District collision investigation squad is investigating. No arrests have been made.

Council Members Yusef Salaam, Tiffany Caban, and Lincoln Restler pressed NYPD Director Joshua Levin about stark racial disparities. The matter: 'Council members criticized NYPD leadership over racial disparities in traffic enforcement after the department refused to acknowledge evidence of bias.' Restler called the disparity 'extreme.' Caban said, 'Black and brown people are being beaten up, searched, arrested, 10 times more than white people.' The NYPD claimed disparities stem from policing high-crime areas. Lawmakers rejected this, citing data showing Black and Latinx drivers are disproportionately stopped, searched, and arrested. The hearing referenced the city’s long record of racially biased enforcement, including jaywalking laws once used to target Black and Latinx New Yorkers. Experts, including the NYCLU, say the Adams administration’s surge in traffic stops continues a pattern of racist policing.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
