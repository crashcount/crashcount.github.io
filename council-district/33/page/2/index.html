Since 2022, <strong>16 people have died</strong> and <strong>48 have been seriously injured</strong> in crashes here. <strong>Over 3,100 have been hurt</strong>. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care if you are young or old, walking or riding. In the last year alone, five more lives were lost.</p><p>Last spring, a 49-year-old man was killed by a bike on India Street. In February, a woman was crushed in the back seat of an SUV on Flatbush Avenue. The dead do not get second chances. The living are left to count the cost.</p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>The horror is not abstract. It is a son searching for his father in the street. “I see him on the floor,” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/06/hit-and-run-driver-kills-brooklyn-restaurant-worker-in-front-of-son/>said Henry Tziquin</a>. “His eyes were closed.

His head was wide open,” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/brooklyn-90-year-old-man-hit-run-rider/>an eyewitness told the Daily News</a>. The driver did not stop.

He voted yes to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable instead of the reckless. But the crisis does not wait for committee meetings. <strong>Bills can sit. Streets do not.</strong></p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>The blood on the street is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every day without change is another day someone does not come home. Call Council Member Restler. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes, daylighted corners, and real consequences for drivers who kill and flee. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list. Act now.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Officers, following new NYPD pursuit rules, did not chase but instead set a roadblock.

The driver, Jumaane Wright, swerved toward officers, nearly striking a lieutenant, who fired a single shot. Wright crashed a mile later and died at the hospital.

Council Members Yusef Salaam, Tiffany Caban, and Lincoln Restler pressed NYPD Director Joshua Levin about stark racial disparities. The matter: 'Council members criticized NYPD leadership over racial disparities in traffic enforcement after the department refused to acknowledge evidence of bias.' Restler called the disparity 'extreme.' Caban said, 'Black and brown people are being beaten up, searched, arrested, 10 times more than white people.' The NYPD claimed disparities stem from policing high-crime areas. Lawmakers rejected this, citing data showing Black and Latinx drivers are disproportionately stopped, searched, and arrested. The hearing referenced the city’s long record of racially biased enforcement, including jaywalking laws once used to target Black and Latinx New Yorkers. Experts, including the NYCLU, say the Adams administration’s surge in traffic stops continues a pattern of racist policing.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The van’s driver continued straight ahead, while a 19-year-old cyclist rode east. The report states, 'A van rolled south. A bike came east. Metal struck flesh.' The cyclist collided headfirst with the van’s rear quarter panel, suffering severe head lacerations and partial ejection, and was found semiconscious with blood on the street. The van’s driver was uninjured. The only contributing factor cited in the report is 'Traffic Control Disregarded,' highlighting the van driver’s failure to obey traffic signals or signs. No contributing factors are attributed to the cyclist. The crash underscores the danger posed when drivers ignore traffic controls, leaving vulnerable road users exposed to grave harm.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

She struck a for-hire car, then hit Natasha Saada and her three children, killing the mother and two daughters. The surviving son remains in a coma. Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez called it 'among the worst collisions he has seen in his 25 years.' The article notes that advocates are pushing for laws requiring speed-limiters on cars of repeat speeders.

No students were on the bus at the time. The victims were hospitalized with serious injuries.

The driver had a suspended license and 'dozens of speed and red light violations,' according to State Sen. Andrew Gounardes. The bill would require speed-limiting devices for drivers with repeated offenses, targeting those with 11 or more points in 24 months or six camera tickets in a year. Advocates and officials, including Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, gathered at Borough Hall to demand action. The article notes that auto deaths have outpaced gun deaths in New York City for two years. The bill mirrors laws for drunk driving and follows stalled efforts like the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Act.

Advocates point to the lack of speed-limiting devices on vehicles with repeated violations, a measure pending in Albany.
