Forty-eight suffered serious injuries. Over 3,100 have been hurt since 2022.</strong> The bodies are not numbers. They are neighbors. A cyclist, age 46, killed on Lynch Street. A 45-year-old woman, crushed in the back seat on Flatbush Avenue. A 49-year-old man, struck down by a bike on India Street. Each loss leaves a hole that does not close.</p><p>Last year alone, the district saw <strong>four deaths and eleven serious injuries</strong>. The violence does not slow. It does not spare the young. It does not spare the old. It does not care if you are walking, riding, or waiting for the light to change.</p><h3 id=the-scene-streets-built-for-speed-not-safety>The Scene: Streets Built for Speed, Not Safety</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> They killed three people and injured 378. Trucks and buses killed two more. Bikes, too, have taken lives—two deaths, one serious injury. The street is a battlefield, and the most vulnerable pay the price.</p><p>The press tells the same story, again and again.

He voted yes to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>redesign truck routes</a>, aiming to &ldquo;improve safety, increase visibility, reduce traffic congestion, and reduce vehicle miles traveled.&rdquo; He also voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the vulnerable and let drivers off the hook.</p><p>But the bodies keep coming. <strong>Every delay, every watered-down law, means another family waits for news that will break them.</strong></p><h3 id=the-next-step-demand-more>The Next Step: Demand More</h3><p><strong>Call Council Member Restler. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand that every bill puts people first, not cars.</strong></p><p>The street will not change itself.
