Forty-eight suffered serious injuries. Over 3,100 have been hurt since 2022.</strong> The bodies are not numbers. They are neighbors. A cyclist, age 46, killed on Lynch Street. A 45-year-old woman, crushed in the back seat on Flatbush Avenue. A 49-year-old man, struck down by a bike on India Street. Each loss leaves a hole that does not close.</p><p>Last year alone, the district saw <strong>four deaths and eleven serious injuries</strong>. The violence does not slow. It does not spare the young. It does not spare the old. It does not care if you are walking, riding, or waiting for the light to change.</p><h3 id=the-scene-streets-built-for-speed-not-safety>The Scene: Streets Built for Speed, Not Safety</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> They killed three people and injured 378. Trucks and buses killed two more. Bikes, too, have taken lives—two deaths, one serious injury. The street is a battlefield, and the most vulnerable pay the price.</p><p>The press tells the same story, again and again. A <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/04/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-man-36-in-brooklyn-crash/>36-year-old man crossing near Broadway Junction</a> is struck by a gray Ford.

He voted yes to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>redesign truck routes</a>, aiming to &ldquo;improve safety, increase visibility, reduce traffic congestion, and reduce vehicle miles traveled.&rdquo; He also voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the vulnerable and let drivers off the hook.</p><p>But the bodies keep coming. <strong>Every delay, every watered-down law, means another family waits for news that will break them.</strong></p><h3 id=the-next-step-demand-more>The Next Step: Demand More</h3><p><strong>Call Council Member Restler. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand that every bill puts people first, not cars.</strong></p><p>The street will not change itself. The dead cannot speak.

When the driver "veered toward one of the officers and nearly hit him," an officer fired, striking the driver. The car continued another mile before crashing again. The driver died at Brookdale Hospital. The incident was captured on police body cameras. Officers were treated at local hospitals but not injured.

Council Members Yusef Salaam, Tiffany Caban, and Lincoln Restler pressed NYPD Director Joshua Levin about stark racial disparities. The matter: 'Council members criticized NYPD leadership over racial disparities in traffic enforcement after the department refused to acknowledge evidence of bias.' Restler called the disparity 'extreme.' Caban said, 'Black and brown people are being beaten up, searched, arrested, 10 times more than white people.' The NYPD claimed disparities stem from policing high-crime areas. Lawmakers rejected this, citing data showing Black and Latinx drivers are disproportionately stopped, searched, and arrested. The hearing referenced the city’s long record of racially biased enforcement, including jaywalking laws once used to target Black and Latinx New Yorkers. Experts, including the NYCLU, say the Adams administration’s surge in traffic stops continues a pattern of racist policing.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
