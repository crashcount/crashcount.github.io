Pedestrians took 556 injuries and eight deaths. Cyclists took 554 injuries and one death. Trucks and buses are a smaller share, but they killed three pedestrians.

Broadway too. The pain clusters. It doesn’t wander.</p><p>The worst hours pile up after dark. Death peaks at 1 a.m., 6 a.m., the school commute, and again in the evening — with three deaths at 7 p.m. and more at 10, 11, and midnight. The count rises when the light fades. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The city’s hourly ledger shows it</a>.</p><h3 id=whats-killing-people-here>What’s killing people here</h3><p>“Other” tops the listed causes for deaths and harm.

He supports a pilot to ticket illegal parking by camera — owners pay when cars block crosswalks and bike lanes. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>His resolution urges Albany to act</a>.</p><p>On one Downtown Brooklyn plaza, police finally cleared years of illegal placard parking after complaints. They wrote 40 tickets, towed 10 cars. “Following community complaints… the NYPD Transportation Bureau and Council Member Lincoln Restler coordinated… to address the parking condition and clear the area,” the department said, as <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/24/police-finally-remove-cars-from-plaza-in-downtown-brooklyn>reported by Streetsblog</a>.

The action, coordinated with Council Member Lincoln Restler, followed community complaints. Officers issued 40 summonses and towed 10 vehicles. The NYPD stated, "Following community complaints about illegal parking... the NYPD Transportation Bureau and Council Member Lincoln Restler coordinated... to address the parking condition and clear the area." Council Members Restler and Crystal Hudson represent the district but did not claim credit. The crackdown targets city employees who abused parking privileges for years. Safety analysts note: "Cracking down on placard abuse reduces illegal parking, especially in bike lanes, crosswalks, and sidewalks, improving safety and accessibility for pedestrians and cyclists by reclaiming public space and reducing driver entitlement."</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Prosecutors say Pigford rear-ended Cifuni, then stopped two blocks away. When Cifuni approached, Pigford 'refused to roll down her window or speak,' then accelerated, striking and dragging Cifuni. The article quotes Assistant District Attorney Tara Kelly: 'The defendant floored the gas, instantly striking Tiffany, causing her body to become lodged beneath the vehicle.' Pigford then made an illegal turn and fled. The case highlights the lethal risk of hit-and-run driving and the dangers posed by unlicensed, reckless drivers operating stolen vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city planned to restore the old painted lane, citing complaints about fast bikes and e-bikes. But advocates and residents sued, arguing the old design was unsafe and that 'safety of all road users has improved since the upgraded design was installed.' The judge's order prevents immediate removal, pending an August hearing. Transportation Alternatives called the ruling a win for street safety, saying, 'We won't let anyone make our streets more dangerous.'

The plan uses 'hardened daylighting'—physical barriers, granite blocks, and planters—to stop vehicles from parking near corners. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' Nearly half of city traffic deaths happen at intersections. The new design will first appear at high-crash sites in Brooklyn, including Ocean Avenue at Church Avenue and several others. The move highlights a systemic effort to address visibility failures and reduce deadly conflicts at crossings.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
