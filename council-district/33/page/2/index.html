Eighteen left with wounds that will not heal. In the last twelve months, District 33 saw <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>1,745 crashes</a>. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>Four children were seriously hurt</a>. A cyclist was killed on Lynch Street. A pedestrian bled out on India Street. These are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors. The street does not care if you are young or old. It takes what it wants.</p><p>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage. In three years, they killed five. Bikes killed two. Trucks and buses killed two more. The rest were left broken, sometimes for life. The pain is not spread evenly. The old, the young, the ones on foot or bike—they pay the highest price.</p><h3 id=the-politics-of-safety>The Politics of Safety</h3><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has not been silent. He voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths. He co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>speed up protected bike lanes</a>. He stood with families when the mayor tried to <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/breaking-activists-sue-city-to-prevent-erasure-of-bedford-avenue-bike-lane>rip out the Bedford Avenue bike lane</a>. “For months, the Mayor has repeatedly ignored our recommendations for ensuring the safety of children on Bedford Avenue,” <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/adams-dot-remove-bedford-avenue-bike-lane/>Restler said</a>. “Instead of identifying solutions that enhance safety for pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers, the Mayor is making a purely political decision to rip out a bike lane with no alternative.”</p><p>When the city tried to erase the lane, a judge <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/court-stops-bedford-avenue-bike-lane-removal/>stopped them</a>. Restler filed an affidavit to keep the protection in place. The fight is not over. The city will try again. The street will claim more lives if nothing changes.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>The disaster is not fate. Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. The council can pass more laws. The mayor can build more barriers. The police can enforce the rules. But none of it matters if the public stays quiet. Contact your council member. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand protected bike lanes that cannot be erased by a backroom deal. Demand that every child can cross the street and come home.</p><p>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The street is hungry. It will not stop on its own.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The letter called the block a 'missing link in Brooklyn’s protected bike lane network.' Brooklyn Community Board 2 backed the demand. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and Borough Commissioner Keith Bray offered only vague replies. The block’s exclusion traces to a mayoral advisor’s intervention for developer Two Trees. Advocates like Kathy Park Price slammed the city: 'Private interests are able to redesign our streets, prioritizing vehicles over safety at a critical corridor.' Despite unanimous support, DOT keeps the street dangerous.

These devices cap speed at 5 mph over the limit for those with 11 or more license points in 24 months or six camera tickets in a year. The rally followed a fatal Gravesend crash that killed a mother and her two daughters. Hanif and other lawmakers called current enforcement—ticketing, suspensions, fines, jail—ineffective.

Buses now run faster. Riders gain time. Manhattan crossings see big speed jumps. MTA tweaks schedules. Council hears calls for more service. Streets grow safer for those outside cars. The city moves.</p><p class=mb3>On March 20, 2025, the City Council held a hearing on congestion pricing’s effects, as reported by Streetsblog NYC. The session reviewed how the new toll for driving below 60th Street cut traffic and boosted bus speeds. MTA Transit President Demetrius Crichlow told council members, “Every single crossing that gets into Manhattan has seen an improvement, some lines as much as seven to 10 minutes improved speeds.” Council Member Lincoln Restler (D-Brooklyn) said, “It sounds like there may be opportunities for us to increase service as the result of more efficient travel times.” The MTA is piloting schedule changes on seven bus lines. Riders Alliance’s Danny Pearlstein called the changes “exactly what it was supposed to do.” Bus riders, pedestrians, and the city’s economy all benefit. No evidence shows traffic shifting to other boroughs.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On March 19, 2025, Council Member Lincoln Restler announced the lowering of Dumbo’s speed limit to 20 mph, making it Brooklyn’s first Regional Slow Zone. The measure follows the passage of Sammy’s Law, which lets the city set its own speed limits. The Department of Transportation cited ten severe injuries and one death in Dumbo over five years. The new zone covers streets packed with pedestrians, from Furman to Navy and Hudson, and John to Sands and the BQE. Restler said, 'Data has shown that a one mile per hour increase in speed results in a nearly three percent increase in mortality.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez added, 'Lowering vehicle speed limits by even a few miles per hour could be the difference between life or death in a traffic crash.' The change will take effect after a public comment period. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso called for more slow zones in high-crash neighborhoods. The city plans to expand 20 mph limits to over 250 locations by the end of 2025.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The BMW driver was cited for 'Following Too Closely,' a critical driver error that led directly to the collision. Both vehicles were traveling straight ahead at the time of impact. The Tesla's center back end was crushed, causing injuries to multiple occupants. A 22-year-old male passenger in the rear seat suffered facial lacerations and remained conscious; he was wearing a lap belt and harness. Other occupants, including the Tesla driver and rear passengers, sustained whiplash and concussion injuries. No contributing factors were attributed to the victims.

The measure, supported by 40 groups and nearly all local elected officials, marks the first neighborhood-wide slow zone request since the passage of Sammy's Law. The board's action follows letters from Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez, and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velazquez to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. They cited CB1's high fatality rate—3.27 deaths per 10,000 residents, above the city average. The board's vote was contentious, with pro-driving members opposing the change. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno acknowledged the support and promised more information on slow zones for outer boroughs. Council Member Lincoln Restler later joined the call for lower speeds. The measure now awaits DOT action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Rodriguez called the technology a 'national model.' Lawmakers want to expand the system to other sites, including the Washington Bridge.
