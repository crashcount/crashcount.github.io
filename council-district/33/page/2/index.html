Forty-six suffered wounds so grave they may never walk the same again. The dead include a 17-year-old boy thrown from a moped, a cyclist crushed on Lynch Street, and a woman crossing Flatbush who never made it to the other side. The city calls them accidents. The families know better.</p><h2 id=the-faces-left-behind>The Faces Left Behind</h2><p>A brother remembers a man who &ldquo;never stopped working&rdquo; and &ldquo;was always passionate about the things that he did&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>said Francisco Mota</a>. A father buries his son. A child’s route to school is marked by blood on the crosswalk. <strong>Most deaths come at the hands of cars and SUVs.</strong> But bikes, mopeds, and trucks all take their share. The street does not care who you are.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h2><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has stood with the living. He backed the <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>SAFE Streets Act</a>, pushed for <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>protected bike lanes</a>, and fought to keep the Bedford Avenue lane from being ripped out by City Hall. When the city tried to erase that protection, Restler did not mince words: &ldquo;For months, the Mayor has repeatedly ignored our recommendations for ensuring the safety of children on Bedford Avenue&rdquo; <a href=https://www.bkreader.com/policy-government/brooklyn-cycling-advocates-sue-to-block-mayor-from-removing-bedford-avenue-bike-lane-10826886>Restler, via BKReader</a>. He filed suit to stop the rollback. He co-sponsored bills to daylight crosswalks, slow cars, and install speed limiters. But the blood keeps coming. <strong>Every delay, every watered-down law, every shortcut leaves another family in mourning.</strong></p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These deaths are not the weather. They are the result of choices. Choices made by people in power. Choices that can be changed.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected lanes that cannot be erased by a tweet. Demand that every repeat reckless driver is stopped before they kill again.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list. The street will not wait. Neither should you.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Council Members Yusef Salaam, Tiffany Caban, and Lincoln Restler pressed NYPD Director Joshua Levin about stark racial disparities. The matter: 'Council members criticized NYPD leadership over racial disparities in traffic enforcement after the department refused to acknowledge evidence of bias.' Restler called the disparity 'extreme.' Caban said, 'Black and brown people are being beaten up, searched, arrested, 10 times more than white people.' The NYPD claimed disparities stem from policing high-crime areas. Lawmakers rejected this, citing data showing Black and Latinx drivers are disproportionately stopped, searched, and arrested. The hearing referenced the city’s long record of racially biased enforcement, including jaywalking laws once used to target Black and Latinx New Yorkers. Experts, including the NYCLU, say the Adams administration’s surge in traffic stops continues a pattern of racist policing.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Both teens were partially ejected and suffered severe lacerations to the head and chest, with shock noted in each case. The report states the sedan's driver was unlicensed and had 'looked away,' citing 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as contributing factors. The impact occurred at the center front end of the sedan and the right side doors of the bike. No safety equipment was used by the victims, but the report does not list this as a contributing factor. The collision underscores the lethal consequences of driver inattention and ignoring traffic controls, especially when an unlicensed driver is behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The letter called the block a 'missing link in Brooklyn’s protected bike lane network.' Brooklyn Community Board 2 backed the demand. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and Borough Commissioner Keith Bray offered only vague replies. The block’s exclusion traces to a mayoral advisor’s intervention for developer Two Trees. Advocates like Kathy Park Price slammed the city: 'Private interests are able to redesign our streets, prioritizing vehicles over safety at a critical corridor.' Despite unanimous support, DOT keeps the street dangerous.

These devices cap speed at 5 mph over the limit for those with 11 or more license points in 24 months or six camera tickets in a year.
