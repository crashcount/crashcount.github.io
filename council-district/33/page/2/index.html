Fifty-two were left with wounds so deep they are called serious injuries. These are not just numbers. They are bodies in the crosswalk, bikes twisted in the gutter, families waiting for a voice at the hospital door.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most harm.</strong> They killed three, injured hundreds, and left nine with life-changing wounds. Trucks and buses killed two more. Bikes and mopeds, too, have left their mark—two deaths, dozens hurt. No one is safe. Not the old, not the young. Not the man on the corner or the child on the way to school.</p><h3 id=the-latest-blood-on-the-asphalt>The Latest Blood on the Asphalt</h3><p>The violence does not stop. In March, a man was killed by an e-bike on Franklin Street. In April, a car turned left and crushed a child’s knee. In May, a BMW driver with alcohol in his blood killed a man on Bedford Avenue. The dead do not speak, but the street remembers. &ldquo;I had a six pack of Modelos and two drinks. I was driving the car by myself last night. It&rsquo;s my fault. After I hit them, I came home,&rdquo; the driver <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/12/hit-and-run-bmw-driver-who-killed-2-in-brooklyn-had-downed-beers-body-matter-found-on-car-da/>told police after one crash</a>.</p><p>Neighbors see the danger. &ldquo;Drivers speed on that stretch of roadway,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>one told reporters after a double fatal hit-and-run</a>. The city counts the dead. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has signed on to bills for safer truck routes, daylighting, protected bike lanes, and legalizing jaywalking. He voted yes to redesign truck routes and to end the criminalization of crossing the street <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>on the Council&rsquo;s legislative record</a>. He co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act and bills for speed humps, solar crosswalks, and more. These are steps. But the bodies keep coming.</p><p><strong>Every delay is another family broken.</strong> The law can change. The street can change. But only if the pressure stays on.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-no-more-waiting>Call to Action: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Call Council Member Restler. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit.

The matter: 'Council members criticized NYPD leadership over racial disparities in traffic enforcement after the department refused to acknowledge evidence of bias.' Restler called the disparity 'extreme.' Caban said, 'Black and brown people are being beaten up, searched, arrested, 10 times more than white people.' The NYPD claimed disparities stem from policing high-crime areas. Lawmakers rejected this, citing data showing Black and Latinx drivers are disproportionately stopped, searched, and arrested. The hearing referenced the city’s long record of racially biased enforcement, including jaywalking laws once used to target Black and Latinx New Yorkers. Experts, including the NYCLU, say the Adams administration’s surge in traffic stops continues a pattern of racist policing.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to police department parking enforcement," demands the NYPD confirm license plates and VINs on vehicles with temporary tags or those ticketed for violations. The NYPD must also release quarterly reports on parking enforcement. Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary), Oswald Feliz, Lincoln Restler, Robert F. Holden, and Chris Banks sponsor the measure. On April 28, 2025, the committee laid the bill over. The bill aims to expose enforcement gaps and bring accountability, but for now, the city’s most vulnerable—pedestrians and cyclists—see no immediate relief. The system stalls.

Ossé (primary sponsor), Crystal Hudson, Lincoln Restler, and Tiffany Cabán back the measure. The cards, handed out by NYPD union members, let friends and relatives skirt penalties for traffic violations. The practice breeds unequal enforcement.
