The driver did not stop. Police found the body at 3:45 a.m. and said only, &ldquo;A driver struck and killed a 47-year-old pedestrian&mldr; then left the scene&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/cops-looking-for-driver-who-fatally-struck-man-on-brooklyn-street/>NY Daily News</a>). The victim died before help could arrive. The driver is still out there.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>eight people have died</strong> in District 33. <strong>Twenty-five more suffered serious injuries.</strong> Nearly a thousand were hurt. The numbers do not slow. They pile up. Each one is a name, a family, a life cut short.</p><h3 id=the-slow-grind-of-change>The Slow Grind of Change</h3><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has taken some steps. He voted to require taxis to warn passengers about opening doors into cyclists (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Legistar legislation</a>). He backed a bill to clear abandoned cars from the street within 72 hours, to keep sightlines open for people on foot and bike. He co-sponsored a law to post safety rules at bike share stations. These are small moves. The street stays the same.</p><p>Restler has also called out the NYPD for racial bias in traffic enforcement, calling the disparity &ldquo;extreme&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/29/council-pols-fume-as-nypd-disputes-report-of-racial-bias-in-traffic-enforcement>Streetsblog NYC</a>). He pushed to remove illegal placard parking that blocks sidewalks and bike lanes (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/24/police-finally-remove-cars-from-plaza-in-downtown-brooklyn>police finally remove cars</a>). He wants parks for people, not for parking (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/02/28/parking-or-parkland-brooklyn-judges-could-lose-their-perk>parking or parkland</a>).</p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The city moves slow. The street does not forgive.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>Every day, another crash. Every week, another family broken.</strong></p><p>Call Council Member Restler. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes and crosswalks that cannot be blocked. Demand action, not words. Do not wait for another body in the road.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The impact pushed the Camry aside and sent the Audi into four pedestrians—a mother and her three young children—crossing in the crosswalk. Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch stated, "This was a horrific tragedy caused by someone who shouldn't have been on the road." The mother and two daughters died; a four-year-old boy remains in critical condition. The Audi overturned. Speed cameras are present at the intersection, but the investigation continues. No criminal charges have been filed.

Witness Jack Collins said, "He died basically on the spot." The e-bike rider remained at the scene. No arrests were made. The article notes this intersection is known for frequent stop sign violations: "It's not a unicorn incident. It's happened a lot." The piece highlights systemic issues, including delivery app pressures and gaps in e-bike regulation. City data shows e-bikes account for less than 2% of traffic deaths, but the policy debate continues. Lawmakers have called for tighter rules, as delivery workers face incentives to rush.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The impact occurred at the center front end of the e-bike, causing severe head injuries and fatal bleeding to the pedestrian. The police report describes the victim as 'crossing, no signal, or crosswalk' and 'not at intersection,' but the primary focus remains on the unlicensed status of the e-bike operator and the disregard for traffic control.

The victim’s family is left to grieve and organize a funeral, while the intersection remains a site of loss.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
