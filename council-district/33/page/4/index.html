Nineteen more suffered serious injuries.</strong> In total, 776 have been hurt in 1,715 crashes—each one a life changed or ended. The numbers are not just numbers. They are fathers, mothers, children. A cyclist, helmet on, killed on Lynch Street. A pedestrian, head struck, left bleeding on India Street. A woman, crushed in the back seat on Flatbush Avenue. The city records the wounds. The families live with them.</p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>The horror is not abstract.

The families do not.</p><h2 id=leadership-progress-and-gaps>Leadership: Progress and Gaps</h2><p><strong>Council Member Lincoln Restler has taken steps.</strong> He voted to redesign truck routes for safety, to legalize jaywalking and end victim-blaming, and to push for protected bike lanes and daylighted intersections. He co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act and bills to raise SUV fees, mandate speed humps, and boost pedestrian lighting. But the deaths keep coming. Laws are passed. The street stays deadly. <strong>Every delay is another risk.</strong></p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> The city can lower speed limits. It can ban parking near crosswalks. It can redesign every deadly intersection. <strong>But only if you demand it.</strong></p><p><strong>Call Council Member Restler. Call the Mayor. Call DOT.</strong> Tell them: No more waiting. No more names turned into numbers. The street belongs to the living.

It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights.

The report states both vehicles faced east when the dump truck 'scraped a parked ambulance.' Inside the ambulance, a 39-year-old man suffered an arm amputation. The police report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Passing Too Closely' as contributing factors, highlighting clear driver error. The narrative notes, 'Steel shrieked. A 39-year-old man inside lost part of his arm. Blood smeared the door.' The man was not wearing a seatbelt, but the report attributes the crash to the dump truck driver’s actions. No evidence in the report suggests the victim’s behavior contributed to the collision.
