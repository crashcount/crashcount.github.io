Nineteen more suffered serious injuries.</strong> In total, 776 have been hurt in 1,715 crashes—each one a life changed or ended. The numbers are not just numbers. They are fathers, mothers, children. A cyclist, helmet on, killed on Lynch Street. A pedestrian, head struck, left bleeding on India Street. A woman, crushed in the back seat on Flatbush Avenue. The city records the wounds. The families live with them.</p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>The horror is not abstract.

The families do not.</p><h2 id=leadership-progress-and-gaps>Leadership: Progress and Gaps</h2><p><strong>Council Member Lincoln Restler has taken steps.</strong> He voted to redesign truck routes for safety, to legalize jaywalking and end victim-blaming, and to push for protected bike lanes and daylighted intersections. He co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act and bills to raise SUV fees, mandate speed humps, and boost pedestrian lighting. But the deaths keep coming. Laws are passed. The street stays deadly. <strong>Every delay is another risk.</strong></p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> The city can lower speed limits. It can ban parking near crosswalks. It can redesign every deadly intersection. <strong>But only if you demand it.</strong></p><p><strong>Call Council Member Restler. Call the Mayor. Call DOT.</strong> Tell them: No more waiting. No more names turned into numbers. The street belongs to the living.

Prime sponsor Joann Ariola leads, joined by Council Members Hanks, Ayala, Salaam, Brooks-Powers, Banks, Restler, Brannan, Ung, Gutiérrez, Louis, Hudson, Schulman, Ossé, Krishnan, Nurse, Moya, and Marmorato. Step streets are public staircases linking streets at different heights. The bill aims to ensure these stairs are well-lit, reducing risk for walkers. Once all step streets are lit, the mandate ends.
