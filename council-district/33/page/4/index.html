Eighteen left with wounds that will not heal.</strong> In the last year alone, District 33 has seen 1,725 crashes. These are not just numbers—they are bodies on the street, families waiting at hospital doors, children who do not come home. In the past twelve months, <strong>one child was killed, thirty-one more injured</strong>. The old and the young, the walker and the cyclist—none are spared.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-the-names-we-bury>Recent Crashes: The Names We Bury</h3><p>A cyclist, helmet on, struck down on Lynch Street. A pedestrian, 49, killed by a bike on Franklin. A 45-year-old woman, crushed in the back seat of an SUV on Flatbush. The dead do not speak, but the living remember. &ldquo;Yeah, this street is dangerous,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-year-old-boy-killed-suv-crossing-intersection-crown-heights-brooklyn/16875804/>said Milli Cent</a>. The city moves on. The blood dries. The danger remains.</p><h3 id=who-pays-who-acts>Who Pays, Who Acts</h3><p><strong>Most injuries come from cars and trucks—390 cases, with five deaths.</strong> Bikes and mopeds kill too, but the steel and speed of larger vehicles do the worst. The city blames the walker, the biker, the child. But the street stays the same. The law stays the same.</p><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has not been silent. He backed the law that <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>lets pedestrians cross anywhere</a>, ending the charade of jaywalking. He co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>speed up protected bike lanes</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>raise SUV fees</a>. When the city tried to rip out the Bedford Avenue bike lane, Restler stood with the families and said, &ldquo;For months, the Mayor has repeatedly ignored our recommendations for ensuring the safety of children on Bedford Avenue&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/breaking-activists-sue-city-to-prevent-erasure-of-bedford-avenue-bike-lane>said Restler</a>.</p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The city drags its feet. The next name is already written.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay, every watered-down bill, every excuse is another body on the street. Call Council Member Restler. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand protected lanes that do not vanish overnight. <strong>Do not wait for the next siren.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter summary: 'giving New Yorkers the power to allow residents to write up drivers for parking violations like blocked bus lanes, bike lanes, and fire hydrants.' Restler’s push follows a fatal Brooklyn fire where blocked hydrants delayed rescue. Eric McClure of StreetsPAC calls for 'more pervasive enforcement and higher fines.' Advocates say NYPD enforcement is lax, with 311 complaints often ignored.

The report states she was 'crossing with the light' when a speeding e-bike struck her, causing 'severe lacerations' to her entire body. She remained conscious after the impact. The e-bike operator, described as unlicensed, did not stop at the scene. The police report lists 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' as contributing factors. The e-bike showed no visible damage. The victim’s action—crossing with the signal—is noted in the report, but the primary focus remains on the rider’s speed, improper lane usage, and lack of a valid license. The crash underscores the dangers posed by reckless operation and systemic failures to control unlicensed riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The article states, 'Three people were injured, including an MTA bus driver and a young girl, in a collision that pinned two cars between a box truck and a city bus.' Footage showed two vehicles sandwiched between the bus and truck, with one car stacked atop another. The injured included a 59-year-old MTA driver, a 33-year-old woman, and a 9-year-old girl. All were hospitalized in stable condition. The cause of the crash was not determined at the time of reporting.

The bill, sponsored by Council Member Joann Ariola, claims residents need notice before losing parking. But DOT and street safety advocates slam the measure as a bureaucratic drag on urgent safety fixes. Council Member Lincoln Restler calls it 'additional hoops and hurdles' for street safety. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso says, 'I don’t know why we entertain any effort to stop or slow-roll safe street design.' Open Plans and StreetsPAC argue the bill props up car dominance and blocks safer, more sustainable streets. The bill could make it harder to move bike infrastructure off sidewalks, risking more sidewalk riding and fewer safe crossings for pedestrians. Similar bills (Intro 606, Intro 104) face the same criticism.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Council Member Robert Holden, claims to address a 'public safety crisis.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez opposed the measure, stating, 'The administration already has the tools to enforce against illegal [cycling] behaviors; a license plate is not necessary for enforcement.' Rodriguez cited data: 105 pedestrians killed by cars this year, versus six by e-bikes, mopeds, and scooters combined. He argued that street redesigns, not new bureaucracy, cut deaths and injuries. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams echoed this, noting that registration backers often resist proven safety fixes like protected bike lanes. Rodriguez warned the bill would waste $19 million and slow adoption of sustainable transport. He called for holding delivery apps accountable and redesigning streets, not targeting vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Erik D. Bottcher is the primary sponsor, joined by Julie Won, Jumaane Williams, and others. The bill prohibits standing or parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and mandates the Department of Transportation to install daylighting barriers at a minimum of 1,000 intersections per year.
