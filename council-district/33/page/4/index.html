Forty-six wounded. In District 33, the numbers do not lie. Since 2022, there have been <strong>6,619 crashes</strong>, <strong>3,111 injuries</strong>, and <strong>15 deaths</strong>. The dead include a 49-year-old man struck crossing <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>India Street at Franklin</a>, a 46-year-old cyclist killed on <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Lynch Street</a>, and a 74-year-old e-bike rider crushed at <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Tillary and Jay</a>. Each crash is a life broken. Each number is a name erased.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the killing.</strong> Trucks, bikes, and buses took their share. The street is a gauntlet. No one is safe.</p><h3 id=the-politics-of-delay>The Politics of Delay</h3><p>The city ripped out three blocks of the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane this June. The mayor called it a response to &ldquo;community feedback&rdquo; after &ldquo;several incidents—including some involving children&rdquo; <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/adams-dot-remove-bedford-avenue-bike-lane/>said Mayor Adams</a>. But the numbers on Bedford are older and colder: nearly 700 injured, four pedestrians dead in just four years before the lane. The city replaced protection with paint. The risk remains.</p><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler did not stay silent. &ldquo;For months, the Mayor has repeatedly ignored our recommendations for ensuring the safety of children on Bedford Avenue. And now, instead of identifying solutions that enhance safety for pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers, the Mayor is making a purely political decision to rip out a bike lane with no alternative&rdquo; <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/adams-dot-remove-bedford-avenue-bike-lane/>Restler said</a>. He backed a lawsuit to stop the removal, filing an affidavit to keep the lane in place <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/breaking-activists-sue-city-to-prevent-erasure-of-bedford-avenue-bike-lane>in court</a>.</p><p>Restler has also co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and lower speed limits. But the city moves slow. The blood dries before the paint does.</p><h3 id=the-next-fight>The Next Fight</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every rollback, every delay, every shortcut has a cost. The dead do not get a second chance. The living must fight for theirs.</p><p><strong>Call Council Member Restler. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes that stay put. Demand that every child, every elder, every cyclist gets home alive.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, not yet numbered, will not take effect until the next contract in 2029. Restler, who called current fees 'out of control,' also urged the city to connect Citi Bike docks to the electrical grid. He said, 'What a silly system we have that's depending on hundreds of cars and trucks going around New York City to recharge our sustainable form of transit.' Restler’s push aims to make e-bikes accessible for working-class New Yorkers and reduce car and truck trips tied to battery swaps. No formal safety analyst note was provided, but the bill’s focus is clear: lower barriers for vulnerable road users and cut vehicle miles on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Assembly Member Emily Gallagher called the compromise 'a plan that does nothing to address the central safety concerns of our community.'

Councilmember Lincoln Restler, representing District 33, criticized the move, saying, 'The mayor has put forward a compromise that nobody likes.' A coalition of elected officials—including Rep. Nydia Velázquez, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, Comptroller Brad Lander, and Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso—called for a more thorough redesign, arguing the current plan preserves dangerous elements. DOT spokesperson Vincent Barone claimed the redesign will make the corridor safer for all users, with new bike lanes and sidewalk extensions.

The Department of Transportation (DOT) will install a bike lane on the southern stretch but keep two traffic lanes in each direction. The original plan called for a road diet and a parking-protected bike lane. After pushback from business interests, DOT scaled back. The new plan converts the outer lane to parking overnight, a design that has led to illegal parking and safety hazards for cyclists. Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized the plan, saying, 'this plan fails to dramatically slow down traffic on this dangerous boulevard.' The advocacy group Make McGuinness Safe accused the mayor of breaking his promise to prioritize safety. The compromise removes some parking, which local businesses oppose. Despite DOT claims, the redesign does not slow traffic or protect vulnerable road users as promised.

Cyclists and walkers claimed space. Safety replaced speed.</p><p class=mb3>On August 3, 2024, a one-day closure of Driggs Avenue—dubbed 'Driggs Passage'—cut car traffic through McCarren Park in Williamsburg. The event, not a formal bill but a policy experiment, was championed by Council Member Lincoln Restler (D-Greenpoint), who said, "Today is a one-day experiment to just experience what it would be like to not have cars flying through the middle of our community's primary green space." The closure united two halves of the park, creating 1.5 acres of new open space. Organizers and residents, including Katie Denny Horowitz of the North Brooklyn Parks Alliance, called for a permanent ban on cars. Since 2020, city data shows 42 crashes on this stretch, injuring six cyclists and one pedestrian. The move echoes past car bans in Central and Prospect Parks, but faces resistance from city officials. The day showed what’s possible when cars yield to people.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, led by NYC DOT, brings mid-block crossings, concrete pedestrian islands, curb enhancements, and split-phase signals to one of Brooklyn’s deadliest corridors. The matter, titled 'Atlantic Avenue upgrade: Locals celebrate major safety fixes coming to dangerous corridor,' highlights years of advocacy after repeated crashes. Restler, who has long pushed for these changes, praised the progress: 'Atlantic Avenue has been extremely dangerous my whole life. I'm excited by the progress we're making in partnership with DOT to expand mid-block crossings and other smart interventions to slow down cars and advance safety in our community.' The announcement follows a deadly crash last spring and is part of the city’s Vision Zero push.

The incident, caught on camera, showed a Dodge Durango honking, then plowing through metal fences as volunteers dove for safety. The matter centers on repeated illegal parking by NYPD and municipal workers, which blocks safety measures and shrinks space for pedestrians. Restler stated, "It has been really frustrating that our city agencies that should be partners in this effort have undermined it." Kelly Carroll, Executive Director of the Atlantic Avenue BID, added, "We can't even set up a table if the cars are parked there. It renders the open street moot." No arrests have been made, but police are pursuing felony charges.
