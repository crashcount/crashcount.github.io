The city scrapped lane reductions and protected bike lanes. Pedestrians and cyclists remain exposed. Elected officials condemned the move. The mayor put politics before lives.</p><p class=mb3>On August 26, 2024, Mayor Adams reversed a key street safety redesign for McGuinness Boulevard in Brooklyn. The Department of Transportation's original plan, announced after a fatal crash in 2021, would have reduced travel lanes and added a parking-protected bike lane. DOT data showed this 'would reduce deaths and serious injuries by 30 percent.' Under pressure from business interests, especially Broadway Stages, Adams first weakened the plan in July 2023, then scaled it back further in August 2024. Council Member Lincoln Restler said, 'Mayor Adams says he cares about safety, except when it comes to McGuinness Boulevard.' Assembly Member Emily Gallagher called the compromise 'a plan that does nothing to address the central safety concerns of our community.' Public Advocate Jumaane Williams urged the city to follow the evidence and protect lives. The mayor’s decision leaves vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT claims improvements, but critics remain unsatisfied.</p><p class=mb3>On August 20, 2024, the city announced it will proceed with a controversial redesign of McGuinness Boulevard in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. The plan, not a council bill but a Department of Transportation decision, extends parking-protected bike lanes from Calyer Street to Meeker Avenue. Councilmember Lincoln Restler, representing District 33, criticized the move, saying, 'The mayor has put forward a compromise that nobody likes.' A coalition of elected officials—including Rep. Nydia Velázquez, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, Comptroller Brad Lander, and Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso—called for a more thorough redesign, arguing the current plan preserves dangerous elements. DOT spokesperson Vincent Barone claimed the redesign will make the corridor safer for all users, with new bike lanes and sidewalk extensions. Despite these claims, advocates and local leaders argue the plan fails to address core dangers and puts vulnerable road users at continued risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT keeps two lanes each way, adds a bike lane with overnight parking. Advocates and officials slam the move. Cyclists face danger. Promised safety upgrades vanish. Traffic stays fast. Lives remain at risk.</p><p class=mb3>On August 20, 2024, Mayor Adams announced a revised redesign for McGuinness Boulevard. The Department of Transportation (DOT) will install a bike lane on the southern stretch but keep two traffic lanes in each direction. The original plan called for a road diet and a parking-protected bike lane. After pushback from business interests, DOT scaled back. The new plan converts the outer lane to parking overnight, a design that has led to illegal parking and safety hazards for cyclists. Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized the plan, saying, 'this plan fails to dramatically slow down traffic on this dangerous boulevard.' The advocacy group Make McGuinness Safe accused the mayor of breaking his promise to prioritize safety. The compromise removes some parking, which local businesses oppose. Despite DOT claims, the redesign does not slow traffic or protect vulnerable road users as promised. The decision follows years of advocacy after a fatal crash in 2021.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, discussed in the Transportation Committee, keeps two vehicle lanes during peak hours and adds protected bike lanes along each curb. The official matter: 'City will move forward with stripped-back redesign of McGuinness Boulevard.' Council Member Lincoln Restler, joined by eight other elected officials, condemned the move, stating, 'Mayor Adams is going forward with a plan that fails Greenpoint by preserving the most dangerous elements of this roadway.' Local safety advocates and Restler argue the redesign ignores years of calls to address deadly conditions. The city’s plan abandons a previous proposal to remove a traffic lane, leaving the street’s core dangers in place. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, children—remain exposed on a corridor with a long record of crashes and deaths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, not a formal bill but a policy experiment, was championed by Council Member Lincoln Restler (D-Greenpoint), who said, "Today is a one-day experiment to just experience what it would be like to not have cars flying through the middle of our community's primary green space." The closure united two halves of the park, creating 1.5 acres of new open space. Organizers and residents, including Katie Denny Horowitz of the North Brooklyn Parks Alliance, called for a permanent ban on cars. Since 2020, city data shows 42 crashes on this stretch, injuring six cyclists and one pedestrian. The move echoes past car bans in Central and Prospect Parks, but faces resistance from city officials.

Restler, who has long pushed for these changes, praised the progress: 'Atlantic Avenue has been extremely dangerous my whole life.

The incident, caught on camera, showed a Dodge Durango honking, then plowing through metal fences as volunteers dove for safety. The matter centers on repeated illegal parking by NYPD and municipal workers, which blocks safety measures and shrinks space for pedestrians. Restler stated, "It has been really frustrating that our city agencies that should be partners in this effort have undermined it." Kelly Carroll, Executive Director of the Atlantic Avenue BID, added, "We can't even set up a table if the cars are parked there. It renders the open street moot."

Progress came, but not enough.</p><p class=mb3>In June 2024, the New York State legislative session ended with mixed results for street safety. Governor Hochul paused congestion pricing, stalling a major funding plan. Lawmakers passed Sammy’s Law, letting New York City lower speed limits, but exempted some roads. The city can now expand red light cameras from 150 to 600 intersections. Other measures, like parking enforcement cameras on sweepers and the Idaho Stop for cyclists, passed only one chamber. Speed governors for reckless drivers and daylighting did not advance. Advocates like Eric McClure called Sammy’s Law a 'huge victory,' but noted, 'there’s so much more the legislature could be doing.' Council Member Lincoln Restler called the failure to pass sweeper camera enforcement 'super disappointing.' The congestion pricing drama overshadowed progress. Vulnerable road users gained some protections, but systemic danger remains.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The rally, organized by Riders Alliance, gathered outside Broadway Junction. Protesters held signs reading, 'Don’t cancel @ 11th hour' and 'clean air, fast trains. Fund the MTA.' The matter, titled 'Brooklynites fume over congestion pricing delay: Kathy Hochul has betrayed us,' saw Restler declare, 'Kathy Hochul has betrayed us.' He called for more frequent buses, reliable trains, and less car dependence. Demonstrators warned that the delay defunds the MTA, threatens service for those without cars, and puts Black, Brown, and low-income communities at risk. State Sen. Jabari Brisport urged Hochul to reinstate the plan.

The event, organized by Riders Alliance, followed Governor Kathy Hochul’s last-minute decision to halt the Manhattan toll plan. The protest drew bus and subway riders, who chanted for immediate action and held signs demanding clean air and reliable transit. Restler declared, 'Kathy Hochul has betrayed us,' and called for more frequent bus service, better trains, and less dependence on cars and trucks. The demonstrators warned that without congestion pricing, the MTA faces a funding crisis. This threatens repairs and improvements, especially in Black, Brown, and low-income neighborhoods, and risks worsening traffic and delays for emergency services. The protest highlights the systemic danger: when transit funding is gutted, vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The move falls short of the original goal but marks the largest growth since 1994. Advocates say cameras save lives. Debate continues over equity and coverage.</p><p class=mb3>On June 6, 2024, the City Council passed a resolution urging the state to expand New York City's red light camera program from 150 to 600 intersections. The measure, led by Council Member Lincoln Restler, follows internal debate and negotiation, with some members pushing for 1,325 intersections and others preferring fewer. The final number represents a four-fold increase, covering about 4 percent of city intersections. The Council's resolution, described as a 'home rule' message, aims to prevent the program from sunsetting and to improve safety for all road users. Restler stated, 'This will expand it to about 4 percent of intersections, and it will make our city safer.' Assembly Member Jeff Dinowitz called the expansion a victory, while advocates like Sara Lind of Open Plans noted no deaths at camera-protected intersections since 1994. Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers highlighted the need to ensure cameras improve communities and street safety, raising concerns about fairness in enforcement. The Department of Transportation called the Council's action a critical step.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The collision ejected the cyclist from his bike, resulting in severe head lacerations. The report states the bus driver was inattentive and failed to yield the right-of-way. The cyclist, who was not wearing a helmet, landed hard on the pavement and remained conscious with a torn-open head. The bus sustained no damage and continued on. The police report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as contributing factors. The narrative details the violence of the impact and the aftermath, emphasizing the unyielding force of the bus and the vulnerability of the young cyclist.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
