Eighteen seriously hurt.</strong> In the past year alone, District 33 has seen 1,758 crashes, with 813 injuries and 18 people left with wounds that will not heal. The dead include a pregnant woman run down in Bedford-Stuyvesant, a cyclist crushed on Lynch Street, and a pedestrian killed by an e-bike in Greenpoint. These are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors.</p><p>On May 24, Tiffany Cifuni was killed after a driver rear-ended her, then ran her down as she tried to get a photo of the license plate. Her family <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/18/brooklyn-hit-run-pregnant-woman-murder-tiffany-cifuni-arrest-chaquasia-pigford/>vowed to seek justice for Tiffany</a>. The driver fled, leaving Tiffany’s body in the street.</p><h3 id=patterns-of-violence-patterns-of-delay>Patterns of Violence, Patterns of Delay</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the killing.</strong> In the last three years, cars and SUVs caused 3 deaths and 387 injuries to pedestrians. Trucks and buses killed 2, bikes killed 2 more. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The violence is relentless</a>. It does not care about the weather, the time, or the victim.</p><p>The city’s response is often slow, sometimes backwards. Just this month, the Mayor tried to rip out a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue. Council Member Lincoln Restler fought back, calling the move <a href=https://www.bkreader.com/policy-government/mayor-orders-removal-of-bike-lane-on-bedford-avenue-in-brooklyn-10815696>&ldquo;purely a political decision&rdquo; that would &ldquo;lead to more tragic crashes.&rdquo;</a> Restler joined a lawsuit and helped win a court order to keep the lane—for now.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-pressure>Leadership: Progress and Pressure</h3><p>Restler has pushed for safer streets. He co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, legalize jaywalking, and speed up protected bike lanes. He backed the SAFE Streets Act and called for speed limiters on the worst drivers. But the blood on the street says it is not enough.</p><p><strong>Every delay, every rollback, every shortcut has a cost.</strong> The city still lets cars park at corners. Speeders still roam free. The most vulnerable—children, cyclists, the elderly—pay the price.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-no-more-waiting>Call to Action: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Call Council Member Restler. Call the Mayor. Demand action.</strong> Tell them to finish the job: daylight every corner, build real protection for people on foot and bike, and end the excuses. The dead cannot speak. The living must not stay silent.</p></div></div><div class="mod-contact tc"><h3 class="fw6 mb2">Fix the Problem</h3><button class="dib pv2 ph3 ba b--light-silver br2 bg-dark-gray white pointer" onclick='var el=document.getElementById("contact-card");el.classList.toggle("dn"),el.classList.toggle("flex")'>

Open Plans and StreetsPAC argue the bill props up car dominance and blocks safer, more sustainable streets.

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez opposed the measure, stating, 'The administration already has the tools to enforce against illegal [cycling] behaviors; a license plate is not necessary for enforcement.' Rodriguez cited data: 105 pedestrians killed by cars this year, versus six by e-bikes, mopeds, and scooters combined. He argued that street redesigns, not new bureaucracy, cut deaths and injuries. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams echoed this, noting that registration backers often resist proven safety fixes like protected bike lanes. Rodriguez warned the bill would waste $19 million and slow adoption of sustainable transport.

The collision left the cyclist with severe lacerations to his arm, described as 'deep cuts and broken flesh,' and he was partially ejected from his bike but remained conscious.

The crash occurred at 8:36 a.m. The focus remains on the driver’s failure to yield, which directly led to the cyclist’s injuries, as documented by police.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The moped rider, a 33-year-old man, suffered chest crush injuries and was partially ejected from his vehicle. He remained conscious at the scene. The police report lists 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Unsafe Speed' as contributing factors in the crash. The Jeep’s right side doors bore the brunt of the impact.

The bill would raise registration fees for larger, heavier vehicles, with a break for electric car batteries. The resolution cites grim numbers: 103 pedestrians killed in New York City in 2023, and research showing heavy vehicles are deadlier. The Council says this law could deter the spread of oversized cars, protect people on foot and bike, and cut emissions.

The proposal, under the Town Center Zoning plan, aims to boost small-scale, mixed-use housing. Council Members Shahana Hanif and Lincoln Restler voiced strong support, with Hanif stating, 'Parking mandates block housing, they block extra space for the folks living in communities, they block plazas, and the ability to live in a climate friendly city.' Restler called the policy vital for Brooklyn. Department of City Planning Director Dan Garodnick acknowledged the importance of removing parking mandates but noted the plan could proceed without it. The Council faces pushback from low-density, transit-poor areas. Progressive groups and experts argue that ending parking mandates is overdue and would reshape housing, public space, and climate policy citywide.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The original lane reduction and protected bike lane plan, previously scrapped, will now move forward for the southern half of the street, between Calyer Street and Meeker Avenue. The matter, described as a return to 'the road diet it had previously finalized and then rejected,' follows months of community outcry and advocacy. Council Member Lincoln Restler (District 33) and other local officials celebrated the move, crediting the Make McGuinness Safe coalition for relentless pressure. Restler stated, 'this is a decision that enhances safety in our community, and that's what matters.' The northern half of the boulevard remains unchanged, with two traffic lanes and barrier-protected bike lanes.
