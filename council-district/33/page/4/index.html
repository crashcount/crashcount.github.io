Fifty-two left with injuries that change a life.</strong> In District 33, the numbers do not lie. Since 2022, the streets have claimed children, elders, cyclists, and walkers. The wounds are not just numbers. They are names, faces, empty chairs at dinner tables. <strong>Cars and SUVs killed three. Trucks and buses killed two.

He voted to require taxis and for-hire vehicles to display warning decals about cyclists, a law meant to fight dooring <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>voted</a>. He co-sponsored bills to remove abandoned vehicles, clear crosswalks, and boost plate enforcement. He pushed for daylighting—banning parking near crosswalks to keep sightlines open. But the pace is slow. The committee laid the daylighting bill over in April. The cars still block the corners. The danger waits.</p><p>Restler has also called out the NYPD for racial bias in traffic enforcement, calling the disparity &ldquo;extreme&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/29/council-pols-fume-as-nypd-disputes-report-of-racial-bias-in-traffic-enforcement>called out</a>.

He has supported crackdowns on illegal placard parking that blocks bike lanes and sidewalks <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/24/police-finally-remove-cars-from-plaza-in-downtown-brooklyn>supported crackdowns</a>.</p><h3 id=the-work-left-undone>The Work Left Undone</h3><p><strong>The dead do not care about decals.</strong> They need streets that do not kill. The bills are a start, but they are not enough. The corners are still blind. The lanes are still blocked. The speed is still too high. The city has the power to lower the limit to 20 mph. It has not used it. Every day of delay is another day a mother, a child, or a neighbor does not come home.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Parks should be for people, not for parking.&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/02/28/parking-or-parkland-brooklyn-judges-could-lose-their-perk>Restler said</a>.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Restler called the racial disparity in traffic enforcement &ldquo;extreme.&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/29/council-pols-fume-as-nypd-disputes-report-of-racial-bias-in-traffic-enforcement>Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Call your council member.

An e-bike rider, seventy-four, thrown down. His head struck, life ended. The street stilled. The door bore the mark. Brooklyn night, another life lost to traffic’s violence.</p><p class=mb3>A 74-year-old man riding an e-bike was killed at the corner of Jay Street and Tillary Street in Brooklyn when a bus struck him while making a right turn, according to the police report. The narrative states the man was 'thrown from the saddle' and suffered fatal head injuries, with 'the door bore the mark' signaling the point of impact on the bus. The police report lists the bus as 'making right turn' and the e-bike as 'going straight ahead.' Both contributing factors are marked as 'Unspecified' in the report. The victim was not wearing a helmet, but the report does not cite this as a contributing factor. The collision ended with the e-bike rider ejected and killed, underscoring the lethal risk faced by vulnerable road users when large vehicles turn across their path.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
