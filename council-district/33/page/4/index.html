The report states the e-bike driver was 'unlicensed' and identifies 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as a contributing factor. The impact occurred at the center front end of the e-bike, causing severe head injuries and fatal bleeding to the pedestrian. The police report describes the victim as 'crossing, no signal, or crosswalk' and 'not at intersection,' but the primary focus remains on the unlicensed status of the e-bike operator and the disregard for traffic control. The narrative details a quiet night interrupted by the crash, with the victim left motionless on the pavement.

According to the police report, 'Both drivers ran the light.' The moped's rear was torn in the crash, and the rider was thrown from his seat, remaining conscious but badly injured. The report lists 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as the primary contributing factor for both vehicles involved. The moped operator was unlicensed, but the data centers driver actions: both failed to obey traffic signals, creating lethal conditions for all road users. The police report describes the aftermath in stark terms: 'Blood ran from deep cuts across his face.' No mention is made of victim behavior as a contributing factor. The crash underscores the systemic danger when drivers ignore traffic controls at busy Brooklyn intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
