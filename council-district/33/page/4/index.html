The driver did not stop. Police found the body at 3:45 a.m. and said only, &ldquo;A driver struck and killed a 47-year-old pedestrian&mldr; then left the scene&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/03/cops-looking-for-driver-who-fatally-struck-man-on-brooklyn-street/>NY Daily News</a>). The victim died before help could arrive. The driver is still out there.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>eight people have died</strong> in District 33. <strong>Twenty-five more suffered serious injuries.</strong> Nearly a thousand were hurt. The numbers do not slow. They pile up. Each one is a name, a family, a life cut short.</p><h3 id=the-slow-grind-of-change>The Slow Grind of Change</h3><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has taken some steps. He voted to require taxis to warn passengers about opening doors into cyclists (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Legistar legislation</a>). He backed a bill to clear abandoned cars from the street within 72 hours, to keep sightlines open for people on foot and bike. He co-sponsored a law to post safety rules at bike share stations. These are small moves. The street stays the same.</p><p>Restler has also called out the NYPD for racial bias in traffic enforcement, calling the disparity &ldquo;extreme&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/29/council-pols-fume-as-nypd-disputes-report-of-racial-bias-in-traffic-enforcement>Streetsblog NYC</a>). He pushed to remove illegal placard parking that blocks sidewalks and bike lanes (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/24/police-finally-remove-cars-from-plaza-in-downtown-brooklyn>police finally remove cars</a>). He wants parks for people, not for parking (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/02/28/parking-or-parkland-brooklyn-judges-could-lose-their-perk>parking or parkland</a>).</p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The city moves slow. The street does not forgive.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>Every day, another crash. Every week, another family broken.</strong></p><p>Call Council Member Restler. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes and crosswalks that cannot be blocked. Demand action, not words. Do not wait for another body in the road.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report states she was 'crossing with the light' when a speeding e-bike struck her, causing 'severe lacerations' to her entire body. She remained conscious after the impact. The e-bike operator, described as unlicensed, did not stop at the scene. The police report lists 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' as contributing factors. The e-bike showed no visible damage. The victim’s action—crossing with the signal—is noted in the report, but the primary focus remains on the rider’s speed, improper lane usage, and lack of a valid license. The crash underscores the dangers posed by reckless operation and systemic failures to control unlicensed riders.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
