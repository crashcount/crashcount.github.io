Eighteen left with wounds that will not heal.</strong> In the last year alone, District 33 has seen 1,725 crashes. These are not just numbers—they are bodies on the street, families waiting at hospital doors, children who do not come home. In the past twelve months, <strong>one child was killed, thirty-one more injured</strong>. The old and the young, the walker and the cyclist—none are spared.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-the-names-we-bury>Recent Crashes: The Names We Bury</h3><p>A cyclist, helmet on, struck down on Lynch Street. A pedestrian, 49, killed by a bike on Franklin. A 45-year-old woman, crushed in the back seat of an SUV on Flatbush. The dead do not speak, but the living remember. &ldquo;Yeah, this street is dangerous,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-year-old-boy-killed-suv-crossing-intersection-crown-heights-brooklyn/16875804/>said Milli Cent</a>. The city moves on. The blood dries. The danger remains.</p><h3 id=who-pays-who-acts>Who Pays, Who Acts</h3><p><strong>Most injuries come from cars and trucks—390 cases, with five deaths.</strong> Bikes and mopeds kill too, but the steel and speed of larger vehicles do the worst. The city blames the walker, the biker, the child. But the street stays the same. The law stays the same.</p><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has not been silent. He backed the law that <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>lets pedestrians cross anywhere</a>, ending the charade of jaywalking. He co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>speed up protected bike lanes</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>raise SUV fees</a>. When the city tried to rip out the Bedford Avenue bike lane, Restler stood with the families and said, &ldquo;For months, the Mayor has repeatedly ignored our recommendations for ensuring the safety of children on Bedford Avenue&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/breaking-activists-sue-city-to-prevent-erasure-of-bedford-avenue-bike-lane>said Restler</a>.</p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The city drags its feet. The next name is already written.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay, every watered-down bill, every excuse is another body on the street. Call Council Member Restler. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand protected lanes that do not vanish overnight. <strong>Do not wait for the next siren.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, now before the City Council, aims to crack down on placard abuse by city workers, which Restler calls 'petty corruption.' The matter summary states the legislation would force agencies to revoke most placards not protected by union contracts. Restler also proposed a bill letting New Yorkers report illegal placards and collect a share of fines. Street safety advocates back the move, saying, 'Ending placard abuse in New York City will make our streets safe, while ensuring bus and bike riders can stay moving—unobstructed by illegally stored cars.' The bill follows years of failed enforcement and mounting placard numbers. Restler’s action targets a system that blocks crosswalks, endangers pedestrians, and slows public transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The redesign converts the street to one-way eastbound, adds a two-way protected bike lane, and installs pedestrian improvements like Qwick Curbs and refuge spaces. Loading zones and left-turn bans aim to cut injuries. Since 2015, 555 crashes have injured 124 and killed one pedestrian. Council Member Lincoln Restler backed the plan, calling it a 'top priority' and 'necessary response' to deadly conditions. Former Council Member Steve Levin and advocates pushed for these changes for years. Some locals criticized Qwick Curbs as ugly, but DOT officials stressed the board's advisory role.

Advocates like Brian Howald and Jon Orcutt stress the need for robust, physical protection—not just paint or flexible posts—to keep drivers out.

Vulnerable users remain exposed.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0287-2022 was introduced on April 28, 2022, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill proposed 'establishing an office of active transportation and an active transportation advisory board.' Council Members Althea V. Stevens (primary sponsor), Lynn C. Schulman, Lincoln Restler, and Carlina Rivera backed the measure. The advisory board would have studied safety, complaints, and policy for cyclists, e-bike riders, and others outside cars. Eight board members would be appointed by the Council Speaker, four by the Mayor. The office would report annually and serve as a citywide liaison for active transportation users. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. No new protections for vulnerable road users resulted.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal supports the Streets Master Plan, which mandates 250 miles of protected bike lanes and 150 miles of protected bus lanes in five years. Restler emphasized that the funding will harden bike lanes, replacing paint with physical barriers to keep cars out and protect cyclists. The Council had requested $3.1 billion, but Restler called the $900 million a dramatic investment.

Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers, Carlina Rivera, Lincoln Restler, Sandy Nurse, Chi Ossé, Crystal Hudson, Shekar Krishnan, and Amanda Farías joined her.

The 84th Precinct in Downtown Brooklyn was named the worst offender, with officers racking up speeding tickets, blocking hydrants, and abusing placards. Council Member Lincoln Restler, who represents the area, condemned the precinct’s behavior as 'petty, but pervasive corruption' and pledged to push for aggressive legislation and enforcement. Restler has previously called for eliminating parking placards entirely. Streetsblog’s study found that precinct blocks see more crashes than nearby streets, linking NYPD misconduct to increased danger for vulnerable road users.

Council Member Erik Bottcher pressed Strauber, citing resident complaints about fake placards and blocked curbs. Bottcher said, 'NYPD traffic enforcement agents are not issuing tickets to many people using counterfeit placards.' Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized the lack of a digital placard system and is drafting new enforcement legislation. Local Law 6 mandates weekly sweeps and monthly reports, but agencies have failed to comply. The Adams administration has not advanced citizen enforcement.

He noted, "These cars obstruct pedestrian space, endanger cyclists, and undermine safety on our streets." Restler supports legislation to reduce placard issuance and the creation of an independent enforcement unit outside the NYPD. Between January 2017 and February 2022, the 84th Precinct area saw 219 crashes injuring cyclists, pedestrians, and motorists. Police cars often took over sidewalks despite having two parking lots.
