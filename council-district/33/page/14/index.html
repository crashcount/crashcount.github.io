Forty-six suffered wounds so grave they may never walk the same again. The dead include a 17-year-old boy thrown from a moped, a cyclist crushed on Lynch Street, and a woman crossing Flatbush who never made it to the other side. The city calls them accidents. The families know better.</p><h2 id=the-faces-left-behind>The Faces Left Behind</h2><p>A brother remembers a man who &ldquo;never stopped working&rdquo; and &ldquo;was always passionate about the things that he did&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>said Francisco Mota</a>. A father buries his son. A child’s route to school is marked by blood on the crosswalk. <strong>Most deaths come at the hands of cars and SUVs.</strong> But bikes, mopeds, and trucks all take their share. The street does not care who you are.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h2><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has stood with the living. He backed the <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>SAFE Streets Act</a>, pushed for <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>protected bike lanes</a>, and fought to keep the Bedford Avenue lane from being ripped out by City Hall. When the city tried to erase that protection, Restler did not mince words: &ldquo;For months, the Mayor has repeatedly ignored our recommendations for ensuring the safety of children on Bedford Avenue&rdquo; <a href=https://www.bkreader.com/policy-government/brooklyn-cycling-advocates-sue-to-block-mayor-from-removing-bedford-avenue-bike-lane-10826886>Restler, via BKReader</a>. He filed suit to stop the rollback. He co-sponsored bills to daylight crosswalks, slow cars, and install speed limiters. But the blood keeps coming. <strong>Every delay, every watered-down law, every shortcut leaves another family in mourning.</strong></p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These deaths are not the weather. They are the result of choices. Choices made by people in power. Choices that can be changed.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected lanes that cannot be erased by a tweet. Demand that every repeat reckless driver is stopped before they kill again.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list. The street will not wait. Neither should you.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Former Brooklyn Democratic Party Chair Frank Seddio opposed the lane reduction, urging allies to resist the change. The meeting excluded some officials who support shrinking the highway, such as Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon and State Senator Andrew Gounardes, who cite environmental and community health concerns. Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized the city for favoring a three-lane solution and sidelining affected communities.

Reynoso said, 'Those are two pieces I’d love to see pushed absolutely.' He also champions protected bike lanes, a comprehensive bike network, and the Brooklyn Waterfront Greenway. Reynoso’s stance is clear: streets must be safer for people walking and biking. He wants action after recent traffic violence and supports more open streets.

The official summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to conducting a study of the impact that truck and delivery traffic generated by last mile facilities have on local communities and infrastructure.'

Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint.

Despite City Hall’s claim that 'obscuring and defacing license plates is against the law' and that enforcement is increasing, the streets tell a different story. Unreadable plates let reckless drivers escape detection. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, passengers—face greater risk.
