Forty-six wounded. In District 33, the numbers do not lie. Since 2022, there have been <strong>6,619 crashes</strong>, <strong>3,111 injuries</strong>, and <strong>15 deaths</strong>. The dead include a 49-year-old man struck crossing <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>India Street at Franklin</a>, a 46-year-old cyclist killed on <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Lynch Street</a>, and a 74-year-old e-bike rider crushed at <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Tillary and Jay</a>. Each crash is a life broken. Each number is a name erased.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the killing.</strong> Trucks, bikes, and buses took their share. The street is a gauntlet. No one is safe.</p><h3 id=the-politics-of-delay>The Politics of Delay</h3><p>The city ripped out three blocks of the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane this June. The mayor called it a response to &ldquo;community feedback&rdquo; after &ldquo;several incidents—including some involving children&rdquo; <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/adams-dot-remove-bedford-avenue-bike-lane/>said Mayor Adams</a>. But the numbers on Bedford are older and colder: nearly 700 injured, four pedestrians dead in just four years before the lane. The city replaced protection with paint. The risk remains.</p><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler did not stay silent. &ldquo;For months, the Mayor has repeatedly ignored our recommendations for ensuring the safety of children on Bedford Avenue. And now, instead of identifying solutions that enhance safety for pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers, the Mayor is making a purely political decision to rip out a bike lane with no alternative&rdquo; <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/adams-dot-remove-bedford-avenue-bike-lane/>Restler said</a>. He backed a lawsuit to stop the removal, filing an affidavit to keep the lane in place <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/breaking-activists-sue-city-to-prevent-erasure-of-bedford-avenue-bike-lane>in court</a>.</p><p>Restler has also co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and lower speed limits. But the city moves slow. The blood dries before the paint does.</p><h3 id=the-next-fight>The Next Fight</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every rollback, every delay, every shortcut has a cost. The dead do not get a second chance. The living must fight for theirs.</p><p><strong>Call Council Member Restler. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes that stay put. Demand that every child, every elder, every cyclist gets home alive.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Liz Denys of Bridges 4 People called out the city for ignoring creative ideas and failing to reduce car and truck traffic. William Meehan criticized the focus on beautification over safety.

The matter arose after attorney Adam White was arrested for removing plastic from an obscured license plate; charges were later dropped by Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez, citing 'insufficient evidence.' The bill, discussed at a press conference, aims to crack down on license plate defacement and illegal parking, which Restler says is rampant among city workers and police. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes introduced a similar bill at the state level.

Sponsored by Council Member Lincoln Restler, the bill is advancing in the City Council with 24 out of 51 members signed on as of November 7, 2022. It sits with the Transportation Committee, chaired by Selvena Brooks-Powers, who is working with Restler to streamline the complaint process. The bill’s summary: it allows residents to ticket drivers who block bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or fire hydrants within 1,320 feet of a school, creating a $175 fine and a civilian complaint protocol. Restler and Brooks-Powers are refining the process to avoid the pitfalls of the city’s anti-idling law, which discourages participation. The NYPD and DOT oppose the bill, citing concerns about neighbor conflict. Advocates support it, highlighting NYPD’s failure to protect vulnerable road users. The bill is seen as a major improvement over the ineffective 311 system.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law.

The request follows complaints after Schermerhorn Street’s redesign, which added a protected bike lane but made all crossings one-way southbound, causing gridlock and blocking access for services. The Community Board’s Transportation and Public Safety Committee, chaired by Sid Meyer, voted to support the change and insisted DOT maintain and protect the Bond Street bike lane with a physical barrier.
