Pedestrians took 556 injuries and eight deaths. Cyclists took 554 injuries and one death. Trucks and buses are a smaller share, but they killed three pedestrians.

Broadway too. The pain clusters. It doesn’t wander.</p><p>The worst hours pile up after dark. Death peaks at 1 a.m., 6 a.m., the school commute, and again in the evening — with three deaths at 7 p.m. and more at 10, 11, and midnight. The count rises when the light fades. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The city’s hourly ledger shows it</a>.</p><h3 id=whats-killing-people-here>What’s killing people here</h3><p>“Other” tops the listed causes for deaths and harm.

He supports a pilot to ticket illegal parking by camera — owners pay when cars block crosswalks and bike lanes. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>His resolution urges Albany to act</a>.</p><p>On one Downtown Brooklyn plaza, police finally cleared years of illegal placard parking after complaints. They wrote 40 tickets, towed 10 cars. “Following community complaints… the NYPD Transportation Bureau and Council Member Lincoln Restler coordinated… to address the parking condition and clear the area,” the department said, as <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/24/police-finally-remove-cars-from-plaza-in-downtown-brooklyn>reported by Streetsblog</a>.

Data shows Black drivers face more searches and arrests. NYPD blamed crime patterns. Lawmakers called it an excuse. The city’s history of biased policing loomed large.</p><p class=mb3>On April 29, 2025, the City Council held an oversight hearing on NYPD traffic enforcement and racial bias. Council Members Yusef Salaam, Tiffany Caban, and Lincoln Restler pressed NYPD Director Joshua Levin about stark racial disparities. The matter: 'Council members criticized NYPD leadership over racial disparities in traffic enforcement after the department refused to acknowledge evidence of bias.' Restler called the disparity 'extreme.' Caban said, 'Black and brown people are being beaten up, searched, arrested, 10 times more than white people.' The NYPD claimed disparities stem from policing high-crime areas. Lawmakers rejected this, citing data showing Black and Latinx drivers are disproportionately stopped, searched, and arrested. The hearing referenced the city’s long record of racially biased enforcement, including jaywalking laws once used to target Black and Latinx New Yorkers. Experts, including the NYCLU, say the Adams administration’s surge in traffic stops continues a pattern of racist policing.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
