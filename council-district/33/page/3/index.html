Officers first noticed the vehicle due to stolen plates and tried to pull it over on Cropsey Avenue. The driver fled, leading police to set up a blockade.

Council Members Yusef Salaam, Tiffany Caban, and Lincoln Restler pressed NYPD Director Joshua Levin about stark racial disparities. The matter: 'Council members criticized NYPD leadership over racial disparities in traffic enforcement after the department refused to acknowledge evidence of bias.' Restler called the disparity 'extreme.' Caban said, 'Black and brown people are being beaten up, searched, arrested, 10 times more than white people.' The NYPD claimed disparities stem from policing high-crime areas. Lawmakers rejected this, citing data showing Black and Latinx drivers are disproportionately stopped, searched, and arrested. The hearing referenced the city’s long record of racially biased enforcement, including jaywalking laws once used to target Black and Latinx New Yorkers. Experts, including the NYCLU, say the Adams administration’s surge in traffic stops continues a pattern of racist policing.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The intersection saw 39 crashes from 2020 to 2024. The redesign includes a pedestrian plaza, narrowed roadways, and a ban on right turns onto Scott Avenue.

Police say Yarimi struck an Uber, flipped, and plowed into the family as they crossed the street. The boy remains in critical condition after losing a kidney. The article quotes City Comptroller Brad Lander: 'He is still in critical condition. He lost one kidney but they are hopeful about his prognosis.' Yarimi faces multiple counts of manslaughter and assault. The crash also injured an Uber driver and a second family.
