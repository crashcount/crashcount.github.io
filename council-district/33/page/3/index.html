Nineteen left with life-altering injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months, 776 have been hurt in 1,720 crashes. The dead include a 45-year-old woman crushed in the back seat of an SUV, a 49-year-old man struck by a bike, and a 74-year-old e-bike rider thrown from his seat and killed by a turning bus. The pain is not abstract. It is a son standing in the street, searching for his father. “I see him on the floor,” said Henry Tziquin. “His eyes were closed. I’m scared—I don’t know what to do” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/06/hit-and-run-driver-kills-brooklyn-restaurant-worker-in-front-of-son/>NY Daily News</a>.</p><p><strong>Hit-and-run drivers do not stop. They keep going.</strong> “He didn’t stop,” Henry <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/06/hit-and-run-driver-kills-brooklyn-restaurant-worker-in-front-of-son/>said</a>. “He just kept going.”</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> In the last three years, they killed five, left nine with serious injuries, and hurt 378 more. Trucks and buses killed two. Motorcycles and mopeds, one. Bikes, two. The streets are not safe for the old, the young, or anyone in between. <strong>Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians pay the price.</strong></p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has backed bills to redesign truck routes, daylight intersections, and build more protected bike lanes. He voted to legalize jaywalking and co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act. These are steps. But the blood on the street says it is not enough. The city can lower speed limits. It can ban parking near crosswalks. It can force the worst drivers off the road. <strong>Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</strong></p><h3 id=act-nowor-count-the-dead>Act Now—Or Count the Dead</h3><p><strong>Call Council Member Restler. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every crossing. Demand action, not words.</strong> The dead cannot speak. The living must. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report states the e-bike driver was 'unlicensed' and identifies 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as a contributing factor. The impact occurred at the center front end of the e-bike, causing severe head injuries and fatal bleeding to the pedestrian. The police report describes the victim as 'crossing, no signal, or crosswalk' and 'not at intersection,' but the primary focus remains on the unlicensed status of the e-bike operator and the disregard for traffic control. The narrative details a quiet night interrupted by the crash, with the victim left motionless on the pavement.
