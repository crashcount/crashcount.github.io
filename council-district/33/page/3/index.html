Forty-six seriously hurt.</strong> In the last three and a half years, District 33 has seen 6,601 crashes. The bodies pile up: 3,104 injured, many for life. The dead include a 49-year-old man struck by an e-bike on India Street, a 74-year-old cyclist crushed by a bus on Tillary, and a 46-year-old cyclist killed by an SUV on Lynch Street. These numbers are not just statistics. They are parents, children, neighbors. The street does not care who you are.</p><h2 id=the-politics-of-protection>The Politics of Protection</h2><p><strong>Leadership matters.</strong> Council Member Lincoln Restler has not been silent. He voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the vulnerable for crossing the street. He co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>require protected bike lanes</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>push for speed limiters</a> on dangerous vehicles. When Mayor Adams tried to rip out the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane, Restler called it &ldquo;a purely political decision to rip out a bike lane with no alternative&rdquo; and warned, &ldquo;He is going to make this area less safe for pedestrians, for cyclists&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/bedford-avenue-protected-bike-lane-removal/>CBS New York</a>).</p><p>Restler stood with advocates and parents in court, backing a lawsuit that stopped the city from removing the lane—at least for now (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/breaking-activists-sue-city-to-prevent-erasure-of-bedford-avenue-bike-lane>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><h2 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h2><p><strong>Every delay is a death sentence for someone.</strong> The city’s own numbers show that SUVs and cars are the main killers, but every mode—bikes, trucks, buses—has left blood on the street. The law says streets are for people. The reality says otherwise. The fight is not over. The judge’s order is only temporary. The paint fades. The barriers come down. The danger returns.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>Call Restler. Call the Mayor. Demand more.</strong> Demand real protection for the most vulnerable. Demand daylighted corners, protected bike lanes, lower speed limits, and enforcement that targets the reckless, not the walking. <strong>Don’t wait for another name to become a number.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report states she was 'crossing with the light' when a speeding e-bike struck her, causing 'severe lacerations' to her entire body. She remained conscious after the impact. The e-bike operator, described as unlicensed, did not stop at the scene. The police report lists 'Unsafe Speed' and 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' as contributing factors. The e-bike showed no visible damage. The victim’s action—crossing with the signal—is noted in the report, but the primary focus remains on the rider’s speed, improper lane usage, and lack of a valid license.

The bill, sponsored by Council Member Joann Ariola, claims residents need notice before losing parking. But DOT and street safety advocates slam the measure as a bureaucratic drag on urgent safety fixes. Council Member Lincoln Restler calls it 'additional hoops and hurdles' for street safety. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso says, 'I don’t know why we entertain any effort to stop or slow-roll safe street design.' Open Plans and StreetsPAC argue the bill props up car dominance and blocks safer, more sustainable streets. The bill could make it harder to move bike infrastructure off sidewalks, risking more sidewalk riding and fewer safe crossings for pedestrians. Similar bills (Intro 606, Intro 104) face the same criticism.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Council Member Robert Holden, claims to address a 'public safety crisis.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez opposed the measure, stating, 'The administration already has the tools to enforce against illegal [cycling] behaviors; a license plate is not necessary for enforcement.' Rodriguez cited data: 105 pedestrians killed by cars this year, versus six by e-bikes, mopeds, and scooters combined. He argued that street redesigns, not new bureaucracy, cut deaths and injuries. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams echoed this, noting that registration backers often resist proven safety fixes like protected bike lanes. Rodriguez warned the bill would waste $19 million and slow adoption of sustainable transport. He called for holding delivery apps accountable and redesigning streets, not targeting vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article, titled 'Opinion: Worried About E-Bike Safety? Make the Roads Safer First,' highlights the dangers faced by cyclists and pedestrians due to poor infrastructure. It supports Council Member Lincoln Restler’s bill to enforce bike and bus lane obstruction rules and backs state Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal’s proposal for employer-based delivery worker licensing. The piece states: 'Such proposals are heavy-handed and will deter and discourage e-bike ridership without effectively ensuring their safe operations on the street.' The author urges protected bike lanes, daylighted intersections, and moving Citi Bike docks off sidewalks. The message is clear: systemic fixes, not punitive measures, protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable. The law marks a shift: streets are for people, not just cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, not yet passed, awaits committee review and would take effect in 2029 if the city renews its contract with Lyft. The bill summary reads: 'Citi Bike members would not pay more than the MTA's intra-city transit fare for any e-bike ride under an hour or any non-electric Citi Bike ride under two hours.' Restler, the bill's sponsor, argues, 'Bike share is an essential part of transit in NYC. It needs to be affordable & accessible for all.' He criticizes the current model, where e-bike rides can cost up to $7.20 for a half-hour, far above the $2.90 subway fare. The bill would require public investment to lower fares, following models in Boston and Washington, D.C.

The bill, not yet numbered, will not take effect until the next contract in 2029. Restler, who called current fees 'out of control,' also urged the city to connect Citi Bike docks to the electrical grid. He said, 'What a silly system we have that's depending on hundreds of cars and trucks going around New York City to recharge our sustainable form of transit.' Restler’s push aims to make e-bikes accessible for working-class New Yorkers and reduce car and truck trips tied to battery swaps. No formal safety analyst note was provided, but the bill’s focus is clear: lower barriers for vulnerable road users and cut vehicle miles on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
