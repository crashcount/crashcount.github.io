Twenty seriously hurt.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, there have been 1,722 crashes, leaving 777 injured. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. A 45-year-old passenger crushed in a car on Flatbush. A 49-year-old man killed by an e-bike on Franklin. A 74-year-old thrown from his bike on Tillary. The street does not forgive.</p><h3 id=the-faces-behind-the-numbers>The Faces Behind the Numbers</h3><p>The horror is not abstract. &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/brooklyn-90-year-old-man-hit-run-rider/>said an eyewitness</a> after a moped struck a 90-year-old man in Brooklyn. The driver wore a mask. He hit the man and left. The city keeps searching for footage, for justice, for a reason. But the street stays silent.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most harm</strong>—three killed, 269 left with wounds. Trucks and buses killed two, bikes killed two more. Mopeds and motorcycles left dozens more battered. The old, the young, the ones on foot—they pay the price. <strong>Every crash is preventable. Every death is a failure.</strong></p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—and What Hasn’t</h3><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has backed laws to clear sightlines at intersections, redesign truck routes, and legalize crossing the street outside the lines—measures that chip away at the old order. He voted yes to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>redesign truck routes</a>, to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, and to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>. But the bodies keep coming. The pace is slow. The street is faster.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Restler. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people, not just promises. <strong>Every day of delay is another family broken.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

A mother and two daughters died. Her young son was left in critical condition. The driver faced charges. The street showed the scars. Mourners filled the night.</p><p class=mb3>The New York Times (March 30, 2025) reported a deadly crash at Ocean Parkway and Quentin Road, Brooklyn. Miriam Yarimi, driving with a suspended license, "barreled into a silver Toyota Camry" before veering into a crosswalk and hitting Natasha Saada and her children. Yarimi was charged with manslaughter, reckless driving, and other offenses. The Audi she drove had a record of 99 violations, including red-light and school-zone speeding tickets. Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said, "This was a horrific tragedy caused by someone who shouldn't have been on the road."

The impact occurred at the center front end of the e-bike, causing severe head injuries and fatal bleeding to the pedestrian. The police report describes the victim as 'crossing, no signal, or crosswalk' and 'not at intersection,' but the primary focus remains on the unlicensed status of the e-bike operator and the disregard for traffic control.

The report states the rider was 'partially ejected' and suffered 'crush injuries' to his leg, remaining conscious at the scene. The police cite 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Following Too Closely' as contributing factors in the crash. The motorcycle's point of impact was the left front bumper, colliding with the Jeep's center back end. The rider was wearing a helmet, as documented in the report. No contributing factors are attributed to the Jeep driver. The collision underscores the dangers when driver attention lapses and following distances vanish, leaving vulnerable road users exposed to devastating harm.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The report states she was 'crossing with the light' when a speeding e-bike struck her, causing 'severe lacerations' to her entire body. She remained conscious after the impact.

The e-bike showed no visible damage.

Council Member Erik D. Bottcher is the primary sponsor, joined by Julie Won, Jumaane Williams, and others. The bill prohibits standing or parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and mandates the Department of Transportation to install daylighting barriers at a minimum of 1,000 intersections per year. The law also requires citywide outreach and reporting. This measure aims to keep sightlines clear at crossings, a known danger zone for people on foot and bike.
