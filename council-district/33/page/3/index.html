Fifty-two were left with wounds so deep they are called serious injuries. These are not just numbers. They are bodies in the crosswalk, bikes twisted in the gutter, families waiting for a voice at the hospital door.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most harm.</strong> They killed three, injured hundreds, and left nine with life-changing wounds. Trucks and buses killed two more. Bikes and mopeds, too, have left their mark—two deaths, dozens hurt. No one is safe. Not the old, not the young. Not the man on the corner or the child on the way to school.</p><h3 id=the-latest-blood-on-the-asphalt>The Latest Blood on the Asphalt</h3><p>The violence does not stop. In March, a man was killed by an e-bike on Franklin Street. In April, a car turned left and crushed a child’s knee. In May, a BMW driver with alcohol in his blood killed a man on Bedford Avenue. The dead do not speak, but the street remembers. &ldquo;I had a six pack of Modelos and two drinks. I was driving the car by myself last night. It&rsquo;s my fault. After I hit them, I came home,&rdquo; the driver <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/12/hit-and-run-bmw-driver-who-killed-2-in-brooklyn-had-downed-beers-body-matter-found-on-car-da/>told police after one crash</a>.</p><p>Neighbors see the danger. &ldquo;Drivers speed on that stretch of roadway,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>one told reporters after a double fatal hit-and-run</a>. The city counts the dead. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has signed on to bills for safer truck routes, daylighting, protected bike lanes, and legalizing jaywalking. He voted yes to redesign truck routes and to end the criminalization of crossing the street <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>on the Council&rsquo;s legislative record</a>. He co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act and bills for speed humps, solar crosswalks, and more. These are steps. But the bodies keep coming.</p><p><strong>Every delay is another family broken.</strong> The law can change. The street can change. But only if the pressure stays on.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-no-more-waiting>Call to Action: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Call Council Member Restler. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit.

Police said Yarimi was driving about 50 mph in a 25 mph zone and ran a red light with a suspended license. She was charged with manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, assault, reckless driving, and other offenses. The article quotes survivor Shakhzod Ahmedova: "After the car crash, we just saw the car flipped over and two kids on the ground. We were scared."

The impact occurred at the center front end of the e-bike, causing severe head injuries and fatal bleeding to the pedestrian. The police report describes the victim as 'crossing, no signal, or crosswalk' and 'not at intersection,' but the primary focus remains on the unlicensed status of the e-bike operator and the disregard for traffic control.
