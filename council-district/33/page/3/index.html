One body. Again.</p><p>A 45‑year‑old passenger died at Flatbush and State just before midnight on Feb. 28, 2025. The record says “Apparent Death.” Two cars. One stopped. One moving. The woman never made it home. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>City data shows the crash</a> and calls it what it is: fatal.</p><h3 id=where-the-blood-keeps-spilling>Where the blood keeps spilling</h3><p>Since 2022 in Council District 33, at least <strong>18 people are dead</strong> and 3,469 are hurt across 7,327 crashes. Pedestrians took 556 injuries and eight deaths. Cyclists took 554 injuries and one death. Trucks and buses are a smaller share, but they killed three pedestrians. The numbers are from the city’s crash database. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>They are ours</a>.</p><p>The map is familiar. The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Brooklyn‑Queens Expressway</a> leads with two deaths and 605 injuries tied to it. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Tillary Street</a> and <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Flushing Avenue</a> stack serious injuries. Broadway too. The pain clusters. It doesn’t wander.</p><p>The worst hours pile up after dark. Death peaks at 1 a.m., 6 a.m., the school commute, and again in the evening — with three deaths at 7 p.m. and more at 10, 11, and midnight. The count rises when the light fades. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The city’s hourly ledger shows it</a>.</p><h3 id=whats-killing-people-here>What’s killing people here</h3><p>“Other” tops the listed causes for deaths and harm. It hides more than it shows. Inattention shows up next. Disregarding signals. Improper passing. Failure to yield. The sheet is blunt: people outside cars pay. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The contributing factors are logged here</a>.</p><p>On March 21, 2025, a man walking on Franklin near India was hit and killed by a rider on an e‑bike. The city file says the rider disregarded control. The victim died in the street. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The record is spare</a>.</p><p>On May 14, 2025, at Bedford and N 11th, a 50‑year‑old driver died after striking parked cars; a passenger was hurt. The file notes alcohol involvement for the passenger. No moral. Just a body and broken glass. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The entry sits in the database</a>.</p><h3 id=city-hall-motions-streets-still-hurt>City Hall motions, streets still hurt</h3><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has pushed changes at the margins. He voted yes on a law to put warning decals on taxi doors to cut dooring risk for cyclists. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>The bill passed on May 1, 2025</a>. He backed towing derelict cars faster to clear sightlines and space. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>That bill passed June 30, 2025</a>. He co‑sponsored a 60‑day deadline for school‑front safety devices. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>It’s in committee now</a>. He supports a pilot to ticket illegal parking by camera — owners pay when cars block crosswalks and bike lanes. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>His resolution urges Albany to act</a>.</p><p>On one Downtown Brooklyn plaza, police finally cleared years of illegal placard parking after complaints. They wrote 40 tickets, towed 10 cars. “Following community complaints… the NYPD Transportation Bureau and Council Member Lincoln Restler coordinated… to address the parking condition and clear the area,” the department said, as <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/24/police-finally-remove-cars-from-plaza-in-downtown-brooklyn>reported by Streetsblog</a>. The plaza belongs to people, not parked cruisers. For a day, it did.</p><h3 id=night-after-night>Night after night</h3><p>The log keeps its tone. At 8:30 a.m. on Aug. 19, 2025, a driver died on Henry Street after following too closely, the file says. A parked Mini was struck. She was 58. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The crash record lists the death</a>.</p><p>At 1:57 a.m. on July 3, 2025, a 55‑year‑old motorcyclist was killed on the BQE. The entry marks ejection, unsafe speed, and inattention. Helmet noted. Life over. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The database does not soften it</a>.</p><p>Since 2022, people on foot have been hit most by sedans and SUVs. Trucks and buses leave fewer cases but a harder edge: three pedestrian deaths. Bikes and mopeds add to the toll too. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The vehicle rollup tells it by type</a>.</p><h3 id=what-would-stop-the-next-one>What would stop the next one</h3><p>District 33 bleeds on the same corners and the same clock.

Harden the turns. Give walkers a head start.</li><li>Lock in camera enforcement against blocked crosswalks and bike lanes. Owner liability puts the bill on the plate, not the driver’s excuses. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>The Council resolution asks Albany to pass A.5440</a>.</li><li>Target the deadly hours with lighting and targeted enforcement at repeat hotspots. The nighttime ledger is clear. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The hourly data points to the peaks</a>.</li></ul><p>And the citywide moves that save the most lives: slower default speeds on every block, and speed limiters for the worst repeat offenders. The tools exist. The choice is whether to use them.</p><p>Lower the speed. Box in the repeaters. End the ritual.</p><p>Take one step today. Ask City Hall and Albany to act.

Council Members Yusef Salaam, Tiffany Caban, and Lincoln Restler pressed NYPD Director Joshua Levin about stark racial disparities. The matter: 'Council members criticized NYPD leadership over racial disparities in traffic enforcement after the department refused to acknowledge evidence of bias.' Restler called the disparity 'extreme.' Caban said, 'Black and brown people are being beaten up, searched, arrested, 10 times more than white people.' The NYPD claimed disparities stem from policing high-crime areas. Lawmakers rejected this, citing data showing Black and Latinx drivers are disproportionately stopped, searched, and arrested. The hearing referenced the city’s long record of racially biased enforcement, including jaywalking laws once used to target Black and Latinx New Yorkers. Experts, including the NYCLU, say the Adams administration’s surge in traffic stops continues a pattern of racist policing.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
