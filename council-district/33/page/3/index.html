Twenty-two seriously hurt.</strong> In the past year alone, 858 people have been injured in 1,877 crashes. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. A cyclist struck on Kent Avenue. A pedestrian killed by a turning SUV. A woman crushed in the back seat of a car on Flatbush. The street does not care who you are.</p><h3 id=the-recent-wounds>The Recent Wounds</h3><p><strong>Just this spring, a cyclist was killed on India Street by a man on an e-bike.</strong> The crash left the victim bleeding in the road, dead before help could come. In May, a driver slammed into parked cars on Bedford Avenue. One man died. Another was left with head wounds. The cause: alcohol, speed, and a city that lets it happen. The stories repeat. A child’s knee crushed by a turning car. A cyclist doored on Atlantic. Each crash a fresh wound, each wound a warning.</p><h3 id=leadership-small-steps-slow-change>Leadership: Small Steps, Slow Change</h3><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has moved on some fronts. He <strong>voted to require taxi door warning decals</strong>—a small step against the threat of dooring, but no shield against steel and speed. He <strong>co-sponsored bills to clear abandoned cars</strong> and to force bike-share companies to show safety rules. He stood with the community to crack down on illegal placard parking, helping clear the way for people on foot and bike. But the pace is slow. The danger is fast. As Restler said at a Council hearing, the racial gap in traffic enforcement is <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/29/council-pols-fume-as-nypd-disputes-report-of-racial-bias-in-traffic-enforcement>&ldquo;extreme&rdquo;</a>. The city still spends more time policing the vulnerable than protecting them.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>No more waiting.</strong> The dead do not get second chances. Call Council Member Restler. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand streets where a child can walk and live. The time for half-measures is over. The blood on the street is real. <strong>Act now.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The impact pushed the Camry aside and sent the Audi into four pedestrians—a mother and her three young children—crossing in the crosswalk. Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch stated, "This was a horrific tragedy caused by someone who shouldn't have been on the road." The mother and two daughters died; a four-year-old boy remains in critical condition. The Audi overturned. Speed cameras are present at the intersection, but the investigation continues. No criminal charges have been filed.

The report highlights systemic issues: delivery app pressures, lack of regulation, and a street design that encourages risky moves.

The impact occurred at the center front end of the e-bike, causing severe head injuries and fatal bleeding to the pedestrian. The police report describes the victim as 'crossing, no signal, or crosswalk' and 'not at intersection,' but the primary focus remains on the unlicensed status of the e-bike operator and the disregard for traffic control.
