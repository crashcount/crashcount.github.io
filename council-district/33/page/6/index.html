Forty-six wounded. In the last three years, District 33 has seen 6,548 crashes. <strong>Children limp home. Cyclists do not.</strong> A man steps from his car in Greenpoint. An e-bike runs the stop sign. He dies on the spot. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-by-e-bike-delivery-worker-who-blew-stop-sign-in-greenpoint-witnesses-say>“He died basically on the spot,” said Jack Collins.</a> The rider stays. No arrest. The street stays the same.</p><p><strong>SUVs, trucks, bikes, buses—each leaves its mark.</strong> Cars and SUVs killed five. Trucks and buses killed two. Bikes killed two. The rest are numbers, but each number is a life cut short. The city counts. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-bills-and-the-slow-grind>Leadership: Votes, Bills, and the Slow Grind</h3><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has voted and sponsored bills. He backed the law that ended jaywalking tickets, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>voting yes to legalize crossing wherever you walk</a>. He called for more slow zones, <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/speed-limit-lowered-dumbo-slow-zone/>praising the new 20 mph limit in DUMBO</a>: “Data has shown that a one mile per hour increase in speed results in a nearly three percent increase in mortality.”</p><p>Restler co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and raise SUV fees. He stood with advocates for speed limiters on repeat offenders. He supports the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane, even as party bosses <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/28/democratic-party-machine-joins-the-bikelash-on-bedford-avenue>try to kill it</a>. But the deaths keep coming. The bills sit in committee. The paint dries. The blood does not.</p><h3 id=the-work-ahead-no-more-waiting>The Work Ahead: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not. The council can pass daylighting, speed limiters, and real bike lane protection. It has not. The dead cannot wait. The living should not have to.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighting at every crosswalk. Demand action, not words.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Assembly Member Tony Simone submitted a state bill to double fines after the tenth violation, up to five times the current cap. The matter targets 'the worst repeat offenders of parking tickets.' Manhattan safe streets activist Jehiah Czebotar analyzed city data, finding that 77 percent of street-sweeping tickets go to repeat offenders, with 37 percent to drivers who got at least six tickets. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program expired last year, leaving a gap in enforcement.

The electrified dock pilot, meant to launch late last year, is months behind schedule. Bottcher wrote, 'I urge the Department of Transportation and Con Edison to expedite the electrification of [Citi Bike] stations for the purpose of charging the pedal-assist bikes.' Council Member Lincoln Restler of Greenpoint echoed the demand, calling the project 'an exciting opportunity' for better reliability. DOT claims to be working on it; ConEd says their role is limited. The delay leaves e-bike riders without charged bikes, as workers must swap batteries by hand. The new Lyft contract will double e-bikes, making efficient charging urgent.
