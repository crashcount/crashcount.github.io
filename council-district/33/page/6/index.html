Forty-six seriously hurt.</strong> In the last three and a half years, District 33 has seen 6,601 crashes. The bodies pile up: 3,104 injured, many for life. The dead include a 49-year-old man struck by an e-bike on India Street, a 74-year-old cyclist crushed by a bus on Tillary, and a 46-year-old cyclist killed by an SUV on Lynch Street. These numbers are not just statistics. They are parents, children, neighbors. The street does not care who you are.</p><h2 id=the-politics-of-protection>The Politics of Protection</h2><p><strong>Leadership matters.</strong> Council Member Lincoln Restler has not been silent. He voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the vulnerable for crossing the street. He co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>require protected bike lanes</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>push for speed limiters</a> on dangerous vehicles. When Mayor Adams tried to rip out the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane, Restler called it &ldquo;a purely political decision to rip out a bike lane with no alternative&rdquo; and warned, &ldquo;He is going to make this area less safe for pedestrians, for cyclists&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/bedford-avenue-protected-bike-lane-removal/>CBS New York</a>).</p><p>Restler stood with advocates and parents in court, backing a lawsuit that stopped the city from removing the lane—at least for now (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/breaking-activists-sue-city-to-prevent-erasure-of-bedford-avenue-bike-lane>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><h2 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h2><p><strong>Every delay is a death sentence for someone.</strong> The city’s own numbers show that SUVs and cars are the main killers, but every mode—bikes, trucks, buses—has left blood on the street. The law says streets are for people. The reality says otherwise. The fight is not over. The judge’s order is only temporary. The paint fades. The barriers come down. The danger returns.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>Call Restler. Call the Mayor. Demand more.</strong> Demand real protection for the most vulnerable. Demand daylighted corners, protected bike lanes, lower speed limits, and enforcement that targets the reckless, not the walking. <strong>Don’t wait for another name to become a number.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Riders face dead batteries, empty docks, and mounting frustration. The city promised a pilot last year. Still, the streets wait. The delay leaves e-bike users stranded.</p><p class=mb3>On February 29, 2024, Council Member Erik Bottcher called out the Department of Transportation and Con Edison for failing to deliver electrified Citi Bike docks in his Manhattan district. The electrified dock pilot, meant to launch late last year, is months behind schedule. Bottcher wrote, 'I urge the Department of Transportation and Con Edison to expedite the electrification of [Citi Bike] stations for the purpose of charging the pedal-assist bikes.' Council Member Lincoln Restler of Greenpoint echoed the demand, calling the project 'an exciting opportunity' for better reliability. DOT claims to be working on it; ConEd says their role is limited. The delay leaves e-bike riders without charged bikes, as workers must swap batteries by hand. The new Lyft contract will double e-bikes, making efficient charging urgent. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the lack of charged bikes keeps vulnerable riders off the street and in harm's way.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
