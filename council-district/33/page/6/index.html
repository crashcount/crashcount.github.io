Nineteen left with life-altering injuries.</strong> In the last twelve months, 776 have been hurt in 1,720 crashes. The dead include a 45-year-old woman crushed in the back seat of an SUV, a 49-year-old man struck by a bike, and a 74-year-old e-bike rider thrown from his seat and killed by a turning bus. The pain is not abstract. It is a son standing in the street, searching for his father. “I see him on the floor,” said Henry Tziquin. “His eyes were closed. I’m scared—I don’t know what to do” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/06/hit-and-run-driver-kills-brooklyn-restaurant-worker-in-front-of-son/>NY Daily News</a>.</p><p><strong>Hit-and-run drivers do not stop. They keep going.</strong> “He didn’t stop,” Henry <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/06/hit-and-run-driver-kills-brooklyn-restaurant-worker-in-front-of-son/>said</a>. “He just kept going.”</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> In the last three years, they killed five, left nine with serious injuries, and hurt 378 more. Trucks and buses killed two. Motorcycles and mopeds, one. Bikes, two. The streets are not safe for the old, the young, or anyone in between. <strong>Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians pay the price.</strong></p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has backed bills to redesign truck routes, daylight intersections, and build more protected bike lanes. He voted to legalize jaywalking and co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act. These are steps. But the blood on the street says it is not enough. The city can lower speed limits. It can ban parking near crosswalks. It can force the worst drivers off the road. <strong>Every day of delay is another day someone does not come home.</strong></p><h3 id=act-nowor-count-the-dead>Act Now—Or Count the Dead</h3><p><strong>Call Council Member Restler. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every crossing. Demand action, not words.</strong> The dead cannot speak. The living must. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the installation of solar-powered crosswalks,' orders the Department of Transportation to install at least 100 illuminated, solar-powered traffic control devices at crosswalks each year for five years—a total of 500. The department must also study their impact compared to unlit signs. Council Member Lincoln Restler leads as primary sponsor, joined by Menin, Brooks-Powers, Rivera, Won, Narcisse, Hanks, Hanif, Bottcher, Brewer, Hudson, Schulman, and Avilés. The bill was laid over by committee on June 25, 2024. No safety analyst note was provided. Vulnerable road users remain exposed while the city delays action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
