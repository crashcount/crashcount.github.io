Pedestrians took 556 injuries and eight deaths. Cyclists took 554 injuries and one death. Trucks and buses are a smaller share, but they killed three pedestrians.

Broadway too. The pain clusters. It doesn’t wander.</p><p>The worst hours pile up after dark. Death peaks at 1 a.m., 6 a.m., the school commute, and again in the evening — with three deaths at 7 p.m. and more at 10, 11, and midnight. The count rises when the light fades. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The city’s hourly ledger shows it</a>.</p><h3 id=whats-killing-people-here>What’s killing people here</h3><p>“Other” tops the listed causes for deaths and harm.

He supports a pilot to ticket illegal parking by camera — owners pay when cars block crosswalks and bike lanes. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>His resolution urges Albany to act</a>.</p><p>On one Downtown Brooklyn plaza, police finally cleared years of illegal placard parking after complaints. They wrote 40 tickets, towed 10 cars. “Following community complaints… the NYPD Transportation Bureau and Council Member Lincoln Restler coordinated… to address the parking condition and clear the area,” the department said, as <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/24/police-finally-remove-cars-from-plaza-in-downtown-brooklyn>reported by Streetsblog</a>.

Introduced April 18, 2024, the bill amends city law to require the Department of Transportation to consider where traffic enforcement agents are placed when drafting the interagency roadway safety plan. The bill summary states: 'require DOT to specifically consider placement of traffic enforcement agents in certain areas.' Public Advocate Jumaane Williams and Council Members Brannan (primary), Louis, Restler, and the Queens Borough President sponsor the measure. The bill responds to Local Law 12 of 2011, which already mandates a five-year safety plan. Now, the council demands DOT put enforcement on the map, aiming to cut injuries and deaths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Pedestrians win the right to cross anywhere, signals or not. The law strips police of power to ticket walkers. Streets shift. The city must now teach all road users the new rules.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0346-2024, now enacted, amends city code to let pedestrians cross streets at any point, even against signals. The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure passed it on October 26, 2024. The bill states: 'crossing against a traffic signal or outside a crosswalk will not be a violation.' Council Member Tiffany Cabán led, joined by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, Restler, Mealy, Louis, and Bottcher. The law bans summonses for jaywalking and orders the Department of Transportation to educate the public on new rights and responsibilities. The mayor returned it unsigned. This law removes a tool long used to target vulnerable New Yorkers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
