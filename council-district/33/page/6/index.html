Forty-six seriously injured. In the last three years, District 33 has seen 6,556 crashes. <strong>Children limp home. Cyclists do not.</strong> A man steps from his car in Greenpoint. An e-bike runs the stop sign. He dies on the spot. The rider stays. No arrest. The street stays the same.</p><p><strong>SUVs, trucks, bikes, buses—each leaves its mark.</strong> Cars and SUVs killed three. Trucks and buses killed two. Bikes killed two.

He called for more slow zones, <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/speed-limit-lowered-dumbo-slow-zone/>praising the new 20 mph limit in DUMBO</a>: “Data has shown that a one mile per hour increase in speed results in a nearly three percent increase in mortality.”</p><p>Restler co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and raise SUV fees. He stood with advocates for speed limiters on repeat offenders. He supports the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane, even as party bosses <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/28/democratic-party-machine-joins-the-bikelash-on-bedford-avenue>try to kill it</a>.

It has not. The council can pass daylighting, speed limiters, and real bike lane protection. It has not. The dead cannot wait. The living should not have to.</p><p><strong>Call your council member.

The company racked up over 60 reckless driving tickets—red lights, speeding, more. The Business Integrity Commission issued six violations since 2019. Yet, penalties remain minimal: a small fine for a hood ornament, missing paperwork. The driver in the latest fatality faces no charges, despite video showing the pedestrian had the right of way. Restler declared, 'We need much stricter oversight of the private sanitation and construction truck companies that are operating in New York City.' He added, 'Companies like Manolos Trucking should not be allowed to do business in New York City.' The company did not respond to requests for comment. Oversight is lax. Dangerous trucks keep rolling. Vulnerable New Yorkers keep dying.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Introduced March 7, 2024, it seeks to ban moving billboards in New York City. The matter title reads: "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to banning moving billboards." Council Members Erik D. Bottcher (primary sponsor), Justin L. Brannan, Gale A. Brewer, and Lincoln Restler back the measure. The bill would codify an existing rule—34 RCNY 4-12(j)—that already makes these billboards illegal. By writing the ban into the administrative code, the council aims to close loopholes and strengthen enforcement. No safety analyst note was provided, but the bill targets a known hazard: mobile ads that pull attention from the street and put vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Manhattan safe streets activist Jehiah Czebotar analyzed city data, finding that 77 percent of street-sweeping tickets go to repeat offenders, with 37 percent to drivers who got at least six tickets. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program expired last year, leaving a gap in enforcement.

The electrified dock pilot, meant to launch late last year, is months behind schedule. Bottcher wrote, 'I urge the Department of Transportation and Con Edison to expedite the electrification of [Citi Bike] stations for the purpose of charging the pedal-assist bikes.' Council Member Lincoln Restler of Greenpoint echoed the demand, calling the project 'an exciting opportunity' for better reliability. DOT claims to be working on it; ConEd says their role is limited. The delay leaves e-bike riders without charged bikes, as workers must swap batteries by hand. The new Lyft contract will double e-bikes, making efficient charging urgent.
