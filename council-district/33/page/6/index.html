Twenty seriously hurt.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, there have been 1,722 crashes, leaving 777 injured. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. A 45-year-old passenger crushed in a car on Flatbush. A 49-year-old man killed by an e-bike on Franklin. A 74-year-old thrown from his bike on Tillary. The street does not forgive.</p><h3 id=the-faces-behind-the-numbers>The Faces Behind the Numbers</h3><p>The horror is not abstract. &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/brooklyn-90-year-old-man-hit-run-rider/>said an eyewitness</a> after a moped struck a 90-year-old man in Brooklyn. The driver wore a mask. He hit the man and left. The city keeps searching for footage, for justice, for a reason. But the street stays silent.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most harm</strong>—three killed, 269 left with wounds. Trucks and buses killed two, bikes killed two more. Mopeds and motorcycles left dozens more battered. The old, the young, the ones on foot—they pay the price. <strong>Every crash is preventable. Every death is a failure.</strong></p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—and What Hasn’t</h3><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has backed laws to clear sightlines at intersections, redesign truck routes, and legalize crossing the street outside the lines—measures that chip away at the old order. He voted yes to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>redesign truck routes</a>, to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, and to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>. But the bodies keep coming. The pace is slow. The street is faster.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Restler. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people, not just promises. <strong>Every day of delay is another family broken.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Introduced on February 28, 2024, the bill orders the Department of Transportation to install 100 miles of protected bike lanes per year for six years. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the installation of protected bicycle lanes.' Lincoln Restler leads as primary sponsor, joined by Carlina Rivera, Farah N. Louis, Shahana K. Hanif, Chi A. Ossé, Gale A. Brewer, Tiffany Cabán, Sandy Nurse, Crystal Hudson, Yusef Salaam, Erik D. Bottcher, Jennifer Gutiérrez, Oswald Feliz, Julie Won, and Rita C. Joseph. The bill’s summary states protected lanes 'increase cycling and ensure the safety of New Yorkers.' If passed, the law will force the city to build real protection for people on bikes, not just paint. The measure aims to cut risk for cyclists and push back against deadly streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled 'A Local Law in relation to establishing a task force to study the feasibility of building charging stations for bicycles with electric assist to be used by food delivery workers,' calls for a task force to examine where and how to build charging stations for e-bike couriers. Council Members Restler (primary sponsor), Gutiérrez, Avilés, Won, Cabán, Marte, Hanif, Nurse, Hudson, Brewer, and Farías back the measure. The task force must review costs, possible third-party funding, station locations, and fire risks from lithium-ion batteries. The bill aims to protect delivery workers, who face daily hazards from unsafe charging and lack of city support. No votes have been held. The bill remains in committee.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The park could finally belong to people.</p><p class=mb3>On February 28, 2024, Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Council Member Lincoln Restler, with business leaders, unveiled proposals to remove the judicial parking lot at Columbus Park. The plan, discussed at a community meeting, would replace the lot with public amenities—open greenery, playgrounds, a skatepark, and restrooms. Architects from WXY presented four designs, all eliminating the judges’ parking. The proposal also calls for safer streets: protected bike lanes on Adams Street, expanded sidewalks, narrowed roads, bus lanes, and possible pedestrianization of Johnson Street. Council Member Restler declared, 'Parks should be for people, not for parking.' Residents voiced support, calling the lot a 'vestige of another era.' The officials will gather more public feedback before submitting a formal proposal. No timeline has been set.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the driver failed to yield the right-of-way. The report states, 'A Dodge pickup turned left. A 49-year-old woman crossed in the marked crosswalk. The truck struck her head-on.' The woman suffered fatal head injuries and severe bleeding, dying at the scene. The driver, a licensed man, was not injured and his vehicle sustained no damage. The police report explicitly cites 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as the contributing factor. The victim was crossing without a signal but within a marked crosswalk, as noted in the police report, after the driver’s error. The crash underscores the lethal consequences of driver failure to yield at intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
