Forty-eight suffered serious injuries. Over 3,100 have been hurt since 2022.</strong> The bodies are not numbers. They are neighbors. A cyclist, age 46, killed on Lynch Street. A 45-year-old woman, crushed in the back seat on Flatbush Avenue. A 49-year-old man, struck down by a bike on India Street. Each loss leaves a hole that does not close.</p><p>Last year alone, the district saw <strong>four deaths and eleven serious injuries</strong>. The violence does not slow. It does not spare the young. It does not spare the old. It does not care if you are walking, riding, or waiting for the light to change.</p><h3 id=the-scene-streets-built-for-speed-not-safety>The Scene: Streets Built for Speed, Not Safety</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do the most harm.</strong> They killed three people and injured 378. Trucks and buses killed two more. Bikes, too, have taken lives—two deaths, one serious injury. The street is a battlefield, and the most vulnerable pay the price.</p><p>The press tells the same story, again and again. A <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/04/hit-and-run-driver-mows-down-man-36-in-brooklyn-crash/>36-year-old man crossing near Broadway Junction</a> is struck by a gray Ford.

He voted yes to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>redesign truck routes</a>, aiming to &ldquo;improve safety, increase visibility, reduce traffic congestion, and reduce vehicle miles traveled.&rdquo; He also voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the vulnerable and let drivers off the hook.</p><p>But the bodies keep coming. <strong>Every delay, every watered-down law, means another family waits for news that will break them.</strong></p><h3 id=the-next-step-demand-more>The Next Step: Demand More</h3><p><strong>Call Council Member Restler. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand that every bill puts people first, not cars.</strong></p><p>The street will not change itself. The dead cannot speak.

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to use of force incidents involving police department use of a motor vehicle," forces the NYPD to add 'use of a motor vehicle to gain control of a subject' as a specific reporting category in quarterly and annual use of force reports. Council Member Lincoln Restler leads as primary sponsor, joined by Hudson, Won, Hanif, Bottcher, Brewer, Avilés, Abreu, Ossé, Krishnan, Williams, Cabán, Nurse, Sanchez, and the Brooklyn Borough President. The bill targets a gap: current NYPD reports do not name motor vehicles as a means of force. This change brings police violence by car into the light, exposing patterns that endanger pedestrians and other vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, discussed at a community meeting, would replace the lot with public amenities—open greenery, playgrounds, a skatepark, and restrooms. Architects from WXY presented four designs, all eliminating the judges’ parking. The proposal also calls for safer streets: protected bike lanes on Adams Street, expanded sidewalks, narrowed roads, bus lanes, and possible pedestrianization of Johnson Street. Council Member Restler declared, 'Parks should be for people, not for parking.' Residents voiced support, calling the lot a 'vestige of another era.' The officials will gather more public feedback before submitting a formal proposal.
