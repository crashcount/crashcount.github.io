This temporary closure, set through mid-August, aims to ease congestion for shuttle buses during the G train shutdown. The Department of Transportation banned left turns and blocked cars, opening the street to people. Council member Lincoln Restler said, 'Having an alternative use for this space during this period for the G train [shutdown] makes a ton of sense. It gives us an opportunity to see how it goes.' DOT spokeswoman Mona Bruno said the closure will 'enhance safety and create new public space.' The North Brooklyn Parks Alliance set up planters to keep cars out. A 2020 crash pushed locals to demand change. Over 2,000 signed a petition for a permanent plaza.

The matter, titled 'Cyclists call on DOT to fix ‘chaotic’ Kent Avenue bike lane in Brooklyn,' highlights chaos along the north Brooklyn waterfront. Restler is organizing local businesses to pressure DOT, demanding wider bike lanes and sidewalks, curb separation to block drivers, and safer pedestrian crossings. He says, 'If we really care about cyclists and their safety in New York City, then we should design and implement bike lanes that show it.' DOT spokesperson Will Livingston says the agency is reviewing the proposal but notes the city’s priority is elsewhere. Cyclists and pedestrians face daily danger: narrow lanes, illegal parking, and forced detours into traffic. No formal bill number or committee stage yet.

The move follows community rejection of ramp expansion plans. DOT Chief Strategy Officer Julie Bero said, 'it was well received that DOT would study closing the Queens-bound on-ramp at Atlantic Avenue, a request from many community members.' Council Member Lincoln Restler welcomed the study and pressed for immediate closure, stating, 'The community wants to see it closed now and I think it would make a big difference in improving safety on Atlantic Avenue and reducing congestion in that area.' The ramp, called 'one of the worst-designed ramps in New York City,' endangers pedestrians and cyclists and slows buses. DOT will analyze impacts as part of a larger BQE redesign, with construction set for 2029.

The Council's resolution, described as a 'home rule' message, aims to prevent the program from sunsetting and to improve safety for all road users. Restler stated, 'This will expand it to about 4 percent of intersections, and it will make our city safer.' Assembly Member Jeff Dinowitz called the expansion a victory, while advocates like Sara Lind of Open Plans noted no deaths at camera-protected intersections since 1994. Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers highlighted the need to ensure cameras improve communities and street safety, raising concerns about fairness in enforcement.

The narrative states, 'The front struck her. She fell, crushed and silent. Her whole body broken. The bus showed no damage. The street held her small, still form.' The report lists the pedestrian's action as 'Crossing, No Signal, or Crosswalk' and her location as 'Not at Intersection.' Both contributing factors for the driver and the pedestrian are marked as 'Unspecified.' The bus was going straight ahead at the time of the crash, and the point of impact was the center front end. The baby girl suffered crush injuries to her entire body and was found unconscious. The report does not cite any specific driver errors or additional contributing factors, but the collision underscores the lethal risk posed by large vehicles to vulnerable pedestrians, especially children.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Council members and advocates demand urgency. The mayor and DOT hesitate. Traffic deaths mount. The city faces a choice: act fast or let danger linger on its streets.</p><p class=mb3>On May 3, 2024, the City Council debated a new policy allowing New York City to lower speed limits from 25 mph to 20 mph on most streets, following a recent state budget measure. The measure, discussed in committee, requires a Council vote for citywide changes and a six-month warning period for drivers. Kamillah Hanks (District 49) was mentioned in the debate. Assemblymember Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas stressed urgency, citing recent deaths. Brooklyn Councilmember Lincoln Restler pledged to push the measure forward. Advocates like Transportation Alternatives called for a citywide approach, not piecemeal action. The Department of Transportation thanked lawmakers but did not commit to a timeline. The debate highlights the tension between urgent safety needs and political delays. Vulnerable road users remain at risk until the city acts.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states both vehicles were traveling east when they collided. The motorcycle rider, a 40-year-old man, remained conscious but suffered a crushed lower leg. His helmet stayed on. The SUV’s front left quarter panel was severely damaged. Police cite 'Reaction to Uninvolved Vehicle' as the contributing factor, highlighting a systemic hazard where sudden, unpredictable roadway events can trigger violent impacts. No driver errors beyond this are listed in the report. The focus remains on the chain reaction that left a vulnerable rider injured, underscoring the persistent danger for those outside steel cages on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Repeat offenders rack up most tickets. Lawmakers say dirty streets and blocked drains endanger everyone. The law would sunset in 2029.</p><p class=mb3>Assembly Bill (unnumbered) was introduced by Brooklyn Assembly Member Brian Cunningham on April 25, 2024. The bill is pending in the state legislature. It would allow New York City to mount enforcement cameras on street sweepers to ticket cars parked illegally during street cleaning hours. The bill summary states it 'fulfills the Sanitation Department's longstanding ask for help getting vehicles out of the way of road-cleaning operations.' Cunningham, who sponsors the bill, said, 'Dirty streets are totally unacceptable.' Sanitation Commissioner Jessica Tisch supports the change, noting that state law must allow automated ticketing. Uptown Manhattan State Senator Robert Jackson introduced a similar Senate bill. The law would phase in after a year and expire by mid-2029, giving officials time to assess its impact. No formal safety analysis for vulnerable road users was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
