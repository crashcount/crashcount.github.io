In District 33, the numbers pile up. <strong>Sixteen dead. Fifty-two left with serious injuries. Over 3,200 hurt.</strong> Each number is a body, a family, a life changed or ended. In the last twelve months alone, <strong>seven people died and twenty-three suffered serious wounds</strong>—the kind you do not walk away from. Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers: no one is spared.</p><h2 id=recent-crashes-lasting-scars>Recent Crashes, Lasting Scars</h2><p>Just days ago, a 90-year-old man was struck by a masked moped rider and left to die in the street. A witness said, &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open. It was a blue scooter. The driver had a mask. He hit the guy and he left.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/09/brooklyn-man-90-struck-by-hit-and-run-moped-rider-dies/>said a witness</a>. The killer did not stop.

It requires NYPD to launch a website giving crash victims and their families access to investigation updates, summonses, and witness information. The Department of Transportation must create a guide for collision victims, covering police reports and no-fault insurance. Council Members Lincoln Restler (primary sponsor, District 33) and Mercedes Narcisse (co-sponsor, District 46) back the measure. The bill was referred to committee and awaits further action.
