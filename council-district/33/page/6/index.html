He co-sponsored bills to remove abandoned vehicles, clear crosswalks, and boost plate enforcement. He pushed for daylighting—banning parking near crosswalks to keep sightlines open. But the pace is slow. The committee laid the daylighting bill over in April. The cars still block the corners. The danger waits.</p><p>Restler has also called out the NYPD for racial bias in traffic enforcement, calling the disparity &ldquo;extreme&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/29/council-pols-fume-as-nypd-disputes-report-of-racial-bias-in-traffic-enforcement>called out</a>.

He has supported crackdowns on illegal placard parking that blocks bike lanes and sidewalks <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/24/police-finally-remove-cars-from-plaza-in-downtown-brooklyn>supported crackdowns</a>.</p><h3 id=the-work-left-undone>The Work Left Undone</h3><p><strong>The dead do not care about decals.</strong> They need streets that do not kill. The bills are a start, but they are not enough. The corners are still blind. The lanes are still blocked. The speed is still too high. The city has the power to lower the limit to 20 mph. It has not used it. Every day of delay is another day a mother, a child, or a neighbor does not come home.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Parks should be for people, not for parking.&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/02/28/parking-or-parkland-brooklyn-judges-could-lose-their-perk>Restler said</a>.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Restler called the racial disparity in traffic enforcement &ldquo;extreme.&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/29/council-pols-fume-as-nypd-disputes-report-of-racial-bias-in-traffic-enforcement>Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Call your council member.
