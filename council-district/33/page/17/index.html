Forty-six wounded. In District 33, the numbers do not lie. Since 2022, there have been <strong>6,619 crashes</strong>, <strong>3,111 injuries</strong>, and <strong>15 deaths</strong>. The dead include a 49-year-old man struck crossing <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>India Street at Franklin</a>, a 46-year-old cyclist killed on <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Lynch Street</a>, and a 74-year-old e-bike rider crushed at <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Tillary and Jay</a>. Each crash is a life broken. Each number is a name erased.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the killing.</strong> Trucks, bikes, and buses took their share. The street is a gauntlet. No one is safe.</p><h3 id=the-politics-of-delay>The Politics of Delay</h3><p>The city ripped out three blocks of the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane this June. The mayor called it a response to &ldquo;community feedback&rdquo; after &ldquo;several incidents—including some involving children&rdquo; <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/adams-dot-remove-bedford-avenue-bike-lane/>said Mayor Adams</a>. But the numbers on Bedford are older and colder: nearly 700 injured, four pedestrians dead in just four years before the lane. The city replaced protection with paint. The risk remains.</p><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler did not stay silent. &ldquo;For months, the Mayor has repeatedly ignored our recommendations for ensuring the safety of children on Bedford Avenue. And now, instead of identifying solutions that enhance safety for pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers, the Mayor is making a purely political decision to rip out a bike lane with no alternative&rdquo; <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/adams-dot-remove-bedford-avenue-bike-lane/>Restler said</a>. He backed a lawsuit to stop the removal, filing an affidavit to keep the lane in place <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/breaking-activists-sue-city-to-prevent-erasure-of-bedford-avenue-bike-lane>in court</a>.</p><p>Restler has also co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and lower speed limits. But the city moves slow. The blood dries before the paint does.</p><h3 id=the-next-fight>The Next Fight</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every rollback, every delay, every shortcut has a cost. The dead do not get a second chance. The living must fight for theirs.</p><p><strong>Call Council Member Restler. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes that stay put. Demand that every child, every elder, every cyclist gets home alive.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Restler emphasized that the funding will harden bike lanes, replacing paint with physical barriers to keep cars out and protect cyclists.

Restler has previously called for eliminating parking placards entirely.

The new Department of Investigation (DOI) boss, Jocelyn Strauber, hesitated to confirm if placard abuse is a problem, despite a 2019 law requiring DOI and NYPD to investigate and report on the issue. Council Member Erik Bottcher pressed Strauber, citing resident complaints about fake placards and blocked curbs. Bottcher said, 'NYPD traffic enforcement agents are not issuing tickets to many people using counterfeit placards.' Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized the lack of a digital placard system and is drafting new enforcement legislation. Local Law 6 mandates weekly sweeps and monthly reports, but agencies have failed to comply. The Adams administration has not advanced citizen enforcement. The result: curb space remains dangerous and inaccessible for pedestrians, cyclists, and those who need it most.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Crashes follow. Council Member Lincoln Restler calls out illegal placard parking. He backs new laws and outside enforcement. Streets stay dangerous while police ignore the rules. Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On March 22, 2022, Council Member Lincoln Restler issued a statement targeting police placard abuse in Brooklyn. The matter, highlighted in the annual March (Parking) Madness contest, compared the 84th and 69th Precincts for their illegal parking practices. Restler said, "Placard permit holders and users of fake placards park illegally every day and it's simply the status quo." He noted, "These cars obstruct pedestrian space, endanger cyclists, and undermine safety on our streets." Restler supports legislation to reduce placard issuance and the creation of an independent enforcement unit outside the NYPD. Between January 2017 and February 2022, the 84th Precinct area saw 219 crashes injuring cyclists, pedestrians, and motorists. Police cars often took over sidewalks despite having two parking lots. The statement underscores how unchecked police parking endangers vulnerable road users and blocks safe passage.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Since 2019, 67 cyclists have been injured and 196 crashes reported. The letter urges the city to replace weak barriers, fix dangerous entrances, and finally deliver safety for vulnerable road users.

The push follows years of crashes—67 cyclist injuries and 196 total crashes since 2019—despite so-called 'protected' lanes. The matter, titled 'Activists and electeds ask DOT to add better barriers to Grand Street bike lane,' highlights how plastic bollards fail to stop drivers from blocking lanes, forcing cyclists into traffic. Restler, along with Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, State Senator Julia Salazar, and Borough President Antonio Reynoso, signed a letter urging Mayor Adams and Commissioner Rodriguez to act. The DOT has started hardening some lanes citywide, but Grand Street remains unprotected. Activists say, 'We knew the omission of protective jersey barriers would lead to dangerous conditions back in 2019 and we have witnessed that prediction come tragically true throughout 2021.'

The action is not a formal bill, but a policy stance led by Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Council Member Lincoln Restler. The group, including Council Members Jennifer Gutierrez, Crystal Hudson, Chi Osse, Sandy Nurse, Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Rita Joseph, and Farah Louis, demands that developers seeking zoning changes first apply for a special permit to waive parking requirements. Restler said, 'Developers need our consent and approval, and we are telling them, plainly, that they have to file for a special permit to end parking requirements.' Reynoso added, 'You don't need to do that anymore.' Avilés called parking mandates a barrier to affordable housing and climate action. The group argues that parking minimums raise construction costs, encourage car use, and block green space. Restler warned he is 'far more likely to vote no' on projects without a parking waiver.
