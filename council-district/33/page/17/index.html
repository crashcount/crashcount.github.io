Eighteen seriously hurt.</strong> In the past year alone, District 33 has seen 1,758 crashes, with 813 injuries and 18 people left with wounds that will not heal. The dead include a pregnant woman run down in Bedford-Stuyvesant, a cyclist crushed on Lynch Street, and a pedestrian killed by an e-bike in Greenpoint. These are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors.</p><p>On May 24, Tiffany Cifuni was killed after a driver rear-ended her, then ran her down as she tried to get a photo of the license plate. Her family <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/18/brooklyn-hit-run-pregnant-woman-murder-tiffany-cifuni-arrest-chaquasia-pigford/>vowed to seek justice for Tiffany</a>. The driver fled, leaving Tiffany’s body in the street.</p><h3 id=patterns-of-violence-patterns-of-delay>Patterns of Violence, Patterns of Delay</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the killing.</strong> In the last three years, cars and SUVs caused 3 deaths and 387 injuries to pedestrians. Trucks and buses killed 2, bikes killed 2 more. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The violence is relentless</a>. It does not care about the weather, the time, or the victim.</p><p>The city’s response is often slow, sometimes backwards. Just this month, the Mayor tried to rip out a protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue. Council Member Lincoln Restler fought back, calling the move <a href=https://www.bkreader.com/policy-government/mayor-orders-removal-of-bike-lane-on-bedford-avenue-in-brooklyn-10815696>&ldquo;purely a political decision&rdquo; that would &ldquo;lead to more tragic crashes.&rdquo;</a> Restler joined a lawsuit and helped win a court order to keep the lane—for now.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-pressure>Leadership: Progress and Pressure</h3><p>Restler has pushed for safer streets. He co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, legalize jaywalking, and speed up protected bike lanes. He backed the SAFE Streets Act and called for speed limiters on the worst drivers. But the blood on the street says it is not enough.</p><p><strong>Every delay, every rollback, every shortcut has a cost.</strong> The city still lets cars park at corners. Speeders still roam free. The most vulnerable—children, cyclists, the elderly—pay the price.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-no-more-waiting>Call to Action: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Call Council Member Restler. Call the Mayor. Demand action.</strong> Tell them to finish the job: daylight every corner, build real protection for people on foot and bike, and end the excuses. The dead cannot speak. The living must not stay silent.</p></div></div><div class="mod-contact tc"><h3 class="fw6 mb2">Fix the Problem</h3><button class="dib pv2 ph3 ba b--light-silver br2 bg-dark-gray white pointer" onclick='var el=document.getElementById("contact-card");el.classList.toggle("dn"),el.classList.toggle("flex")'>

The Department of Transportation will present its draft plan to Brooklyn Community Board 1’s Transportation Committee on June 30. The petition, described as a call for 'wider sidewalks and a wider median, a protected bike lane, and eliminating one lane of traffic in each direction,' follows the hit-and-run death of teacher Matthew Jensen. Gallagher stated, 'Our community is speaking loud and clear: no more deaths on McGuinness.' The campaign has support from Councilmember Lincoln Restler and Borough President Antonio Reynoso. The street, a busy four-lane truck route, has seen dozens of crashes and injuries in recent years.

The bill responds to mounting complaints—nearly 60,000 since 2010—over helicopter noise and pollution.

Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0501-2022 was introduced to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on June 2, 2022. The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to hazardous obstruction by vehicles and civilian complaints to the department of transportation for hazardous obstruction violations,' aimed to create a new civil penalty for vehicles blocking bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or hydrants within 1,320 feet of a school. The penalty: $175 per violation, enforced through the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings. Civilians, except city employees, could file complaints and receive 25% of collected fines. The Department of Transportation would support this with a phased-in reporting program and annual public reports. Council Member Carlina Rivera led as primary sponsor, joined by over two dozen co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law. No safety analyst note was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Lynn C. Schulman sponsored the bill, joined by Kagan, Hudson, Hanif, Abreu, Restler, Riley, and Sanchez. The bill would have forced the city to install these signals at no fewer than 400 intersections each year. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. No law passed.

The bill, now before the City Council, aims to crack down on placard abuse by city workers, which Restler calls 'petty corruption.' The matter summary states the legislation would force agencies to revoke most placards not protected by union contracts. Restler also proposed a bill letting New Yorkers report illegal placards and collect a share of fines. Street safety advocates back the move, saying, 'Ending placard abuse in New York City will make our streets safe, while ensuring bus and bike riders can stay moving—unobstructed by illegally stored cars.' The bill follows years of failed enforcement and mounting placard numbers. Restler’s action targets a system that blocks crosswalks, endangers pedestrians, and slows public transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, detailed in the media, will convert the painted bike lane to a two-way, parking-protected lane between Smith Street and Third Avenue. The street will become eastbound one-way for vehicles, with curb extensions, loading zones, and plastic bollards to block illegal parking. The DOT says the redesign addresses high injury rates from turning vehicles. Councilmember Lincoln Restler (District 33) publicly backed the project, calling Schermerhorn 'a disaster' for cyclists and naming its fix a top priority. The overhaul follows DOT surveys of local stakeholders. The project aims to protect cyclists and pedestrians on a vital route, with city agencies keeping parking and new loading zones for hotels.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, not requiring board approval, targets the stretch between Boerum Place and Third Avenue. DOT calls it a 'Vision Zero Priority Area.' The redesign converts the street to one-way eastbound, adds a two-way protected bike lane, and installs pedestrian improvements like Qwick Curbs and refuge spaces. Loading zones and left-turn bans aim to cut injuries. Since 2015, 555 crashes have injured 124 and killed one pedestrian. Council Member Lincoln Restler backed the plan, calling it a 'top priority' and 'necessary response' to deadly conditions. Former Council Member Steve Levin and advocates pushed for these changes for years. Some locals criticized Qwick Curbs as ugly, but DOT officials stressed the board's advisory role. The redesign does not address Hoyt Street, where illegal parking remains rampant.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
