Forty-six seriously hurt.</strong> In the last three and a half years, District 33 has seen 6,601 crashes. The bodies pile up: 3,104 injured, many for life. The dead include a 49-year-old man struck by an e-bike on India Street, a 74-year-old cyclist crushed by a bus on Tillary, and a 46-year-old cyclist killed by an SUV on Lynch Street. These numbers are not just statistics. They are parents, children, neighbors. The street does not care who you are.</p><h2 id=the-politics-of-protection>The Politics of Protection</h2><p><strong>Leadership matters.</strong> Council Member Lincoln Restler has not been silent. He voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the vulnerable for crossing the street. He co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>require protected bike lanes</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>push for speed limiters</a> on dangerous vehicles. When Mayor Adams tried to rip out the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane, Restler called it &ldquo;a purely political decision to rip out a bike lane with no alternative&rdquo; and warned, &ldquo;He is going to make this area less safe for pedestrians, for cyclists&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/bedford-avenue-protected-bike-lane-removal/>CBS New York</a>).</p><p>Restler stood with advocates and parents in court, backing a lawsuit that stopped the city from removing the lane—at least for now (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/breaking-activists-sue-city-to-prevent-erasure-of-bedford-avenue-bike-lane>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><h2 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h2><p><strong>Every delay is a death sentence for someone.</strong> The city’s own numbers show that SUVs and cars are the main killers, but every mode—bikes, trucks, buses—has left blood on the street. The law says streets are for people. The reality says otherwise. The fight is not over. The judge’s order is only temporary. The paint fades. The barriers come down. The danger returns.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>Call Restler. Call the Mayor. Demand more.</strong> Demand real protection for the most vulnerable. Demand daylighted corners, protected bike lanes, lower speed limits, and enforcement that targets the reckless, not the walking. <strong>Don’t wait for another name to become a number.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Activists like Sara Lind back the bounty, arguing, 'More reporting, more enforcement, will lead to fewer violations.'

An e-scooter went straight. Metal struck flesh.' The collision ejected the e-scooter rider headfirst onto the pavement, resulting in severe bleeding from a head injury. The victim was conscious but alone and bleeding in the cold. The police report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified' for both parties, but the narrative and vehicle actions highlight the sedan's left turn across the path of the e-scooter. The report notes the e-scooter rider was not wearing a helmet, but this detail is listed after the description of the driver's maneuver. No injuries were reported for the sedan driver.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Danger shifts.</p><p class=mb3>On January 10, 2024, the city completed a new busway on Livingston Street in Brooklyn. The project, not tied to a specific bill number, was led by the Department of Transportation and praised by Councilmember Lincoln Restler (District 33). The redesign turned a congested, two-way street into a one-way westbound corridor with two directions of physically-separated, dedicated bus lanes. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said the project 'transformed what was a congested, double-parked corridor into two-way fully protected and dedicated bus lanes.' Restler declared, 'Those days are over with the new Livingston Busway!' The project aims to speed up service for 50,000 daily riders and keep cars out of bus lanes with concrete boarding islands. While the article notes ongoing issues with illegal parking and citywide delays, the Livingston Street busway stands as a rare win for bus riders and vulnerable street users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Council Member Lincoln Restler, cleared the Council with a 32-15 vote. It reduces the waiting period after community board notification from 90 days plus 45 after a hearing, to just 14 days. The matter summary reads: 'The City Council repealed a decade-old law that imposed lengthy delays on the city before it could break ground on new bike lanes.' Restler said, 'No other transportation project in New York City...requires this type of extended dead period.' Council Member Keith Powers backed the bill, citing rising cyclist deaths. The Department of Transportation called bike lanes 'life-saving infrastructure.' The amended bill now covers all bike lanes, regardless of length.

He thanked DOT for acting to eliminate vending on the bridge, but called for more vendor licenses elsewhere. Vendors and advocates argued the ban is too harsh, urging specific rules instead of a blanket prohibition. DOT will review public comments before finalizing the rule.
