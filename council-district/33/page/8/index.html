Nineteen more suffered serious injuries.</strong> In total, 776 have been hurt in 1,715 crashes—each one a life changed or ended. The numbers are not just numbers. They are fathers, mothers, children. A cyclist, helmet on, killed on Lynch Street. A pedestrian, head struck, left bleeding on India Street. A woman, crushed in the back seat on Flatbush Avenue. The city records the wounds. The families live with them.</p><h2 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h2><p>The horror is not abstract.

The families do not.</p><h2 id=leadership-progress-and-gaps>Leadership: Progress and Gaps</h2><p><strong>Council Member Lincoln Restler has taken steps.</strong> He voted to redesign truck routes for safety, to legalize jaywalking and end victim-blaming, and to push for protected bike lanes and daylighted intersections. He co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act and bills to raise SUV fees, mandate speed humps, and boost pedestrian lighting. But the deaths keep coming. Laws are passed. The street stays deadly. <strong>Every delay is another risk.</strong></p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> The city can lower speed limits. It can ban parking near crosswalks. It can redesign every deadly intersection. <strong>But only if you demand it.</strong></p><p><strong>Call Council Member Restler. Call the Mayor. Call DOT.</strong> Tell them: No more waiting. No more names turned into numbers. The street belongs to the living.

Council Member Darlene Mealy sponsored the bill, joined by co-sponsors including Amanda Farías, Tiffany Cabán, and others. The council voted overwhelmingly in favor on April 27, 2023. The law requires the Department of Transportation, in consultation with the Department for the Aging, to annually install at least one traffic calming device in each designated senior pedestrian zone, with a minimum of fifty devices citywide per year. DOT must report installation locations to the council every year. The law aims to slow traffic and protect older pedestrians where they are most at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
