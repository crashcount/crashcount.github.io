The fight for safer streets and real transit continues.</p><p class=mb3>On February 7, 2024, the U.S. Department of Transportation rejected Mayor Adams’s request for nearly $1 billion to repair and expand the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The city sought $800 million to shore up the aging highway. The matter, described as a bid to 'maintain the structural integrity of the BQE,' faced sharp criticism. Council Member Lincoln Restler and advocates like Danny Pearlstein (Riders Alliance) opposed the plan, arguing it would worsen conditions for vulnerable road users and fail to improve transit. Jon Orcutt called it 'a bad project.' Community groups, including the Brooklyn Heights Association, withheld support. The federal decision halts expansion and buys time for a safer, more community-driven solution.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, supported by Council Member Lincoln Restler, follows a deadly crash that killed a 31-year-old woman. DOT crews installed crossings between Bond and Nevins, Hoyt and Bond, and Smith and Hoyt streets. The official matter summary states: 'Freshly painted crosswalks and new traffic signals will help slow down drivers and encourage more foot traffic and safe crossings.' Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called the crossings vital for safety. Restler applauded the move but demanded further action, especially near the site of the fatal crash. He said, 'Mid-block crossings are a critical step in making this dangerous corridor safer.' The new measures do not cover all danger zones. Atlantic Avenue remains a threat for pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city’s hand finally moves after years of blood.</p><p class=mb3>On February 5, 2024, Council Member Lincoln Restler announced new mid-block pedestrian crossings on Atlantic Avenue, Brooklyn’s so-called 'Boulevard of Death.' The crossings, between Nevins and Bond, Bond and Hoyt, and Hoyt and Smith streets, add crosswalks, traffic lights, and ramps. Restler said, 'These new mid-block crossings will create a greater sense of safety and community for Boerum Hill.' The Department of Transportation acted after Restler and others demanded change following the death of Katherine Harris, killed by a speeding driver. DOT’s study found hundreds of people crossing mid-block every weekend. Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called the project a way to 'enhance safety by better managing traffic.' Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon called the improvements 'a great step forward.' The city has finished installing signals and is completing ramps and crosswalks. Leaders want more: curb extensions, redesigned crossings, and further traffic calming. Atlantic Avenue remains a battleground for the city’s most vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary notes Restler's intent to remain active: 'I am reintroducing 501, the citizen reporting bill, and will push as hard as I can to get it over the finish line.' Restler has sponsored bills to curb illegal parking, speed up bike lane installations, and fight placard abuse. Despite his removal, advocates and colleagues, including Jon Orcutt, voiced confidence that Restler will continue to fight for pedestrian and cyclist safety.

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said the project 'transformed what was a congested, double-parked corridor into two-way fully protected and dedicated bus lanes.' Restler declared, 'Those days are over with the new Livingston Busway!' The project aims to speed up service for 50,000 daily riders and keep cars out of bus lanes with concrete boarding islands.

Projects for safer roads stall. Pedestrians and cyclists lose ground. City Hall favors drivers. DOT’s mission weakens. Council Member Restler calls it neutering. Streets grow deadlier. The process delays change. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On November 10, 2023, Streetsblog NYC reported that Richard Bearak, a City Hall land use official, is quietly interfering with New York City Department of Transportation (DOT) street safety projects. The article, titled 'City Hall Functionary is Quietly Interfering with Critical Street Safety Initiatives: Sources,' details how Bearak reviews and delays projects like McGuinness Boulevard and Underhill Avenue, often demanding changes that benefit private motorists over pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users. Council Member Lincoln Restler condemned Bearak’s oversight, stating, 'The Department of Transportation has been neutered.' Bearak, with no transportation background, was placed in this role by Ingrid Lewis-Martin, the mayor’s chief adviser. Officials say this process undermines DOT’s ability to deliver on the Streets Master Plan and the mayor’s promises, risking more deaths and injuries for vulnerable road users. The interference creates extra hurdles for projects already vetted by the public and experts, stalling progress and endangering lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill required the Department of Transportation to create a dedicated parking enforcement unit. Its summary: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the establishment of a parking enforcement unit within the department of transportation.' Council Members Christopher Marte (primary sponsor), Lincoln Restler, and Rita C. Joseph backed the measure. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote or enactment. The proposal would have targeted illegal parking, a key threat to pedestrians and cyclists. With the bill’s failure, enforcement remains fragmented. Vulnerable road users continue to face blocked crosswalks and bike lanes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law, sponsored by Gale A. Brewer with co-sponsors including Erik D. Bottcher, Lincoln Restler, and others, amends the city code to require the Department of Transportation to report on vehicles with license plates unreadable by photo violation monitoring systems. The law’s title states it is 'in relation to reporting on motor vehicles with license plates that are unreadable by photo violation monitoring systems.' DOT must post quarterly reports showing the time, location, and reasons plates evade cameras—whether by concealment, distortion, or missing tags. The law aims to expose drivers who dodge automated enforcement, shining light on a loophole that puts pedestrians and cyclists at risk. The reports must be public and sent to the Mayor and Council Speaker.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law states: 'The department shall prioritize and promote...the safety of all street users...and improving equity in infrastructure investment.' Sponsored by Kevin C. Riley (primary), with Brooks-Powers, Narcisse, Hanif, Brewer, Restler, and Rivera as co-sponsors, the bill demands DOT report, by neighborhood, on safety infrastructure investment, crash rates, and demographics.
