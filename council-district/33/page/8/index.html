The Department of Transportation (DOT) seeks to prohibit vendors from pedestrian paths, bike lanes, and bridge approaches. The matter, described as a 'span ban,' drew strong public support for restrictions. Council Member Lincoln Restler, representing Brooklyn, stated, 'I am a strong supporter of vending, but it should go in designated spaces... the Brooklyn Bridge is not the place for it.' He thanked DOT for acting to eliminate vending on the bridge, but called for more vendor licenses elsewhere. Vendors and advocates argued the ban is too harsh, urging specific rules instead of a blanket prohibition. DOT will review public comments before finalizing the rule. No timeline has been set.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
