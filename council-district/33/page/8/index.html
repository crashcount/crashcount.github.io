A BMW ran the red. The car did not slow. The men, Kex Un Chen, 80, and Faqiu Lin, 59, died where they fell. The driver sped away. Police found him later. He faces manslaughter and homicide charges.

The law requires the Department of Transportation to 'implement daylighting at a minimum of 100 intersections a year,' meaning no parking within 15 feet of corners. High-crash intersections must be prioritized unless deemed infeasible. DOT must also install physical daylighting features, such as planters or bike corrals, where possible. Council Member Farah N. Louis sponsored the bill, joined by Brooks-Powers, Hudson, Ossé, and others. The law took effect 90 days after enactment. DOT must report annually on locations and reasons for any exceptions.

It raised fines for businesses and ordered a study, then installation, of bollards. The bill aimed to keep sidewalks clear for people, not parked cars. Filed, not passed.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0900-2023 was introduced on February 2, 2023, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to enhancing penalties for sidewalk parking and installing bollards in M1 zoning districts.' Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary sponsor), Alexa Avilés, Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, Kristin Richardson Jordan, and Lincoln Restler backed the measure. The bill increased penalties for businesses parking on sidewalks in M1 zones—$150 for a first offense, $500 for a second, $1,000 for more. It required DOT to study and install bollards to block cars from sidewalks. The bill was filed at session’s end on December 31, 2023, without becoming law. The measure focused on keeping sidewalks open and safe for people, not vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
