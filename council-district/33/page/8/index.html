The dead do not get second chances. The living carry scars.</p><p>Just weeks ago, a cyclist was struck on McGuinness Boulevard. The driver turned, the bike lane was only paint. The city had promised protection. The city did not deliver. &ldquo;The fact is that this wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem if Mayor Adams had just done what he had promised to do, which was, make all of McGuinness safe,&rdquo; said Kevin LaCherra. &ldquo;The road diet works where it&rsquo;s been installed and it&rsquo;s needed for the entire corridor before this happens again.&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/20/cyclist-badly-hurt-on-segment-of-mcguinness-blvd-that-mayor-adams-refused-to-make-safe>said Kevin LaCherra</a></p><p>A few blocks away, a 74-year-old man was killed at Tillary and Jay.

It only cares who is bigger, faster, heavier.</p><h2 id=what-has-restler-done>What Has Restler Done?</h2><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has moved on some fronts. He voted to clear abandoned cars from crosswalks and sidewalks, a small step for sightlines and safety. He led a law to put warning decals on taxi doors, a warning for cyclists about to be doored. He co-sponsored bills for better lighting, faster removal of hazards, and more data. He pressed the NYPD on racial bias in traffic stops, calling the disparity &ldquo;extreme.&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/29/council-pols-fume-as-nypd-disputes-report-of-racial-bias-in-traffic-enforcement>pressed the NYPD on racial bias</a></p><p>But the blood keeps flowing. The bills are slow. The paint fades. The bodies do not.</p><h2 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h2><p><strong>Do not wait for another child to die.</strong> Call Council Member Restler. Demand protected bike lanes, daylighted crosswalks, and a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action that saves lives, not just headlines. The dead cannot call.
