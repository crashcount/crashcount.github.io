The park could finally belong to people.</p><p class=mb3>On February 28, 2024, Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Council Member Lincoln Restler, with business leaders, unveiled proposals to remove the judicial parking lot at Columbus Park. The plan, discussed at a community meeting, would replace the lot with public amenities—open greenery, playgrounds, a skatepark, and restrooms. Architects from WXY presented four designs, all eliminating the judges’ parking. The proposal also calls for safer streets: protected bike lanes on Adams Street, expanded sidewalks, narrowed roads, bus lanes, and possible pedestrianization of Johnson Street. Council Member Restler declared, 'Parks should be for people, not for parking.' Residents voiced support, calling the lot a 'vestige of another era.' The officials will gather more public feedback before submitting a formal proposal. No timeline has been set.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Activists like Sara Lind back the bounty, arguing, 'More reporting, more enforcement, will lead to fewer violations.'
