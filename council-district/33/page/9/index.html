Forty-six seriously injured. In the last three years, District 33 has seen 6,556 crashes. <strong>Children limp home. Cyclists do not.</strong> A man steps from his car in Greenpoint. An e-bike runs the stop sign. He dies on the spot. The rider stays. No arrest. The street stays the same.</p><p><strong>SUVs, trucks, bikes, buses—each leaves its mark.</strong> Cars and SUVs killed three. Trucks and buses killed two. Bikes killed two. The rest are numbers, but each number is a life cut short. The city counts. The city moves on.</p><p>The toll grows. Eight more crashes. Four more injuries. The numbers climb. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-bills-and-the-slow-grind>Leadership: Votes, Bills, and the Slow Grind</h3><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has voted and sponsored bills.

He called for more slow zones, <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/speed-limit-lowered-dumbo-slow-zone/>praising the new 20 mph limit in DUMBO</a>: “Data has shown that a one mile per hour increase in speed results in a nearly three percent increase in mortality.”</p><p>Restler co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and raise SUV fees. He stood with advocates for speed limiters on repeat offenders. He supports the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane, even as party bosses <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/28/democratic-party-machine-joins-the-bikelash-on-bedford-avenue>try to kill it</a>. But the deaths keep coming. The bills sit in committee. The paint dries. The blood does not.</p><h3 id=the-work-ahead-no-more-waiting>The Work Ahead: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not. The council can pass daylighting, speed limiters, and real bike lane protection. It has not. The dead cannot wait. The living should not have to.</p><p><strong>Call your council member.

Projects for safer roads stall. Pedestrians and cyclists lose ground. City Hall favors drivers. DOT’s mission weakens. Council Member Restler calls it neutering. Streets grow deadlier. The process delays change. Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On November 10, 2023, Streetsblog NYC reported that Richard Bearak, a City Hall land use official, is quietly interfering with New York City Department of Transportation (DOT) street safety projects. The article, titled 'City Hall Functionary is Quietly Interfering with Critical Street Safety Initiatives: Sources,' details how Bearak reviews and delays projects like McGuinness Boulevard and Underhill Avenue, often demanding changes that benefit private motorists over pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users. Council Member Lincoln Restler condemned Bearak’s oversight, stating, 'The Department of Transportation has been neutered.' Bearak, with no transportation background, was placed in this role by Ingrid Lewis-Martin, the mayor’s chief adviser. Officials say this process undermines DOT’s ability to deliver on the Streets Master Plan and the mayor’s promises, risking more deaths and injuries for vulnerable road users. The interference creates extra hurdles for projects already vetted by the public and experts, stalling progress and endangering lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill required the Department of Transportation to create a dedicated parking enforcement unit. Its summary: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the establishment of a parking enforcement unit within the department of transportation.' Council Members Christopher Marte (primary sponsor), Lincoln Restler, and Rita C. Joseph backed the measure. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote or enactment. The proposal would have targeted illegal parking, a key threat to pedestrians and cyclists.

The law, sponsored by Gale A. Brewer with co-sponsors including Erik D. Bottcher, Lincoln Restler, and others, amends the city code to require the Department of Transportation to report on vehicles with license plates unreadable by photo violation monitoring systems. The law’s title states it is 'in relation to reporting on motor vehicles with license plates that are unreadable by photo violation monitoring systems.' DOT must post quarterly reports showing the time, location, and reasons plates evade cameras—whether by concealment, distortion, or missing tags. The law aims to expose drivers who dodge automated enforcement, shining light on a loophole that puts pedestrians and cyclists at risk. The reports must be public and sent to the Mayor and Council Speaker.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

This stretch of Atlantic Avenue is notorious for deadly crashes. Council Member Lincoln Restler responded, stating, “Our community is unified in demanding immediate changes to dramatically slow down traffic, improve safety at intersections, and install new mid block crossings.” The incident marks the second fatal crash on this corridor in 2023. Despite calls from Restler and other local officials for mid-block crossings and traffic calming after previous deaths, the city has not acted. The bill or action is a public statement, not legislation, but it highlights urgent demands for redesign and enforcement to protect vulnerable road users. No safety improvements have been implemented yet.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The fight for real safety continues.</p><p class=mb3>On August 17, 2023, Council Member Lincoln Restler (District 33) joined other officials in announcing a compromise redesign for McGuinness Boulevard. The Department of Transportation's new plan, described as a 'compromised version,' adds protected bike lanes but keeps two car lanes during peak hours from Calyer Street to the Pulaski Bridge. The matter, titled 'Relief in Greenpoint as compromise reached on McGuinness Boulevard redesign,' reflects years of advocacy for safer streets. Restler, along with Borough President Reynoso and others, welcomed the changes and pledged to push for swift implementation. Advocacy group Make McGuinness Safe criticized the compromise as 'less effective and less safe,' blaming business opposition for watering down the original plan. The compromise marks a partial win for vulnerable road users, but falls short of the full road diet advocates demanded.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation (DOT) manages these paths but has failed to keep them clear. As one rider put it, 'They should maintain [it] so bikers who use it don't get whacked and don't need to ride in the middle of the lanes.' Council Member Lincoln Restler responded to complaints, tweeting that DOT would prune Kent Avenue’s bike lane 'next week.' The article, 'Too Green: City Neglects Overgrown Bike Paths,' details how weeds squeeze lanes to a single rider, forcing cyclists into traffic. Advocates urge regular maintenance and clearer agency roles, warning that neglect makes greenways unsafe for all who rely on them.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
