Forty-six suffered wounds so grave they may never walk the same again. The dead include a 17-year-old boy thrown from a moped, a cyclist crushed on Lynch Street, and a woman crossing Flatbush who never made it to the other side. The city calls them accidents. The families know better.</p><h2 id=the-faces-left-behind>The Faces Left Behind</h2><p>A brother remembers a man who &ldquo;never stopped working&rdquo; and &ldquo;was always passionate about the things that he did&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>said Francisco Mota</a>. A father buries his son. A child’s route to school is marked by blood on the crosswalk. <strong>Most deaths come at the hands of cars and SUVs.</strong> But bikes, mopeds, and trucks all take their share. The street does not care who you are.</p><h2 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h2><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has stood with the living. He backed the <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>SAFE Streets Act</a>, pushed for <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>protected bike lanes</a>, and fought to keep the Bedford Avenue lane from being ripped out by City Hall. When the city tried to erase that protection, Restler did not mince words: &ldquo;For months, the Mayor has repeatedly ignored our recommendations for ensuring the safety of children on Bedford Avenue&rdquo; <a href=https://www.bkreader.com/policy-government/brooklyn-cycling-advocates-sue-to-block-mayor-from-removing-bedford-avenue-bike-lane-10826886>Restler, via BKReader</a>. He filed suit to stop the rollback. He co-sponsored bills to daylight crosswalks, slow cars, and install speed limiters. But the blood keeps coming. <strong>Every delay, every watered-down law, every shortcut leaves another family in mourning.</strong></p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These deaths are not the weather. They are the result of choices. Choices made by people in power. Choices that can be changed.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected lanes that cannot be erased by a tweet. Demand that every repeat reckless driver is stopped before they kill again.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list. The street will not wait. Neither should you.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The proposal also calls for safer streets: protected bike lanes on Adams Street, expanded sidewalks, narrowed roads, bus lanes, and possible pedestrianization of Johnson Street.

Following the crash, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, Council Member Lincoln Restler, and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velázquez called for passage of two state bills: one requiring repeat speeding offenders to install intelligent speed assistance devices, and Sammy's Law, which would let the City Council lower speed limits. They also urged the Department of Transportation to install raised crosswalks and daylighting at intersections. Their statement reads: “Lowering the speed limit and enforcing real accountability for dangerous drivers are urgent steps we must take to protect New Yorkers.”</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the driver failed to yield the right-of-way. The report states, 'A Dodge pickup turned left. A 49-year-old woman crossed in the marked crosswalk. The truck struck her head-on.' The woman suffered fatal head injuries and severe bleeding, dying at the scene. The driver, a licensed man, was not injured and his vehicle sustained no damage. The police report explicitly cites 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as the contributing factor. The victim was crossing without a signal but within a marked crosswalk, as noted in the police report, after the driver’s error.

The bill, announced on February 8, 2024, removes prior compromises—no phased rollout, no mandatory training, no ID hurdles. The measure, previously stripped down in committee, now returns to its original form. The matter title: 'Prophet Motive: Restler Bill Would Restore 25% Bounty for Blocked Bike and Bus Lane Tickets.' Restler vows to push hard for passage, saying, 'This bill would make a tremendous difference in making our streets safer for cyclists and pedestrians.' Activists like Sara Lind back the bounty, arguing, 'More reporting, more enforcement, will lead to fewer violations.' The bill’s fate is uncertain after Restler’s removal from the Transportation Committee, but the intent is clear: shift enforcement from NYPD to the people, and clear the way for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
