Twenty seriously hurt.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, there have been 1,722 crashes, leaving 777 injured. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. A 45-year-old passenger crushed in a car on Flatbush. A 49-year-old man killed by an e-bike on Franklin. A 74-year-old thrown from his bike on Tillary. The street does not forgive.</p><h3 id=the-faces-behind-the-numbers>The Faces Behind the Numbers</h3><p>The horror is not abstract. &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/brooklyn-90-year-old-man-hit-run-rider/>said an eyewitness</a> after a moped struck a 90-year-old man in Brooklyn. The driver wore a mask. He hit the man and left. The city keeps searching for footage, for justice, for a reason. But the street stays silent.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most harm</strong>—three killed, 269 left with wounds. Trucks and buses killed two, bikes killed two more. Mopeds and motorcycles left dozens more battered. The old, the young, the ones on foot—they pay the price. <strong>Every crash is preventable. Every death is a failure.</strong></p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—and What Hasn’t</h3><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has backed laws to clear sightlines at intersections, redesign truck routes, and legalize crossing the street outside the lines—measures that chip away at the old order. He voted yes to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>redesign truck routes</a>, to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, and to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>. But the bodies keep coming. The pace is slow. The street is faster.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Restler. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people, not just promises. <strong>Every day of delay is another family broken.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to enhancing penalties for sidewalk parking and installing bollards in M1 zoning districts.' Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary sponsor), Alexa Avilés, Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, Kristin Richardson Jordan, and Lincoln Restler backed the measure. The bill increased penalties for businesses parking on sidewalks in M1 zones—$150 for a first offense, $500 for a second, $1,000 for more. It required DOT to study and install bollards to block cars from sidewalks. The bill was filed at session’s end on December 31, 2023, without becoming law. The measure focused on keeping sidewalks open and safe for people, not vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
