Forty-six wounded. In the last three years, District 33 has seen 6,548 crashes. <strong>Children limp home. Cyclists do not.</strong> A man steps from his car in Greenpoint. An e-bike runs the stop sign. He dies on the spot. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-by-e-bike-delivery-worker-who-blew-stop-sign-in-greenpoint-witnesses-say>“He died basically on the spot,” said Jack Collins.</a> The rider stays. No arrest. The street stays the same.</p><p><strong>SUVs, trucks, bikes, buses—each leaves its mark.</strong> Cars and SUVs killed five. Trucks and buses killed two. Bikes killed two. The rest are numbers, but each number is a life cut short. The city counts. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-bills-and-the-slow-grind>Leadership: Votes, Bills, and the Slow Grind</h3><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has voted and sponsored bills. He backed the law that ended jaywalking tickets, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>voting yes to legalize crossing wherever you walk</a>. He called for more slow zones, <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/speed-limit-lowered-dumbo-slow-zone/>praising the new 20 mph limit in DUMBO</a>: “Data has shown that a one mile per hour increase in speed results in a nearly three percent increase in mortality.”</p><p>Restler co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and raise SUV fees. He stood with advocates for speed limiters on repeat offenders. He supports the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane, even as party bosses <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/28/democratic-party-machine-joins-the-bikelash-on-bedford-avenue>try to kill it</a>. But the deaths keep coming. The bills sit in committee. The paint dries. The blood does not.</p><h3 id=the-work-ahead-no-more-waiting>The Work Ahead: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not. The council can pass daylighting, speed limiters, and real bike lane protection. It has not. The dead cannot wait. The living should not have to.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighting at every crosswalk. Demand action, not words.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The resolution urges the New York State Legislature and Governor to pass A.5001-A/S.2515-B, which would require scramble crosswalks at intersections near schools during student arrival and dismissal. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, A.5001-A/S.2515-B, in relation to establishing scramble crosswalks leading to and from school buildings during times of student arrival and dismissal.' Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary), Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, Lincoln Restler, and Kevin C. Riley sponsored the measure. The bill responds to persistent crashes near schools and the loss of hundreds of crossing guards. Scramble crosswalks, also called Barnes Dances, stop all traffic so pedestrians cross in every direction.

The letter urges DOT to 'ensure curb lanes be preserved for safe cyclist passage' and to 'deploy quick-build physical elements' for pedestrian safety. DOT has not responded.

The law requires 150 miles of protected bus lanes and 250 miles of protected bike lanes by 2026. In 2022, the city built only 4.4 miles of bus lanes and 26.3 miles of bike lanes, far short of the legal benchmarks.

The Department of Transportation (DOT) manages these paths but has failed to keep them clear. As one rider put it, 'They should maintain [it] so bikers who use it don't get whacked and don't need to ride in the middle of the lanes.' Council Member Lincoln Restler responded to complaints, tweeting that DOT would prune Kent Avenue’s bike lane 'next week.' The article, 'Too Green: City Neglects Overgrown Bike Paths,' details how weeds squeeze lanes to a single rider, forcing cyclists into traffic. Advocates urge regular maintenance and clearer agency roles, warning that neglect makes greenways unsafe for all who rely on them.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No one is satisfied.</p><p class=mb3>On August 16, 2023, Mayor Adams announced a compromise redesign for McGuinness Boulevard, a notorious Brooklyn corridor. The Department of Transportation will install curbside protected bike lanes and reduce car lanes from two to one in each direction on most of the strip. However, north of Calyer Street, two lanes for cars will remain open during weekdays, reverting to parking lanes at night and on weekends. The plan, shaped after lobbying by business interests and mayoral adviser Ingrid Lewis-Martin, mixes two previous DOT proposals. Mayoral spokesman Charles Lutvak said, 'Traffic safety is a key priority for Mayor Adams, and we are delivering with a redesign of McGuinness Boulevard that will make this corridor safer for all road users.' Local officials, including Council Member Lincoln Restler, called it a 'critical step' but noted it lacks key safety elements. The compromise leaves gaps. Since 2021, 62 people have been injured on this stretch. The carnage continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

This action addresses a coverage gap that has existed since Citi Bike’s 2013 arrival in the area. The matter, described as closing the 'black hat black hole,' faces resistance from some community members, but data show high demand and low car ownership. Council Member Lincoln Restler, a strong supporter, stated, 'I have been working with DOT to help expand access to Citi Bike for South Williamsburg residents.' He praised DOT’s outreach and progress. Despite the expansion, a significant part of the neighborhood will remain without Citi Bike access. Political resistance has slowed progress, but the new docks mark a step forward for vulnerable road users who rely on safe, affordable transportation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal, by Edison Properties, would add 95 parking spaces. Dan Garodnick, chair of the City Planning Commission, called the site 'ideal for housing.' Council Member Lincoln Restler, who represents the area, stated he is an unequivocal 'no' on the expansion and wants a use that benefits the community. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso urged the city to discourage private vehicles, citing high pedestrian traffic and strong transit access. City Planning Commissioner Juan Camilo Osorio highlighted policies to cut car use and decarbonize the city. Officials warn that more parking means more cars and more danger for people walking and biking, especially after a major bike lane was added to Schermerhorn Street.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
