Forty-six left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 3,100 hurt since 2022. The dead include a 49-year-old man struck by an e-bike on India Street, a 45-year-old woman crushed as a passenger on Flatbush, and a 46-year-old cyclist killed on Lynch Street. Each number is a name, a family, a hole in the world.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs are the main threat.</strong> Three killed by SUVs or sedans. Two more by trucks. Two by bikes. The violence is steady. It does not care if you are walking, riding, or waiting for a light to change. It comes for the young and the old. It comes for children. It comes for you.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-the-battle-for-bedford-avenue>Leadership: Words, Laws, and the Battle for Bedford Avenue</h3><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has not been silent. He has voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable for crossing the street (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Restler votes yes to legalize jaywalking, improving overall pedestrian safety</a>). He has backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and support 20 MPH slow zones. He stood with advocates when the mayor tried to rip out the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane. &ldquo;For months, the Mayor has repeatedly ignored our recommendations for ensuring the safety of children on Bedford Avenue. And now, instead of identifying solutions that enhance safety for pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers, the Mayor is making a purely political decision to rip out a bike lane with no alternative,&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/adams-dot-remove-bedford-avenue-bike-lane/>Restler said</a>).</p><p>When the city tried to erase the lane, a judge stopped them. The fight is not over. The lane stands, for now. But the threat remains. &ldquo;Tearing out portions of the Bedford Avenue bike lane will only make our streets more dangerous for everyone who uses them, including children,&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/18/breaking-judge-halts-mayor-adamss-plan-to-tear-out-bedford-av-bike-lane>said Baruch Herzfeld</a>).</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>The carnage is not fate.</strong> It is policy. It is choice. Every day without change is another day of blood on the street. <strong>Call your council member. Demand daylighted corners. Demand protected lanes. Demand a 20 MPH speed limit. Demand action.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name to become a number. The street will not wait for you.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Restler, the sponsor, said, 'We have illegal placard activities on every block, and it actually makes our streets unsafe.' The bills target the rampant abuse that blocks intersections, sidewalks, and bike lanes, especially in Downtown Brooklyn.

The legislation, not yet passed or assigned to a committee, is described as a response to 'petty corruption' that endangers pedestrians, people with disabilities, and cyclists. Restler said, 'It is petty corruption and it makes our streets unsafe for a parent walking with a stroller, for a person with a wheelchair, for a cyclist.' The first bill would sharply restrict city agencies from issuing parking permits for private cars, with narrow exemptions. The second would empower civilians to report cars blocking bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or hydrants, creating a $175 fine and a reward for reporters.

Cyclists and walkers have waited too long.</p><p class=mb3>On May 17, 2022, the Department of Transportation (DOT) unveiled a redesign plan for Schermerhorn Street, a notorious crash corridor in Downtown Brooklyn. The plan, presented to the community board, proposes making Schermerhorn one-way between Smith Street and Third Avenue, installing a two-way protected bike lane, and moving the existing painted lane to the south side. DOT spokesperson Vincent Barone called it a 'holistic approach to address traffic and bicycle safety.' Council Member Lincoln Restler said, 'Getting this has been a top priority across the district.' Former Council Member Stephen Levin and advocates have long pushed for these changes, especially to stop NYPD from blocking bike lanes. Advocates like Brian Howald and Jon Orcutt stress the need for robust, physical protection—not just paint or flexible posts—to keep drivers out. Since 2015, 555 crashes have injured 124 people and killed one pedestrian on this stretch. The plan aims to end the lawless status quo and protect the most vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
