Forty-six seriously hurt.</strong> In the last three and a half years, District 33 has seen 6,601 crashes. The bodies pile up: 3,104 injured, many for life. The dead include a 49-year-old man struck by an e-bike on India Street, a 74-year-old cyclist crushed by a bus on Tillary, and a 46-year-old cyclist killed by an SUV on Lynch Street. These numbers are not just statistics. They are parents, children, neighbors. The street does not care who you are.</p><h2 id=the-politics-of-protection>The Politics of Protection</h2><p><strong>Leadership matters.</strong> Council Member Lincoln Restler has not been silent. He voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the vulnerable for crossing the street. He co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>require protected bike lanes</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>push for speed limiters</a> on dangerous vehicles. When Mayor Adams tried to rip out the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane, Restler called it &ldquo;a purely political decision to rip out a bike lane with no alternative&rdquo; and warned, &ldquo;He is going to make this area less safe for pedestrians, for cyclists&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/bedford-avenue-protected-bike-lane-removal/>CBS New York</a>).</p><p>Restler stood with advocates and parents in court, backing a lawsuit that stopped the city from removing the lane—at least for now (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/breaking-activists-sue-city-to-prevent-erasure-of-bedford-avenue-bike-lane>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><h2 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h2><p><strong>Every delay is a death sentence for someone.</strong> The city’s own numbers show that SUVs and cars are the main killers, but every mode—bikes, trucks, buses—has left blood on the street. The law says streets are for people. The reality says otherwise. The fight is not over. The judge’s order is only temporary. The paint fades. The barriers come down. The danger returns.</p><h2 id=what-you-can-do>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>Call Restler. Call the Mayor. Demand more.</strong> Demand real protection for the most vulnerable. Demand daylighted corners, protected bike lanes, lower speed limits, and enforcement that targets the reckless, not the walking. <strong>Don’t wait for another name to become a number.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Restler, the sponsor, said, 'We have illegal placard activities on every block, and it actually makes our streets unsafe.' The bills target the rampant abuse that blocks intersections, sidewalks, and bike lanes, especially in Downtown Brooklyn. The civilian enforcement bill would let New Yorkers report violations and collect a share of fines. Transportation advocates back the effort, calling placard abuse 'city-approved corruption.'

The legislation, not yet passed or assigned to a committee, is described as a response to 'petty corruption' that endangers pedestrians, people with disabilities, and cyclists. Restler said, 'It is petty corruption and it makes our streets unsafe for a parent walking with a stroller, for a person with a wheelchair, for a cyclist.' The first bill would sharply restrict city agencies from issuing parking permits for private cars, with narrow exemptions. The second would empower civilians to report cars blocking bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or hydrants, creating a $175 fine and a reward for reporters. Restler’s district, including Downtown Brooklyn, suffers from rampant placard abuse.

Cyclists and walkers have waited too long.</p><p class=mb3>On May 17, 2022, the Department of Transportation (DOT) unveiled a redesign plan for Schermerhorn Street, a notorious crash corridor in Downtown Brooklyn. The plan, presented to the community board, proposes making Schermerhorn one-way between Smith Street and Third Avenue, installing a two-way protected bike lane, and moving the existing painted lane to the south side. DOT spokesperson Vincent Barone called it a 'holistic approach to address traffic and bicycle safety.' Council Member Lincoln Restler said, 'Getting this has been a top priority across the district.' Former Council Member Stephen Levin and advocates have long pushed for these changes, especially to stop NYPD from blocking bike lanes. Advocates like Brian Howald and Jon Orcutt stress the need for robust, physical protection—not just paint or flexible posts—to keep drivers out. Since 2015, 555 crashes have injured 124 people and killed one pedestrian on this stretch. The plan aims to end the lawless status quo and protect the most vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
