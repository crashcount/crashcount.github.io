The plan, discussed in committee, seeks to reduce or eliminate parking minimums for new developments. The matter summary states the proposal will 'prioritize people over parking, aiming to make streets safer and reduce parking requirements to enable more housing and amenities.' Restler said, 'In urban hubs like Lower Manhattan, the heart of the South Bronx, Downtown Brooklyn or Downtown Jamaica, we need affordable housing, economic development with good jobs, and dynamic mixed use buildings, not more parking.' The bill has drawn support from advocates and developers, who argue that parking mandates drive up housing costs and disrupt pedestrian-friendly streets. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams remained noncommittal, focusing on the housing crisis and bureaucracy.

Councilmember Restler pushed for this change.</p><p class=mb3>On October 12, 2022, the Department of Transportation held a ribbon-cutting for the new protected bike lane on Schermerhorn Street in Brooklyn's District 33. The overhaul converted the street to one-way eastbound and installed a two-way, parking-protected bike lane. The matter summary reads: 'DOT cuts ribbon on newly fortified Schermerhorn Street bike lane.' Councilmember Lincoln Restler, who championed the redesign, attended the event and called it 'a great friggin day for Brooklyn.' The old lanes were unprotected and blocked by double-parked cars, forcing cyclists into traffic. Since 2012, 29 cyclists have been injured and one killed along this stretch. The new design separates cyclists from vehicles, aiming to end the danger that plagued this busy corridor.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists now ride behind parked cars, shielded from traffic. Councilmember Lincoln Restler pushed for the overhaul after years of crashes and blocked lanes. Safety comes first.</p><p class=mb3>On October 12, 2022, the Department of Transportation opened a fortified, two-way protected bike lane on Schermerhorn Street in Brooklyn’s District 33. The project, championed by Councilmember Lincoln Restler, followed years of complaints about blocked, unprotected lanes and frequent crashes. The matter, described as a 'complete transformation of the look and feel of the corridor,' converted Schermerhorn from a chaotic two-way street to a one-way with parking-protected bike lanes. Restler, who once failed to ride the stretch without leaving the lane due to illegal parking, called the redesign 'real safety in downtown Brooklyn.' DOT data shows 29 cyclists injured and one killed on this stretch since 2012. The overhaul separates cyclists from moving vehicles, reducing risk for Brooklyn’s most vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, now under committee review, proposes a civilian reporting and reward program for illegal parking enforcement. The bill summary states: 'New York City is considering a policy that would pay people up to $44 for each actionable tip about cars illegally blocking bike lanes and intersections.' Restler, the sole sponsor, said, 'Too many parents with strollers, people in wheelchairs and bicyclists face unsafe conditions every day because of sidewalks and bike lanes obstructed by illegal parking.' The bill would empower the Department of Transportation to enlist civilians to flag violators, with a 25% share of fines as reward. The NYPD opposes the plan, warning it could pit neighbor against neighbor and outsource risk to civilians. The bill aims to protect vulnerable road users by targeting hazardous obstructions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Lincoln Restler said, “We have not seen adequate enforcement of illegal parking in the 84 and across the city.” Former Council Member Steve Levin called the violations serious and demanded accountability. Advocates and officials question if Rana’s behavior shapes a culture that endangers pedestrians and cyclists. The NYPD and Rana declined comment.

The cyclist, a 39-year-old man, was ejected and landed head first, suffering severe bleeding and a head injury. According to the police report, 'Traffic control was ignored.' The sedan's driver and another occupant were not reported injured. The crash data lists 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as the contributing factor. The cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this is noted only after the driver's failure to obey traffic controls. The impact left the cyclist conscious but gravely hurt, bleeding on the street.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Seniors get top priority. Non-NYCHA emergencies still jump the queue. The bill died at session’s end. Broken walks remain. Vulnerable tenants wait. Streets stay rough. Danger lingers.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0604-2022 was introduced on August 11, 2022, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill aimed to 'establish priority for sidewalk repairs at developments operated by the New York City Housing Authority,' giving first priority to senior-only NYCHA buildings, then to other NYCHA sites. Emergencies at non-NYCHA properties could override this order, with required notification to local officials. The bill required DOT to report on completed and pending NYCHA sidewalk repairs by June 30, 2023. Council Member Alexa Avilés sponsored the bill, joined by Abreu, Brooks-Powers, Restler, Hanif, Won, Nurse, Gutiérrez, and Sanchez. The measure was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without enactment. Sidewalk hazards at NYCHA developments persist, leaving vulnerable residents exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city moves to act, despite driver backlash and parking fears.</p><p class=mb3>On August 9, 2022, Councilmember Mercedes Narcisse (District 46) endorsed the Flatbush Avenue dedicated bus lane proposal. The plan, a priority for the Adams administration and MTA, aims to speed up the B41 bus from Downtown Brooklyn to Marine Park. Narcisse and Councilmember Rita Joseph joined Mayor Eric Adams at a press conference, riding the B41 and speaking with riders. Narcisse said, “People are suffering waiting 30 minutes, 40 minutes, it’s unfair to the riders.” She stressed that better bus service could cut down on illegal dollar vans. The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, has started community engagement. Some community boards worry about lost parking, but Rodriguez called their role advisory, saying, “we want to hear what the riders want.” Narcisse acknowledged driver backlash but insisted on the need for faster, reliable transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

NYPD agents hesitated, citing placard privilege and jurisdiction. Only after pressure did they issue a ticket. Council Member Restler now pushes a bill for citizen enforcement.</p><p class=mb3>Council Member Lincoln Restler has revived a bill that would let the public directly ticket cars for parking violations. The Department of Transportation opposes this measure. The incident, reported August 5, 2022, highlights weak NYPD enforcement against placard abuse and illegal plate covers. The matter centers on a car parked in a federal zone with obscured plates, a violation of state law. NYPD agents hesitated to act, citing placard status and unclear jurisdiction, but issued a $65 ticket after supervisor intervention. The bill, now in committee, aims to break the cycle of impunity for placard holders. Restler has also called for the elimination of placards entirely, stating, 'there are way too many scofflaw federal officers out there driving way too much to get from their (likely) suburban homes to their free, placard-guaranteed parking space in Lower Manhattan.' The affair exposes systemic failures in protecting pedestrians and cyclists from the dangers of unchecked car privilege.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
