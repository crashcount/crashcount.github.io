Forty-six seriously injured. In the last three years, District 33 has seen 6,556 crashes. <strong>Children limp home. Cyclists do not.</strong> A man steps from his car in Greenpoint. An e-bike runs the stop sign. He dies on the spot. The rider stays. No arrest. The street stays the same.</p><p><strong>SUVs, trucks, bikes, buses—each leaves its mark.</strong> Cars and SUVs killed three. Trucks and buses killed two. Bikes killed two. The rest are numbers, but each number is a life cut short. The city counts. The city moves on.</p><p>The toll grows. Eight more crashes. Four more injuries. The numbers climb. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-bills-and-the-slow-grind>Leadership: Votes, Bills, and the Slow Grind</h3><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has voted and sponsored bills. He backed the law that ended jaywalking tickets, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>voting yes to legalize crossing wherever you walk</a>. He called for more slow zones, <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/speed-limit-lowered-dumbo-slow-zone/>praising the new 20 mph limit in DUMBO</a>: “Data has shown that a one mile per hour increase in speed results in a nearly three percent increase in mortality.”</p><p>Restler co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and raise SUV fees. He stood with advocates for speed limiters on repeat offenders. He supports the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane, even as party bosses <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/28/democratic-party-machine-joins-the-bikelash-on-bedford-avenue>try to kill it</a>. But the deaths keep coming. The bills sit in committee. The paint dries. The blood does not.</p><h3 id=the-work-ahead-no-more-waiting>The Work Ahead: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not. The council can pass daylighting, speed limiters, and real bike lane protection. It has not. The dead cannot wait. The living should not have to.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighting at every crosswalk.

The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring leading pedestrian interval signals at intersections adjacent to hospitals, libraries, schools, and senior centers.' Council Member Lynn C. Schulman sponsored the bill, joined by Kagan, Hudson, Hanif, Abreu, Restler, Riley, and Sanchez. The bill would have forced the city to install these signals at no fewer than 400 intersections each year. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. No law passed.

Council Member Christopher Marte led as primary sponsor, joined by Restler, Brewer, Joseph, Nurse, Cabán, Avilés, Bottcher, Won, Ossé, and Richardson Jordan, plus the Brooklyn Borough President. The bill aimed to end a system that let private cars claim curb space, fueling illegal parking and danger for those on foot or bike.

The bill, now before the City Council, aims to crack down on placard abuse by city workers, which Restler calls 'petty corruption.' The matter summary states the legislation would force agencies to revoke most placards not protected by union contracts. Restler also proposed a bill letting New Yorkers report illegal placards and collect a share of fines. Street safety advocates back the move, saying, 'Ending placard abuse in New York City will make our streets safe, while ensuring bus and bike riders can stay moving—unobstructed by illegally stored cars.' The bill follows years of failed enforcement and mounting placard numbers. Restler’s action targets a system that blocks crosswalks, endangers pedestrians, and slows public transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, detailed in the media, will convert the painted bike lane to a two-way, parking-protected lane between Smith Street and Third Avenue. The street will become eastbound one-way for vehicles, with curb extensions, loading zones, and plastic bollards to block illegal parking. The DOT says the redesign addresses high injury rates from turning vehicles. Councilmember Lincoln Restler (District 33) publicly backed the project, calling Schermerhorn 'a disaster' for cyclists and naming its fix a top priority. The overhaul follows DOT surveys of local stakeholders. The project aims to protect cyclists and pedestrians on a vital route, with city agencies keeping parking and new loading zones for hotels.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, not requiring board approval, targets the stretch between Boerum Place and Third Avenue. DOT calls it a 'Vision Zero Priority Area.' The redesign converts the street to one-way eastbound, adds a two-way protected bike lane, and installs pedestrian improvements like Qwick Curbs and refuge spaces. Loading zones and left-turn bans aim to cut injuries. Since 2015, 555 crashes have injured 124 and killed one pedestrian. Council Member Lincoln Restler backed the plan, calling it a 'top priority' and 'necessary response' to deadly conditions. Former Council Member Steve Levin and advocates pushed for these changes for years. Some locals criticized Qwick Curbs as ugly, but DOT officials stressed the board's advisory role. The redesign does not address Hoyt Street, where illegal parking remains rampant.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Former Council Member Stephen Levin and advocates have long pushed for these changes, especially to stop NYPD from blocking bike lanes. Advocates like Brian Howald and Jon Orcutt stress the need for robust, physical protection—not just paint or flexible posts—to keep drivers out. Since 2015, 555 crashes have injured 124 people and killed one pedestrian on this stretch.

The plan follows the City Council's push for a $3.1 billion, five-year budget. Adams said, 'We're making a historical announcement to continue to keep our streets safe.' Council Member Lincoln Restler called it 'a big, big, big day for street safety.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez stated, 'We will be building even more bike lanes and dedicated bus lanes as well as new plaza and other public space.' The funding will upgrade weakly protected bike lanes and step up enforcement against reckless drivers. Advocates, including Transportation Alternatives, praised the move as transformational for vulnerable road users. The investment marks a major step to reclaim streets from cars and address rising traffic deaths.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The call: fund safety now.</p><p class=mb3>On April 22, 2022, more than a dozen City Council members and advocates gathered at City Hall to demand full funding for the Streets Master Plan. The plan, passed in 2019, requires hundreds of miles of protected bike lanes, bus lanes, and safer sidewalks. Council Member Alexa Avilés led the call: "We want $3.1 billion, a little tiny fraction of the [nearly $100-billion] city budget, to make sure our streets belong to us, and to make sure New Yorkers are safe." Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers, Carlina Rivera, Lincoln Restler, Sandy Nurse, Chi Ossé, Crystal Hudson, Shekar Krishnan, and Amanda Farías joined her. Traffic fatalities rose 44 percent in the first quarter of 2022, the deadliest start since Vision Zero began. The mayor’s proposed $98.5-billion budget did not allocate significant funds for the plan. Advocates say the city must act now to stem the bloodshed on its streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Residents pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On April 21, 2022, Streetsblog announced the results of its annual March (Parking) Madness contest, spotlighting NYPD precincts with rampant illegal parking and placard abuse. The 84th Precinct in Downtown Brooklyn was named the worst offender, with officers racking up speeding tickets, blocking hydrants, and abusing placards. Council Member Lincoln Restler, who represents the area, condemned the precinct’s behavior as 'petty, but pervasive corruption' and pledged to push for aggressive legislation and enforcement. Restler has previously called for eliminating parking placards entirely. Streetsblog’s study found that precinct blocks see more crashes than nearby streets, linking NYPD misconduct to increased danger for vulnerable road users. The issue is framed as a threat to public safety and neighborhood respect.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill required the Department of Transportation to issue a traffic study determination within 60 days of a request for a traffic control device by a council member or community board. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring that traffic study determinations be issued no later than 60 days from the date a traffic control device is requested by a city council member or community board.' Council Members Brannan, Yeger (primary), Won, Restler, Williams, and Nurse sponsored the bill. The measure aimed to end delays and force transparency by requiring denials to include crash data and study summaries.

Council members press for action. Streets stay blocked. Curb access lost. Police and city workers park with impunity. Laws ignored. Promises broken. Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On April 12, 2022, the City Council held an oversight hearing on placard abuse and enforcement. The new Department of Investigation (DOI) boss, Jocelyn Strauber, hesitated to confirm if placard abuse is a problem, despite a 2019 law requiring DOI and NYPD to investigate and report on the issue. Council Member Erik Bottcher pressed Strauber, citing resident complaints about fake placards and blocked curbs. Bottcher said, 'NYPD traffic enforcement agents are not issuing tickets to many people using counterfeit placards.' Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized the lack of a digital placard system and is drafting new enforcement legislation. Local Law 6 mandates weekly sweeps and monthly reports, but agencies have failed to comply. The Adams administration has not advanced citizen enforcement. The result: curb space remains dangerous and inaccessible for pedestrians, cyclists, and those who need it most.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
