Forty-eight with injuries so grave they change a life.</strong> In District 33, the numbers do not tell the whole story, but they do not lie. Since 2022, crashes have torn through Greenpoint, Williamsburg, Brooklyn Heights, and beyond. Children, elders, cyclists, and walkers—no one is spared. The dead do not get a second chance. The living carry scars.</p><p>Just this spring, a sedan struck a cyclist on Kent Avenue. A van ignored a traffic control and left a cyclist with head trauma. A child’s knee was crushed by a driver who failed to yield. The list is long. The pain is longer. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data shows the pattern</a>: cars, trucks, bikes, buses—each can kill, each has.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-the-weight-of-action>Leadership: Words, Laws, and the Weight of Action</h3><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has not been silent. He has backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks, require protected bike lanes, and push for speed limiters on dangerous vehicles. He co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act and voted to legalize jaywalking, shifting blame off the walker and onto the street and the driver. When a woman was struck by an MTA bus, Restler called it <a href=https://nypost.com/2024/05/05/us-news/woman-23-critically-injured-after-struck-by-mta-bus-in-nyc/>&ldquo;devastating&rdquo;</a>. He has fought illegal NYPD parking, saying sidewalks and bike lanes are not for police cars. &ldquo;We need to roll up our sleeves and take action at the local level, at the neighborhood level on our blocks,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/brooklyns-district-33-becomes-first-in-nyc-to-release-its-own-climate-plan>Restler said</a>.</p><p>But the blood keeps coming. The laws are not enough. The pace is slow. The street does not wait.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-the-fight-is-not-over>What Comes Next: The Fight Is Not Over</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a policy failure. The city must clear sightlines at every crosswalk, build real protection for every bike lane, and slow every car. Residents must call, write, and show up. Demand more. Demand faster. Demand that the next child, the next cyclist, the next elder, makes it home.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Do not let up.</strong> The road is not safe until the killing stops.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called the crossings vital for safety. Restler applauded the move but demanded further action, especially near the site of the fatal crash.

DOT’s study found hundreds of people crossing mid-block every weekend. Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called the project a way to 'enhance safety by better managing traffic.' Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon called the improvements 'a great step forward.' The city has finished installing signals and is completing ramps and crosswalks.

The matter summary notes Restler's intent to remain active: 'I am reintroducing 501, the citizen reporting bill, and will push as hard as I can to get it over the finish line.' Restler has sponsored bills to curb illegal parking, speed up bike lane installations, and fight placard abuse. Despite his removal, advocates and colleagues, including Jon Orcutt, voiced confidence that Restler will continue to fight for pedestrian and cyclist safety.

Danger shifts.</p><p class=mb3>On January 10, 2024, the city completed a new busway on Livingston Street in Brooklyn. The project, not tied to a specific bill number, was led by the Department of Transportation and praised by Councilmember Lincoln Restler (District 33). The redesign turned a congested, two-way street into a one-way westbound corridor with two directions of physically-separated, dedicated bus lanes. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said the project 'transformed what was a congested, double-parked corridor into two-way fully protected and dedicated bus lanes.' Restler declared, 'Those days are over with the new Livingston Busway!' The project aims to speed up service for 50,000 daily riders and keep cars out of bus lanes with concrete boarding islands. While the article notes ongoing issues with illegal parking and citywide delays, the Livingston Street busway stands as a rare win for bus riders and vulnerable street users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
