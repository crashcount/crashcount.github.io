The Department of Transportation (DOT) manages these paths but has failed to keep them clear. As one rider put it, 'They should maintain [it] so bikers who use it don't get whacked and don't need to ride in the middle of the lanes.' Council Member Lincoln Restler responded to complaints, tweeting that DOT would prune Kent Avenue’s bike lane 'next week.' The article, 'Too Green: City Neglects Overgrown Bike Paths,' details how weeds squeeze lanes to a single rider, forcing cyclists into traffic. Advocates urge regular maintenance and clearer agency roles, warning that neglect makes greenways unsafe for all who rely on them.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No one is satisfied.</p><p class=mb3>On August 16, 2023, Mayor Adams announced a compromise redesign for McGuinness Boulevard, a notorious Brooklyn corridor. The Department of Transportation will install curbside protected bike lanes and reduce car lanes from two to one in each direction on most of the strip. However, north of Calyer Street, two lanes for cars will remain open during weekdays, reverting to parking lanes at night and on weekends. The plan, shaped after lobbying by business interests and mayoral adviser Ingrid Lewis-Martin, mixes two previous DOT proposals. Mayoral spokesman Charles Lutvak said, 'Traffic safety is a key priority for Mayor Adams, and we are delivering with a redesign of McGuinness Boulevard that will make this corridor safer for all road users.' Local officials, including Council Member Lincoln Restler, called it a 'critical step' but noted it lacks key safety elements. The compromise leaves gaps. Since 2021, 62 people have been injured on this stretch. The carnage continues.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Demand is high.</p><p class=mb3>On August 16, 2023, the Department of Transportation announced plans to install seven new Citi Bike docking stations in Hasidic Williamsburg. This action addresses a coverage gap that has existed since Citi Bike’s 2013 arrival in the area. The matter, described as closing the 'black hat black hole,' faces resistance from some community members, but data show high demand and low car ownership. Council Member Lincoln Restler, a strong supporter, stated, 'I have been working with DOT to help expand access to Citi Bike for South Williamsburg residents.' He praised DOT’s outreach and progress. Despite the expansion, a significant part of the neighborhood will remain without Citi Bike access. Political resistance has slowed progress, but the new docks mark a step forward for vulnerable road users who rely on safe, affordable transportation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal, by Edison Properties, would add 95 parking spaces. Dan Garodnick, chair of the City Planning Commission, called the site 'ideal for housing.' Council Member Lincoln Restler, who represents the area, stated he is an unequivocal 'no' on the expansion and wants a use that benefits the community. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso urged the city to discourage private vehicles, citing high pedestrian traffic and strong transit access. City Planning Commissioner Juan Camilo Osorio highlighted policies to cut car use and decarbonize the city. Officials warn that more parking means more cars and more danger for people walking and biking, especially after a major bike lane was added to Schermerhorn Street.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as a 'NYC transportation policy dispute: McGuinness Blvd safety redesign reversal,' saw Adams cite opposition from a business-organized town hall, despite over 7,000 residents signing a petition for the redesign. Council Member Lincoln Restler, who supported the plan, criticized Adams, stating, 'We experience a crash per week on McGuinness.' Restler called for renewed efforts to implement the safety measures, highlighting the ongoing danger to pedestrians and cyclists. The mayor’s decision, influenced by his chief adviser Ingrid Lewis-Martin, leaves vulnerable road users at risk and delays long-promised protections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event followed Mayor Adams' reversal of a previously approved plan, which came after a fatal 2021 hit-and-run. The rally, organized by Make McGuinness Safe, drew support from Council Members Jennifer Gutierrez and Lincoln Restler. The matter, titled 'Greenpoint to Mayor: We Are the Residents and We Support a Safer McGuinness!', saw speakers denounce the influence of the Argento family and Broadway Stages, who opposed the redesign to protect business interests. Residents cited high crash and injury rates, especially for children crossing to local schools. DOT is now refining the plan based on community feedback. The message was clear: Greenpoint wants action, not delay, to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, 'Two bikes collided head-on in the dark. No helmets. No warning. An 18-year-old boy lay unconscious, his face torn, bleeding on the pavement.' The report lists 'Driver Inexperience' as a contributing factor. No other vehicles were involved. Both bikes were traveling straight, one east and one west. The data notes that neither rider wore a helmet, but this is only mentioned after the primary cause: driver inexperience.

Council Member Restler and activists stood firm.</p><p class=mb3>On June 16, 2023, a contentious town hall convened over the city’s proposed safety redesign for McGuinness Boulevard. The meeting, billed as an 'awareness town hall,' was dominated by opponents, including Assembly Member Rodneyse Bichotte-Hermelyn and business leaders like Tony Argento of Broadway Stages. Bichotte-Hermelyn, whose district is far from the site, admitted limited knowledge of the plan but cited business concerns. The session excluded supporters of the redesign, who rallied outside. The Department of Transportation defended its proposal to reduce lanes and add parking-protected bike lanes, citing proven safety benefits. Council Member Lincoln Restler and activists later rallied for the overhaul, insisting that safety for all road users must not be compromised. The event highlighted deep divisions and the influence of business interests over street safety reforms.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
