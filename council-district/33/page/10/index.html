The driver stayed. The boy did not. No arrest was made. The street stayed open. The city moved on.</p><p>A week before, a 17-year-old died on a moped. He slammed into a turning car. He died at the hospital. The driver was not charged.

The project, supported by Council Member Lincoln Restler, follows a deadly crash that killed a 31-year-old woman. DOT crews installed crossings between Bond and Nevins, Hoyt and Bond, and Smith and Hoyt streets. The official matter summary states: 'Freshly painted crosswalks and new traffic signals will help slow down drivers and encourage more foot traffic and safe crossings.' Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called the crossings vital for safety. Restler applauded the move but demanded further action, especially near the site of the fatal crash. He said, 'Mid-block crossings are a critical step in making this dangerous corridor safer.' The new measures do not cover all danger zones.

The crossings, between Nevins and Bond, Bond and Hoyt, and Hoyt and Smith streets, add crosswalks, traffic lights, and ramps. Restler said, 'These new mid-block crossings will create a greater sense of safety and community for Boerum Hill.' The Department of Transportation acted after Restler and others demanded change following the death of Katherine Harris, killed by a speeding driver. DOT’s study found hundreds of people crossing mid-block every weekend. Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called the project a way to 'enhance safety by better managing traffic.' Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon called the improvements 'a great step forward.' The city has finished installing signals and is completing ramps and crosswalks. Leaders want more: curb extensions, redesigned crossings, and further traffic calming.

The woman was not wearing a helmet, as documented in the report, but this detail appears after the driver error of unsafe speed. No other vehicles or people were involved.

Restler has sponsored bills to curb illegal parking, speed up bike lane installations, and fight placard abuse. Despite his removal, advocates and colleagues, including Jon Orcutt, voiced confidence that Restler will continue to fight for pedestrian and cyclist safety. The committee change may slow progress on key safety bills, but Restler's record and resolve remain strong.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill required the Department of Transportation to create a dedicated parking enforcement unit. Its summary: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the establishment of a parking enforcement unit within the department of transportation.' Council Members Christopher Marte (primary sponsor), Lincoln Restler, and Rita C. Joseph backed the measure. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote or enactment. The proposal would have targeted illegal parking, a key threat to pedestrians and cyclists. With the bill’s failure, enforcement remains fragmented. Vulnerable road users continue to face blocked crosswalks and bike lanes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Data goes public, every quarter.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0712-2022, now enacted as Local Law 155 of 2023, passed the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the full Council on October 19, 2023. The law, sponsored by Gale A. Brewer with co-sponsors including Erik D. Bottcher, Lincoln Restler, and others, amends the city code to require the Department of Transportation to report on vehicles with license plates unreadable by photo violation monitoring systems. The law’s title states it is 'in relation to reporting on motor vehicles with license plates that are unreadable by photo violation monitoring systems.' DOT must post quarterly reports showing the time, location, and reasons plates evade cameras—whether by concealment, distortion, or missing tags. The law aims to expose drivers who dodge automated enforcement, shining light on a loophole that puts pedestrians and cyclists at risk. The reports must be public and sent to the Mayor and Council Speaker.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill moved through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, passing on October 19, 2023, and became law on November 19, 2023. The law states: 'The department shall prioritize and promote...the safety of all street users...and improving equity in infrastructure investment.' Sponsored by Kevin C. Riley (primary), with Brooks-Powers, Narcisse, Hanif, Brewer, Restler, and Rivera as co-sponsors, the bill demands DOT report, by neighborhood, on safety infrastructure investment, crash rates, and demographics. It shines a light on which districts get safety upgrades and which are left exposed. The roadmap aims to close the gap for underserved areas, forcing transparency and accountability for every dollar spent on street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates and Councilmember Restler say lives are at risk. Promised safety upgrades for cyclists and bus riders stall. Political will fades. Vulnerable road users pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On October 18, 2023, Councilmember Lincoln Restler (District 33) spoke out as the Adams administration scaled back major street safety and transit projects. The matter, titled 'Advocates worry which street safety project Mayor Adams will abandon next,' details how the city cut the length of a planned protected bike lane on McGuinness Boulevard and reduced the scope of a Fordham Road busway. Restler said, 'I have no expectations that bold, big projects that can make our streets safer... are going to be happening in this administration.' He revealed the Department of Transportation was told to halt large bike and bus lane expansions due to waning political support. The administration’s actions leave vulnerable road users exposed, as cycling deaths rise and promised safety infrastructure stalls. The city fell short of its protected bike lane targets, endangering those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
