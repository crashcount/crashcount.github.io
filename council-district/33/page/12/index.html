Forty-six seriously injured. In the last three years, District 33 has seen 6,556 crashes. <strong>Children limp home. Cyclists do not.</strong> A man steps from his car in Greenpoint. An e-bike runs the stop sign. He dies on the spot. The rider stays. No arrest. The street stays the same.</p><p><strong>SUVs, trucks, bikes, buses—each leaves its mark.</strong> Cars and SUVs killed three. Trucks and buses killed two. Bikes killed two. The rest are numbers, but each number is a life cut short. The city counts. The city moves on.</p><p>The toll grows. Eight more crashes. Four more injuries. The numbers climb. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-bills-and-the-slow-grind>Leadership: Votes, Bills, and the Slow Grind</h3><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has voted and sponsored bills.

He called for more slow zones, <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/speed-limit-lowered-dumbo-slow-zone/>praising the new 20 mph limit in DUMBO</a>: “Data has shown that a one mile per hour increase in speed results in a nearly three percent increase in mortality.”</p><p>Restler co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and raise SUV fees. He stood with advocates for speed limiters on repeat offenders. He supports the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane, even as party bosses <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/28/democratic-party-machine-joins-the-bikelash-on-bedford-avenue>try to kill it</a>.

It has not. The council can pass daylighting, speed limiters, and real bike lane protection. It has not. The dead cannot wait. The living should not have to.</p><p><strong>Call your council member.

The bill, named for Sammy Cohen Eckstein, killed by a speeding driver in 2013, would let the city lower limits to 20 mph. The matter, described as 'Let New York City lower its own speed limits,' has strong support from the mayor, DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, and advocates like Families for Safe Streets. Restler’s action was public advocacy. The Assembly is the final hurdle; the bill is already in the governor’s and Senate’s budgets. Advocates cite a 36% drop in pedestrian deaths after the 2014 speed limit change.

The matter, described as 'the heavily used existing painted bike lane on Bedford Avenue puts people on bikes at risk because it is chronically blocked by double-parked vehicles,' highlights a deadly stretch for cyclists and pedestrians. Good Co., a Black-led bike club, and Transportation Alternatives lead the push. DOT acknowledged support and is open to future talks. The effort faces resistance from some community boards.

Safety hangs in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On March 17, 2023, Council Member Rita Joseph (D-Flatbush) introduced a bill to require New York City to build 100 miles of protected bike lanes annually, doubling the current Streets Plan mandate. The bill, co-sponsored by Council Member Lincoln Restler (D-Williamsburg), would apply from this year through 2028. The matter summary states the bill 'emphasizes the need for more protected bike lanes to make streets safer and increase cycling.' Joseph leads the legislation; Restler supports. The Department of Transportation failed to meet even the lower 30-mile requirement in 2022, building only 26.3 miles. DOT faces staffing shortages and budget gaps. Advocates warn that enforcement and maintenance lag, and that blocked lanes remain a threat. Joseph’s district ranks low in protected bike lane coverage, despite high rates of walking, biking, and transit use. The bill sits before the Council, with DOT reviewing.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, sponsored by Public Advocate Jumaane Williams and Council Member Alexa Avilés, with over thirty co-sponsors, sought a city study on the impact of truck and delivery traffic from last mile facilities. The official summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to conducting a study of the impact that truck and delivery traffic generated by last mile facilities have on local communities and infrastructure.' The bill required the Department of Transportation to report on delivery vehicle volumes, parking, congestion, collisions, and pedestrian injuries near these hubs. It called for identifying the most affected streets and estimating the costs and possible fixes. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without passage.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill required the Department of Transportation to study and report on using street design to limit or reduce commercial vehicle use in residential neighborhoods. The matter’s title reads: 'A Local Law in relation to requiring the department of transportation to study street design as a means to limit or reduce the use by commercial vehicles of streets in residential neighborhoods.' Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez sponsored the bill, joined by Avilés, the Public Advocate, and others. The report was due by December 31, 2023. The bill was filed at the end of session with no report issued. The measure aimed to examine street redesign, traffic calming, and camera enforcement to keep trucks out of residential areas, but it stalled before any impact reached the street.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez sponsored, joined by Avilés, the Public Advocate Williams, and others. The bill cited the city’s reliance on trucks—89% of freight—fueling congestion, pollution, and risk for everyone outside a vehicle. The Council pointed to pilot programs like Blue Highways as a way to clear streets and cut emissions. But the resolution was filed without action. Trucks still rule the road.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The hearing, led by Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, reviewed a slate of bills requiring reflective materials, school safety signs, daylighting, bollards, and more frequent fatality studies. Rodriguez said DOT supports the intent but opposes the bills, citing staffing shortages and a need for flexibility. Brooks-Powers expressed disappointment: 'It sounds, unfortunately, like DOT is not supporting any of the bills.' Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized city austerity and shrinking staff. Advocates, including Amy Cohen, said the bills 'don’t go nearly far enough.' The hearing exposed deep gaps between Council ambition, DOT capacity, and the urgent need for safer streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
