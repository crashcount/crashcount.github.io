Eighteen left with wounds that will not heal.</strong> In the last year alone, District 33 has seen 1,725 crashes. These are not just numbers—they are bodies on the street, families waiting at hospital doors, children who do not come home. In the past twelve months, <strong>one child was killed, thirty-one more injured</strong>. The old and the young, the walker and the cyclist—none are spared.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-the-names-we-bury>Recent Crashes: The Names We Bury</h3><p>A cyclist, helmet on, struck down on Lynch Street. A pedestrian, 49, killed by a bike on Franklin. A 45-year-old woman, crushed in the back seat of an SUV on Flatbush. The dead do not speak, but the living remember. &ldquo;Yeah, this street is dangerous,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-year-old-boy-killed-suv-crossing-intersection-crown-heights-brooklyn/16875804/>said Milli Cent</a>. The city moves on. The blood dries. The danger remains.</p><h3 id=who-pays-who-acts>Who Pays, Who Acts</h3><p><strong>Most injuries come from cars and trucks—390 cases, with five deaths.</strong> Bikes and mopeds kill too, but the steel and speed of larger vehicles do the worst. The city blames the walker, the biker, the child. But the street stays the same. The law stays the same.</p><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has not been silent. He backed the law that <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>lets pedestrians cross anywhere</a>, ending the charade of jaywalking. He co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>speed up protected bike lanes</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>raise SUV fees</a>. When the city tried to rip out the Bedford Avenue bike lane, Restler stood with the families and said, &ldquo;For months, the Mayor has repeatedly ignored our recommendations for ensuring the safety of children on Bedford Avenue&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/breaking-activists-sue-city-to-prevent-erasure-of-bedford-avenue-bike-lane>said Restler</a>.</p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The city drags its feet. The next name is already written.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay, every watered-down bill, every excuse is another body on the street. Call Council Member Restler. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand protected lanes that do not vanish overnight. <strong>Do not wait for the next siren.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The incident, near the site of a 2021 fatality, drew a joint statement from Rep. Nydia Velázquez, Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, and Council Member Lincoln Restler. They called the crash 'entirely predictable' and demanded Mayor Adams immediately implement the Department of Transportation’s stalled safety redesign. The DOT’s plan, which includes narrowing the street and adding a protected bike lane, faces opposition from powerful donors. The mayor’s office claims traffic safety is a priority, but the plan remains in limbo. Advocates and officials say every delay puts more lives at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Adams, who once approved the overhaul, reversed course after business pushback. The city now proposes a compromise: two moving lanes for cars and trucks remain on 30% of the corridor. Council Member Lincoln Restler condemned the reversal, saying, 'A compromise plan is a compromise on safety.' Parents echoed this, noting Adams would not commit to the promised changes.

The bill, introduced in the New York State Legislature, would require drivers with at least six speeding tickets in a single year, or 11 points in 18 months, to install speed limiter devices in their vehicles. The matter summary states: "We are going to literally force you to slow down by requiring you to install a speed limiter on your car." Gounardes led the announcement at the Atlantic Avenue intersection where a driver killed Katherine Harris. Gallagher, co-sponsor, said, "Cars and trucks can act as weapons when used recklessly." The bill aims to bypass bureaucratic hurdles and act automatically, modeled after ignition interlock devices for drunk drivers. Advocates and city officials joined the call, citing data that speed limiters can reduce traffic deaths by 37 percent.

Restler, whose district covers DUMBO, Greenpoint, and Brooklyn Heights, expressed reluctance to push for stricter enforcement, noting that many scooter riders are deliveristas pressured by food delivery apps. Cyclists described collisions, injuries, and a lack of NYPD action. One cyclist, Shari Stadel, suffered a concussion and stitches after a crash with scooters on the Manhattan Bridge.

The redesign, shaped by months of public meetings, aimed to remove a vehicle lane in each direction to add protected bike lanes. Council Member Lincoln Restler (District 33) and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher backed the safety-focused plan. The mayor’s reversal followed pressure from local businesses and the 'Keep McGuinness Moving' campaign. Over 7,000 people signed a petition for the redesign, while about 4,000 opposed it. The official matter summary states: 'Mayor Eric Adams appears to have ordered the city's Department of Transportation (DOT) to reverse course on a planned redesign of McGuinness Boulevard after powerful locals and influential members of the administration voiced their opposition.' The delay means the street remains dangerous for people walking and biking.
