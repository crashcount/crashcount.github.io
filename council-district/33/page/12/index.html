Forty-six left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 3,100 hurt since 2022. The dead include a 49-year-old man struck by an e-bike on India Street, a 45-year-old woman crushed as a passenger on Flatbush, and a 46-year-old cyclist killed on Lynch Street. Each number is a name, a family, a hole in the world.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs are the main threat.</strong> Three killed by SUVs or sedans. Two more by trucks. Two by bikes. The violence is steady. It does not care if you are walking, riding, or waiting for a light to change. It comes for the young and the old. It comes for children. It comes for you.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-the-battle-for-bedford-avenue>Leadership: Words, Laws, and the Battle for Bedford Avenue</h3><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has not been silent. He has voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable for crossing the street (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Restler votes yes to legalize jaywalking, improving overall pedestrian safety</a>). He has backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and support 20 MPH slow zones. He stood with advocates when the mayor tried to rip out the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane. &ldquo;For months, the Mayor has repeatedly ignored our recommendations for ensuring the safety of children on Bedford Avenue. And now, instead of identifying solutions that enhance safety for pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers, the Mayor is making a purely political decision to rip out a bike lane with no alternative,&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/adams-dot-remove-bedford-avenue-bike-lane/>Restler said</a>).</p><p>When the city tried to erase the lane, a judge stopped them. The fight is not over. The lane stands, for now. But the threat remains. &ldquo;Tearing out portions of the Bedford Avenue bike lane will only make our streets more dangerous for everyone who uses them, including children,&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/18/breaking-judge-halts-mayor-adamss-plan-to-tear-out-bedford-av-bike-lane>said Baruch Herzfeld</a>).</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>The carnage is not fate.</strong> It is policy. It is choice. Every day without change is another day of blood on the street. <strong>Call your council member. Demand daylighted corners. Demand protected lanes. Demand a 20 MPH speed limit. Demand action.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name to become a number. The street will not wait for you.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill was amended on March 7, 2023, in committee. The matter: 'encourage more ticketing of drivers who park in bike and bus lanes.' Council Member Lincoln Restler led the amendment, removing a financial incentive and adding a digital training requirement. Reports can only target unoccupied cars. Doug Gordon called the new version 'silly,' saying it adds hoops and limits scope. Eric McClure said the bill still improves things, but activists argue these changes gut its power. The loss of the reporting bounty is seen as a missed chance to shift driver behavior. Critics warn the new hurdles will stifle complaints and keep streets unsafe for cyclists and pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event, organized by Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi, focused on whether to reduce the BQE from three lanes to two. Former Brooklyn Democratic Party Chair Frank Seddio opposed the lane reduction, urging allies to resist the change. The meeting excluded some officials who support shrinking the highway, such as Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon and State Senator Andrew Gounardes, who cite environmental and community health concerns. Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized the city for favoring a three-lane solution and sidelining affected communities. City Hall denied taking a side, stating, 'the decision would be based on a DOT traffic study.' No formal council bill or vote was recorded, and no safety analyst assessed the impact on vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Restler said, 'My top priority is expanding street safety.' The bill now requires a digital training course and valid ID for complainants. Only unoccupied cars can be reported.

The meeting drew over 100 attendees. Council Member Lincoln Restler (District 33) voiced concerns about the lack of information on neighborhood impacts, costs, and the city’s refusal to commit to reducing the BQE to two lanes in each direction. The DOT presented three proposals—The Terraces, The Lookout, and The Stoop—aiming to repair the crumbling highway and reconnect Brooklyn Heights to Brooklyn Bridge Park. Restler said, 'We need a commitment that this is the long-term solution.' Residents like Cindy McLaughlin pushed for a walkable, green city, while Amy Breedlove warned that wider highways mean more danger on local streets. The DOT delayed its environmental review to study lane reduction, but offered no clear promises.

The matter, described as a fix for a 'free-for-all system that led to reckless driving and fatalities,' remains stalled.

Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, who introduced the original legislation, stressed the need for clear guidance. StreetsPAC’s Eric McClure highlighted the deadly consequences of delay.
