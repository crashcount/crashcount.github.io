Twenty seriously hurt.</strong> In the last twelve months alone, there have been 1,722 crashes, leaving 777 injured. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. A 45-year-old passenger crushed in a car on Flatbush. A 49-year-old man killed by an e-bike on Franklin. A 74-year-old thrown from his bike on Tillary. The street does not forgive.</p><h3 id=the-faces-behind-the-numbers>The Faces Behind the Numbers</h3><p>The horror is not abstract. &ldquo;He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/brooklyn-90-year-old-man-hit-run-rider/>said an eyewitness</a> after a moped struck a 90-year-old man in Brooklyn. The driver wore a mask. He hit the man and left. The city keeps searching for footage, for justice, for a reason. But the street stays silent.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did the most harm</strong>—three killed, 269 left with wounds. Trucks and buses killed two, bikes killed two more. Mopeds and motorcycles left dozens more battered. The old, the young, the ones on foot—they pay the price. <strong>Every crash is preventable. Every death is a failure.</strong></p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—and What Hasn’t</h3><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has backed laws to clear sightlines at intersections, redesign truck routes, and legalize crossing the street outside the lines—measures that chip away at the old order. He voted yes to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>redesign truck routes</a>, to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, and to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>. But the bodies keep coming. The pace is slow. The street is faster.</p><h3 id=the-call>The Call</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Restler. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people, not just promises. <strong>Every day of delay is another family broken.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0095-2024, introduced February 8, 2024, sits with the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill demands a study on 'the feasibility of installing raised crosswalks, raised intersections, and speed reducers at intersections and roadways adjacent to schools.' Council Member Julie Menin leads, joined by Schulman, Hudson, Brooks-Powers, Riley, Lee, Louis, Restler, and Gutiérrez as sponsors. The bill would repeal and replace Section 19-189 of the city code, requiring the Department of Transportation to report crash data and feasibility findings to the Mayor and Council Speaker. After the study, the Commissioner may install traffic-calming measures where possible. The bill remains 'Laid Over in Committee' as of June 25, 2024. No safety analyst note is available, but the bill targets systemic risk where children walk and drivers speed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

He thanked DOT for acting to eliminate vending on the bridge, but called for more vendor licenses elsewhere. Vendors and advocates argued the ban is too harsh, urging specific rules instead of a blanket prohibition. DOT will review public comments before finalizing the rule.

The move aims to cut deadly conflict between cars and kids. Filed at session’s end, the resolution targets peak arrival and dismissal. Sponsors push Albany to act. Streets remain risky.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0792-2023 was filed by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on September 28, 2023, and closed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. The resolution urges the New York State Legislature and Governor to pass A.5001-A/S.2515-B, which would require scramble crosswalks at intersections near schools during student arrival and dismissal. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, A.5001-A/S.2515-B, in relation to establishing scramble crosswalks leading to and from school buildings during times of student arrival and dismissal.' Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary), Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, Lincoln Restler, and Kevin C. Riley sponsored the measure. The bill responds to persistent crashes near schools and the loss of hundreds of crossing guards. Scramble crosswalks, also called Barnes Dances, stop all traffic so pedestrians cross in every direction. The council’s action highlights the ongoing danger children face on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
