Forty-six wounded. In the last three years, District 33 has seen 6,548 crashes. <strong>Children limp home. Cyclists do not.</strong> A man steps from his car in Greenpoint. An e-bike runs the stop sign. He dies on the spot. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-by-e-bike-delivery-worker-who-blew-stop-sign-in-greenpoint-witnesses-say>“He died basically on the spot,” said Jack Collins.</a> The rider stays. No arrest. The street stays the same.</p><p><strong>SUVs, trucks, bikes, buses—each leaves its mark.</strong> Cars and SUVs killed five. Trucks and buses killed two. Bikes killed two. The rest are numbers, but each number is a life cut short. The city counts. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-bills-and-the-slow-grind>Leadership: Votes, Bills, and the Slow Grind</h3><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has voted and sponsored bills. He backed the law that ended jaywalking tickets, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>voting yes to legalize crossing wherever you walk</a>. He called for more slow zones, <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/speed-limit-lowered-dumbo-slow-zone/>praising the new 20 mph limit in DUMBO</a>: “Data has shown that a one mile per hour increase in speed results in a nearly three percent increase in mortality.”</p><p>Restler co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and raise SUV fees. He stood with advocates for speed limiters on repeat offenders. He supports the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane, even as party bosses <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/28/democratic-party-machine-joins-the-bikelash-on-bedford-avenue>try to kill it</a>. But the deaths keep coming. The bills sit in committee. The paint dries. The blood does not.</p><h3 id=the-work-ahead-no-more-waiting>The Work Ahead: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> The city has the power to lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It has not. The council can pass daylighting, speed limiters, and real bike lane protection. It has not. The dead cannot wait. The living should not have to.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighting at every crosswalk. Demand action, not words.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Streets remain deadly.</p><p class=mb3>On February 22, 2024, a woman was struck and critically injured by Stanley Manel, a driver with 26 prior speed camera violations, at Sutton Street and Nassau Avenue in Greenpoint. Manel was charged with failure to yield and failure to exercise due care. Nassau Avenue, a two-way street used by cyclists, lacks protective infrastructure. Following the crash, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, Council Member Lincoln Restler, and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velázquez called for passage of two state bills: one requiring repeat speeding offenders to install intelligent speed assistance devices, and Sammy's Law, which would let the City Council lower speed limits. They also urged the Department of Transportation to install raised crosswalks and daylighting at intersections. Their statement reads: “Lowering the speed limit and enforcing real accountability for dangerous drivers are urgent steps we must take to protect New Yorkers.”</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, the driver failed to yield the right-of-way. The report states, 'A Dodge pickup turned left. A 49-year-old woman crossed in the marked crosswalk. The truck struck her head-on.' The woman suffered fatal head injuries and severe bleeding, dying at the scene. The driver, a licensed man, was not injured and his vehicle sustained no damage. The police report explicitly cites 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as the contributing factor. The victim was crossing without a signal but within a marked crosswalk, as noted in the police report, after the driver’s error. The crash underscores the lethal consequences of driver failure to yield at intersections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill, announced on February 8, 2024, removes prior compromises—no phased rollout, no mandatory training, no ID hurdles. The measure, previously stripped down in committee, now returns to its original form. The matter title: 'Prophet Motive: Restler Bill Would Restore 25% Bounty for Blocked Bike and Bus Lane Tickets.' Restler vows to push hard for passage, saying, 'This bill would make a tremendous difference in making our streets safer for cyclists and pedestrians.' Activists like Sara Lind back the bounty, arguing, 'More reporting, more enforcement, will lead to fewer violations.' The bill’s fate is uncertain after Restler’s removal from the Transportation Committee, but the intent is clear: shift enforcement from NYPD to the people, and clear the way for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called the crossings vital for safety. Restler applauded the move but demanded further action, especially near the site of the fatal crash. He said, 'Mid-block crossings are a critical step in making this dangerous corridor safer.' The new measures do not cover all danger zones.
