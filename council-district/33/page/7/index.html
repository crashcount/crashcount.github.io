He co-sponsored bills to remove abandoned vehicles, clear crosswalks, and boost plate enforcement. He pushed for daylighting—banning parking near crosswalks to keep sightlines open. But the pace is slow. The committee laid the daylighting bill over in April. The cars still block the corners. The danger waits.</p><p>Restler has also called out the NYPD for racial bias in traffic enforcement, calling the disparity &ldquo;extreme&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/29/council-pols-fume-as-nypd-disputes-report-of-racial-bias-in-traffic-enforcement>called out</a>.

He has supported crackdowns on illegal placard parking that blocks bike lanes and sidewalks <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/24/police-finally-remove-cars-from-plaza-in-downtown-brooklyn>supported crackdowns</a>.</p><h3 id=the-work-left-undone>The Work Left Undone</h3><p><strong>The dead do not care about decals.</strong> They need streets that do not kill. The bills are a start, but they are not enough. The corners are still blind. The lanes are still blocked. The speed is still too high. The city has the power to lower the limit to 20 mph. It has not used it. Every day of delay is another day a mother, a child, or a neighbor does not come home.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Parks should be for people, not for parking.&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/02/28/parking-or-parkland-brooklyn-judges-could-lose-their-perk>Restler said</a>.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Restler called the racial disparity in traffic enforcement &ldquo;extreme.&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/29/council-pols-fume-as-nypd-disputes-report-of-racial-bias-in-traffic-enforcement>Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Call your council member.

The plan, discussed at a community meeting, would replace the lot with public amenities—open greenery, playgrounds, a skatepark, and restrooms. Architects from WXY presented four designs, all eliminating the judges’ parking. The proposal also calls for safer streets: protected bike lanes on Adams Street, expanded sidewalks, narrowed roads, bus lanes, and possible pedestrianization of Johnson Street. Council Member Restler declared, 'Parks should be for people, not for parking.' Residents voiced support, calling the lot a 'vestige of another era.' The officials will gather more public feedback before submitting a formal proposal.

According to the police report, the driver failed to yield the right-of-way. The report states, 'A Dodge pickup turned left. A 49-year-old woman crossed in the marked crosswalk.

The victim was crossing without a signal but within a marked crosswalk, as noted in the police report, after the driver’s error.

The Department of Transportation (DOT) seeks to prohibit vendors from pedestrian paths, bike lanes, and bridge approaches. The matter, described as a 'span ban,' drew strong public support for restrictions. Council Member Lincoln Restler, representing Brooklyn, stated, 'I am a strong supporter of vending, but it should go in designated spaces... the Brooklyn Bridge is not the place for it.' He thanked DOT for acting to eliminate vending on the bridge, but called for more vendor licenses elsewhere. Vendors and advocates argued the ban is too harsh, urging specific rules instead of a blanket prohibition. DOT will review public comments before finalizing the rule. No timeline has been set.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
