Forty-six left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 3,100 hurt since 2022. The dead include a 49-year-old man struck by an e-bike on India Street, a 45-year-old woman crushed as a passenger on Flatbush, and a 46-year-old cyclist killed on Lynch Street. Each number is a name, a family, a hole in the world.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs are the main threat.</strong> Three killed by SUVs or sedans. Two more by trucks. Two by bikes. The violence is steady. It does not care if you are walking, riding, or waiting for a light to change. It comes for the young and the old. It comes for children. It comes for you.</p><h3 id=leadership-words-laws-and-the-battle-for-bedford-avenue>Leadership: Words, Laws, and the Battle for Bedford Avenue</h3><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has not been silent. He has voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable for crossing the street (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Restler votes yes to legalize jaywalking, improving overall pedestrian safety</a>). He has backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and support 20 MPH slow zones. He stood with advocates when the mayor tried to rip out the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane. &ldquo;For months, the Mayor has repeatedly ignored our recommendations for ensuring the safety of children on Bedford Avenue. And now, instead of identifying solutions that enhance safety for pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers, the Mayor is making a purely political decision to rip out a bike lane with no alternative,&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/adams-dot-remove-bedford-avenue-bike-lane/>Restler said</a>).</p><p>When the city tried to erase the lane, a judge stopped them. The fight is not over. The lane stands, for now. But the threat remains. &ldquo;Tearing out portions of the Bedford Avenue bike lane will only make our streets more dangerous for everyone who uses them, including children,&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/18/breaking-judge-halts-mayor-adamss-plan-to-tear-out-bedford-av-bike-lane>said Baruch Herzfeld</a>).</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>The carnage is not fate.</strong> It is policy. It is choice. Every day without change is another day of blood on the street. <strong>Call your council member. Demand daylighted corners. Demand protected lanes. Demand a 20 MPH speed limit. Demand action.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name to become a number. The street will not wait for you.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the installation of solar-powered crosswalks,' orders the Department of Transportation to install at least 100 illuminated, solar-powered traffic control devices at crosswalks each year for five years—a total of 500. The department must also study their impact compared to unlit signs.

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to use of force incidents involving police department use of a motor vehicle," forces the NYPD to add 'use of a motor vehicle to gain control of a subject' as a specific reporting category in quarterly and annual use of force reports. Council Member Lincoln Restler leads as primary sponsor, joined by Hudson, Won, Hanif, Bottcher, Brewer, Avilés, Abreu, Ossé, Krishnan, Williams, Cabán, Nurse, Sanchez, and the Brooklyn Borough President. The bill targets a gap: current NYPD reports do not name motor vehicles as a means of force. This change brings police violence by car into the light, exposing patterns that endanger pedestrians and other vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, discussed at a community meeting, would replace the lot with public amenities—open greenery, playgrounds, a skatepark, and restrooms. Architects from WXY presented four designs, all eliminating the judges’ parking. The proposal also calls for safer streets: protected bike lanes on Adams Street, expanded sidewalks, narrowed roads, bus lanes, and possible pedestrianization of Johnson Street. Council Member Restler declared, 'Parks should be for people, not for parking.' Residents voiced support, calling the lot a 'vestige of another era.' The officials will gather more public feedback before submitting a formal proposal.

Transportation Alternatives described the intersection as 'filled with slip lanes that encourage speeding and no infrastructure to keep pedestrians or cyclists safe.'
