Eighteen Broken. Who Will Stop the Bleeding on Brooklyn’s Streets?</h1><p class="byline f6 silver">Written June 28, 2025 <em>(Revised June 28, 2025)</em></p></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>District 33: Jan 1, 2022 - Jun 28, 2025</h2><h2 id=the-toll-in-blood-and-silence>The Toll in Blood and Silence</h2><p><strong>Six dead. Eighteen seriously hurt.</strong> In the last year alone, District 33 has seen 1,731 crashes, 794 injuries, and 18 people left with wounds that will not heal. The dead do not speak. The living carry scars.</p><p>Last week, a 17-year-old boy died after his moped collided with a car. His passenger is fighting for life. Police said the moped &ldquo;slammed into&rdquo; a turning car. There were no arrests. The street was quiet again, except for the sirens (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/teen-boy-dead-man-critically-injured-in-moped-crash-in-brooklyn/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>Days before, another moped rider, Joel Mota, was killed by a drunk, unlicensed driver. His brother said, &ldquo;He was a hardworking man. He had a lot of love for his family&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p><strong>The pattern is old. The pain is fresh.</strong></p><h2 id=who-pays-who-acts>Who Pays, Who Acts</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs killed three. Trucks and buses killed two. Bikes killed two.</strong> The numbers are small until it is your family. In District 33, the most vulnerable—children, cyclists, the old—are the first to fall.</p><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has not stood still. He backed the <a href=https://www.bkreader.com/policy-government/brooklyn-cycling-advocates-sue-to-block-mayor-from-removing-bedford-avenue-bike-lane-10826886>lawsuit that stopped the city from tearing out the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane</a>. He filed an affidavit to keep the lane in place, citing the law that demands notice before safety is stripped away.</p><p>Restler has co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and push for lower speed limits. He has called for more enforcement against illegal parking and reckless driving. But the deaths keep coming.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every delay is a choice. The city has the power to lower speed limits, redesign streets, and end the bloodshed. But power unused is no comfort to the dead.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand action.</strong> Do not wait for another name on the list. The streets will not change themselves. Only people can do that.</p></div></div><div class="mod-contact tc"><h3 class="fw6 mb2">Fix the Problem</h3><button class="dib pv2 ph3 ba b--light-silver br2 bg-dark-gray white pointer" onclick='var el=document.getElementById("contact-card");el.classList.toggle("dn"),el.classList.toggle("flex")'>

Council Member Lincoln Restler, representing the area, offered condolences: "My heart breaks for her family and loved ones." Local activist Brent Bovenzi called for urgent action, saying, "We must have greater safety for our most vulnerable New Yorkers. The city already has the tools to make our intersections safer, we just need the political will to do it." Advocates demand reinstated crossing guards and daylighting. Mayor Adams pledged to daylight 1,000 intersections in 2024, but critics say the pace is glacial.

Promises broken. Cyclists still risk death. Community boards back the lane. City drags its feet. Injuries rise. Politics blocks safety. Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>On March 19, 2024, Council Member Chi Ossé publicly condemned the Department of Transportation for failing to install the promised protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue. The DOT had pledged completion in late 2023, but the project remains stalled with no timeline. Ossé stated, 'They brought this to the community board and there was an outpouring of support for this protected bike lane.' The matter was discussed with Community Boards 3 and 8, and local officials, schools, and businesses support the project. Council Member Lincoln Restler accused Mayor Adams of putting politics over public safety, saying, 'Mayor Adams has decided that he cares more about who he thinks is going to vote for him in 2025 than our lives.' The delay leaves cyclists exposed to ongoing danger, with injuries on the rise. The DOT’s call for more 'community engagement' is seen as a smokescreen for inaction. No formal safety analyst assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The company racked up over 60 reckless driving tickets—red lights, speeding, more. The Business Integrity Commission issued six violations since 2019. Yet, penalties remain minimal: a small fine for a hood ornament, missing paperwork. The driver in the latest fatality faces no charges, despite video showing the pedestrian had the right of way. Restler declared, 'We need much stricter oversight of the private sanitation and construction truck companies that are operating in New York City.' He added, 'Companies like Manolos Trucking should not be allowed to do business in New York City.' The company did not respond to requests for comment. Oversight is lax. Dangerous trucks keep rolling. Vulnerable New Yorkers keep dying.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

By writing the ban into the administrative code, the council aims to close loopholes and strengthen enforcement.

Assembly Member Tony Simone submitted a state bill to double fines after the tenth violation, up to five times the current cap. The matter targets 'the worst repeat offenders of parking tickets.' Manhattan safe streets activist Jehiah Czebotar analyzed city data, finding that 77 percent of street-sweeping tickets go to repeat offenders, with 37 percent to drivers who got at least six tickets. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program expired last year, leaving a gap in enforcement.

The electrified dock pilot, meant to launch late last year, is months behind schedule. Bottcher wrote, 'I urge the Department of Transportation and Con Edison to expedite the electrification of [Citi Bike] stations for the purpose of charging the pedal-assist bikes.' Council Member Lincoln Restler of Greenpoint echoed the demand, calling the project 'an exciting opportunity' for better reliability. DOT claims to be working on it; ConEd says their role is limited. The delay leaves e-bike riders without charged bikes, as workers must swap batteries by hand. The new Lyft contract will double e-bikes, making efficient charging urgent. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the lack of charged bikes keeps vulnerable riders off the street and in harm's way.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
