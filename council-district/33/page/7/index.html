Twenty-two seriously hurt.</strong> That’s just the last twelve months in District 33. The numbers are not names, but each one is a life ended or broken. A mother, a child, a man on his way home. The street does not care. The car does not stop.</p><p>Just last week, a driver doing donuts in a Brooklyn parking lot lost control. He struck his girlfriend, Madisyn Ruiz, as she sat on the curb. She died at the hospital. Police charged him with negligent homicide. <em>&ldquo;He lost control when he was doing donuts with the vehicle,&rdquo;</em> he told police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>NY Daily News</a>. Days later, the tire marks were still there.</p><p>On Third Avenue, two men were killed by a hit-and-run driver. The driver left car parts and bodies behind. Neighbors said, <em>&ldquo;drivers speed on that stretch of roadway&rdquo;</em> <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/2-dead-in-brooklyn-hit-and-run-suspect-in-custody/>CBS New York</a>. The city swept up the glass. The danger remains.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> In the last three years, cars and trucks killed or injured hundreds. Bikes and mopeds add to the toll, but the deadliest force is still the car. The old, the young, the ones just crossing the street. No helmet, no crosswalk, no law can shield you from a speeding driver.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn’t</h3><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has backed some safety bills. He voted yes to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>remove abandoned vehicles</a>, co-sponsored a law to warn taxi passengers about dooring, and pushed for daylighting crosswalks. He called out <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/29/council-pols-fume-as-nypd-disputes-report-of-racial-bias-in-traffic-enforcement>racial bias in NYPD traffic stops</a>. He supported <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/24/police-finally-remove-cars-from-plaza-in-downtown-brooklyn>clearing illegal placard parking that blocks sightlines</a>.</p><p>But the pace is slow. Some bills stall in committee. Some changes are small. The street stays the same. The bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real enforcement against reckless drivers, not just warnings for cyclists.</strong> Every day of delay is another family broken. The street will not change itself. Only you can force their hand.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The plan, discussed at a community meeting, would replace the lot with public amenities—open greenery, playgrounds, a skatepark, and restrooms. Architects from WXY presented four designs, all eliminating the judges’ parking. The proposal also calls for safer streets: protected bike lanes on Adams Street, expanded sidewalks, narrowed roads, bus lanes, and possible pedestrianization of Johnson Street. Council Member Restler declared, 'Parks should be for people, not for parking.' Residents voiced support, calling the lot a 'vestige of another era.'

According to the police report, the driver failed to yield the right-of-way. The report states, 'A Dodge pickup turned left. A 49-year-old woman crossed in the marked crosswalk.

The victim was crossing without a signal but within a marked crosswalk, as noted in the police report, after the driver’s error.

The bill demands the city install pedestrian lighting in at least 500 commercial corridors per year, aiming for a minimum of 1 footcandle (11 lux) on every sidewalk. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to installation of pedestrian lighting fixtures.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers leads as primary sponsor, joined by Restler, Krishnan, Bottcher, and others. The committee has not yet voted. The bill’s text sets clear targets for coverage and contiguity, but action is stalled. Vulnerable road users remain in the dark until the city acts.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation (DOT) seeks to prohibit vendors from pedestrian paths, bike lanes, and bridge approaches. The matter, described as a 'span ban,' drew strong public support for restrictions. Council Member Lincoln Restler, representing Brooklyn, stated, 'I am a strong supporter of vending, but it should go in designated spaces... the Brooklyn Bridge is not the place for it.' He thanked DOT for acting to eliminate vending on the bridge, but called for more vendor licenses elsewhere. Vendors and advocates argued the ban is too harsh, urging specific rules instead of a blanket prohibition. DOT will review public comments before finalizing the rule.
