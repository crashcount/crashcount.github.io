Eighteen left with wounds that will not heal. In the last twelve months, District 33 saw <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>1,745 crashes</a>. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>Four children were seriously hurt</a>. A cyclist was killed on Lynch Street. A pedestrian bled out on India Street. These are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors. The street does not care if you are young or old. It takes what it wants.</p><p>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage. In three years, they killed five. Bikes killed two. Trucks and buses killed two more. The rest were left broken, sometimes for life. The pain is not spread evenly. The old, the young, the ones on foot or bike—they pay the highest price.</p><h3 id=the-politics-of-safety>The Politics of Safety</h3><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has not been silent. He voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths. He co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>speed up protected bike lanes</a>. He stood with families when the mayor tried to <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/breaking-activists-sue-city-to-prevent-erasure-of-bedford-avenue-bike-lane>rip out the Bedford Avenue bike lane</a>. “For months, the Mayor has repeatedly ignored our recommendations for ensuring the safety of children on Bedford Avenue,” <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/adams-dot-remove-bedford-avenue-bike-lane/>Restler said</a>. “Instead of identifying solutions that enhance safety for pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers, the Mayor is making a purely political decision to rip out a bike lane with no alternative.”</p><p>When the city tried to erase the lane, a judge <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/court-stops-bedford-avenue-bike-lane-removal/>stopped them</a>. Restler filed an affidavit to keep the protection in place. The fight is not over. The city will try again. The street will claim more lives if nothing changes.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>The disaster is not fate. Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. The council can pass more laws. The mayor can build more barriers. The police can enforce the rules. But none of it matters if the public stays quiet. Contact your council member. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand protected bike lanes that cannot be erased by a backroom deal. Demand that every child can cross the street and come home.</p><p>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The street is hungry. It will not stop on its own.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The matter, described as a 'NYC transportation policy dispute: McGuinness Blvd safety redesign reversal,' saw Adams cite opposition from a business-organized town hall, despite over 7,000 residents signing a petition for the redesign. Council Member Lincoln Restler, who supported the plan, criticized Adams, stating, 'We experience a crash per week on McGuinness.' Restler called for renewed efforts to implement the safety measures, highlighting the ongoing danger to pedestrians and cyclists. The mayor’s decision, influenced by his chief adviser Ingrid Lewis-Martin, leaves vulnerable road users at risk and delays long-promised protections.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, presented to Community Board 1's Transportation Committee, will remove a car lane in each direction and install protected bike lanes along a 1.1-mile stretch from Meeker Avenue to the Pulaski Bridge. The official summary states the overhaul will 'reconfigure the 1.1-mile stretch... following advocacy for safety upgrades after multiple deaths.' Council Member Lincoln Restler and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher praised the plan, calling it 'transformative' and pledging support. DOT statistics show similar road diets reduce deaths and serious injuries by 30 percent. The redesign includes shorter crosswalks, pedestrian islands, and new loading zones. This action responds to a history of crashes and the 2021 hit-and-run killing of teacher Matthew Jensen.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The officials demand mid-block crossings, daylighted intersections, raised crosswalks, curb extensions, and safer pedestrian space near BQE ramps.

The bill seeks to repeal an old law that forces the Department of Transportation (DOT) to give extended notice to community boards before installing bike lanes. The current rule requires a 90-day notice and a 45-day wait after a hearing. Intro 417 would cut this to just 14 days. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez told the Council, 'We love Lincoln Restler's bill,' and called the old law 'unnecessarily burdensome.' The bill's summary states it would 'put bike lanes on the same community outreach and installation schedule as other street projects.' Council Member Farah Louis raised concerns about less community input, but DOT officials stressed that the process would still involve boards and electeds—just faster.
