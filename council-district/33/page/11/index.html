The matter, described as 'DOT continues to ignore dangers it created on Brooklyn’s Fourth Ave,' centers on DOT’s decision to replace bike lanes with a second car lane, violating a city law that requires temporary bike lanes during such work. Council Members Lincoln Restler, Alexa Aviles, Shahana Hanif, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, State Senator Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, and groups like Bike New York and Transportation Alternatives sent a letter demanding the bike lane’s return and physical barriers to stop illegal parking on pedestrian islands. The letter urges DOT to 'ensure curb lanes be preserved for safe cyclist passage' and to 'deploy quick-build physical elements' for pedestrian safety. DOT has not responded.

The hearing, led by Transportation Committee chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, pressed DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez for answers. The law requires 150 miles of protected bus lanes and 250 miles of protected bike lanes by 2026. In 2022, the city built only 4.4 miles of bus lanes and 26.3 miles of bike lanes, far short of the legal benchmarks. Councilmember Lincoln Restler criticized political interference, saying, 'We're at a point where it's all politics all the time, and we're failing to execute.' Advocacy groups confirmed the city lags behind. The administration’s refusal to track or disclose progress leaves vulnerable road users exposed.

Restler’s opposition centers on concerns for local safety and access, stating, 'This tranquility will be disrupted when thousands of cars and trucks are rerouted onto these local streets.' Instead, the op-ed supports alternative safety measures such as speed cameras, curb extensions, and increased enforcement.

The crash tore open his leg. Blood pooled on the street. Speed fueled the violence. The rider wore no helmet. The SUV’s front end did the damage.</p><p class=mb3>A 20-year-old man riding an e-bike southbound on Meeker Avenue near Humboldt Street was struck from behind by a Toyota SUV. According to the police report, 'A Toyota SUV slammed into the rear of a southbound e-bike. The 20-year-old rider hit the pavement hard. His leg split open. Blood pooled on hot asphalt. Speed did the damage.' The crash left the e-bike rider with severe lacerations to his lower leg and foot. The report lists 'Unsafe Speed' as the contributing factor. The SUV’s center front end struck the e-bike’s rear, causing the rider to fall. The rider was not wearing a helmet, as noted in the report, but the primary cause was the SUV driver’s unsafe speed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The carnage reignited calls for long-delayed safety fixes. Local leaders say the crash was no surprise. The city’s promise to protect lives remains unfulfilled.</p><p class=mb3>On August 10, 2023, a motorist seriously injured a moped rider and crashed into several vehicles on McGuinness Boulevard in Greenpoint. The incident, near the site of a 2021 fatality, drew a joint statement from Rep. Nydia Velázquez, Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, and Council Member Lincoln Restler. They called the crash 'entirely predictable' and demanded Mayor Adams immediately implement the Department of Transportation’s stalled safety redesign. The DOT’s plan, which includes narrowing the street and adding a protected bike lane, faces opposition from powerful donors. The mayor’s office claims traffic safety is a priority, but the plan remains in limbo. Advocates and officials say every delay puts more lives at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The meeting followed the death of a P.S. 110 teacher on this deadly street. The original plan, now shelved, promised parking-protected bike lanes and safer crossings. Adams, who once approved the overhaul, reversed course after business pushback. The city now proposes a compromise: two moving lanes for cars and trucks remain on 30% of the corridor. Council Member Lincoln Restler condemned the reversal, saying, 'A compromise plan is a compromise on safety.' Parents echoed this, noting Adams would not commit to the promised changes. Broadway Stages, a local business, backed the compromise. The mayor’s office declined comment. No safety analyst assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill also ordered a study comparing these devices to unlit signs, probing their power to deter traffic violations and mapping out logistical hurdles. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the installation of solar-powered crosswalks.' Council Member Lincoln Restler led as primary sponsor, joined by Menin, Brooks-Powers, Rivera, and over thirty others. The bill was filed at session’s end on December 31, 2023.
