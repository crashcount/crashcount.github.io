He called for more slow zones, <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/speed-limit-lowered-dumbo-slow-zone/>praising the new 20 mph limit in DUMBO</a>: “Data has shown that a one mile per hour increase in speed results in a nearly three percent increase in mortality.”</p><p>Restler co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and raise SUV fees. He stood with advocates for speed limiters on repeat offenders. He supports the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane, even as party bosses <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/28/democratic-party-machine-joins-the-bikelash-on-bedford-avenue>try to kill it</a>.

The matter, titled 'There is No Plan to Limit Driving During Health Emergencies Like This One,' exposed a gap in city response. Mayor Adams and his emergency team did not roll out HOV lanes or urge residents to avoid driving, despite transportation being a top source of pollution. Council Member Lincoln Restler (D-Brooklyn) criticized the mayor and called HOV lanes 'a prudent measure to help keep New Yorkers safe.' Advocates like Sara Lind and Elizabeth Adams pressed for a playbook to cut car use and protect vulnerable groups. The city’s inaction left children, seniors, and people with asthma exposed to dangerous air, while cars continued to pollute. No council bill was introduced, but the debate spotlights the urgent need for systemic change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The event followed the removal of traffic calming measures, which had once protected pedestrians and cyclists. Chris Roberti, chair of the Safe Streets Committee at Public School 110, called for a 'comprehensive, safe street redesign.' Council Member Lincoln Restler promised to 'push like all hell' for changes at Monitor and Driggs by September. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher blamed state legislators for blocking Sammy's Law, which would let New York City lower speed limits. The rally featured a ghost bike and calls for urgent safety improvements.

The standoff laid bare a system that protects cars, not people.</p><p class=mb3>On April 24, 2023, the City Council held an oversight hearing on NYPD parking enforcement and related legislation. Council Member Lincoln Restler (D-Williamsburg) confronted NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell over widespread illegal parking by police around precincts. Restler cited a study showing 70 of 77 precincts had officers’ cars blocking sidewalks, calling NYPD enforcement 'a joke.' Chell insisted he has led 5,000 inspections and issued 39 command disciplines in four months, but Restler dismissed these efforts as inadequate. Restler used the hearing to highlight his bill allowing citizen reporting of parking infractions, bypassing the broken 311 system. He argued, 'A failure of the NYPD to enforce against this issue over many years makes our streets unsafe. So why not empower citizens to do the work that the NYPD has refused to do?' The hearing exposed deep distrust and the ongoing danger NYPD’s parking practices pose to pedestrians and other vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The group sent a letter to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, stating: 'Over the last decade, we have lost four neighbors to traffic violence on this very block.' The letter demands mid-block crossings, curb extensions, and traffic calming. Restler led DOT on a tour and announced a traffic study for mid-block crossings this summer. He said, 'We can't wait any longer. For whatever reason we've seen inaction for decades along Atlantic Avenue. Now is the time for substantial changes.' The push follows 94 pedestrian injuries, 72 cyclist injuries, and over 500 crashes in five years. The community will hold a safety walk to honor victims and press for action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The incident saw a driver run a red light, killing pedestrian Katherine Harris. Restler said, 'Traffic calming and safety improvements on Atlantic are a top priority. We are committed to working with neighbors and DOT to make it happen.' He referenced a recent walk with the Department of Transportation to highlight the need for critical changes. Restler’s response follows a grim trend: over 57 traffic deaths in New York City this year, including 25 pedestrians. He called the loss 'tragic' and 'avoidable,' and pledged to push for measures that protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets stay deadly.</p><p class=mb3>On April 12, 2023, Council Speaker Adrienne Adams declined to support Sammy’s Law, a state bill allowing New York City to control its speed limits. The bill, named for Sammy Cohen Eckstein, killed by a reckless driver in 2013, has stalled in Albany despite mounting pressure. Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez introduced a resolution urging passage, co-sponsored by Shahana Hanif and Lincoln Restler. Adams, however, said, 'We’re going to let the state do what the state does in response to Sammy’s Law,' and focused on other budget priorities. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, chair of the Transportation Committee, called for pairing lower speed limits with street redesigns in neglected neighborhoods. As children and cyclists die in record numbers, the council’s inaction leaves vulnerable New Yorkers at risk. The law would not lower limits automatically, but grant the city authority to act.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
