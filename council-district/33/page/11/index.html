Eighteen Broken. Who Will Stop the Bleeding on Brooklyn’s Streets?</h1><p class="byline f6 silver">Written June 28, 2025 <em>(Revised June 28, 2025)</em></p></header><div class="lh-copy measure-wide markdown-content"><h2 id=period-heading>District 33: Jan 1, 2022 - Jun 28, 2025</h2><h2 id=the-toll-in-blood-and-silence>The Toll in Blood and Silence</h2><p><strong>Six dead. Eighteen seriously hurt.</strong> In the last year alone, District 33 has seen 1,731 crashes, 794 injuries, and 18 people left with wounds that will not heal. The dead do not speak. The living carry scars.</p><p>Last week, a 17-year-old boy died after his moped collided with a car. His passenger is fighting for life. Police said the moped &ldquo;slammed into&rdquo; a turning car. There were no arrests. The street was quiet again, except for the sirens (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/teen-boy-dead-man-critically-injured-in-moped-crash-in-brooklyn/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>Days before, another moped rider, Joel Mota, was killed by a drunk, unlicensed driver. His brother said, &ldquo;He was a hardworking man. He had a lot of love for his family&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p><strong>The pattern is old. The pain is fresh.</strong></p><h2 id=who-pays-who-acts>Who Pays, Who Acts</h2><p><strong>Cars and SUVs killed three. Trucks and buses killed two. Bikes killed two.</strong> The numbers are small until it is your family. In District 33, the most vulnerable—children, cyclists, the old—are the first to fall.</p><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has not stood still. He backed the <a href=https://www.bkreader.com/policy-government/brooklyn-cycling-advocates-sue-to-block-mayor-from-removing-bedford-avenue-bike-lane-10826886>lawsuit that stopped the city from tearing out the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane</a>. He filed an affidavit to keep the lane in place, citing the law that demands notice before safety is stripped away.</p><p>Restler has co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and push for lower speed limits. He has called for more enforcement against illegal parking and reckless driving. But the deaths keep coming.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every delay is a choice. The city has the power to lower speed limits, redesign streets, and end the bloodshed. But power unused is no comfort to the dead.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand action.</strong> Do not wait for another name on the list. The streets will not change themselves. Only people can do that.</p></div></div><div class="mod-contact tc"><h3 class="fw6 mb2">Fix the Problem</h3><button class="dib pv2 ph3 ba b--light-silver br2 bg-dark-gray white pointer" onclick='var el=document.getElementById("contact-card");el.classList.toggle("dn"),el.classList.toggle("flex")'>

DOT spokesman Vin Barone claimed the project would calm traffic and protect cyclists. Advocates accuse Mayor Adams of putting donors over safety. The redesign’s future is uncertain.

The matter, titled 'Locals call for mayor to take immediate action after moped rider injured on McGuinness Boulevard,' highlights the urgent need for the Department of Transportation’s proposed safety redesign. Restler, along with U.S. Rep. Nydia Velázquez, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, and State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, issued a joint statement: 'Lives are being put at risk. We need immediate action by the Mayor's office to implement the Department of Transportation's proposed safety improvements so that everyone in our community can feel confident that McGuinness Boulevard will not cause more tragedies.' The safety plan remains blocked, leaving vulnerable road users exposed to ongoing danger.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, 'A Toyota SUV slammed into the rear of a southbound e-bike. The 20-year-old rider hit the pavement hard. His leg split open. Blood pooled on hot asphalt. Speed did the damage.' The crash left the e-bike rider with severe lacerations to his lower leg and foot. The report lists 'Unsafe Speed' as the contributing factor. The SUV’s center front end struck the e-bike’s rear, causing the rider to fall. The rider was not wearing a helmet, as noted in the report, but the primary cause was the SUV driver’s unsafe speed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The incident, near the site of a 2021 fatality, drew a joint statement from Rep. Nydia Velázquez, Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, and Council Member Lincoln Restler. They called the crash 'entirely predictable' and demanded Mayor Adams immediately implement the Department of Transportation’s stalled safety redesign. The DOT’s plan, which includes narrowing the street and adding a protected bike lane, faces opposition from powerful donors. The mayor’s office claims traffic safety is a priority, but the plan remains in limbo. Advocates and officials say every delay puts more lives at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The meeting followed the death of a P.S. 110 teacher on this deadly street. The original plan, now shelved, promised parking-protected bike lanes and safer crossings. Adams, who once approved the overhaul, reversed course after business pushback. The city now proposes a compromise: two moving lanes for cars and trucks remain on 30% of the corridor. Council Member Lincoln Restler condemned the reversal, saying, 'A compromise plan is a compromise on safety.' Parents echoed this, noting Adams would not commit to the promised changes. Broadway Stages, a local business, backed the compromise. The mayor’s office declined comment.

The bill, introduced in the New York State Legislature, would require drivers with at least six speeding tickets in a single year, or 11 points in 18 months, to install speed limiter devices in their vehicles. The matter summary states: "We are going to literally force you to slow down by requiring you to install a speed limiter on your car." Gounardes led the announcement at the Atlantic Avenue intersection where a driver killed Katherine Harris. Gallagher, co-sponsor, said, "Cars and trucks can act as weapons when used recklessly." The bill aims to bypass bureaucratic hurdles and act automatically, modeled after ignition interlock devices for drunk drivers. Advocates and city officials joined the call, citing data that speed limiters can reduce traffic deaths by 37 percent.

Restler, whose district covers DUMBO, Greenpoint, and Brooklyn Heights, expressed reluctance to push for stricter enforcement, noting that many scooter riders are deliveristas pressured by food delivery apps. Cyclists described collisions, injuries, and a lack of NYPD action. One cyclist, Shari Stadel, suffered a concussion and stitches after a crash with scooters on the Manhattan Bridge. Cyclists and witnesses questioned why laws are not enforced.
