Forty-seven left with injuries that will never heal.</strong> In the last three and a half years, District 33 has seen 6,637 crashes. The numbers are blunt, but the pain is sharp. A cyclist, age 46, killed on Lynch Street. A 45-year-old woman, crushed as a passenger on Flatbush Avenue. A 49-year-old man, struck dead by a bike on India Street. These are not accidents. They are the cost of inaction.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>A child steps into the street and does not come home. A woman waits for the light, a bus takes everything. &ldquo;A 23-year-old woman was critically injured Sunday when she was hit by an MTA bus on a Brooklyn street,&rdquo; <a href=https://nypost.com/2024/05/05/us-news/woman-23-critically-injured-after-struck-by-mta-bus-in-nyc/>police said</a>.

The street does not care about your plans. It only remembers the bodies.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the killing.</strong> Three deaths by SUV. Two by truck. Two by bike. The rest are scattered among buses, vans, and motorcycles. The pattern is clear. The danger is not.</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Council Member Restler has not been silent. He co-sponsored the law that ended jaywalking tickets, shifting blame off pedestrians and onto the street itself. He backed bills to ban parking near crosswalks, require protected bike lanes, and push for speed limiters. He fought illegal police parking, saying cops should not block sidewalks and bike lanes <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/early-addition-the-word-among-nypd-officers-is-stop-parking-on-sidewalks>with impunity</a>. He called for local climate action, more bike lanes, and safer streets <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/brooklyns-district-33-becomes-first-in-nyc-to-release-its-own-climate-plan>for all</a>.</p><p>But the blood keeps flowing. <strong>Four deaths already this year.</strong> The bills are good. The pace is not. &ldquo;We need to roll up our sleeves and take action at the local level, at the neighborhood level on our blocks,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/brooklyns-district-33-becomes-first-in-nyc-to-release-its-own-climate-plan>Restler said</a>. The sleeves are still rolled up. The work is not done.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a failure. Call Council Member Restler. Call the Mayor. Call the DOT. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes and daylighted crosswalks. Demand that the killing stops.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.

Restler said, 'I have no expectations that bold, big projects that can make our streets safer... are going to be happening in this administration.' He revealed the Department of Transportation was told to halt large bike and bus lane expansions due to waning political support. The administration’s actions leave vulnerable road users exposed, as cycling deaths rise and promised safety infrastructure stalls.

The letter urges DOT to 'ensure curb lanes be preserved for safe cyclist passage' and to 'deploy quick-build physical elements' for pedestrian safety. DOT has not responded.

The hearing, led by Transportation Committee chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, pressed DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez for answers. The law requires 150 miles of protected bus lanes and 250 miles of protected bike lanes by 2026. In 2022, the city built only 4.4 miles of bus lanes and 26.3 miles of bike lanes, far short of the legal benchmarks. Councilmember Lincoln Restler criticized political interference, saying, 'We're at a point where it's all politics all the time, and we're failing to execute.'

Restler’s opposition centers on concerns for local safety and access, stating, 'This tranquility will be disrupted when thousands of cars and trucks are rerouted onto these local streets.' Instead, the op-ed supports alternative safety measures such as speed cameras, curb extensions, and increased enforcement.

DOT had previously announced a compromise design after political pressure and opposition from groups like 'Keep McGuinness Moving,' funded by Broadway Stages. Council Member Lincoln Restler, representing the area, said, 'This process has been so messed up that I have no comment.' DOT spokesman Vin Barone claimed the project would calm traffic and protect cyclists. Advocates accuse Mayor Adams of putting donors over safety. The redesign’s future is uncertain.
