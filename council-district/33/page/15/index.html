Forty-six wounded. In District 33, the numbers do not lie. Since 2022, there have been <strong>6,619 crashes</strong>, <strong>3,111 injuries</strong>, and <strong>15 deaths</strong>. The dead include a 49-year-old man struck crossing <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>India Street at Franklin</a>, a 46-year-old cyclist killed on <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Lynch Street</a>, and a 74-year-old e-bike rider crushed at <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Tillary and Jay</a>. Each crash is a life broken. Each number is a name erased.</p><p><strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the killing.</strong> Trucks, bikes, and buses took their share. The street is a gauntlet. No one is safe.</p><h3 id=the-politics-of-delay>The Politics of Delay</h3><p>The city ripped out three blocks of the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane this June. The mayor called it a response to &ldquo;community feedback&rdquo; after &ldquo;several incidents—including some involving children&rdquo; <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/adams-dot-remove-bedford-avenue-bike-lane/>said Mayor Adams</a>. But the numbers on Bedford are older and colder: nearly 700 injured, four pedestrians dead in just four years before the lane. The city replaced protection with paint. The risk remains.</p><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler did not stay silent. &ldquo;For months, the Mayor has repeatedly ignored our recommendations for ensuring the safety of children on Bedford Avenue. And now, instead of identifying solutions that enhance safety for pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers, the Mayor is making a purely political decision to rip out a bike lane with no alternative&rdquo; <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/adams-dot-remove-bedford-avenue-bike-lane/>Restler said</a>. He backed a lawsuit to stop the removal, filing an affidavit to keep the lane in place <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/breaking-activists-sue-city-to-prevent-erasure-of-bedford-avenue-bike-lane>in court</a>.</p><p>Restler has also co-sponsored bills to ban parking near crosswalks, speed up protected bike lanes, and lower speed limits. But the city moves slow. The blood dries before the paint does.</p><h3 id=the-next-fight>The Next Fight</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every rollback, every delay, every shortcut has a cost. The dead do not get a second chance. The living must fight for theirs.</p><p><strong>Call Council Member Restler. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes that stay put. Demand that every child, every elder, every cyclist gets home alive.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report details Rana’s 2018 guilty plea for reckless driving, including speeding, ignoring signals, and driving against traffic without cause. He also falsified 43 command log entries and was often absent or late. Despite this, Rana rose to lead a precinct notorious for placard abuse, illegal parking, and weak traffic enforcement. Council Member Lincoln Restler said, “We have not seen adequate enforcement of illegal parking in the 84 and across the city.” Former Council Member Steve Levin called the violations serious and demanded accountability. Advocates and officials question if Rana’s behavior shapes a culture that endangers pedestrians and cyclists. The NYPD and Rana declined comment.

Emergencies at non-NYCHA properties could override this order, with required notification to local officials. The bill required DOT to report on completed and pending NYCHA sidewalk repairs by June 30, 2023.

The plan, a priority for the Adams administration and MTA, aims to speed up the B41 bus from Downtown Brooklyn to Marine Park. Narcisse and Councilmember Rita Joseph joined Mayor Eric Adams at a press conference, riding the B41 and speaking with riders. Narcisse said, “People are suffering waiting 30 minutes, 40 minutes, it’s unfair to the riders.” She stressed that better bus service could cut down on illegal dollar vans. The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, has started community engagement. Some community boards worry about lost parking, but Rodriguez called their role advisory, saying, “we want to hear what the riders want.” Narcisse acknowledged driver backlash but insisted on the need for faster, reliable transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation opposes this measure. The incident, reported August 5, 2022, highlights weak NYPD enforcement against placard abuse and illegal plate covers. The matter centers on a car parked in a federal zone with obscured plates, a violation of state law. NYPD agents hesitated to act, citing placard status and unclear jurisdiction, but issued a $65 ticket after supervisor intervention. The bill, now in committee, aims to break the cycle of impunity for placard holders. Restler has also called for the elimination of placards entirely, stating, 'there are way too many scofflaw federal officers out there driving way too much to get from their (likely) suburban homes to their free, placard-guaranteed parking space in Lower Manhattan.' The affair exposes systemic failures in protecting pedestrians and cyclists from the dangers of unchecked car privilege.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
