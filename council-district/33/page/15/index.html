Eighteen left with wounds that will not heal. In the last twelve months, District 33 saw <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>1,745 crashes</a>. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>Four children were seriously hurt</a>. A cyclist was killed on Lynch Street. A pedestrian bled out on India Street. These are not just numbers. They are mothers, sons, neighbors. The street does not care if you are young or old. It takes what it wants.</p><p>Cars and SUVs did most of the damage. In three years, they killed five. Bikes killed two. Trucks and buses killed two more. The rest were left broken, sometimes for life. The pain is not spread evenly. The old, the young, the ones on foot or bike—they pay the highest price.</p><h3 id=the-politics-of-safety>The Politics of Safety</h3><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has not been silent. He voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths. He co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a> and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>speed up protected bike lanes</a>. He stood with families when the mayor tried to <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/breaking-activists-sue-city-to-prevent-erasure-of-bedford-avenue-bike-lane>rip out the Bedford Avenue bike lane</a>. “For months, the Mayor has repeatedly ignored our recommendations for ensuring the safety of children on Bedford Avenue,” <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/adams-dot-remove-bedford-avenue-bike-lane/>Restler said</a>. “Instead of identifying solutions that enhance safety for pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers, the Mayor is making a purely political decision to rip out a bike lane with no alternative.”</p><p>When the city tried to erase the lane, a judge <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/court-stops-bedford-avenue-bike-lane-removal/>stopped them</a>. Restler filed an affidavit to keep the protection in place. The fight is not over. The city will try again. The street will claim more lives if nothing changes.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>The disaster is not fate. Every crash is a choice made by someone in power. The council can pass more laws. The mayor can build more barriers. The police can enforce the rules. But none of it matters if the public stays quiet. Contact your council member. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand protected bike lanes that cannot be erased by a backroom deal. Demand that every child can cross the street and come home.</p><p>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The street is hungry. It will not stop on its own.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

He highlights the risk of further delay for the Brooklyn Queens Expressway, a corridor plagued by crashes and pollution.

The sedan's driver and another occupant were not reported injured. The crash data lists 'Traffic Control Disregarded' as the contributing factor. The cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this is noted only after the driver's failure to obey traffic controls.

The bill aimed to 'establish priority for sidewalk repairs at developments operated by the New York City Housing Authority,' giving first priority to senior-only NYCHA buildings, then to other NYCHA sites. Emergencies at non-NYCHA properties could override this order, with required notification to local officials. The bill required DOT to report on completed and pending NYCHA sidewalk repairs by June 30, 2023. Council Member Alexa Avilés sponsored the bill, joined by Abreu, Brooks-Powers, Restler, Hanif, Won, Nurse, Gutiérrez, and Sanchez. The measure was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without enactment.

The plan, a priority for the Adams administration and MTA, aims to speed up the B41 bus from Downtown Brooklyn to Marine Park. Narcisse and Councilmember Rita Joseph joined Mayor Eric Adams at a press conference, riding the B41 and speaking with riders. Narcisse said, “People are suffering waiting 30 minutes, 40 minutes, it’s unfair to the riders.” She stressed that better bus service could cut down on illegal dollar vans. The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, has started community engagement. Some community boards worry about lost parking, but Rodriguez called their role advisory, saying, “we want to hear what the riders want.” Narcisse acknowledged driver backlash but insisted on the need for faster, reliable transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation opposes this measure. The incident, reported August 5, 2022, highlights weak NYPD enforcement against placard abuse and illegal plate covers. The matter centers on a car parked in a federal zone with obscured plates, a violation of state law. NYPD agents hesitated to act, citing placard status and unclear jurisdiction, but issued a $65 ticket after supervisor intervention. The bill, now in committee, aims to break the cycle of impunity for placard holders. Restler has also called for the elimination of placards entirely, stating, 'there are way too many scofflaw federal officers out there driving way too much to get from their (likely) suburban homes to their free, placard-guaranteed parking space in Lower Manhattan.' The affair exposes systemic failures in protecting pedestrians and cyclists from the dangers of unchecked car privilege.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Councilmember Lincoln Restler (District 33) criticized the weakest plan, saying, 'I’m really disappointed that after hearing so clearly from the elected officials in the community, from many thousands of neighborhood residents—that still DOT came forward with this presentation tonight.' Restler and others urged DOT to remove a vehicle lane, citing ongoing deaths and injuries. Over 2,500 residents signed a petition for dramatic change.

Council Member Lincoln Restler, joined by Assembly Member Emily Gallagher and Borough President Antonio Reynoso, criticized DOT’s proposals as 'inadequate.' Restler stated, 'The way we're going to fully connect Greenpoint community and make this street safer is by having less lanes of traffic.' Advocates and residents backed lane reductions and protected bike lanes, citing three deaths since 2014. DOT cited traffic concerns and delayed action.
