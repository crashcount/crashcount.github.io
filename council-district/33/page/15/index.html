Eighteen left with wounds that will not heal.</strong> In the last year alone, District 33 has seen 1,725 crashes. These are not just numbers—they are bodies on the street, families waiting at hospital doors, children who do not come home. In the past twelve months, <strong>one child was killed, thirty-one more injured</strong>. The old and the young, the walker and the cyclist—none are spared.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-the-names-we-bury>Recent Crashes: The Names We Bury</h3><p>A cyclist, helmet on, struck down on Lynch Street. A pedestrian, 49, killed by a bike on Franklin. A 45-year-old woman, crushed in the back seat of an SUV on Flatbush. The dead do not speak, but the living remember. &ldquo;Yeah, this street is dangerous,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-year-old-boy-killed-suv-crossing-intersection-crown-heights-brooklyn/16875804/>said Milli Cent</a>. The city moves on. The blood dries. The danger remains.</p><h3 id=who-pays-who-acts>Who Pays, Who Acts</h3><p><strong>Most injuries come from cars and trucks—390 cases, with five deaths.</strong> Bikes and mopeds kill too, but the steel and speed of larger vehicles do the worst. The city blames the walker, the biker, the child. But the street stays the same. The law stays the same.</p><p>Council Member Lincoln Restler has not been silent. He backed the law that <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>lets pedestrians cross anywhere</a>, ending the charade of jaywalking. He co-sponsored bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>, <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>speed up protected bike lanes</a>, and <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>raise SUV fees</a>. When the city tried to rip out the Bedford Avenue bike lane, Restler stood with the families and said, &ldquo;For months, the Mayor has repeatedly ignored our recommendations for ensuring the safety of children on Bedford Avenue&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/06/17/breaking-activists-sue-city-to-prevent-erasure-of-bedford-avenue-bike-lane>said Restler</a>.</p><p>But the deaths keep coming. The city drags its feet. The next name is already written.</p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay, every watered-down bill, every excuse is another body on the street. Call Council Member Restler. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand protected lanes that do not vanish overnight. <strong>Do not wait for the next siren.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On February 10, 2023, eighteen Brooklyn lawmakers issued a joint letter demanding New York State Department of Transportation (DOT) participate in comprehensive planning for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The statement, prompted by a Streetsblog report, reads: "We ask that the NYS DOT remember the daily harms caused by the BQE in its current state—not just the crumbling cantilever section—and join us at the table in search of a solution." The group includes Reps. Nydia Velázquez, Dan Goldman, Borough President Antonio Reynoso, state Sens. Jabari Brisport, Julia Salazar, Kristen Gonzalez, Andrew Gounardes, Assembly Members Bobby Carroll, Maritza Davila, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Emily Gallagher, Jo Anne Simon, Marcela Mitaynes, and Council Members Alexa Avilés, Shahana Hanif, Crystal Hudson, Jennifer Gutiérrez, and Lincoln Restler. Senator Gounardes called the state’s refusal to join the city’s visioning process “unacceptable and irresponsible.” The lawmakers stress that the BQE’s harms—crashes, pollution, division—stretch from Bay Ridge to Greenpoint. Without state action, only city-owned segments see attention. The city’s efforts are limited. The state’s inaction leaves systemic danger unaddressed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as a public safety issue, exposes a gap in city enforcement. Brooks-Powers’s action responds to calls for accountability, as highlighted in the article: 'there will be a hearing on obscured plates.' Despite City Hall’s claim that 'obscuring and defacing license plates is against the law' and that enforcement is increasing, the streets tell a different story. Unreadable plates let reckless drivers escape detection. Vulnerable road users—pedestrians, cyclists, passengers—face greater risk.

The matter summary reads: 'proposing three similar options for a redesign that will restore three lanes of traffic in each direction, with a park on top.' Liz Denys of Bridges 4 People called out the city for ignoring creative ideas and failing to reduce car and truck traffic. William Meehan criticized the focus on beautification over safety. Council Member Lincoln Restler urged a reduction in car impacts, while Borough President Antonio Reynoso condemned the neglect of environmental justice. Advocates say the plan keeps vulnerable road users in danger and misses a chance to make streets safer.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Restler is the lead sponsor. In a published opinion, critics argue the bill creates conflict, erodes trust, and places the burden of enforcement on vulnerable road users. The statement warns, 'By devolving responsibility for street safety to cyclists and pedestrians, Restler abdicates the role of government and places the burden—and by extension, the blame—back on the victims.'

The matter arose after attorney Adam White was arrested for removing plastic from an obscured license plate; charges were later dropped by Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez, citing 'insufficient evidence.' The bill, discussed at a press conference, aims to crack down on license plate defacement and illegal parking, which Restler says is rampant among city workers and police. State Sen. Andrew Gounardes introduced a similar bill at the state level.

The effort follows years of rising congestion and danger for pedestrians between the Brooklyn Bridge and Navy Yard.

Restler said, 'It’s a moment for us to pause and think and plan how to move pedestrian and vehicular traffic much safer.' Locals like Mallory Kasdan called for more stop signs and enforcement. Despite some calls for pedestrianization, the study will not consider a full car ban.

Restler and Brooks-Powers are refining the process to avoid the pitfalls of the city’s anti-idling law, which discourages participation.
