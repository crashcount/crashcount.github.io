Forty-six seriously injured. In the last three years, District 33 has seen 6,556 crashes. <strong>Children limp home. Cyclists do not.</strong> A man steps from his car in Greenpoint. An e-bike runs the stop sign. He dies on the spot. The rider stays. No arrest. The street stays the same.</p><p><strong>SUVs, trucks, bikes, buses—each leaves its mark.</strong> Cars and SUVs killed three. Trucks and buses killed two. Bikes killed two.

He stood with advocates for speed limiters on repeat offenders. He supports the Bedford Avenue protected bike lane, even as party bosses <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/28/democratic-party-machine-joins-the-bikelash-on-bedford-avenue>try to kill it</a>.

The event came as the public comment period for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Central Business District Tolling Program ended. The plan would toll drivers entering Manhattan below 60th Street, aiming to cut traffic and pollution. Restler said, “This is a tangible, major, sweeping policy that will dramatically reduce the number of cars and trucks on the street in New York City.” He supported limited exemptions, especially for taxis and for-hire vehicles, but stressed the need to keep cars off the road. The rally urged the Federal Highway Administration to approve the plan, which is expected to shift commuters to mass transit and modernize city infrastructure. Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon also backed a taxi carveout.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The statement, titled 'Congestion Pricing Benefits Are Inarguable; Its Minor Problems are Easily Fixable,' urged city, state, and federal leaders to advance the Central Business District Tolling Program. Wright said, 'Congestion pricing will have benefits for communities across the city and region: It will reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality. It will raise vital revenue for public transit. It will make the transportation system more equitable.' Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Council Member Lincoln Restler planned a rally in support. The statement acknowledged minor impacts, like increased traffic on select highways, but insisted these can be addressed by electrifying fleets and capping highways. The focus remained on the program’s broad benefits for vulnerable road users and city residents.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Gallagher said, 'Quick, iterative incremental changes will be a great way to reduce injuries and fatalities rather than waiting for an entire overhaul.' Council Member Lincoln Restler praised the upgrades as 'a step in the right direction.' Bronwyn Breitner of Make McGuinness Safe Coalition called for a full-scale redesign, reallocating space from cars to people.

The Department of Transportation opposes this measure. The incident, reported August 5, 2022, highlights weak NYPD enforcement against placard abuse and illegal plate covers. The matter centers on a car parked in a federal zone with obscured plates, a violation of state law. NYPD agents hesitated to act, citing placard status and unclear jurisdiction, but issued a $65 ticket after supervisor intervention. The bill, now in committee, aims to break the cycle of impunity for placard holders. Restler has also called for the elimination of placards entirely, stating, 'there are way too many scofflaw federal officers out there driving way too much to get from their (likely) suburban homes to their free, placard-guaranteed parking space in Lower Manhattan.' The affair exposes systemic failures in protecting pedestrians and cyclists from the dangers of unchecked car privilege.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill required owners of commercial buildings over 500,000 square feet to submit and carry out delivery and servicing plans. The matter summary reads: 'creating an office of sustainable delivery systems and requiring large generator of truck traffic buildings to produce and implement a delivery and servicing plan.' Council Member Gale A. Brewer sponsored the bill, joined by Rivera, Gutiérrez, Restler, Won, Sanchez, and Cabán. The bill called for on-site loading, delivery reservations, and off-peak scheduling to cut truck traffic and street loading. It would have created a new city office to oversee compliance and penalize violators. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023.

He targets abuse by city officials and fake permits. His bill exempts people with disabilities. Another measure rewards whistleblowers. The Council should pass both. The city’s streets demand it.</p><p class=mb3>On June 7, 2022, Councilman Lincoln Restler (District 33) announced legislation to revoke tens of thousands of personal vehicle parking placards, with exemptions for people with disabilities and those covered by collective bargaining. The editorial, titled 'Free perking: Pull back run amok NYC parking placards,' calls out rampant placard abuse: 'End this scam.' Restler’s companion bill would reward whistleblowers who report cheaters with 25% of fines collected. Both measures have four co-sponsors. The editorial urges the Council to pass the bills and for Mayor Adams to sign them. Placard abuse fuels lawless parking, endangering pedestrians and cyclists. The city’s lack of oversight lets drivers block crosswalks and bike lanes. Restler’s push aims to restore fairness and safety to New York’s streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Restler wants action.</p><p class=mb3>On June 3, 2022, Council Member Lincoln Restler (District 33) introduced two bills in the City Council. The legislation, now in committee, aims to revoke about 60,000 city-issued parking placards and create a civilian enforcement program. The matter summary states: 'legislation seeks to curb the misuse of parking placards by government employees by revoking thousands of the permits and empowering New Yorkers to report drivers who abuse their parking privileges.' Restler, the sponsor, said, 'We have illegal placard activities on every block, and it actually makes our streets unsafe.' The bills target the rampant abuse that blocks intersections, sidewalks, and bike lanes, especially in Downtown Brooklyn. The civilian enforcement bill would let New Yorkers report violations and collect a share of fines. Transportation advocates back the effort, calling placard abuse 'city-approved corruption.' The legislation seeks to restore safety and access for people on foot, bikes, and transit.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
