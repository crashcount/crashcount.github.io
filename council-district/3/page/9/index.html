Fifty-seven left with serious injuries.</strong> Two thousand five hundred and one injured since 2022. The streets run through the <a href=/neighborhood/mn0203/>West Village</a>, <a href=/neighborhood/mn0401/>Chelsea-Hudson Yards</a>, <a href=/neighborhood/mn0402/>Hell&rsquo;s Kitchen</a>, and <a href=/neighborhood/mn0501/>Midtown South-Flatiron-Union Square</a>. The wounds are fresh. In May, a 34-year-old man was killed at the intersection of 7th Avenue and West 36th Street by an SUV. The cause: driver inattention. In April, a 39-year-old pedestrian was crushed by a box truck on West 40th Street. In May, a garbage truck backed over a 35-year-old man on Cornelia Street. These are not accidents. They are the cost of inaction.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>A dozen people hurt when buses collided at Port Authority just this July. Fourteen more treated for injuries. One driver trapped, pulled out by emergency crews. The terminal shut down for hours. The news <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/more-than-a-dozen-hurt-when-buses-collide-at-port-authority-terminal/>reported</a>, &ldquo;Port Authority Bus Terminal is closed and 14 people are being treated for non-life-threatening injuries, authorities said.&rdquo;</p><p>On the street, the story is the same. Trucks, SUVs, taxis, bikes. The city counts the bodies. The families count the days since.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-stalled>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Stalled</h3><p>Council Member <strong>Erik Bottcher</strong> has backed bills to clear sightlines at crosswalks, expand protected bike lanes, and end the criminalization of jaywalking. He sponsored a <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>bill to ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks</a>, aiming to daylight 1,000 intersections a year. He voted yes to legalize jaywalking, shifting blame away from pedestrians. He <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/6th-avenue-protected-bike-lane/>praised the new protected bike lane on Sixth Avenue</a>, saying, &ldquo;By completing the Sixth Avenue bike lane, we are not only improving the safety of cyclists but also enhancing the overall experience for pedestrians and drivers alike.&rdquo;</p><p>But the pace is slow. The danger is not. The city <a href=https://www.amny.com/transit/nyc-redesigned-1200-intersections-2022-adams/>redesigns intersections</a>, but the death toll does not fall fast enough. <strong>Every day without change is another day of risk.</strong></p><h3 id=the-next-fight>The Next Fight</h3><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylighting at every intersection. Demand that every bill moves, every promise kept.</strong> The blood on the street is not washed away by words.

No summons was issued to the driver or passenger for the illegal act. The area, plagued by 913 crashes in three years, has injured dozens of cyclists and pedestrians. Council Member Erik Bottcher and State Senator Brad Hoylman responded by rallying with advocacy groups, demanding protected bike lanes on 10th and 11th avenues. Hoylman tweeted, 'The City must make the streets of the West Side safer!' The Hudson River Greenway, a nearby bike path, bans legal e-bikes, forcing riders like Kwan onto dangerous streets.

Brannan led sponsorship, joined by Ayala, Menin, Louis, Hanif, Hudson, Bottcher, Farías, Brooks-Powers, and Brewer. The resolution slams service caps and fare surcharges, calling them 'inequitable and unjust.' It demands that paratransit users get the same fare, hours, and ride freedom as subway and bus riders. The bill would end rationing and financial barriers for disabled New Yorkers who rely on Access-A-Ride.

Bottcher, speaking before DOT and backed by advocates and community boards, described the avenues as 'four-lane highways' with no safe infrastructure. He called for protected bike lanes, pedestrian refuge islands, and strict enforcement against illegal parking in loading zones. Bottcher shared his own near-miss while biking, saying, 'I was inches from the wheels of an 18-wheel truck.' DOT acknowledged his push and promised to prioritize safety. Bottcher stressed the need for resources to fix dangerous intersections and pressed the city to act before more lives are lost.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
