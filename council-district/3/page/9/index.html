Police recorded failure to yield by the driver. She was unconscious and bleeding when EMS arrived (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Since Jan 1, 2022, in Council District 3, there have been <strong>25 people killed</strong> and <strong>3,630 injured</strong> in traffic crashes, across <strong>8,291</strong> reported collisions (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). People walking account for 10 of those deaths and 1,105 injuries; people on bikes for 4 deaths and 875 injuries (same source).</p><p>This year, crashes stand at <strong>1,398</strong> versus <strong>1,595</strong> at this point last year.

First, lower the default speed limit using Sammy’s Law. Second, stop repeat offenders with mandatory speed limiters after a threshold of tickets. The Stop Super Speeders Act would require it. Both are laid out here with contacts and scripts: <strong><a href=/take_action/>Take action</a></strong>.</p><p>On Aug 20, a left turn on Broadway put a woman on the pavement.
