A box truck rolls south. The man does not get up. He dies where he sits. The driver is 75. No arrest. No charges. The city moves on. <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/pedestrain-fatally-struck-box-truck-manhattan-police>Police said the victim was pronounced dead at the scene</a>.</p><p>A uniformed officer walks to his car at W. 13th and Seventh. A black Dodge Charger spins out. The officer tries to run. The car pins him against his own cruiser. Both men survive, but not without scars. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/14/nypd-officer-struck-and-pinned-by-out-of-control-dodge-charger-in-manhattan/>&ldquo;The driver of the Charger appeared to be speeding,&rdquo;</a> a witness told the Daily News.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>District 3 saw 2 deaths, 784 injuries, and 22 serious injuries</strong>. The dead do not get a second chance. The injured carry it with them. The numbers do not flinch.</p><h2 id=leadership-laws-and-limits>Leadership: Laws and Limits</h2><p>Council Member Erik Bottcher has not been silent. He sponsored a bill to ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks, forcing daylight into the blind corners where people die. The bill would require the city to install barriers at 1,000 intersections a year. It sits in committee. No vote. No law.</p><p>Bottcher voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a rule that punished the desperate and the hurried but did nothing to slow the cars. He backed the SAFE Streets Act, pushing Albany to let the city set lower speed limits and give crash victims more rights. He called for more protected bike lanes, more light, more space for people. But the pace is slow. The danger is not.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>The city knows what works.</strong> Speed kills. Trucks crush. Corners hide. Every delay means another family waits for news that will break them. <strong>Contact your council member. Demand a vote on the daylighting bill. Demand real protected bike lanes. Demand lower speed limits.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another body in the road.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Avilés, at the hearing, said, 'The Red Hook community has not seen economic benefit from this or any other cruise deal—we have seen a negative benefit, and that is traffic, unwieldy, businesses closing because workers can’t get there, honking, car crashes.' The bill also demands traffic mitigation plans for cruise departures. Residents and advocates say the city’s cruise terminals bring only pollution, congestion, and risk to vulnerable road users.

The impact set off a chain reaction, tangling twelve vehicles. The report lists 'Alcohol Involvement' as a contributing factor, stating one driver had been drinking. The woman was not in the roadway at the time. The police report highlights the driver's error—backing up while impaired—as the direct cause of the injury and the pileup. No victim action contributed to the crash. The incident exposes the lethal risk of impaired driving on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill aimed to prohibit parking, standing, stopping, or operating a motor vehicle with obscured or defaced license plates. The matter summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting the parking, standing, stopping, or operation of a motor vehicle with obscured or defaced license plates.' Council Members Oswald Feliz (primary), Gale A. Brewer, Erik D. Bottcher, and Robert F. Holden sponsored the measure. It would have imposed fines up to $1,000 and jail time for repeat offenders. The bill was filed at session’s end, leaving enforcement unchanged. Vulnerable road users remain exposed to drivers who hide from accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Danger grows for all outside a car.</p><p class=mb3>On September 21, 2023, Council Members Alexa Avilés and Erik Bottcher introduced a bill targeting cruise ship traffic and pollution in Red Hook. The proposal, discussed at a City Council press conference, would require the Economic Development Corporation (EDC) to mandate shore power use and enforce traffic mitigation plans for cruise ships. Avilés declared, 'Our residents are suffocating and the city must act.' The bill responds to chaos caused by ships like the MSC Meraviglia, which brings thousands of passengers and vehicles, blocking streets and the B61 bus. Unlike other lines, MSC offers no shuttle, forcing more cars onto local roads. The EDC claims traffic has improved, but local counts and residents say otherwise. Businesses see little benefit. The bill aims to cut pollution and congestion, but the city has yet to act.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
