Fifty-seven left with serious injuries.</strong> More than 2,500 hurt since 2022. The dead include pedestrians crushed by trucks on Cornelia Street, a man struck by an SUV at 36th and 7th, and a cyclist thrown to the pavement. The city’s streets do not forgive mistakes. They punish the vulnerable.</p><p>Just last year, a garbage truck backed over a man on Cornelia Street. He died in the road. On 7th Avenue, a distracted driver in a new SUV hit a pedestrian at the intersection. He did not get up. These are not isolated events. They are the cost of delay, the price of inaction.</p><h3 id=buses-collide-commuters-bleed>Buses Collide, Commuters Bleed</h3><p>On July 2, <strong>three NJ Transit buses crashed at the Port Authority Terminal</strong>. Fourteen people were hurt. One was trapped and had to be pulled out by emergency crews. &ldquo;One with moderate injuries that required extrication, 10 patients with minor injuries all transported to local area hospitals,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/port-authority-bus-terminal-accident-nyc/>said FDNY Deputy Chief Jason Saffon</a>. The crash shut down the terminal for hours. The city rerouted buses. The morning commute became a scene of blood and sirens. The cause is still under investigation, but the pattern is clear: <strong>crowded streets, heavy vehicles, and not enough protection for the people inside or outside them</strong>.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>Council Member Erik Bottcher has taken steps. He sponsored a bill to ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and force the city to clear sightlines at 1,000 intersections a year. The <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>bill is still waiting for a vote</a>. Bottcher also voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that often punished the victim instead of the driver. &ldquo;Drivers are illegally concealing, obscuring, and defacing their license plates to continue to speed with impunity,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/29/cm-bottcher-city-must-publicly-report-on-plate-covering-perps>Bottcher said</a>, pushing for more transparency on enforcement.</p><p>But the deaths continue. The bills move slow. The streets do not wait.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every death is a warning. Every injury is a call. Demand more. Call Council Member Bottcher. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand action before another body hits the pavement.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for the next siren. Make the call.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
