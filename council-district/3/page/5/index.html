Fifty-seven suffered serious injuries. Two thousand five hundred and one were hurt. These are not just numbers. They are lives ended, bodies broken, families left with empty chairs.</p><p><strong>The past year brought no relief.</strong> In the last twelve months, two more deaths. Twenty-two more with injuries so grave they may never walk the same. Seven hundred seventy-eight hurt. The wounds keep coming, slow and steady, like the traffic that never stops.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-the-cost-of-delay>Recent Crashes: The Cost of Delay</h3><p>Just weeks ago, a taxi struck a pedestrian at West 51st and 8th. In April, a box truck killed a man on West 40th. In May, a sedan hit a pedestrian at Bleecker. The pattern is clear. <strong>Most victims are on foot. Most drivers walk away.</strong></p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>Council Member Erik Bottcher has backed bills to clear sightlines at crosswalks, expand protected bike lanes, and legalize safe crossings for pedestrians. He voted yes to end jaywalking enforcement, shifting blame off those on foot and onto the system that fails them. &ldquo;By completing the Sixth Avenue bike lane, we are not only improving the safety of cyclists but also enhancing the overall experience for pedestrians and drivers alike,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/6th-avenue-protected-bike-lane/>Bottcher said</a>. He called for more space for people, less for cars. But the pace is slow. Paint fades. Concrete takes years.</p><p>The bills are on the table. Some are stuck in committee. Some are law, but not yet real on the street. <strong>The danger remains.</strong></p><h3 id=the-call-demand-action-not-excuses>The Call: Demand Action, Not Excuses</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong> Call Council Member Bottcher. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand protected space for every person on foot or bike. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, heard in committee, would require cruise ships at city terminals to connect to electric shore power or be barred from docking. The matter summary states: 'Fossil fuel-emitting cruise ships would have to walk the plank and abandon New York City ports unless they plug into clean shore power for energy.' Avilés, at the hearing, said, 'The Red Hook community has not seen economic benefit from this or any other cruise deal—we have seen a negative benefit, and that is traffic, unwieldy, businesses closing because workers can’t get there, honking, car crashes.' The bill also demands traffic mitigation plans for cruise departures. Residents and advocates say the city’s cruise terminals bring only pollution, congestion, and risk to vulnerable road users.

Unregistered mopeds menace streets. Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price. The measure aims to close loopholes and cut illegal, dangerous riding.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0024-2024 sits with the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced February 8, 2024, it urges Albany to pass A.8052 and S.7703. The resolution calls for 'purchasers of limited use motorcycles present a driver’s license appropriate for the legal operation... and register such limited use motorcycles, prior to completing a purchase.' Council Member Gale A. Brewer leads, joined by Rivera, Schulman, Krishnan, Won, Bottcher, and others. The bills would require dealers to check licenses and register mopeds at sale. The Council notes that illegal, unregistered mopeds endanger pedestrians, cyclists, and riders. NYPD seized over 8,600 illegal mopeds by September 2023. The resolution presses for safeguards to keep unlicensed, unregistered vehicles off city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

At least 450 corridors must be contiguous to others with new or existing lighting. Council Member Selvena N.

The campaign, titled 'Slow Your Roll, Respect The Stroll,' urges cyclists to stop at red lights and avoid sidewalks, but Bottcher stressed, 'the vast majority of deaths and injuries are caused by cars.' Bottcher and Hoylman-Sigal both called out reckless drivers as the real threat. Assembly Member Tony Simone joined, pushing for statewide laws to curb dangerous delivery app practices. Ligia Guallpa of the Workers Justice Project highlighted how apps force delivery workers into risky behavior, but noted that new minimum pay rates help slow things down. The campaign focuses on education, not punishment, and centers the voices of workers and vulnerable road users.
