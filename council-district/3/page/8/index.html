Since 2022, <strong>19 people have died</strong> and <strong>2,729 have been injured</strong> in crashes. <strong>Sixty-three were left with serious injuries</strong>—lives changed in a blink. The dead do not speak. The injured carry the story in scars and limps.</p><p>Just last week, a 65-year-old e-bike rider was struck on Second Avenue. The driver fled, drove onto the sidewalk, and later told police he ran because he had no license. The cyclist was left with critical head trauma. The paper said, &ldquo;He now faces charges of leaving the scene of an accident that caused serious injury and driving without a license&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/driver-arrested-after-hitting-65-year-old-e-biker-on-second-ave-XF4896347>West Side Spirit</a>).</p><p>On Cornelia Street, a truck backed over a 35-year-old man.

Motorcycles and mopeds left dozens hurt. The street is a gauntlet, and the most vulnerable—walkers, cyclists, the old—pay the highest price.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member <strong>Erik Bottcher has backed bills to clear abandoned cars, speed up pavement markings, and require daylighting at crosswalks</strong>—all steps to clear sightlines and slow the street’s violence. He voted to <strong>decriminalize jaywalking</strong>, a move to stop blaming the dead for their own deaths. He co-sponsored a bill to force the city to report on drivers who cover their plates to dodge speed cameras, saying, &ldquo;drivers are illegally concealing, obscuring, and defacing their license plates to continue to speed with impunity&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/29/cm-bottcher-city-must-publicly-report-on-plate-covering-perps>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>But the pace is slow.
