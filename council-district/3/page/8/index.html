A box truck rolls south. The man does not get up. He dies where he sits. The driver is 75. No arrest. No charges. The city moves on. <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/pedestrain-fatally-struck-box-truck-manhattan-police>Police said the victim was pronounced dead at the scene</a>.</p><p>A uniformed officer walks to his car at W. 13th and Seventh. A black Dodge Charger spins out. The officer tries to run. The car pins him against his own cruiser. Both men survive, but not without scars. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/03/14/nypd-officer-struck-and-pinned-by-out-of-control-dodge-charger-in-manhattan/>&ldquo;The driver of the Charger appeared to be speeding,&rdquo;</a> a witness told the Daily News.</p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>District 3 saw 2 deaths, 784 injuries, and 22 serious injuries</strong>.

He sponsored a bill to ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks, forcing daylight into the blind corners where people die. The bill would require the city to install barriers at 1,000 intersections a year. It sits in committee. No vote. No law.</p><p>Bottcher voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a rule that punished the desperate and the hurried but did nothing to slow the cars. He backed the SAFE Streets Act, pushing Albany to let the city set lower speed limits and give crash victims more rights. He called for more protected bike lanes, more light, more space for people. But the pace is slow. The danger is not.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>The city knows what works.</strong> Speed kills. Trucks crush. Corners hide. Every delay means another family waits for news that will break them. <strong>Contact your council member. Demand a vote on the daylighting bill. Demand real protected bike lanes. Demand lower speed limits.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another body in the road.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The push follows blood on the street.</p><p class=mb3>On July 1, 2022, Council Member Keith Powers and Manhattan officials called for the pedestrianization of Broadway in Midtown. The proposal urges the Department of Transportation to close Broadway to most vehicles between 14th and 34th Streets next year, with future expansion to 42nd Street. The matter follows a severe June 20 crash where a taxi hit a cyclist. The politicians’ letter states: 'A safer, more pedestrian-friendly corridor must be achieved quickly.' Powers, along with Mark Levine, Carlina Rivera, and Erik Bottcher, argue the city’s current plan—limited to small plazas and traffic restrictions—is not enough. They demand bold action to protect pedestrians and cyclists. The city’s response: their plans already include many changes, but the council members say it falls short.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Few students get lessons now. The Department of Education drags its feet. Advocates want more: protected lanes, safe routes. Drivers hold the real power. Kids need more than lessons. They need safe streets.</p><p class=mb3>On April 29, 2022, Council Members Erik Bottcher, Rita Joseph, and Selvena Brooks-Powers introduced a resolution urging the Department of Education to teach bicycle safety in all New York City public schools. The resolution states: 'Providing instruction in bicycle and traffic safety in schools, starting at an early age and continuing throughout students' years in school, would be an effective measure to both promote cycling and prevent bicycle accidents and other safety incidents.' Bottcher criticized the Department of Education for failing to follow the law, noting only a handful of schools offer bike lessons. Bottcher said, 'We want to see that program enlarged significantly.' Advocates support the push but warn that education alone is not enough. Julie Huntington stressed, 'This announcement must come with an investment in building protected bike lanes and safe routes to school to keep our new riders safe.' Bottcher put the responsibility on drivers: 'Drivers are in the vehicle that weighs thousands of pounds... if they hit someone with their car, it’s very likely they could take their life.' The council’s action highlights a gap between policy and real safety for children on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Stevens led as primary sponsor, joined by 26 co-sponsors including Hudson, Williams, Restler, Krishnan, and others.

Vulnerable New Yorkers pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On April 12, 2022, the City Council held an oversight hearing on placard abuse and enforcement. The new Department of Investigation (DOI) boss, Jocelyn Strauber, hesitated to confirm if placard abuse is a problem, despite a 2019 law requiring DOI and NYPD to investigate and report on the issue. Council Member Erik Bottcher pressed Strauber, citing resident complaints about fake placards and blocked curbs. Bottcher said, 'NYPD traffic enforcement agents are not issuing tickets to many people using counterfeit placards.' Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized the lack of a digital placard system and is drafting new enforcement legislation. Local Law 6 mandates weekly sweeps and monthly reports, but agencies have failed to comply. The Adams administration has not advanced citizen enforcement. The result: curb space remains dangerous and inaccessible for pedestrians, cyclists, and those who need it most.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law ordered NYPD to inspect 25 blocks weekly for placard abuse and another 25 for blocked bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, and crosswalks. The Department of Investigation (DOI) was to review and report by September 30, 2020. Agencies missed deadlines, citing pandemic and staffing shortages. Councilmember Erik Bottcher, representing District 3, pressed for action, saying businesses suffered from fake placards. The hearing highlighted the matter: 'Standing still zone: Two-year-old parking placard abuse probe stuck in bureaucratic time warp, NYC investigator blames COVID.' Advocates and @placardabuse called the delays corrupt and dangerous. Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance said placard abuse is no victimless crime, making streets more dangerous and slowing buses.
