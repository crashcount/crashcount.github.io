A box truck. A person down. Two dead along that spine since 2022. Seventy‑one injured there too. This is not a surprise. It is a record. It sits in the open data.</p><p><strong>Twelve people are dead here since 2022.</strong> Eight were on foot. Two were on bikes. The city logged 6,534 crashes, 2,812 injuries, and 65 serious injuries in this council district over the period covered. Trucks and buses struck and injured dozens of pedestrians; SUVs and cars hit far more. The hurt piles up in daylight and dark.</p><h3 id=night-bleeds>Night bleeds</h3><p>The map is loud at night. District 3 shows spikes from 11 p.m. to 1 a.m., and again at 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. In the 11 p.m. hour, two deaths; at midnight, two more; 1 a.m. holds steady; 3 a.m. and 5 a.m., another each; 11 p.m. to 1 a.m. again at 11 p.m. and midnight with two each; 11 p.m. has five serious injuries. The late hours keep taking.</p><p>A man, 34, died in the crosswalk at 7th Avenue and West 36th Street. The record notes driver distraction. It was 11:31 p.m. The SUV “going straight ahead.” The person “killed.” The rest is blank. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data lists it</a>.</p><h3 id=heavy-steel-soft-bodies>Heavy steel, soft bodies</h3><p>Trucks kill here. A 39‑year‑old pedestrian died under a 2018 box truck at West 40th Street and 9th Avenue just after 3 a.m. The file reads “Crush Injuries.” Another person, 35, was killed by a reversing garbage truck on Cornelia Street at 5:22 a.m. The database says “Backing Unsafely.” These are lines in a spreadsheet. They are also lives. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The crash IDs are there</a>.</p><p>Across the district, SUVs led in pedestrian toll: 230 pedestrian strikes, including deaths. Trucks followed with 61. Taxis hit 102. Bikes hit 121. The pattern is plain in the rollup. No one should have to memorize it to stay alive.</p><h3 id=corners-that-hide-and-corridors-that-race>Corners that hide and corridors that race</h3><p>The danger clusters on wide avenues. Two deaths and 71 injuries are logged along <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>8 Avenue</a>. Another death and 44 injuries on <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>11 Avenue</a>. Avenue of the Americas shows 72 injuries. Seven Avenue shows 74. Sightlines fail. Turns cut. People step and vanish behind parked metal.</p><p>At Avenue of the Americas and Bleecker, a driver died in a late‑night collision with a taxi in 2023. The taxi was parked. The SUV hit “center front end.” The entry says “Apparent Death.” There is no why. Only when and where. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The open data entry is here</a>.</p><h3 id=city-hall-says-fix-the-street-when>City Hall says fix the street. When?</h3><p>On Canal Street, after two people were killed by a driver reported at 109 mph, the city promised barriers, lower speeds, and narrower lanes. “We are taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection,” said the transportation commissioner. Advocates warned the rest of the corridor “will remain deadly.” The promise matters. So does the delay. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Gothamist reported it</a> and <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/07/chinatown-deadly-crash-safety-upgrades-canal-street>NY1 confirmed</a>.</p><p>On 14th Street, the city says a redesign begins next year to “improve the pedestrian experience,” backed by $3 million with BID money in the mix. A plan on paper does not stop a truck at 3 a.m. It could, if it arrives on time and with steel and stone. <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/15/redesign-of-14th-street-to-kick-off-next-year>NY1 has the details</a>.</p><h3 id=tools-on-the-table-still-unused>Tools on the table, still unused</h3><p>Council Member Erik Bottcher is pushing a law to clear 20 feet at crosswalks. Daylighting. A thousand intersections a year. The bill was laid over. Cars keep hiding people at the corner. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Council records show it</a>.</p><p>The Council moved other pieces. Removing derelict cars within 72 hours passed. So did decals on taxi doors to warn riders to look for cyclists. Bottcher voted yes.

Make the 20‑foot no‑parking rule real, fast. Harden the turn radii. Protect the walk.</li><li>Install leading pedestrian intervals and hardened turns at the worst corners named in the city’s own data.</li><li>Set truck routes off narrow residential blocks like Cornelia. Enforce backing bans where people live and walk.</li></ul><h3 id=the-citywide-moves-that-would-matter>The citywide moves that would matter</h3><p>Lower speeds save lives.
