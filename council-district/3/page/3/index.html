Fifty-seven suffered serious injuries. Two thousand five hundred and one were hurt. These are not just numbers. They are lives ended, bodies broken, families left with empty chairs.</p><p><strong>The past year brought no relief.</strong> In the last twelve months, two more deaths. Twenty-two more with injuries so grave they may never walk the same. Seven hundred seventy-eight hurt. The wounds keep coming, slow and steady, like the traffic that never stops.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-the-cost-of-delay>Recent Crashes: The Cost of Delay</h3><p>Just weeks ago, a taxi struck a pedestrian at West 51st and 8th. In April, a box truck killed a man on West 40th. In May, a sedan hit a pedestrian at Bleecker. The pattern is clear. <strong>Most victims are on foot. Most drivers walk away.</strong></p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>Council Member Erik Bottcher has backed bills to clear sightlines at crosswalks, expand protected bike lanes, and legalize safe crossings for pedestrians. He voted yes to end jaywalking enforcement, shifting blame off those on foot and onto the system that fails them. &ldquo;By completing the Sixth Avenue bike lane, we are not only improving the safety of cyclists but also enhancing the overall experience for pedestrians and drivers alike,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/6th-avenue-protected-bike-lane/>Bottcher said</a>. He called for more space for people, less for cars. But the pace is slow. Paint fades. Concrete takes years.</p><p>The bills are on the table. Some are stuck in committee. Some are law, but not yet real on the street. <strong>The danger remains.</strong></p><h3 id=the-call-demand-action-not-excuses>The Call: Demand Action, Not Excuses</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of risk.</strong> Call Council Member Bottcher. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand protected space for every person on foot or bike. <strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The project, part of the city’s Streets Plan, was announced by DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. Council Member Erik Bottcher, representing District 3, praised the completion, saying, “By completing the Sixth Avenue bike lane, we are not only improving the safety of cyclists but also enhancing the overall experience for pedestrians and drivers alike.” The new lane replaces a car lane, widens space for bikes, and redesigns intersections to shorten pedestrian crossings and slow turning vehicles. Transportation advocates and Manhattan Community Board 2 support the project. DOT data shows protected bike lanes cut total deaths and serious injuries by 18.1%, and pedestrian deaths and serious injuries by 29.1%.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill is 'Laid Over in Committee.' Its title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting standing or parking a vehicle within 20 feet of a crosswalk at an intersection.' Council Member Erik D. Bottcher is the primary sponsor, joined by Julie Won, Jumaane Williams, and others. The bill prohibits standing or parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and mandates the Department of Transportation to install daylighting barriers at a minimum of 1,000 intersections per year. The law also requires citywide outreach and reporting. This measure aims to keep sightlines clear at crossings, a known danger zone for people on foot and bike. The bill has not yet received a vote.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The crash occurred at 22:40, when the taxi, described as a 2023 Ford, made a left turn and its front end hit the cyclist’s head. The police report lists 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' as a contributing factor for the driver, highlighting a critical error that led to the collision. The cyclist suffered crush injuries to the head and was found unconscious at the scene. The report also notes 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' and that the cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but these are mentioned only after the primary driver error.

The piece, titled 'Eliminating ‘parking minimums’ in NYC can help ease the housing crisis,' argues that required parking spaces in new developments block affordable housing and favor cars over people. Bottcher writes, 'By eliminating parking minimums, we can unlock the potential for more housing units in buildings across the city.' He highlights that parking mandates raise construction costs, limit design, and disrupt street life. Bottcher’s call joins a national trend: cities like Minneapolis and Buffalo have already scrapped these rules. The op-ed claims that ending parking minimums will promote walking, cycling, and transit, making streets safer and more welcoming for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
