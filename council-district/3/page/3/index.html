Fifty-nine are left with serious injuries.</strong> In just over three years, District 3 has seen 6,073 crashes. The numbers are blunt, but the pain is sharp. A man, 34, struck and killed at <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>7th Avenue and West 36th</a> by an SUV.

In the last year alone, <strong>two more lives lost, 848 injured, 23 left with wounds that will not heal</strong>. The bodies pile up: pedestrians, cyclists, children. The city records show the same pattern—<strong>SUVs, trucks, taxis, bikes, and buses all leave bodies in their wake</strong>. The most vulnerable pay the highest price. &ldquo;One bus made contact with the rear of the other bus,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/2-buses-collide-port-authority-shutting-down-14-injured/16916303/>said FDNY Deputy Chief Jason Saffon</a>.

He sponsored a law to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>, to clear sightlines for people on foot. He voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, stripping away a law that punished the vulnerable. He called for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/29/cm-bottcher-city-must-publicly-report-on-plate-covering-perps>public reporting on drivers who cover their plates</a>, saying, &ldquo;drivers are illegally concealing, obscuring, and defacing their license plates to continue to speed with impunity.&rdquo;</p><p>But the blood keeps flowing. Laws are passed, but the street does not forgive delay. <strong>Every day without action is another day someone does not come home.</strong></p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Call Bottcher. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for every crosswalk and bike lane.</strong> The dead cannot speak.

Williams was struck, thrown, and died from his injuries. The article states, “An officer pursuing dirt bikers suddenly crossed the double yellow line into Williams' path, causing a collision.” Another NYPD vehicle attempted a similar maneuver. The family’s attorney called it a “deadly maneuver” for a minor violation. The city later billed Williams’ family for police vehicle damages. The NYPD has not commented, citing litigation. The case raises questions about police pursuit tactics and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary sponsor), Lincoln Restler, and Erik D. Bottcher back the resolution. The bill aims to let the city use cameras to catch and fine drivers who block bike lanes. Cyclists remain exposed. The council’s move highlights the deadly toll: more cyclists killed, more drivers unchecked. The bill’s fate now rests in Albany.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Jaywalking is now legal. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks or against signals. The law shifts blame from walkers to drivers. Streets belong to people again.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0346-2024, now Local Law 98 of 2024, was enacted by the City Council on October 26, 2024, after passing the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable. The law marks a shift: streets are for people, not just cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
