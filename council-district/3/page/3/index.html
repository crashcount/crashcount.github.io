A Nissan Rogue hit him. The driver fled. The man lay in the road, head split, paramedics working in silence. Police arrested the driver two hours later. He was unlicensed. The charge: leaving the scene, causing serious injury. The street shut down. The red light on the crumpled bike kept flashing. <a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/driver-arrested-after-collision-with-e-biker-on-second-ave-XF4896347>&ldquo;The biker was rushed by EMS to Bellevue Hospital in critical condition.&rdquo;</a></p><p>This is not rare. In the last year, District 3 saw 2 deaths, 24 serious injuries, and 931 people hurt in 1,934 crashes. Cyclists, walkers, the old, the young. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do.</p><h3 id=patterns-of-harm>Patterns of Harm</h3><p>Cars and trucks do most of the killing. In the past three and a half years, they took 19 lives and left thousands more broken. Bikes and mopeds hurt, but they do not kill like cars. Trucks back up, crush skulls. SUVs plow through crosswalks. The city counts the bodies. The city moves on.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-delays>Leadership: Promises and Delays</h3><p>Council Member Erik Bottcher has acted. He backed a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, to keep sightlines clear. He voted to remove abandoned cars, to clear the way for people on foot and bike. He co-sponsored a bill for medians with trees to shield cyclists. He pushed for daylight at a thousand intersections a year. But the bills sit in committee. The danger does not wait.</p><p>Bottcher once <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/29/cm-bottcher-city-must-publicly-report-on-plate-covering-perps>said drivers are illegally concealing, obscuring, and defacing their license plates to continue to speed with impunity.</a> The city still lets them.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now</h3><p><strong>The blood is fresh. The danger is old.</strong> Call Bottcher. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand action before another bike light blinks in the dark, alone.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
