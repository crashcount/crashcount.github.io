No law.</p><p>Bottcher voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a rule that punished the desperate and the hurried but did nothing to slow the cars. He backed the SAFE Streets Act, pushing Albany to let the city set lower speed limits and give crash victims more rights. He called for more protected bike lanes, more light, more space for people.

The report states the cyclist suffered severe head lacerations, with his 'skull split' and blood pooling on the pavement. Despite the violence of the crash, the taxi showed 'no damage.' The cyclist remained conscious at the scene. The police report lists 'Unspecified' as the contributing factor for both involved parties, offering no explicit driver error, but the narrative centers the impact and injury to the cyclist. The report notes the cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but only after describing the driver actions and crash impact.

These rolling ads distract drivers and endanger people on foot and bike. The bill locks in an existing rule. It aims to keep city streets clearer and safer for all.</p><p class=mb3>Bill Int 0541-2024 sits with the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced March 7, 2024, it seeks to ban moving billboards in New York City. The matter title reads: "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to banning moving billboards." Council Members Erik D. Bottcher (primary sponsor), Justin L. Brannan, Gale A. Brewer, and Lincoln Restler back the measure. The bill would codify an existing rule—34 RCNY 4-12(j)—that already makes these billboards illegal. By writing the ban into the administrative code, the council aims to close loopholes and strengthen enforcement. No safety analyst note was provided, but the bill targets a known hazard: mobile ads that pull attention from the street and put vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The delay leaves e-bike users stranded.</p><p class=mb3>On February 29, 2024, Council Member Erik Bottcher called out the Department of Transportation and Con Edison for failing to deliver electrified Citi Bike docks in his Manhattan district. The electrified dock pilot, meant to launch late last year, is months behind schedule. Bottcher wrote, 'I urge the Department of Transportation and Con Edison to expedite the electrification of [Citi Bike] stations for the purpose of charging the pedal-assist bikes.' Council Member Lincoln Restler of Greenpoint echoed the demand, calling the project 'an exciting opportunity' for better reliability. DOT claims to be working on it; ConEd says their role is limited. The delay leaves e-bike riders without charged bikes, as workers must swap batteries by hand. The new Lyft contract will double e-bikes, making efficient charging urgent. No formal safety analysis was provided, but the lack of charged bikes keeps vulnerable riders off the street and in harm's way.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The penalty is $175 per violation. The Department of Transportation must launch a civilian reporting program. If DOT prosecutes a case using civilian evidence, the complainant gets 25% of the proceeds. Council Member Carlina Rivera leads as primary sponsor, joined by Restler, Joseph, Menin, Nurse, Hudson, Brannan, Farías, Brewer, Salaam, Hanif, Avilés, Won, Bottcher, Krishnan, Gutiérrez, Marte, and the Brooklyn Borough President. The bill aims to keep streets clear for vulnerable road users, especially near schools.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Introduced February 8, 2024, it urges Albany to pass A.8052 and S.7703. The resolution calls for 'purchasers of limited use motorcycles present a driver’s license appropriate for the legal operation... and register such limited use motorcycles, prior to completing a purchase.' Council Member Gale A. Brewer leads, joined by Rivera, Schulman, Krishnan, Won, Bottcher, and others. The bills would require dealers to check licenses and register mopeds at sale. The Council notes that illegal, unregistered mopeds endanger pedestrians, cyclists, and riders. NYPD seized over 8,600 illegal mopeds by September 2023. The resolution presses for safeguards to keep unlicensed, unregistered vehicles off city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

At least 450 corridors must be contiguous to others with new or existing lighting. Council Member Selvena N.

The campaign, titled 'Slow Your Roll, Respect The Stroll,' urges cyclists to stop at red lights and avoid sidewalks, but Bottcher stressed, 'the vast majority of deaths and injuries are caused by cars.' Bottcher and Hoylman-Sigal both called out reckless drivers as the real threat. Assembly Member Tony Simone joined, pushing for statewide laws to curb dangerous delivery app practices. Ligia Guallpa of the Workers Justice Project highlighted how apps force delivery workers into risky behavior, but noted that new minimum pay rates help slow things down. The campaign focuses on education, not punishment, and centers the voices of workers and vulnerable road users. No direct safety impact assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
