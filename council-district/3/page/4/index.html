A box truck rolls south. The man does not get up. He dies where he sits. The driver is 75. No arrest. No charges. The city moves on. <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/pedestrain-fatally-struck-box-truck-manhattan-police>Police said the victim was pronounced dead at the scene</a>.</p><p>A uniformed officer walks to his car at W. 13th and Seventh.

He sponsored a bill to ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks, forcing daylight into the blind corners where people die. The bill would require the city to install barriers at 1,000 intersections a year. It sits in committee. No vote. No law.</p><p>Bottcher voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a rule that punished the desperate and the hurried but did nothing to slow the cars. He backed the SAFE Streets Act, pushing Albany to let the city set lower speed limits and give crash victims more rights. He called for more protected bike lanes, more light, more space for people. But the pace is slow. The danger is not.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>The city knows what works.</strong> Speed kills. Trucks crush. Corners hide. Every delay means another family waits for news that will break them. <strong>Contact your council member. Demand a vote on the daylighting bill. Demand real protected bike lanes.

The proposal, discussed at a City Council press conference, would require the Economic Development Corporation (EDC) to mandate shore power use and enforce traffic mitigation plans for cruise ships. Avilés declared, 'Our residents are suffocating and the city must act.' The bill responds to chaos caused by ships like the MSC Meraviglia, which brings thousands of passengers and vehicles, blocking streets and the B61 bus. Unlike other lines, MSC offers no shuttle, forcing more cars onto local roads. The EDC claims traffic has improved, but local counts and residents say otherwise. Businesses see little benefit.

He called out the lack of docks in transit deserts. Advocates demand city funding. Without it, expansion stalls. Low-income riders and outer boroughs lose. The city’s inaction keeps streets unequal.</p><p class=mb3>On May 26, 2023, the City Council debated public funding for bike-share expansion. The matter, titled "Citigroup Renews NYC Bike-Share Sponsorship — Is It Time For Public Funding?", highlighted the gap in service for low-income and outer-borough neighborhoods. Council Member Justin Brannan (District 47) criticized Citi Bike’s limited reach, saying, "Ya gotta love @CitiBikeNYC systematically icing out the 'outer' borough transit deserts." Advocates and labor leaders echoed calls for public funding, arguing the for-profit model fails vulnerable New Yorkers. Mayor Adams’s campaign promise to expand Citi Bike with city funding remains unfulfilled. The debate underscores a systemic failure: without public investment, bike-share stays out of reach for those who need it most. No formal safety analysis was provided, but advocates stress that lack of access keeps vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
