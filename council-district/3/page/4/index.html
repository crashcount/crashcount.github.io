Police recorded failure to yield by the driver. She was unconscious and bleeding when EMS arrived (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Since Jan 1, 2022, in Council District 3, there have been <strong>25 people killed</strong> and <strong>3,630 injured</strong> in traffic crashes, across <strong>8,291</strong> reported collisions (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). People walking account for 10 of those deaths and 1,105 injuries; people on bikes for 4 deaths and 875 injuries (same source).</p><p>This year, crashes stand at <strong>1,398</strong> versus <strong>1,595</strong> at this point last year. Deaths: <strong>2</strong> versus <strong>4</strong>. Injuries: <strong>694</strong> versus <strong>717</strong>. Serious injuries: <strong>17</strong> versus <strong>15</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Nights are brutal: four deaths hit in the 10 PM hour over this period (same source).</p><h3 id=corners-where-people-go-down>Corners where people go down</h3><p>On 8th Avenue, crashes have injured 103 people and killed three. On 11th Avenue, 54 injured and two killed. Both are within District 3 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Police records in this district repeatedly cite driver failure to yield and inattention among the causes (same source).</p><p>Trucks and buses add weight to the harm: police counts tie them to pedestrian injuries alongside cars and SUVs over this period (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=what-leaders-have-on-the-table>What leaders have on the table</h3><p>Council Member <a href=/politician/7802/>Erik Bottcher</a> is backing a car‑free 34th Street busway in a Midtown rezoning deal, which the administration has now committed to revive (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/06/its-back-34th-street-busway-revived-in-midtown-rezoning-deal>Streetsblog</a>). When the project was paused in July, he called it “a transformative project that will improve bus speeds, reduce crashes, and make it easier for New Yorkers to get where they need to go” (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/03/anti-miracle-on-34th-street-adams-administration-pauses-work-on-34th-street-busway>Streetsblog</a>).</p><p>Bottcher also sponsors a daylighting bill to keep cars 20 feet back from crosswalks and require DOT to build visibility barriers at 1,000 intersections a year (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council Legistar</a>). At these corners where left turns keep cutting people down, clear sightlines save seconds that matter.</p><h3 id=the-fixes-we-can-use-now>The fixes we can use now</h3><ul><li>Daylight the intersections in District 3’s hot spots like 8th and 11th Avenues. The bill exists; move it to law (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council Legistar</a>).</li><li>Lock in the promised 34th Street busway to cut car traffic and calm the crosstown crash corridor (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/08/06/its-back-34th-street-busway-revived-in-midtown-rezoning-deal>Streetsblog</a>).</li><li>Enforce bike‑lane clearance with automated cameras citywide, a measure Bottcher has supported via resolution (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council Legistar</a>).</li></ul><p>Citywide, there are two levers that would bend this curve. First, lower the default speed limit using Sammy’s Law. Second, stop repeat offenders with mandatory speed limiters after a threshold of tickets. The Stop Super Speeders Act would require it. Both are laid out here with contacts and scripts: <strong><a href=/take_action/>Take action</a></strong>.</p><p>On Aug 20, a left turn on Broadway put a woman on the pavement. The map shows the next corner, and the next. The tools sit on the shelf.
