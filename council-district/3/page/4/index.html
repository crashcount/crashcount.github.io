Fifty-seven were hurt so badly they may never walk the same again. The dead include a 34-year-old man struck by an SUV at 7th Avenue and West 36th Street, killed by a driver who was not paying attention. A 35-year-old was crushed by a garbage truck on Cornelia Street. Another man, 39, died under the wheels of a box truck on West 40th. These are not accidents. These are preventable deaths.</p><h3 id=broken-bodies-broken-promises>Broken Bodies, Broken Promises</h3><p>The carnage is relentless. <strong>Cars and trucks do the most damage:</strong> 542 crashes, 16 serious injuries, 4 deaths. Bikes and mopeds are not blameless—106 crashes, 3 serious injuries—but the weight of steel and speed kills more. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not. A pedestrian thrown to the pavement. A cyclist left bleeding at the curb. The city calls it Vision Zero. The bodies say otherwise.</p><h3 id=what-has-bottcher-done>What Has Bottcher Done?</h3><p>Council Member Erik Bottcher has taken some steps. He sponsored a bill to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>, aiming to clear sightlines for people on foot. He <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>voted to legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the desperate and the poor. Bottcher also <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/29/cm-bottcher-city-must-publicly-report-on-plate-covering-perps>pushed for more protected bike lanes and transparency on drivers who hide their plates</a> to dodge speed cameras. But the pace is slow. The danger is not.</p><h3 id=the-words-of-the-wounded>The Words of the Wounded</h3><p>After a bus crash at Port Authority, <strong>Deputy Chief Jason Saffon <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/2-buses-collide-port-authority-shutting-down-14-injured/16916303/>said</a></strong>, &ldquo;One bus made contact with the rear of the other bus&rdquo; and &ldquo;It required some extrication, meaning they had to use some equipment to free the patient.&rdquo; These are the words of a city used to blood on the street. <strong>After a car fire shut the Lincoln Tunnel, a commuter <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/08/us-news/lincoln-tunnel-closed-for-an-hour-in-rush-hour-nightmare-as-car-fire-snarls-traffic/>wrote</a>:</strong> &ldquo;over an hour delay stuck in the Lincoln tunnel while a car was on fire.&rdquo; The city moves on. The pain lingers.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-demand-more-set-the-pace>Call to Action: Demand More, Set the Pace</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Bottcher. Tell him to fight for a 20 mph speed limit, more daylighted intersections, and real enforcement against reckless drivers. Join the groups that refuse to accept another body in the road. The dead cannot speak. You can.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The report states the cyclist suffered severe head lacerations, with his 'skull split' and blood pooling on the pavement. Despite the violence of the crash, the taxi showed 'no damage.' The cyclist remained conscious at the scene. The police report lists 'Unspecified' as the contributing factor for both involved parties, offering no explicit driver error, but the narrative centers the impact and injury to the cyclist. The report notes the cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but only after describing the driver actions and crash impact.

Brannan, Gale A. Brewer, and Lincoln Restler back the measure. The bill would codify an existing rule—34 RCNY 4-12(j)—that already makes these billboards illegal. By writing the ban into the administrative code, the council aims to close loopholes and strengthen enforcement.

Council aims to clear paths for people, not cars.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0080-2024 sits in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure after its introduction on February 8, 2024. The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to hazardous obstruction by vehicles and civilian complaints to the department of transportation for hazardous obstruction violations," creates a new civil penalty for vehicles blocking bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or hydrants within 2,640 feet of a school. The penalty is $175 per violation. The Department of Transportation must launch a civilian reporting program. If DOT prosecutes a case using civilian evidence, the complainant gets 25% of the proceeds. Council Member Carlina Rivera leads as primary sponsor, joined by Restler, Joseph, Menin, Nurse, Hudson, Brannan, Farías, Brewer, Salaam, Hanif, Avilés, Won, Bottcher, Krishnan, Gutiérrez, Marte, and the Brooklyn Borough President. The bill aims to keep streets clear for vulnerable road users, especially near schools.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Gale A. Brewer leads, joined by Rivera, Schulman, Krishnan, Won, Bottcher, and others. The bills would require dealers to check licenses and register mopeds at sale. The Council notes that illegal, unregistered mopeds endanger pedestrians, cyclists, and riders. NYPD seized over 8,600 illegal mopeds by September 2023.

Council Members Oswald Feliz (primary), Gale A. Brewer, Erik D. Bottcher, and Robert F. Holden sponsored the measure. It would have imposed fines up to $1,000 and jail time for repeat offenders. The bill was filed at session’s end, leaving enforcement unchanged.
