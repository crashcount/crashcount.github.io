Fifty-seven left with injuries that will never heal.</strong> In the last three and a half years, District 3 has seen 5,916 crashes. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about age. Children, elders, workers, tourists—no one is spared. In the last twelve months alone, two people died and twenty-two suffered serious injuries. Most were walking or riding. The street does not forgive.</p><h2 id=recent-wounds-unanswered>Recent Wounds, Unanswered</h2><p>Just weeks ago, a man was killed by a truck on West 40th Street. A pedestrian, crushed. No warning, no second chance. Another body, another family left with silence.

The pain does not fade.</p><h2 id=bottchers-record-progress-and-delay>Bottcher’s Record: Progress and Delay</h2><p>Council Member Erik Bottcher has moved on daylighting, sponsoring a bill to ban parking near crosswalks and keep sightlines clear. The bill would force the city to install barriers at 1,000 intersections a year, but it sits in committee, waiting for a vote (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Bottcher sponsors bill to ban parking near crosswalks</a>). Bottcher voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law used to blame the dead instead of the driver (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Bottcher votes yes to legalize jaywalking</a>). He has backed bills for bike lanes, greenways, and more reporting on hit-and-runs. But the pace is slow. The deaths are not.</p><h2 id=the-call>The Call</h2><p><strong>Every day of delay is another day of blood on the street.</strong> Call Bottcher. Call the Council. Demand a vote on daylighting. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand action, not words.

The narrative describes the moment: 'Face split open. Blood on the pavement. Steel met skin.'
