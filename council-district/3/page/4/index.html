Fifty-nine are left with serious injuries.</strong> In just over three years, District 3 has seen 6,073 crashes. The numbers are blunt, but the pain is sharp. A man, 34, struck and killed at <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>7th Avenue and West 36th</a> by an SUV.

In the last year alone, <strong>two more lives lost, 848 injured, 23 left with wounds that will not heal</strong>. The bodies pile up: pedestrians, cyclists, children. The city records show the same pattern—<strong>SUVs, trucks, taxis, bikes, and buses all leave bodies in their wake</strong>. The most vulnerable pay the highest price. &ldquo;One bus made contact with the rear of the other bus,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/2-buses-collide-port-authority-shutting-down-14-injured/16916303/>said FDNY Deputy Chief Jason Saffon</a>.

He sponsored a law to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>, to clear sightlines for people on foot. He voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, stripping away a law that punished the vulnerable. He called for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/29/cm-bottcher-city-must-publicly-report-on-plate-covering-perps>public reporting on drivers who cover their plates</a>, saying, &ldquo;drivers are illegally concealing, obscuring, and defacing their license plates to continue to speed with impunity.&rdquo;</p><p>But the blood keeps flowing. Laws are passed, but the street does not forgive delay. <strong>Every day without action is another day someone does not come home.</strong></p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Call Bottcher. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for every crosswalk and bike lane.</strong> The dead cannot speak.

A cyclist rode north. Steel met skull. He flew, struck pavement. Blood pooled on the street.' The 26-year-old male cyclist was ejected from his bike, sustained a head injury, and was conscious but bleeding severely from the head.

The impact point was the taxi’s left front bumper and the bike’s right front.

Council Members Julie Won (primary sponsor), Lincoln Restler, Gale Brewer, Christopher Marte, Erik Bottcher, Alexa Avilés, and the Brooklyn Borough President back the measure. They seek to stop city agencies from issuing parking permits to private vehicles unless the car belongs to an elected official. Permits for people with disabilities and those required by collective bargaining agreements are not affected. The bill repeals several administrative code sections tied to private parking privileges. Action aims to strip away special access, reduce curb abuse, and put public space back in public hands.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
