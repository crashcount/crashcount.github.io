Fifty-seven left with serious injuries.</strong> More than 2,500 hurt since 2022. The dead include pedestrians crushed by trucks on Cornelia Street, a man struck by an SUV at 36th and 7th, and a cyclist thrown to the pavement. The city’s streets do not forgive mistakes. They punish the vulnerable.</p><p>Just last year, a garbage truck backed over a man on Cornelia Street. He died in the road. On 7th Avenue, a distracted driver in a new SUV hit a pedestrian at the intersection. He did not get up. These are not isolated events. They are the cost of delay, the price of inaction.</p><h3 id=buses-collide-commuters-bleed>Buses Collide, Commuters Bleed</h3><p>On July 2, <strong>three NJ Transit buses crashed at the Port Authority Terminal</strong>. Fourteen people were hurt. One was trapped and had to be pulled out by emergency crews. &ldquo;One with moderate injuries that required extrication, 10 patients with minor injuries all transported to local area hospitals,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/port-authority-bus-terminal-accident-nyc/>said FDNY Deputy Chief Jason Saffon</a>. The crash shut down the terminal for hours. The city rerouted buses. The morning commute became a scene of blood and sirens. The cause is still under investigation, but the pattern is clear: <strong>crowded streets, heavy vehicles, and not enough protection for the people inside or outside them</strong>.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>Council Member Erik Bottcher has taken steps. He sponsored a bill to ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks and force the city to clear sightlines at 1,000 intersections a year. The <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>bill is still waiting for a vote</a>. Bottcher also voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that often punished the victim instead of the driver. &ldquo;Drivers are illegally concealing, obscuring, and defacing their license plates to continue to speed with impunity,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/29/cm-bottcher-city-must-publicly-report-on-plate-covering-perps>Bottcher said</a>, pushing for more transparency on enforcement.</p><p>But the deaths continue. The bills move slow. The streets do not wait.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Every death is a warning. Every injury is a call. Demand more. Call Council Member Bottcher. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand action before another body hits the pavement.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for the next siren. Make the call.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors including Rivera, Hudson, and others. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor on October 27, 2022. The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law.

The bill, supported by Transportation Alternatives, aims to expose the scale of drivers evading automated enforcement. Bottcher said, 'drivers are illegally concealing, obscuring, and defacing their license plates to continue to speed with impunity.' The legislation mandates DOT to post monthly data online and submit annual reports to the mayor and City Council Speaker. Bottcher sponsored the bill, emphasizing the need for public information and accountability. Advocates argue that open data is crucial for safety and enforcement.

The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to hazardous obstruction by vehicles and civilian complaints to the department of transportation for hazardous obstruction violations,' aimed to create a new civil penalty for vehicles blocking bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or hydrants within 1,320 feet of a school. The penalty: $175 per violation, enforced through the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings. Civilians, except city employees, could file complaints and receive 25% of collected fines. The Department of Transportation would support this with a phased-in reporting program and annual public reports. Council Member Carlina Rivera led as primary sponsor, joined by over two dozen co-sponsors. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, and did not become law.
