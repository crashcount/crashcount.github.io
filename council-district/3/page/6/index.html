A man crushed by a truck on Cornelia Street. A pedestrian struck at 7th Avenue and West 36th. A cyclist hit, a body left broken. These are not accidents. They are the price of inaction.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>Last year, a pedestrian was killed by a driver who was not paying attention. The crash report lists the cause as &ldquo;Driver Inattention/Distraction.&rdquo; The result: one man dead, his body found at the intersection, his story ended in a moment (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Another man, 35, was crushed by a backing garbage truck on Cornelia Street. No warning, no chance. <strong>The violence is relentless.</strong></p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-delayed>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Delayed</h3><p>Council Member Erik Bottcher has taken some steps. He sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, aiming to clear sightlines and protect people on foot and bike. The bill would force the city to install daylighting barriers at 1,000 intersections a year, up from 100. But the bill sits in committee, laid over, waiting for action. Bottcher also pushed for public reporting on drivers who cover their plates to dodge speed cameras, saying, <strong>&ldquo;drivers are illegally concealing, obscuring, and defacing their license plates to continue to speed with impunity&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/29/cm-bottcher-city-must-publicly-report-on-plate-covering-perps>Streetsblog NYC</a>). He voted yes on bills to speed up pavement markings, remove abandoned vehicles, and require taxi warning decals. But the deaths keep coming.</p><h3 id=the-next-fight>The Next Fight</h3><p><strong>The crisis is not over.</strong> The city can lower the speed limit to 20 mph. It can redesign streets to protect the people who walk and bike. It can stop blaming the dead and start saving the living. <strong>Call Council Member Bottcher. Demand action.</strong> Do not wait for another body in the road.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
