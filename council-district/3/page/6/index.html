A box truck rolls south. The man does not get up. He dies where he sits. The driver is 75. No arrest. No charges. The city moves on. <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/pedestrain-fatally-struck-box-truck-manhattan-police>Police said the victim was pronounced dead at the scene</a>.</p><p>A uniformed officer walks to his car at W. 13th and Seventh.

He sponsored a bill to ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks, forcing daylight into the blind corners where people die. The bill would require the city to install barriers at 1,000 intersections a year. It sits in committee. No vote. No law.</p><p>Bottcher voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a rule that punished the desperate and the hurried but did nothing to slow the cars. He backed the SAFE Streets Act, pushing Albany to let the city set lower speed limits and give crash victims more rights. He called for more protected bike lanes, more light, more space for people. But the pace is slow. The danger is not.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>The city knows what works.</strong> Speed kills. Trucks crush. Corners hide. Every delay means another family waits for news that will break them. <strong>Contact your council member. Demand a vote on the daylighting bill. Demand real protected bike lanes.

The matter, discussed at a Citizens Union breakfast, centered on the future of the Open Restaurants program. Adams said, "Outdoor dining, in my perspective, should be sidewalk. The street extensions were designed to be temporary." The City Council is currently developing legislation to allow restaurants to use parking lanes, but Adams’s comments signal resistance. Council Member Erik Bottcher countered, calling the use of road space for dining "an overall positive development." Adams’s stance ignores the reality that most city sidewalks are too narrow for sidewalk-only dining, squeezing pedestrians and limiting restaurant survival. Advocates and groups like Transportation Alternatives and Open Plans criticized her position, urging the Council to reclaim public space from cars and support vibrant, safe streets for all.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets stay dangerous.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0500-2022 was introduced on June 2, 2022, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill sought to "prohibit the issuance of private vehicle parking permits and revoke such existing permits," with exceptions for people with disabilities and collective bargaining agreements. Council Member Christopher Marte led as primary sponsor, joined by Restler, Brewer, Joseph, Nurse, Cabán, Avilés, Bottcher, Won, Ossé, and Richardson Jordan, plus the Brooklyn Borough President. The bill aimed to end a system that let private cars claim curb space, fueling illegal parking and danger for those on foot or bike. It was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote. The status quo remains: permits still shield drivers, while vulnerable road users face the risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Carlina Rivera called noise pollution a public health crisis and urged health-focused street design, citing the 14th Street busway. Transportation Alternatives backed the bills, pushing for more pedestrian and green space. Dr. Arline Bronzaft and other experts criticized the Health Department's inaction.

Council Member Rita C. Joseph sponsored the bill, joined by sixteen co-sponsors including Brooks-Powers, Narcisse, Vernikov, and others. The bill would have authorized up to $1,000 for information leading to the capture of hit-and-run drivers, but excluded law enforcement and city employees from eligibility. The measure was filed at the end of the session on December 31, 2023.

They need safe streets.</p><p class=mb3>On April 29, 2022, Council Members Erik Bottcher, Rita Joseph, and Selvena Brooks-Powers introduced a resolution urging the Department of Education to teach bicycle safety in all New York City public schools. The resolution states: 'Providing instruction in bicycle and traffic safety in schools, starting at an early age and continuing throughout students' years in school, would be an effective measure to both promote cycling and prevent bicycle accidents and other safety incidents.' Bottcher criticized the Department of Education for failing to follow the law, noting only a handful of schools offer bike lessons. Bottcher said, 'We want to see that program enlarged significantly.' Advocates support the push but warn that education alone is not enough. Julie Huntington stressed, 'This announcement must come with an investment in building protected bike lanes and safe routes to school to keep our new riders safe.' Bottcher put the responsibility on drivers: 'Drivers are in the vehicle that weighs thousands of pounds... if they hit someone with their car, it’s very likely they could take their life.' The council’s action highlights a gap between policy and real safety for children on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
