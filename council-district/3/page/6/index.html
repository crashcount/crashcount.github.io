Fifty-nine left with serious injuries.</strong> In the past twelve months, two more lives lost, twenty-three more bodies broken. Pedestrians, cyclists, children—none spared. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><p>Last week, a food cart broke loose from a van on 42nd and 10th. It slammed into a parked car with a woman and a ten-year-old boy inside. Police found the van packed with <strong>76 propane tanks and 75 gallons of gasoline</strong>. The driver was charged with reckless endangerment. The woman and child went to the hospital. The van driver tried to keep police out, but the smell of fuel gave him away. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/cops-bust-minivan-driver-in-manhattan-for-carrying-propane-tanks/>Firefighters forced entry into the van, removing 76 20-pound propane cylinders and 15 five-gallon fuel containers.</a></p><p>Days before, a city worker fixing a street sign was slashed by a delivery cyclist after a near collision at Broadway and Cedar. The worker was parked on the corner. &ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t even in the bike lane, they were parked on the corner, fixing the light or the sign or something,&rdquo; a witness said. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/16/electric-biker-slashes-city-worker-nearly-crash-lower-manhattan/>One of the girls came in and said, They&rsquo;re fighting on the corner with knives!</a></p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do the most damage.</strong> In this district, they killed eight, seriously hurt eighteen, and left hundreds more with lesser wounds. Trucks and buses alone took three lives. Bikes and mopeds hurt, too, but the carnage is dwarfed by what comes on four wheels.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-delays>Leadership: Progress and Delays</h3><p>Council Member Erik Bottcher has backed bills to clear abandoned cars, speed up pavement markings, and daylight intersections—measures that could save lives. He voted to remove derelict vehicles within 72 hours and to require warning decals on taxi doors. Bottcher also sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, demanding the city install daylighting barriers at 1,000 intersections a year. But some bills stall in committee. The pace is slow. The street does not wait.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Every day, another life is at risk.</strong> Call Council Member Bottcher. Demand faster action. Demand streets where a child can cross without fear, where a worker can fix a sign and go home alive. The blood on the street is not an accident. It is a choice. Make them choose safety.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, supported by Transportation Alternatives, aims to expose the scale of drivers evading automated enforcement. Bottcher said, 'drivers are illegally concealing, obscuring, and defacing their license plates to continue to speed with impunity.' The legislation mandates DOT to post monthly data online and submit annual reports to the mayor and City Council Speaker. Bottcher sponsored the bill, emphasizing the need for public information and accountability. Advocates argue that open data is crucial for safety and enforcement.
