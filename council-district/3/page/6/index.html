The numbers do not flinch.</p><h2 id=leadership-laws-and-limits>Leadership: Laws and Limits</h2><p>Council Member Erik Bottcher has not been silent. He sponsored a bill to ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks, forcing daylight into the blind corners where people die. The bill would require the city to install barriers at 1,000 intersections a year. It sits in committee. No vote. No law.</p><p>Bottcher voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a rule that punished the desperate and the hurried but did nothing to slow the cars. He backed the SAFE Streets Act, pushing Albany to let the city set lower speed limits and give crash victims more rights. He called for more protected bike lanes, more light, more space for people. But the pace is slow. The danger is not.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>The city knows what works.</strong> Speed kills. Trucks crush. Corners hide. Every delay means another family waits for news that will break them. <strong>Contact your council member. Demand a vote on the daylighting bill. Demand real protected bike lanes. Demand lower speed limits.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another body in the road.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The project, not a council bill but a city initiative, expanded pedestrian space with 'super sidewalks'—painted sidewalk extensions between 50th and 59th streets. Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez pledged to bring this design citywide, stating, 'While we are excited to bring this improvement to Hells Kitchen, we look forward to expanding these efforts elsewhere.' Council member Erik Bottcher called for similar changes on 10th and 11th Avenues. Local advocate Christine Berthet called the new space 'just like having air to breathe.' The redesign removed a car lane in a neighborhood where most households lack cars. Still, the use of paint over concrete means drivers, including NYPD, sometimes park illegally on pedestrian space.
