A truck backs up on Cornelia. He does not walk away. On West 36th, a driver looks away. A pedestrian dies at the crosswalk. In three years, 19 people have died in District 3. Fifty-seven more were left with serious injuries. Most never make the news. The street remembers them all.</p><p>Last year alone, two more died. Over 770 were hurt. The youngest was a child. The oldest, someone’s grandparent. SUVs and trucks led the body count. The numbers do not lie: <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash records</a>.</p><h3 id=the-system-fails-the-vulnerable>The System Fails the Vulnerable</h3><p>The city says it cares. The council passes laws. But the blood dries fast. On Cornelia Street, a garbage truck reversed and killed a man. The record reads: &ldquo;Backing Unsafely.&rdquo; On West 36th, a new SUV struck a pedestrian at the intersection. The cause: &ldquo;Driver Inattention/Distraction.&rdquo; The man died where he stood. No one calls it murder, but the street is just as empty.</p><h3 id=bottchers-record-progress-and-delay>Bottcher’s Record: Progress and Delay</h3><p>Council Member Erik Bottcher has voted for daylighting—banning parking near crosswalks to clear sightlines. He backed the bill to legalize jaywalking, shifting blame off pedestrians. He co-sponsored bills for protected bike lanes, solar crosswalks, and civilian reporting. He called out drivers who hide their plates to dodge speed cameras, stating that <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/29/cm-bottcher-city-must-publicly-report-on-plate-covering-perps>&ldquo;drivers are illegally concealing, obscuring, and defacing their license plates to continue to speed with impunity.&rdquo;</a></p><p>But the pace is slow. The deaths do not wait for committee hearings. Every delay means another family left with a hole in their life.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Call Council Member Bottcher. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand protected bike lanes and sidewalks wide enough for a crowd. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p><p>The street will not forgive silence. Act now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law.

The bill, supported by Transportation Alternatives, aims to expose the scale of drivers evading automated enforcement. Bottcher said, 'drivers are illegally concealing, obscuring, and defacing their license plates to continue to speed with impunity.' The legislation mandates DOT to post monthly data online and submit annual reports to the mayor and City Council Speaker. Bottcher sponsored the bill, emphasizing the need for public information and accountability. Advocates argue that open data is crucial for safety and enforcement. The DOT stated it looks forward to reviewing the legislation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
