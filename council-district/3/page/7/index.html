Fifty-nine are left with serious injuries.</strong> In just over three years, District 3 has seen 6,073 crashes. The numbers are blunt, but the pain is sharp. A man, 34, struck and killed at <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>7th Avenue and West 36th</a> by an SUV.

In the last year alone, <strong>two more lives lost, 848 injured, 23 left with wounds that will not heal</strong>. The bodies pile up: pedestrians, cyclists, children. The city records show the same pattern—<strong>SUVs, trucks, taxis, bikes, and buses all leave bodies in their wake</strong>. The most vulnerable pay the highest price. &ldquo;One bus made contact with the rear of the other bus,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/2-buses-collide-port-authority-shutting-down-14-injured/16916303/>said FDNY Deputy Chief Jason Saffon</a>.

He sponsored a law to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>, to clear sightlines for people on foot. He voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, stripping away a law that punished the vulnerable. He called for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/29/cm-bottcher-city-must-publicly-report-on-plate-covering-perps>public reporting on drivers who cover their plates</a>, saying, &ldquo;drivers are illegally concealing, obscuring, and defacing their license plates to continue to speed with impunity.&rdquo;</p><p>But the blood keeps flowing. Laws are passed, but the street does not forgive delay. <strong>Every day without action is another day someone does not come home.</strong></p><h3 id=what-now-no-more-waiting>What Now: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Call Bottcher. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for every crosswalk and bike lane.</strong> The dead cannot speak.

The bill aimed to end a system that let private cars claim curb space, fueling illegal parking and danger for those on foot or bike. It was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote.

The resolution demands fare parity, no ride caps, and equal service for disabled New Yorkers. Lawmakers say current limits are unjust and restrict mobility.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0002-2022, filed at session's end, came before the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on February 10, 2022. The measure urges passage of S.4037/A.5896, which would 'extend and expand the scope of the MTA On-Demand E-Hail Paratransit Pilot Program.' Council Member Justin L. Brannan led sponsorship, joined by Ayala, Menin, Louis, Hanif, Hudson, Bottcher, Farías, Brooks-Powers, and Brewer. The resolution slams service caps and fare surcharges, calling them 'inequitable and unjust.' It demands that paratransit users get the same fare, hours, and ride freedom as subway and bus riders. The bill would end rationing and financial barriers for disabled New Yorkers who rely on Access-A-Ride. The Council’s action highlights the systemic barriers faced by vulnerable road users and presses for equal, unrestricted access.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
