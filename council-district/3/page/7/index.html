A box truck rolls south. The man does not get up. He dies where he sits. The driver is 75. No arrest. No charges. The city moves on. <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/pedestrain-fatally-struck-box-truck-manhattan-police>Police said the victim was pronounced dead at the scene</a>.</p><p>A uniformed officer walks to his car at W. 13th and Seventh.

He sponsored a bill to ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks, forcing daylight into the blind corners where people die. The bill would require the city to install barriers at 1,000 intersections a year. It sits in committee. No vote. No law.</p><p>Bottcher voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a rule that punished the desperate and the hurried but did nothing to slow the cars. He backed the SAFE Streets Act, pushing Albany to let the city set lower speed limits and give crash victims more rights. He called for more protected bike lanes, more light, more space for people. But the pace is slow. The danger is not.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>The city knows what works.</strong> Speed kills. Trucks crush. Corners hide. Every delay means another family waits for news that will break them. <strong>Contact your council member. Demand a vote on the daylighting bill. Demand real protected bike lanes.

Stevens led as primary sponsor, joined by 26 co-sponsors including Hudson, Williams, Restler, Krishnan, and others.

The new Department of Investigation (DOI) boss, Jocelyn Strauber, hesitated to confirm if placard abuse is a problem, despite a 2019 law requiring DOI and NYPD to investigate and report on the issue. Council Member Erik Bottcher pressed Strauber, citing resident complaints about fake placards and blocked curbs. Bottcher said, 'NYPD traffic enforcement agents are not issuing tickets to many people using counterfeit placards.' Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized the lack of a digital placard system and is drafting new enforcement legislation. Local Law 6 mandates weekly sweeps and monthly reports, but agencies have failed to comply. The Adams administration has not advanced citizen enforcement. The result: curb space remains dangerous and inaccessible for pedestrians, cyclists, and those who need it most.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law ordered NYPD to inspect 25 blocks weekly for placard abuse and another 25 for blocked bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, and crosswalks. The Department of Investigation (DOI) was to review and report by September 30, 2020. Agencies missed deadlines, citing pandemic and staffing shortages.

The hearing highlighted the matter: 'Standing still zone: Two-year-old parking placard abuse probe stuck in bureaucratic time warp, NYC investigator blames COVID.' Advocates and @placardabuse called the delays corrupt and dangerous. Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance said placard abuse is no victimless crime, making streets more dangerous and slowing buses.
