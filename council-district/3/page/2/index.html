Fifty-nine suffered wounds so grave they may never walk the same. Each number is a body. Each body is a life cut or changed. The dead do not speak, but the numbers do.</p><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> Trucks and SUVs killed or maimed more than any other vehicle. Cars, cabs, bikes, mopeds—all play their part. The street is a gauntlet. No one is safe.</p><h3 id=recent-crashes-the-slow-grind-of-loss>Recent Crashes: The Slow Grind of Loss</h3><p>The carnage does not stop. In April, a box truck crushed a man on West 40th. In May, an SUV struck down a pedestrian at 36th and 7th. A garbage truck backed over a man on Cornelia Street. Each crash is a headline, then a memory, then a scar.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;One bus made contact with the rear of the other bus,&rdquo;</strong> said an FDNY chief after a crash at Port Authority that left fourteen hurt. Emergency crews had to fight through blocked ramps to reach the wounded. <strong>&ldquo;We worked with the Port Authority police to open up the exit ramp so we could go up the wrong way and get our ambulances up there.&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/2-buses-collide-port-authority-shutting-down-14-injured/16916303/>ABC7</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-laws-and-the-waiting>Leadership: Promises, Laws, and the Waiting</h3><p>Council Member Erik Bottcher has backed bills to clear sightlines at crosswalks, legalize jaywalking, and demand more protected bike lanes. He sponsored a law to ban parking near crosswalks, a move that could save lives but still sits in committee. Bottcher voted yes to end jaywalking enforcement, shifting blame off pedestrians and onto the street itself. He has called for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/29/cm-bottcher-city-must-publicly-report-on-plate-covering-perps>public reporting on drivers who cover their plates</a>, exposing those who dodge the law. But the pace is slow. The blood dries before the ink does.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another body in the road.</strong> Call Bottcher. Demand he push his own bills to a vote. Demand the city drop the speed limit to 20 mph. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand action, not words. The dead can’t wait. Neither should you.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Their action: referral to committee. The bill requires the Department of Transportation to build new medians between bike lanes and car lanes that can support trees and other vegetation, subject to feasibility.
