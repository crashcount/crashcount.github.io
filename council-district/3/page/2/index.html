He sponsored a bill to ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks, forcing daylight into the blind corners where people die. The bill would require the city to install barriers at 1,000 intersections a year. It sits in committee. No vote. No law.</p><p>Bottcher voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a rule that punished the desperate and the hurried but did nothing to slow the cars. He backed the SAFE Streets Act, pushing Albany to let the city set lower speed limits and give crash victims more rights. He called for more protected bike lanes, more light, more space for people. But the pace is slow. The danger is not.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>The city knows what works.</strong> Speed kills. Trucks crush. Corners hide.

Bottcher argues that ditching parking mandates will open streets, boost transit, and make the city safer for all.</p><p class=mb3>On October 13, 2024, Council Member Erik Bottcher (District 3) published an op-ed urging New York City to eliminate parking minimums. The piece, titled 'Eliminating ‘parking minimums’ in NYC can help ease the housing crisis,' argues that required parking spaces in new developments block affordable housing and favor cars over people. Bottcher writes, 'By eliminating parking minimums, we can unlock the potential for more housing units in buildings across the city.' He highlights that parking mandates raise construction costs, limit design, and disrupt street life. Bottcher’s call joins a national trend: cities like Minneapolis and Buffalo have already scrapped these rules. The op-ed claims that ending parking minimums will promote walking, cycling, and transit, making streets safer and more welcoming for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Introduced September 26, 2024, it urges the State Legislature and Governor to pass S.5008A/A.803A. The measure would 'establish a bicycle lane safety program in the city of New York to enforce certain restrictions on the use of bicycle lanes and protected bicycle lanes by means of bicycle lane photo devices.' Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary sponsor), Lincoln Restler, and Erik D. Bottcher back the resolution. The bill aims to let the city use cameras to catch and fine drivers who block bike lanes. Cyclists remain exposed. The council’s move highlights the deadly toll: more cyclists killed, more drivers unchecked.

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable.

Riders face twenty blocks of chaos—no protection, just trucks and speeding cars. Bottcher calls it danger. DOT promises action but offers no date. The city lags on its own bike lane goals.</p><p class=mb3>On May 2, 2024, Councilmember Erik Bottcher and five other Manhattan officials called on the Department of Transportation to close the protected bike lane gap on Sixth Avenue. Their letter to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez urges the city to connect the missing stretch between Canal Street and West 8th Street, a span where cyclists must ride in open traffic. The letter states, 'The Department of Transportation should prioritize a new bike lane at this location, which has been a long standing request of the community.' Bottcher, representing District 3, said, 'You know you're going to be in danger, because you're going to have to be riding in the same lane as speeding traffic, cars and trucks.' DOT spokesperson Nick Benson acknowledged support for the expansion but gave no timeline. The city has installed only 1.1 miles of protected bike lanes this year, far behind the 50-mile annual target in the NYC Safety Street Plan.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

A cyclist rode north. Steel met skull. He flew, struck pavement. Blood pooled on the street.' The 26-year-old male cyclist was ejected from his bike, sustained a head injury, and was conscious but bleeding severely from the head. The police report lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as a contributing factor. The cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this detail appears only after the driver error is cited. The impact point was the taxi’s left front bumper and the bike’s right front. The crash underscores the lethal consequences of driver distraction for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Streets demand accountability.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0766-2024 sits in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced April 11, 2024, the bill bans parking, standing, stopping, or operating a vehicle with obscured or defaced license plates. The matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to prohibiting the parking, standing, stopping, or operation of a motor vehicle with obscured or defaced license plates.' Council Member Oswald Feliz leads as primary sponsor, joined by Holden, Bottcher, Gennaro, Marte, Restler, Ung, and Paladino. The bill hits violators with up to $1,000 fines, possible jail, and escalating penalties for repeat offenses. The measure aims to end the dodge—drivers hiding plates to evade enforcement. The committee now holds the bill for review.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
