Fifty-seven suffered wounds so grave they may never walk the same again. The dead do not get a second chance. The injured carry scars—some seen, some not.</p><p><strong>Just weeks ago, a man was killed by a truck on West 40th Street.</strong> A 34-year-old pedestrian died at the hands of a distracted SUV driver at 7th Avenue and West 36th. Each crash is a story cut short. Each statistic is a family left behind. The city’s own data shows SUVs, trucks, and taxis are the main weapons. <strong>SUVs alone have killed four and injured hundreds</strong> according to <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>.</p><h3 id=the-system-fails-the-vulnerable>The System Fails the Vulnerable</h3><p>The pattern is clear. <strong>Pedestrians and cyclists pay the price.</strong> Trucks, SUVs, and taxis do the damage.

Fourteen were hurt in a single crash at Port Authority. The system strains, but the bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=what-has-bottcher-done>What Has Bottcher Done?</h3><p>Council Member Erik Bottcher has not been silent. He sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, forcing daylight at a thousand intersections a year. He voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the desperate and the poor. He called out drivers who hide their plates to dodge speed cameras, as <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/29/cm-bottcher-city-must-publicly-report-on-plate-covering-perps>reported by Streetsblog NYC</a>. He co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, demanding lower speed limits and more rights for crash victims. But the bills move slow. The streets bleed fast.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Call Bottcher. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit citywide. Demand the city end repeat offenders.</strong> The dead cannot speak. The living must.

The coalition pushes for the SAFE Streets Package, including speed-limiting devices for repeat offenders and the 'Idaho stop' for cyclists. The article quotes Darnell Sealy-McCrorey: 'This epidemic is preventable. It doesn't have to be this way.' Lawmakers show mixed support. Some cite privacy fears or question the seriousness of multiple speeding violations. Jackson Chabot notes, 'A lot of people have understood the bill because of the tragic and fatal crashes recently.'

Starting May 18, the north outer roadway becomes bike-only, while the south outer roadway, once for vehicles, opens to pedestrians. The article notes, “Advocates have fought to open a separate pedestrian path, citing dangerous overcrowding that has led to conflicts among cyclists, pedestrians and micromobility users.” The bridge was the last city-owned East River crossing without split paths. Manhattan Community Board 6 urged the city to act, pressing DOT to open the path despite construction delays. The change doubles space for non-drivers and removes a vehicle lane, addressing years of systemic risk from forced mixing of vulnerable users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing.

The bill’s title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the planting of vegetation on new medians separating bicycle lanes from motorized vehicle traffic.” Council Member Shekar Krishnan leads as primary sponsor, joined by Bottcher, Ossé, Brannan, Hanif, and Brooks-Powers. Their action: referral to committee. The bill requires the Department of Transportation to build new medians between bike lanes and car lanes that can support trees and other vegetation, subject to feasibility. Parks and Recreation must plant or allow planting in these medians. The move promises a harder barrier between cyclists and cars, with green infrastructure as a shield.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Commissioner Tisch said, “Our officers deserve clear guidance and smart protocols when determining whether to engage in a vehicle pursuit on our streets.” The pursuit was reportedly justified under new policy, which still allows chases for serious crimes.
