Since 2022, <strong>19 people have died</strong> and <strong>2,729 have been injured</strong> in crashes. <strong>Sixty-three were left with serious injuries</strong>—lives changed in a blink. The dead do not speak. The injured carry the story in scars and limps.</p><p>Just last week, a 65-year-old e-bike rider was struck on Second Avenue. The driver fled, drove onto the sidewalk, and later told police he ran because he had no license. The cyclist was left with critical head trauma. The paper said, &ldquo;He now faces charges of leaving the scene of an accident that caused serious injury and driving without a license&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.westsidespirit.com/news/driver-arrested-after-hitting-65-year-old-e-biker-on-second-ave-XF4896347>West Side Spirit</a>).</p><p>On Cornelia Street, a truck backed over a 35-year-old man.

Motorcycles and mopeds left dozens hurt. The street is a gauntlet, and the most vulnerable—walkers, cyclists, the old—pay the highest price.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member <strong>Erik Bottcher has backed bills to clear abandoned cars, speed up pavement markings, and require daylighting at crosswalks</strong>—all steps to clear sightlines and slow the street’s violence. He voted to <strong>decriminalize jaywalking</strong>, a move to stop blaming the dead for their own deaths. He co-sponsored a bill to force the city to report on drivers who cover their plates to dodge speed cameras, saying, &ldquo;drivers are illegally concealing, obscuring, and defacing their license plates to continue to speed with impunity&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/29/cm-bottcher-city-must-publicly-report-on-plate-covering-perps>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>But the pace is slow.

The city’s $2 million pilot lets delivery workers exchange uncertified e-bikes and batteries for certified, UL-standard models. The program also requires a safety course. While battery-related fires rose slightly from 268 in 2023 to 277 in 2024, fatalities fell from 18 to 6.

Residents worry rerouted vehicles will jam local streets and worsen safety. Jessica Lavoie of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association warns, "diverting traffic from this critical corridor onto narrow residential streets would lead to increased congestion, safety hazards, and diminished quality of life."

Seventeen council members, led by Robert Holden (bill sponsor) and Erik Bottcher (district includes stables), support the ban. Speaker Adrienne Adams has blocked a hearing and vote.

The MTA argues the legality of the tolls and seeks a court injunction, stating, 'congestion pricing is legal and proper.'

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
