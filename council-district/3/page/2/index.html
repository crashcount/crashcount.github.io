A box truck. A person down. Two dead along that spine since 2022. Seventy‑one injured there too. This is not a surprise. It is a record. It sits in the open data.</p><p><strong>Twelve people are dead here since 2022.</strong> Eight were on foot. Two were on bikes. The city logged 6,534 crashes, 2,812 injuries, and 65 serious injuries in this council district over the period covered. Trucks and buses struck and injured dozens of pedestrians; SUVs and cars hit far more. The hurt piles up in daylight and dark.</p><h3 id=night-bleeds>Night bleeds</h3><p>The map is loud at night. District 3 shows spikes from 11 p.m. to 1 a.m., and again at 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. In the 11 p.m. hour, two deaths; at midnight, two more; 1 a.m. holds steady; 3 a.m. and 5 a.m., another each; 11 p.m. to 1 a.m. again at 11 p.m. and midnight with two each; 11 p.m. has five serious injuries. The late hours keep taking.</p><p>A man, 34, died in the crosswalk at 7th Avenue and West 36th Street. The record notes driver distraction. It was 11:31 p.m. The SUV “going straight ahead.” The person “killed.” The rest is blank. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data lists it</a>.</p><h3 id=heavy-steel-soft-bodies>Heavy steel, soft bodies</h3><p>Trucks kill here. A 39‑year‑old pedestrian died under a 2018 box truck at West 40th Street and 9th Avenue just after 3 a.m. The file reads “Crush Injuries.” Another person, 35, was killed by a reversing garbage truck on Cornelia Street at 5:22 a.m. The database says “Backing Unsafely.” These are lines in a spreadsheet. They are also lives. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The crash IDs are there</a>.</p><p>Across the district, SUVs led in pedestrian toll: 230 pedestrian strikes, including deaths. Trucks followed with 61. Taxis hit 102. Bikes hit 121. The pattern is plain in the rollup. No one should have to memorize it to stay alive.</p><h3 id=corners-that-hide-and-corridors-that-race>Corners that hide and corridors that race</h3><p>The danger clusters on wide avenues. Two deaths and 71 injuries are logged along <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>8 Avenue</a>. Another death and 44 injuries on <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>11 Avenue</a>. Avenue of the Americas shows 72 injuries. Seven Avenue shows 74. Sightlines fail. Turns cut. People step and vanish behind parked metal.</p><p>At Avenue of the Americas and Bleecker, a driver died in a late‑night collision with a taxi in 2023. The taxi was parked. The SUV hit “center front end.” The entry says “Apparent Death.” There is no why. Only when and where. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The open data entry is here</a>.</p><h3 id=city-hall-says-fix-the-street-when>City Hall says fix the street. When?</h3><p>On Canal Street, after two people were killed by a driver reported at 109 mph, the city promised barriers, lower speeds, and narrower lanes. “We are taking immediate steps to fortify this intersection,” said the transportation commissioner. Advocates warned the rest of the corridor “will remain deadly.” The promise matters. So does the delay. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/after-deadly-chinatown-crash-nyc-makes-long-sought-safety-upgrades-on-canal-street>Gothamist reported it</a> and <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/07/chinatown-deadly-crash-safety-upgrades-canal-street>NY1 confirmed</a>.</p><p>On 14th Street, the city says a redesign begins next year to “improve the pedestrian experience,” backed by $3 million with BID money in the mix. A plan on paper does not stop a truck at 3 a.m. It could, if it arrives on time and with steel and stone. <a href=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/08/15/redesign-of-14th-street-to-kick-off-next-year>NY1 has the details</a>.</p><h3 id=tools-on-the-table-still-unused>Tools on the table, still unused</h3><p>Council Member Erik Bottcher is pushing a law to clear 20 feet at crosswalks. Daylighting. A thousand intersections a year. The bill was laid over. Cars keep hiding people at the corner. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Council records show it</a>.</p><p>The Council moved other pieces. Removing derelict cars within 72 hours passed. So did decals on taxi doors to warn riders to look for cyclists. Bottcher voted yes. Small fixes, real lives. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Votes are logged here</a>.</p><h3 id=what-would-stop-the-next-one>What would stop the next one?</h3><ul><li>Daylight every corner on 8th, 7th, 11th, and Sixth. Make the 20‑foot no‑parking rule real, fast. Harden the turn radii. Protect the walk.</li><li>Install leading pedestrian intervals and hardened turns at the worst corners named in the city’s own data.</li><li>Set truck routes off narrow residential blocks like Cornelia. Enforce backing bans where people live and walk.</li></ul><h3 id=the-citywide-moves-that-would-matter>The citywide moves that would matter</h3><p>Lower speeds save lives. Use existing law to drop the default speed on local streets. Stop repeat speeders with mandatory limiters for cars that rack up camera hits. These tools exist; the deaths do too.

Tension rises between speed, safety, and neighborhood calm.</p><p class=mb3>The New York Post (2025-06-08) reports that the city proposes restricting cars on 34th Street to create a busway between 3rd and 9th Avenues. Residents worry rerouted vehicles will jam local streets and worsen safety. Jessica Lavoie of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association warns, "diverting traffic from this critical corridor onto narrow residential streets would lead to increased congestion, safety hazards, and diminished quality of life." The Department of Transportation aims to replicate the 14th Street busway, which "reduced congestion, sped up bus travel and curbed accidents." The article highlights the ongoing struggle to balance efficient transit, tunnel access, and neighborhood safety. No specific driver errors are cited, but the plan underscores the systemic risks of shifting car traffic onto residential blocks.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article states, "Forcing horses to pound the pavement with heavy carriages in Midtown, where they compete with motor vehicles, bicyclists and pedestrians, is inhumane." Seventeen council members, led by Robert Holden (bill sponsor) and Erik Bottcher (district includes stables), support the ban. Speaker Adrienne Adams has blocked a hearing and vote. The piece highlights recent incidents where bolting horses injured at least four people, including a pedicab driver. Despite the vivid danger, the safety analyst notes: "The event text does not describe any policy or legislative change affecting pedestrians or cyclists, so there is no direct impact on their safety."

As one protester said, “It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.” Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the crackdown, citing the lack of licensing for e-bikes as a challenge for enforcement, but acknowledged the need for legislative reform.

Sidewalks will double. Lanes for cars will shrink. Trees, benches, and light will fill the space. Pedestrians, long squeezed, will finally get room to breathe. The city bets big on feet, not fenders.</p><p class=mb3>amNY reported on May 21, 2025, that New York City will begin a $400 million redesign of Fifth Avenue in 2028, stretching from Bryant Park to Central Park. Mayor Eric Adams said, 'Fifth Avenue is a bustling boulevard... with more people walking down the street every hour than fill Madison Square Garden during a sold-out Knicks game.' The plan nearly doubles sidewalk widths and expands pedestrian zones, cutting space for vehicles. The redesign adds tree buffers, benches, and stormwater upgrades. Pedestrians make up 70% of avenue traffic but have less than half the space. The overhaul shifts priority from cars to people, aiming to reduce systemic danger and reclaim the street for those on foot.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report details how the Bell 206L-4 split into three pieces: 'the fuselage, the main rotor system, and the tail boom.' Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing. The crash highlights gaps in oversight and the risks of repeated tour flights without robust recording or inspection requirements.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
