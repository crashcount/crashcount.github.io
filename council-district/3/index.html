A box truck rolls south. The man does not get up. He dies where he sits. The driver is 75. No arrest. No charges. The city moves on. <a href=https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/pedestrain-fatally-struck-box-truck-manhattan-police>Police said the victim was pronounced dead at the scene</a>.</p><p>A uniformed officer walks to his car at W. 13th and Seventh.

He sponsored a bill to ban parking within 20 feet of crosswalks, forcing daylight into the blind corners where people die. The bill would require the city to install barriers at 1,000 intersections a year. It sits in committee. No vote. No law.</p><p>Bottcher voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a rule that punished the desperate and the hurried but did nothing to slow the cars. He backed the SAFE Streets Act, pushing Albany to let the city set lower speed limits and give crash victims more rights. He called for more protected bike lanes, more light, more space for people. But the pace is slow. The danger is not.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p><strong>The city knows what works.</strong> Speed kills. Trucks crush. Corners hide. Every delay means another family waits for news that will break them. <strong>Contact your council member. Demand a vote on the daylighting bill. Demand real protected bike lanes.

The article states, "Forcing horses to pound the pavement with heavy carriages in Midtown, where they compete with motor vehicles, bicyclists and pedestrians, is inhumane." Seventeen council members, led by Robert Holden (bill sponsor) and Erik Bottcher (district includes stables), support the ban. Speaker Adrienne Adams has blocked a hearing and vote. The piece highlights recent incidents where bolting horses injured at least four people, including a pedicab driver. Despite the vivid danger, the safety analyst notes: "The event text does not describe any policy or legislative change affecting pedestrians or cyclists, so there is no direct impact on their safety." The bill remains stalled in committee, with no relief for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
