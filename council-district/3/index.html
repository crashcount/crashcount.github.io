Fifty-nine suffered serious injuries.</strong> In the past year alone, two more lives were lost and nearly 850 were hurt. The streets do not forgive. A man, 34, struck and killed by an SUV at 7th Avenue and West 36th. A 35-year-old, crushed by a garbage truck on Cornelia Street. A pedestrian, 39, killed by a box truck on West 40th. Each death leaves a hole. Each injury, a scar that does not fade.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do most of the damage.</strong> They killed eight, injured hundreds, and left dozens with wounds that will never heal. Bikes, mopeds, and motorcycles add to the toll, but the weight of death rides on four wheels. Trucks and SUVs, always bigger, always faster, always there at the moment of impact. The city’s own data shows the pattern: the larger the vehicle, the greater the harm (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=leadership-action-and-delay>Leadership: Action and Delay</h3><p>Council Member Erik Bottcher has moved on daylighting, sponsoring a bill to ban parking near crosswalks and keep sightlines clear. The bill would force the city to install barriers at a thousand intersections a year, but it sits in committee, waiting for a vote (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>). Bottcher also voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the desperate and the slow (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>). He has backed the SAFE Streets Act, a package aimed at protecting people on foot and bike. But the pace is slow. The blood dries before the ink does.</p><h3 id=the-words-of-the-wounded>The Words of the Wounded</h3><p>After a bus crash at Port Authority, Deputy Chief Jason Saffon <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/2-buses-collide-port-authority-shutting-down-14-injured/16916303/>said</a>, <strong>&ldquo;One bus made contact with the rear of the other bus.&rdquo;</strong> Fourteen people were hurt. Emergency crews struggled to reach the scene. The ramp was blocked, the city unprepared. In another crash, Saffon <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/2-buses-collide-port-authority-shutting-down-14-injured/16916303/>said</a>, <strong>&ldquo;It required some extrication, meaning they had to use some equipment to free the patient.&rdquo;</strong> The machines do not care who they trap.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day the city waits, another life is at risk. Call Council Member Bottcher. Demand a vote on daylighting. Demand safer speeds. Demand streets where a child can cross without fear. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Critics worried about diverted car traffic clogging residential streets, with one resident calling for a 'traffic study' and 'action plan.'

Jessica Lavoie of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association warns, "diverting traffic from this critical corridor onto narrow residential streets would lead to increased congestion, safety hazards, and diminished quality of life." The Department of Transportation aims to replicate the 14th Street busway, which "reduced congestion, sped up bus travel and curbed accidents."

After hitting Esiyok, Ali continued, injuring a cyclist, two more pedestrians, and crashing into a van.

Seventeen council members, led by Robert Holden (bill sponsor) and Erik Bottcher (district includes stables), support the ban. Speaker Adrienne Adams has blocked a hearing and vote.

Despite the vivid danger, the safety analyst notes: "The event text does not describe any policy or legislative change affecting pedestrians or cyclists, so there is no direct impact on their safety." The bill remains stalled in committee, with no relief for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists and advocates argue the penalties are harsher than those faced by drivers for similar actions. As one protester said, “It seems unfair to me that cyclists should receive a higher penalty for doing the same thing that a person in a car would do.” Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch defended the crackdown, citing the lack of licensing for e-bikes as a challenge for enforcement, but acknowledged the need for legislative reform. The article highlights inconsistent enforcement and the risks faced by vulnerable road users, especially delivery workers. Policy gaps and unequal penalties expose systemic danger on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Commissioner Tisch told the Council, "Pass e-bike regulations." Cyclists object to criminal charges for minor violations, arguing for civil penalties instead. The article highlights the case of Renee Baruch, hospitalized after an e-bike crash left her with facial fractures and a spinal injury. The NYPD’s new Quality of Life Division targets reckless e-bike use, but without updated laws, criminal summonses remain their only tool.

The article details a standoff between the MTA, New York State, and U.S. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy, who demands the tolls be taken down, threatening to withhold highway funds. The MTA argues the legality of the tolls and seeks a court injunction, stating, 'congestion pricing is legal and proper.' The system, operational since January 2025, has reduced daily vehicle entries into Manhattan’s core by 76,000 in April and raised $159 million in the first quarter. The dispute highlights tensions over funding priorities and the impact on lower-income drivers, but the courts, not drivers or pedestrians, will decide the fate of the tolls.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Witnesses heard 'several loud 'bangs'' before the breakup. The helicopter had flown eight tours that day, all with the same pilot, who had less than 50 hours in this model. The aircraft had a prior maintenance issue with its transmission assembly and lacked flight data recorders. The NTSB noted the pilot wore video-capable sunglasses, but they remain missing.
