Fifty-nine left with serious injuries.</strong> More than 2,500 hurt since 2022. Trucks, SUVs, taxis—steel against flesh. A 34-year-old man, dead at the intersection of 7th Avenue and West 36th, struck by an SUV. A 35-year-old, crushed by a garbage truck on Cornelia Street. The street does not care if you are young or old. The street only takes.</p><p>Just this spring, a sedan hit two people in Midtown. A taxi turned left and struck four more on Fifth Avenue. The pattern is old. The pain is fresh. <strong>&ldquo;We want a real solution to the bike and pedestrian safety issue,&rdquo;</strong> said <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/14/civic-panel-dings-adams-for-cutting-bike-and-bus-lanes-out-of-fifth-av-redesign>CB 5 Vice Chair Samir Lavingia</a>. The city keeps talking. The bodies keep coming.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h3><p>Council Member Erik Bottcher has moved on some fronts. He backed a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, to keep sightlines clear and walkers alive. He voted to clear abandoned cars from the curb, to open the way for people on foot and bike. He co-sponsored a bill to speed up pavement markings, and another to plant trees in new bike lane medians. He called for <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/29/cm-bottcher-city-must-publicly-report-on-plate-covering-perps>transparency on license plate defacing</a>, saying, <strong>&ldquo;drivers are illegally concealing, obscuring, and defacing their license plates to continue to speed with impunity.&rdquo;</strong></p><p>But the council moves slow. Bills sit in committee. The <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/14/civic-panel-dings-adams-for-cutting-bike-and-bus-lanes-out-of-fifth-av-redesign>Fifth Avenue redesign cut bike and bus lanes</a>, leaving two lanes for cars and little for the rest. The board warns: without real bike lanes, cyclists will ride the sidewalk, and the danger will not end. The city delays. The street does not.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every day, another crash. Every week, another family changed.</strong> The council can act. Residents can demand it. Call Bottcher. Call the mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes, not promises. Demand the city use its new power to make every street safe for the most vulnerable. The time for patience is over. The street is not patient. It only takes.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Manhattan Community Board 5 called this move not a "real solution" to safety, urging a return to the 2021 plan with protected bike lanes and faster bus service. "We want a real solution to the bike and pedestrian safety issue," said CB 5 Vice Chair Samir Lavingia. The board warns that without bike lanes, cyclists will ride sidewalks, risking conflict. The plan, shaped with business interests, leaves vulnerable road users exposed and delays safer changes until at least 2028.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Video shows the vehicles touching in a V shape. Investigator Nelson Yu, a retired NYPD detective, confronted the woman, demanding identification and handcuffing her after she failed to produce ID. Yu ordered, 'Get out of the car and show some ID,' and later, 'Get in the car! You're not going anywhere!' The woman was placed in the back seat of Yu’s vehicle. The arrest was later voided. The Attorney General’s office stated, 'OAG is investigating this matter internally and will not have further comment at this time.' The incident highlights the risks of parked vehicles and the escalation that can follow minor collisions, especially when law enforcement is involved.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
