The victim was taken to Jamaica Hospital, where he died. No arrests have been announced.</p><p>This year in Council District 31 there have been 4 deaths and about 800 injuries so far, up from 1 death and 572 injuries at this point last year (NYC Open Data).

Fatalities rise overnight, with a clear spike between about 1 a.m. and 3 a.m., indicating the need for better night lighting and enforcement (NYC Open Data).</p><p>Local data point to a few recurring causes: the largest contributing buckets are recorded as “other” and traffic‑related errors, and unsafe speed appears frequently in crash reports.

The city’s promise, still unkept.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist reported on June 22, 2025, that Mayor Eric Adams has failed to deliver on his promise to install hundreds of secure bike parking lockers across New York City. The Department of Transportation has not selected a vendor, despite plans to add 500 secure spots by next month. Councilmembers urged action, calling the program potentially 'as transformative and impactful as our (Citi Bike) share program.' Jon Orcutt of Bike New York said, 'The Adams administration seems to be flubbing it, or failing it, or just letting it sort of slide through the cracks.' The delay leaves cyclists, especially delivery workers, exposed to theft and lacking safe storage. The city’s inaction stands in contrast to London, where secure bike parking has boosted cycling rates. Policy inertia and slow procurement keep New Yorkers vulnerable and city streets less safe for those on two wheels.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
