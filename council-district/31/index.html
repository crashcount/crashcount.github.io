Over 3,100 injured.</strong> Twenty-nine suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same again. In the last year alone, eight people died and more than a thousand were hurt. The dead include the young and the old. A 27-year-old woman died on the Belt Parkway. Police said, &ldquo;Since both occupants were out of the car at the time of the crash, investigators haven&rsquo;t figured out who was driving&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/08/woman-dies-queens-belt-parkway-accident/>according to NY Daily News</a>.

She pushed for daylighting at intersections, better lighting, and more speed humps. She pressed the city to publish its progress on street redesigns and called out the Department of Transportation for failing to deliver. &ldquo;DOT gives us their word every hearing and we are not getting results&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/22/council-transportation-chair-tells-dot-that-shes-sick-of-the-streets-plan-excuses>she said to Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p><p>But the streets are still deadly.

The bodies pile up.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every death is preventable.</strong> Every injury is a failure. Call Council Member Brooks-Powers. Demand she fight for a 20 mph speed limit, more daylighted intersections, and protected space for people on foot and bike.

The Department of Transportation has not selected a vendor, despite plans to add 500 secure spots by next month. Councilmembers urged action, calling the program potentially 'as transformative and impactful as our (Citi Bike) share program.' Jon Orcutt of Bike New York said, 'The Adams administration seems to be flubbing it, or failing it, or just letting it sort of slide through the cracks.' The delay leaves cyclists, especially delivery workers, exposed to theft and lacking safe storage. The city’s inaction stands in contrast to London, where secure bike parking has boosted cycling rates. Policy inertia and slow procurement keep New Yorkers vulnerable and city streets less safe for those on two wheels.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, speaking for local families, condemned the boardwalk ban: "It was about the children that take advantage of biking on the boardwalk...We’re now shifting them into the street." Residents and advocates argue these moves ignore years of complaints about poor maintenance and lack of coordination with DOT. They highlight that car-free conditions in Silver Lake Park improved safety, especially for children. Advocates call for shifting road maintenance from Parks to DOT and demand structural changes.

Intro 1105, sponsored by Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, mandates a tracker for projects that count toward safety benchmarks. Intro 1114, sponsored by Council Member Julie Won, calls for a broader capital projects tracker. The bills respond to the Adams administration's failure to meet legal targets for bus and bike lanes. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams said, 'Today’s legislation will advance greater transparency.' DOT officials pushed back, arguing project work is not linear and trackers have limited use. Won countered, 'It is [the DOT's] responsibility to take their capital plan and implement it.' Advocates and council members agree: tracking is only a first step. Without real follow-through, data alone will not save lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Their action: referral to committee. The bill requires the Department of Transportation to build new medians between bike lanes and car lanes that can support trees and other vegetation, subject to feasibility. Parks and Recreation must plant or allow planting in these medians.

At a community meeting, Brooks-Powers said, "We’ve been trying to get [the bike lane] removed for three years. It wasn’t supported by the community. ... In effect it’s not a bike lane quite honestly; no one uses it, they [drivers] park there. We would like to see the hard infrastructure removed." Instead of demanding enforcement against illegal parking, she wants the lane ripped out, returning the street to a more dangerous state for cyclists and pedestrians. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez replied that building safe bike lanes requires support from local leaders. DOT spokesperson Will Livingston said the agency remains committed to safety and will explore hardening the lane and increasing enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
