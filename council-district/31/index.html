The suit claims the redesign would "jeopardize" safety and hinder emergency access, despite DOT data showing 190 injuries and two deaths in the area since 2020. DOT says the project targets "unpredictable vehicle movements" and double parking, with design elements "found on streets across the city." The agency says it incorporated feedback from 90% of local businesses. The legal fight spotlights tension between safety improvements and business concerns, as the corridor ranks among Queens' most crash-prone.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The article states: 'forcing pedestrians and cyclists in both directions to share a single lane on a bridge with nine lanes for car drivers was unsafe.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, Queens Borough President Donovan Richards, and Council Member Julie Won attended the opening. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative change, so there is no direct impact on pedestrian or cyclist safety to assess.'

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "Brooklyn and Queens deserve a Conduit Boulevard that improves daily life, not a roadway that puts pedestrians and drivers at risk and physically divides entire neighborhoods." The corridor has seen five deaths and 40 severe injuries in five years. The median’s dirt paths show heavy pedestrian use, but only 15 crosswalks span the stretch.
