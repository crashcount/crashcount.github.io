The law, championed by then-Speaker Corey Johnson, aimed for safer, more equitable streets. Key projects, including bike lanes on McGuinness Boulevard and Ashland Place, and bus lanes on Fordham Road, were stalled or abandoned. The Department of Transportation blamed staff shortages and budget cuts. Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers said, 'Thirty-plus miles of completed new bike lane is of course better than none, but falls far short of Streets Plan requirements.' Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and other members voiced frustration but admitted limited power to enforce compliance. Council Member Chi Ossé was mentioned in coverage. Without mayoral commitment, the plan’s promise to protect vulnerable road users remains unfulfilled.

This incident marked the 29th cyclist fatality in 2023, a grim milestone in a year of rising traffic violence. Brooks-Powers criticized the Adams administration and the Department of Transportation for failing to meet the Streets Plan's legal requirement of 50 miles of protected bike lanes, achieving only about 30 miles. She stated, 'Thirty-plus miles of completed new bike lane is of course better than none, but falls far short of Streets Plan requirements.' Brooks-Powers also condemned the missed bus lane targets and called out DOT's lack of transparency, pledging to hold the agency accountable and push for safer, more equitable streets.

The effort, known as daylighting, aims to improve visibility and pedestrian safety. Adams said, 'Protecting New Yorkers is my most sacred responsibility as mayor.' Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers praised daylighting as 'a proven safety measure.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez stressed that daylighting must include physical infrastructure to prevent reckless turns. The Department of Transportation will also add raised crosswalks, extended sidewalks, and leading pedestrian signals at 1,000 intersections next year. The city will expand speed restriction technology in its fleet and increase data transparency. Advocates and community boards have long called for these changes. With nearly 47,000 intersections citywide, the plan will take decades to reach every corner.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, covered by Streetsblog NYC, quotes Adams: the fee is 'the beginning of the conversation' and exemptions must be considered. Councilmember Selvena Brooks-Powers, chair of the Transportation Committee, echoed concerns, saying the toll 'is going to put definitely a hardship on many of my constituents.' Experts Bruce Schaller and Danny Pearlstein criticized Adams, urging him to champion the program’s benefits for transit riders and the environment. The mayor’s office later clarified his comments focused on city workers in city vehicles. The article notes that while a small fraction of Brooks-Powers’s constituents drive into Manhattan, all would benefit from improved transit. Adams’s wavering undermines momentum for a policy proven to reduce traffic and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The law mandates daylighting—removing parking near intersections—to clear sight lines for drivers and protect people crossing.

The law sets deadlines: initial report by November 2023, implementation by June 2024, and new signage by July 2024.

Brooks-Powers, chair of the Transportation Committee, called DOT’s lack of progress tracking on the Streets Plan 'unacceptable.' The city has built only 13.5 of the required 50 miles of protected bike lanes this year. Advocates accuse Mayor Adams of abandoning cyclists and failing to meet legal safety obligations. Protesters rode from Union Square to City Hall, demanding action as the death toll climbs.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No change yet for street safety.</p><p class=mb3>Int 1215-2023 was introduced in the City Council on October 5, 2023, and referred to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to the posting of signs notifying operators of bicycles, bicycles with electric assist, and electric scooters of the prohibition against operating such devices on sidewalks, park walkways, and boardwalks, and of related fines and penalties," would require the Department of Transportation and the Department of Parks and Recreation to post signs warning riders of these restrictions and the consequences. Council Member Lincoln Restler led as primary sponsor, joined by Hudson, Hanif, Brewer, Ung, Abreu, Brooks-Powers, Gutiérrez, and Schulman. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. No direct safety analysis was provided. The measure aims for clarity, not infrastructure change.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
