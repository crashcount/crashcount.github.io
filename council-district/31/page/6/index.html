She has backed bills to daylight intersections, lower speed limits, and expand greenways. She co-sponsored a law to ban parking near crosswalks, to keep sightlines clear for those on foot and bike. She has questioned crackdowns that target cyclists instead of the drivers who kill: <strong>Brooks-Powers asked why police are dragging cyclists into criminal court for minor infractions</strong> <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/06/as-nypds-criminal-crackdown-on-cyclists-expands-it-grows-more-absurd-victims>as reported</a>.</p><p>But the deaths keep coming.

The city has the power to lower speed limits, redesign deadly roads, and keep crosswalks clear. Residents must demand it. Call Council Member Brooks-Powers. Call the Mayor. Call the DOT.

The city’s most fragile pay the price.</p><p class=mb3>On February 28, 2024, the conflict between the City Council and Department of Transportation over the Streets Master Plan erupted. The DOT failed to meet 2023’s legal benchmarks: just 5.2 miles of protected bus lanes built out of 30 required, and 32 miles of protected bike lanes out of 50 mandated by 2019 law. Council Member Chi Ossé (District 36) was mentioned, but only six of 51 council members responded to DOT’s call for safety project suggestions. The matter centers on the DOT’s report and council inaction: 'Out of 51 City Council members, only six responded to a request from DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez for recommended locations where street safety improvements should be made in their districts.' Mayor Adams slashed DOT’s budget and weakened projects, while council leaders deflected responsibility. Advocates like Jon Orcutt and Elizabeth Adams demanded decisive action, warning that delays and excuses cost lives. More than half of New Yorkers remain far from protected bike lanes as daily cycling surges. The city’s vulnerable road users remain at risk while officials pass the buck.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brooks-Powers stated, 'The Streets Plan is the law, and the Department of Transportation is still failing to fulfill its legal obligations.' She promised to hold DOT accountable at an upcoming budget hearing. The city also lagged on bus stop upgrades, completing just 54 out of 500 required.

Brooks-Powers (District 31), chair of the City Council’s Transportation Committee, came under fire after media reports revealed her family car received 25 traffic tickets in 16 months, including 20 for speeding near schools. The controversy centers on officials’ personal compliance with traffic laws while publicly supporting measures like speed cameras and congestion pricing. Brooks-Powers, who has promoted speed cameras and legislation to reward reporting hit-and-run drivers, claims her husband was responsible for the violations and that she has not used the car in over a year. Councilman Robert Holden called her a 'hypocrite,' while safe streets advocate Adam White stressed, 'Public officials and their families need to abide by speed cameras and red lights... people’s lives are at risk.'

The measure, previously stripped down in committee, now returns to its original form. The matter title: 'Prophet Motive: Restler Bill Would Restore 25% Bounty for Blocked Bike and Bus Lane Tickets.' Restler vows to push hard for passage, saying, 'This bill would make a tremendous difference in making our streets safer for cyclists and pedestrians.' Activists like Sara Lind back the bounty, arguing, 'More reporting, more enforcement, will lead to fewer violations.' The bill’s fate is uncertain after Restler’s removal from the Transportation Committee, but the intent is clear: shift enforcement from NYPD to the people, and clear the way for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report, titled "NYC streets have gotten safer under Vision Zero – especially if you live in a white neighborhood," found that while traffic fatalities dropped citywide, majority-Black communities saw a 13% increase and Latino areas a 30% rise. Brooks-Powers said, "It is deeply concerning that communities of color are experiencing fatalities at higher rates." The report states, "It's clear the program has not been fully or effectively implemented in neighborhoods of color and with lower incomes." DOT spokesperson Anna Correa responded that recent plans focus more resources on high-poverty, non-white neighborhoods, but the safety gap persists. The data shows Vision Zero’s benefits depend on where you live—and who the city prioritizes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation, led by Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, installed these barriers in fall 2023, aiming to 'harden' bike lanes in a borough with few safe cycling routes. Cyclists like Joseph Rienti say the barriers are better than nothing, but drivers now park at both ends, forcing riders into car traffic. Rienti urges better design or enforcement, not removal. Police enforcement is almost nonexistent: less than 2 percent of 76,000 complaints led to tickets. City Council, including Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, has not advanced a bill allowing citizen reporting of blocked lanes, despite majority support. DOT spokeswoman Mona Bruno promises to work with police, but for now, the barriers fail to protect vulnerable cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Streets grow less free.</p><p class=mb3>On November 3, 2023, Revel, the Brooklyn-based electric moped company, announced it will end its moped rental service in New York City and San Francisco. The company’s founders, Frank Reig and Paul Suhey, shared the news, citing a 30 percent drop in ridership and financial strain. Revel’s mopeds, once hailed as a lifeline during transit disruptions, will disappear from city streets by November 18. The company now focuses on its growing electric taxi fleet, boasting 500 Teslas and over 1,500 drivers. Advocates mourned the loss, calling it a bad day for car-free travel. Revel’s mopeds were legal, registered, and barred from bike lanes by geo-fencing. Their departure leaves fewer options for vulnerable road users seeking safe, efficient alternatives to cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
