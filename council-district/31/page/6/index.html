Over a thousand injured.</strong> In the last year, District 31 has seen 1,015 people hurt and 8 killed in traffic crashes. The dead include the old and the young. A woman in her seventies, found unconscious in the back seat of a minivan, did not make it out alive. Three others, all seniors, were rushed to the hospital. The minivan veered off Brookville Boulevard and struck a tree. Police said, &ldquo;A woman was killed and three other people were hospitalized when a trip from a Queens senior residential home turned deadly early Friday&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/14/woman-killed-3-hurt-in-senior-residence-minivan-crash/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>On the Belt Parkway, a 27-year-old woman died in a single-car crash. Police found both occupants outside the wreck. &ldquo;Since both occupants were out of the car at the time of the crash, investigators haven&rsquo;t figured out who was driving, police said&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/08/woman-dies-queens-belt-parkway-accident/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p><strong>SUVs, sedans, trucks.</strong> The machines keep moving. The bodies pile up. In the last twelve months, three people over 75 died. One person under 25. No one is spared.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers has backed bills to clear parked cars from crosswalks, add speed humps, and expand lighting for pedestrians. She voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable for crossing the street (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>). She called out city agencies for failing to deliver on promised bike lanes and bus lanes, saying, &ldquo;DOT gives us their word every hearing and we are not getting results&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/22/council-transportation-chair-tells-dot-that-shes-sick-of-the-streets-plan-excuses>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>But the carnage continues. Bills sit in committee. Promises gather dust. The streets do not wait.</p><h3 id=the-next-fight-action-not-excuses>The Next Fight: Action, Not Excuses</h3><p><strong>Speed kills.</strong> Lowering the speed limit to 20 mph citywide is now possible. Cameras that catch speeders and red-light runners are proven to save lives, but their future is not guaranteed. Every day of delay means another family shattered.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer streets.</strong> Join groups like <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> and <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>.

The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling on the New York State Legislature to pass, and the Governor to sign, A.5001-A/S.2515-B, in relation to establishing scramble crosswalks leading to and from school buildings during times of student arrival and dismissal.' Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary), Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, Lincoln Restler, and Kevin C. Riley sponsored the measure.

She stressed, 'The 30 miles of bus lane and 50 miles of bike lanes is not a goal—it’s legal mandate.' The exchange revealed ongoing tension over DOT’s slow rollout and lack of transparency.

The bill’s matter title reads: 'requiring the department of transportation to develop a map of bicycle infrastructure conditions.' Council Member Crystal Hudson sponsored the bill, joined by Rivera, Sanchez, Stevens, Yeger, Restler, Avilés, and others.

Riders and walkers pay the price for weak enforcement.</p><p class=mb3>On June 27, 2023, the City Council held a hearing on NYPD enforcement against ghost cars—vehicles with fake, covered, or defaced plates. NYPD Transportation Bureau’s Michael Pilecki reported arrests for forged plates fell 11 percent from last year, while summonses rose just 0.6 percent. The hearing spotlighted two bills from Council Member Oswald Feliz to raise fines for using or selling fake plates, both widely supported, including by the NYPD. The matter summary: 'NYPD claims it has stepped up its efforts to summons and arrest car drivers who cover or deface their plate, or drive with a fake temporary tag, but its own statistics show that the effort has not continued into this year.' Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers and Kamillah Hanks did not comment. Activists and officials noted DOT’s automated cameras failed to bill 1.2 million violations last year due to temp tags, leaving dangerous drivers unaccountable. The city’s weak enforcement leaves vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary states: 'Because people are dying and being maimed on New York's most-dangerous 25-mile-per-hour streets.' Supporters, including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, cite the science: lower speeds mean less force, fewer deaths. Research shows 20 mph zones cut crashes by 60 percent.
