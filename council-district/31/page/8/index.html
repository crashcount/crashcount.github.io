Stop the repeats.</p><ul><li>Albany handed New York City the power to set safer speeds. City Hall can lower residential streets to 20 mph. That cuts force. That saves lives. See our <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a> guide.</li><li>One small group of drivers does outsized harm. Vehicles with 16 camera tickets in a year double the risk of killing or seriously injuring someone; 30+ tickets multiplies it fifty‑fold. The Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045C/A2299C) would require speed limiters for drivers who rack up those records. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/20/the-1-5-percent-of-drivers-who-cause-21-percent-of-pedestrian-deaths>Evidence and bill details</a> in our <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</li></ul><p>This is District 31.

The report, reviewed by Council Transportation Chair Selvena N. Brooks-Powers (District 31), found little impact: 'A program meant to crack down on dangerous drivers did not dramatically reduce their behavior.' Only half completed the course, violations persisted, and just 12 vehicles were seized. Brooks-Powers stated, 'Holding reckless drivers accountable and keeping our streets safe for all New Yorkers remains a priority.' Comptroller Brad Lander criticized DOT for abandoning the effort, urging the city to strengthen, not scrap, DVAP.

She stressed, 'The 30 miles of bus lane and 50 miles of bike lanes is not a goal—it’s legal mandate.' The exchange revealed ongoing tension over DOT’s slow rollout and lack of transparency.

This bill has two sponsors and no opposition. Meanwhile, thirteen more significant bills, including measures to streamline bike lane installation, enable reporting of blocked bike and bus lanes, create e-bike charging stations for delivery workers, and improve truck route safety, remain unscheduled despite broad support. Only 19% of the committee’s 113 bills have had hearings; just 4% have passed. Advocates like Elizabeth Adams and Jon Orcutt decry the slow pace, especially as traffic crashes and injuries remain high. Brooks-Powers has not responded to requests for comment.

Riders and walkers pay the price for weak enforcement.</p><p class=mb3>On June 27, 2023, the City Council held a hearing on NYPD enforcement against ghost cars—vehicles with fake, covered, or defaced plates. NYPD Transportation Bureau’s Michael Pilecki reported arrests for forged plates fell 11 percent from last year, while summonses rose just 0.6 percent. The hearing spotlighted two bills from Council Member Oswald Feliz to raise fines for using or selling fake plates, both widely supported, including by the NYPD. The matter summary: 'NYPD claims it has stepped up its efforts to summons and arrest car drivers who cover or deface their plate, or drive with a fake temporary tag, but its own statistics show that the effort has not continued into this year.' Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers and Kamillah Hanks did not comment. Activists and officials noted DOT’s automated cameras failed to bill 1.2 million violations last year due to temp tags, leaving dangerous drivers unaccountable. The city’s weak enforcement leaves vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT Commissioner Rodriguez said, 'E-scooters and other forms of micromobility will help us build a cleaner and greener transportation system that connects residents to commercial and transit hubs.' Council Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers celebrated the move, highlighting its impact on transit deserts in Southeast Queens. The Bronx pilot logged over two million trips with very low injury rates. Safety features—speed limits, in-app training, 'Beginner Mode,' and no overnight use for new riders—will continue.

Mayor Adams said, “This is a five-borough city and we are now saying the Summer Streets program is going be a five-borough initiative. Everyone deserves to enjoy that.” Adams expressed interest in longer hours but cited public safety and NYPD staffing costs as barriers. Advocates want more hours and connected car-free routes. The city will spend $1.5 million, not including staffing.

Council Member Jen Gutierrez carried the resolution; Selvena Brooks-Powers later signed on. The bill targets corridors like Bushwick Avenue, Laurelton Parkway, and East Gun Hill Road—sites of hundreds of crashes and dozens killed or maimed since 2019. The matter summary states: 'Because people are dying and being maimed on New York's most-dangerous 25-mile-per-hour streets.' Supporters, including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, cite the science: lower speeds mean less force, fewer deaths. Research shows 20 mph zones cut crashes by 60 percent. The bill does not mandate, but allows, lower limits where carnage is highest. The council’s action centers the lives of pedestrians and cyclists, demanding the city act before more are lost.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
