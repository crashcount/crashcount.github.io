See our <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a> guide.</li><li>One small group of drivers does outsized harm. Vehicles with 16 camera tickets in a year double the risk of killing or seriously injuring someone; 30+ tickets multiplies it fifty‑fold. The Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045C/A2299C) would require speed limiters for drivers who rack up those records. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/20/the-1-5-percent-of-drivers-who-cause-21-percent-of-pedestrian-deaths>Evidence and bill details</a> in our <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</li></ul><p>This is District 31.

Federal Secretary Duffy objects. Critics say his stance ignores history and safety. The bridge once belonged to walkers. Now, the city returns space to people, not cars. Tensions flare. Vulnerable users watch.</p><p class=mb3>On May 19, 2025, Streetsblog NYC covered the Adams administration's move to open a dedicated pedestrian path on the Queensboro Bridge. The event, not a council bill but a city action, drew sharp criticism from U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, who opposed removing a vehicle lane for pedestrians and cyclists. The article states: 'forcing pedestrians and cyclists in both directions to share a single lane on a bridge with nine lanes for car drivers was unsafe.' DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, Queens Borough President Donovan Richards, and Council Member Julie Won attended the opening. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text does not describe a specific policy or legislative change, so there is no direct impact on pedestrian or cyclist safety to assess.' Still, the move restores space to those on foot and bike, challenging car dominance and federal resistance.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It's confusing, it's poorly designed ... and we know the lack of sufficient pedestrian and bike infrastructure makes it even more dangerous for the neighbors of Queens and Brooklyn."" -- Donovan J. Richards</p><p class=mb3>On May 13, 2025, the Department of Transportation (DOT) announced a city-funded public engagement process for a major safety redesign of Conduit Boulevard, a three-mile corridor linking Atlantic Avenue to the Belt Parkway and JFK Airport. The project follows urgent requests in 2023 from Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "Brooklyn and Queens deserve a Conduit Boulevard that improves daily life, not a roadway that puts pedestrians and drivers at risk and physically divides entire neighborhoods." The corridor has seen five deaths and 40 severe injuries in five years. The median’s dirt paths show heavy pedestrian use, but only 15 crosswalks span the stretch. The public process begins in June and may run into 2026. The redesign aims to end decades of danger for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The policy, supported by Mayor Adams and Police Commissioner Tisch, escalates minor cycling infractions to criminal court summonses. The article, titled 'As NYPD’s Criminal Crackdown on Cyclists Expands, It Grows More Absurd: Victims,' details complaints of overzealous, inconsistent enforcement and alleged entrapment. Council Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers questioned the need for criminal court involvement, while Comptroller Brad Lander called the crackdown 'performative' and dangerous. The safety analyst notes: 'Policies that empower discretionary or punitive enforcement against cyclists can deter active transportation, increase fear and mistrust, and shift responsibility away from systemic safety improvements, ultimately undermining population-level safety for vulnerable road users.' The crackdown draws widespread criticism for endangering those outside cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The policy, backed by Mayor Adams and Police Commissioner Tisch, claims to target 'quality of life' offenses. Cyclists report tickets for minor or fabricated infractions, including headphone use and stopping ahead of painted lines. Comptroller and mayoral candidate Brad Lander called the crackdown 'performative,' urging alternatives like the Idaho Stop and stricter delivery app regulation. Council Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers questioned the need for criminal court involvement and signaled interest in a hearing. The article notes e-bike riders cause few pedestrian injuries. The City Council previously limited criminal summonses for minor infractions over racial profiling concerns. Critics say the crackdown punishes vulnerable road users while failing to improve street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Police said Peña drove 83 mph in a 25 mph zone and ran a red light, t-boning Justin Diaz near LaGuardia Airport. Peña had a history of 25 school-zone speeding tickets. The article quotes Diaz's brother: "We're sick, angry, disgusted." Peña was charged with vehicular manslaughter, DWI, and refusing a breath test.

The department banned bikes from a major stretch of the Rockaway Boardwalk, closed parts of the Hudson River Greenway, and allowed cars back into Silver Lake Park. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, speaking for local families, condemned the boardwalk ban: "It was about the children that take advantage of biking on the boardwalk...We’re now shifting them into the street." Residents and advocates argue these moves ignore years of complaints about poor maintenance and lack of coordination with DOT. They highlight that car-free conditions in Silver Lake Park improved safety, especially for children. Advocates call for shifting road maintenance from Parks to DOT and demand structural changes. The Parks Department’s focus on recreation, not transportation, leaves vulnerable road users exposed and frustrated.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The debate rages on.</p><p class=mb3>On April 23, 2025, the City Council debated a new bill to bring back year-round roadway dining. The measure, still in committee, follows the 2023 law that limited outdoor dining to April through November. Council Member Lincoln Restler (D-Brooklyn) leads the charge, calling the current law a 'failure' that 'prioritized parking spots over vibrant streets.' Restler, who voted against the seasonal restriction, now seeks broader support. Council Member Chi Ossé (D-Bedford-Stuyvesant) and Carlina Rivera (Lower East Side) also back the change, though both previously supported the seasonal law to keep some form of the program alive. Committee chair Selvena Brooks-Powers (D-Queens) is open to the idea, while Council Member Julie Menin (D-Upper East Side) criticizes DOT's management, urging a shift to the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection. Lawmakers and advocates agree: high costs, bureaucracy, and seasonality block participation and hurt street life.
