Brooks-Powers</p><p class=mb3>On January 22, 2025, Council Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers confronted the Department of Transportation at a public hearing. She cited DOT's repeated failure to meet the 2019 Streets Master Plan benchmarks—50 miles of protected bike lanes and 30 miles of bus lanes each year. In 2024, DOT delivered only 5.3 miles of bus lanes and 25.7 miles of bike lanes. Brooks-Powers introduced Intro 1105, a bill requiring DOT to publish a tracker of its progress. She declared, "DOT gives us their word every hearing and we are not getting results." DOT First Deputy Commissioner Margaret Forgione objected, claiming the tracker would add paperwork and reduce community engagement. Brooks-Powers countered, "DOT needs to be more transparent about its project pipeline so we can identify bottlenecks." The committee signaled intent to advance the bill. The city’s failure leaves pedestrians, cyclists, and bus riders exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The proposal includes over $30 million in new funding, 17 new local routes, and increased frequency for 17 lines, but also service reductions on 29 routes. The main highlight is the introduction of 'rush' routes to connect riders to rail faster. MTA Chair Janno Lieber said, 'Every change to a route has an impact on the schedule... and we did it.' Queens Borough President Donovan Richards voiced support, stating, 'I'm ready. We're ready.' The process began in 2019 and was shaped by extensive community input.

Advocates warned new language could blame pedestrians for crashes. The bill would have let people cross mid-block, but now demands they yield to drivers. Racial bias in enforcement remains unaddressed.</p><p class=mb3>On September 12, 2024, the City Council delayed action on a bill to legalize jaywalking. The measure, sponsored by Council Member Mercedes Narcisse, passed the Transportation Committee but was withdrawn before a full Council vote. The bill’s summary stated it would 'legalize crossing outside crosswalks and require a pedestrian education campaign.' Advocates objected to last-minute changes that would force pedestrians to yield to drivers, fearing it could criminalize those struck by cars. Narcisse highlighted 'systemic bias in how these laws are enforced.' Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers said, 'There is little evidence to support the claim that criminal or civil offenses for jaywalking change pedestrian behavior or increase pedestrian safety,' and noted racial disparities in ticketing. The NYPD and DOT opposed the bill, citing safety concerns. The bill’s fate remains uncertain, with advocates demanding stronger protections for pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Protected bike lanes. Bigger pedestrian islands. Raised crosswalks. City officials promise change after 112 crashes since 2019. Construction starts 2027. No more waiting for blood on the asphalt.</p><p class=mb3>The planned overhaul targets the chaotic intersection of Beach 35th Street, Seagirt Boulevard, Rockaway Freeway, and Beach Channel Drive. Announced September 11, 2024, the $24.8 million project includes protected bike lanes, expanded sidewalks, and safer crossings. Queens Borough President Donovan Richards pledged $500,000, saying, "We're not waiting until someone loses their life to take action." Since 2019, 112 crashes have injured 54 people here—five of them pedestrians. The intersection currently favors cars, forcing pedestrians on long detours. The redesign will dead-end Beach 35th Street, add raised bike lanes, and expand pedestrian space. Final design is due next year, with construction set for 2027 and completion by 2029. The project includes a $2.6 million federal grant and is tied to Edgemere sewer upgrades.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Pedestrians now cross anywhere, any time. No summons. Law strips drivers of excuses. Streets shift. Power tilts to people on foot.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0346-2024, now enacted, rewrites New York’s pedestrian rules. The bill, heard by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, passed on September 26, 2024, and became law on October 26, 2024. Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers. It shifts blame from people on foot to the system and those behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
