She has backed bills to daylight intersections, lower speed limits, and expand greenways. She co-sponsored a law to ban parking near crosswalks, to keep sightlines clear for those on foot and bike. She has questioned crackdowns that target cyclists instead of the drivers who kill: <strong>Brooks-Powers asked why police are dragging cyclists into criminal court for minor infractions</strong> <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/05/06/as-nypds-criminal-crackdown-on-cyclists-expands-it-grows-more-absurd-victims>as reported</a>.</p><p>But the deaths keep coming.

The city has the power to lower speed limits, redesign deadly roads, and keep crosswalks clear. Residents must demand it. Call Council Member Brooks-Powers. Call the Mayor. Call the DOT.

The crash involved a pickup and a sedan, both traveling east. The report states, 'A pickup flipped after a lane change. A 73-year-old man, belted in the front seat, bled from the head.' The sedan’s front left quarter panel was crushed. Police cite 'Unsafe Lane Changing' and 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' as contributing factors. The 73-year-old male passenger in the pickup, restrained by a lap belt and harness, suffered severe head bleeding but remained conscious. The report details blood on the belt and silence on the road.

The collision occurred when the Jeep, identified as having 'Brakes Defective' as a contributing factor, crashed into the Cadillac’s center back end. The front passenger in the Cadillac, a 45-year-old man, was injured with severe neck crush injuries and remained conscious at the scene. The report notes that the passenger wore only a lap belt. The Jeep showed no damage, while the Cadillac sustained damage to the right rear bumper. The police report explicitly cites 'Brakes Defective' as the primary cause, highlighting a clear driver-related mechanical failure. No victim behaviors are listed as contributing factors.

The measure, sponsored by Council Member Mercedes Narcisse, passed the Transportation Committee but was withdrawn before a full Council vote. The bill’s summary stated it would 'legalize crossing outside crosswalks and require a pedestrian education campaign.' Advocates objected to last-minute changes that would force pedestrians to yield to drivers, fearing it could criminalize those struck by cars. Narcisse highlighted 'systemic bias in how these laws are enforced.' Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers said, 'There is little evidence to support the claim that criminal or civil offenses for jaywalking change pedestrian behavior or increase pedestrian safety,' and noted racial disparities in ticketing. The NYPD and DOT opposed the bill, citing safety concerns. The bill’s fate remains uncertain, with advocates demanding stronger protections for pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Announced September 11, 2024, the $24.8 million project includes protected bike lanes, expanded sidewalks, and safer crossings. Queens Borough President Donovan Richards pledged $500,000, saying, "We're not waiting until someone loses their life to take action." Since 2019, 112 crashes have injured 54 people here—five of them pedestrians. The intersection currently favors cars, forcing pedestrians on long detours. The redesign will dead-end Beach 35th Street, add raised bike lanes, and expand pedestrian space. Final design is due next year, with construction set for 2027 and completion by 2029.

Richards opposes lifting mandates in Queens, citing poor transit. Marmorato lobbied to restore mandates in a Bronx rezoning near new Metro North stations, arguing, 'We live in a transit desert where cars are a necessity for daily activities.' The editorial rebukes this logic, stating, 'We should not cling to parking mandates when we know they encourage car ownership, make streets less vibrant, increase rents, and pollute our air.' The piece urges officials to break the cycle of car-first policy, invest in transit, and end mandates that block affordable housing and safer streets. No safety analyst assessment was provided, but the editorial centers the harm parking mandates inflict on vulnerable road users and the city’s livability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Richards supports removing parking mandates in high-density, transit-rich areas—like downtown Jamaica, Flushing, and Long Island City—saying, “Parking mandates in major transit hubs... should be eliminated, in order to increase housing opportunities there.” But he opposes ending parking mandates citywide, insisting they remain in low-density, outer transit-oriented development areas (OTODAs) due to infrequent Long Island Rail Road service and car dependence. Richards claims, “This is the reality of living in a transit desert.” The move splits the city, keeping car-centric policies in place for much of Queens. Housing advocates and the mayor’s office argue that citywide parking reform is needed to spur housing and reduce car reliance, but Richards’s stance preserves systemic danger for vulnerable road users in sprawling neighborhoods.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Christopher Marte welcomed the slow zone in his district, citing rampant speeding off the bridges. Advocates and officials demand faster, broader action, saying, 'Twenty is plenty wherever you'll find people, and in New York that's everywhere.'
