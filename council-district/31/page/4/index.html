The victim was taken to Jamaica Hospital, where he died. No arrests have been announced.</p><p>This year in Council District 31 there have been 4 deaths and about 800 injuries so far, up from 1 death and 572 injuries at this point last year (NYC Open Data).

Fatalities rise overnight, with a clear spike between about 1 a.m. and 3 a.m., indicating the need for better night lighting and enforcement (NYC Open Data).</p><p>Local data point to a few recurring causes: the largest contributing buckets are recorded as “other” and traffic‑related errors, and unsafe speed appears frequently in crash reports.

The proposal includes over $30 million in new funding, 17 new local routes, and increased frequency for 17 lines, but also service reductions on 29 routes. The main highlight is the introduction of 'rush' routes to connect riders to rail faster. MTA Chair Janno Lieber said, 'Every change to a route has an impact on the schedule... and we did it.' Queens Borough President Donovan Richards voiced support, stating, 'I'm ready. We're ready.' The process began in 2019 and was shaped by extensive community input.

The measure, sponsored by Council Member Mercedes Narcisse, passed the Transportation Committee but was withdrawn before a full Council vote. The bill’s summary stated it would 'legalize crossing outside crosswalks and require a pedestrian education campaign.' Advocates objected to last-minute changes that would force pedestrians to yield to drivers, fearing it could criminalize those struck by cars. Narcisse highlighted 'systemic bias in how these laws are enforced.' Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers said, 'There is little evidence to support the claim that criminal or civil offenses for jaywalking change pedestrian behavior or increase pedestrian safety,' and noted racial disparities in ticketing. The NYPD and DOT opposed the bill, citing safety concerns.

A six-year-old girl, strapped in back, took glass to the face. Blood marked the spot. Obstructed view left her wounded in daylight.</p><p class=mb3>At Beach Channel Drive and Beach 45 Street in Queens, two SUVs collided at 12:05 PM. According to the police report, both vehicles were 'going straight ahead' when they crashed. The report lists 'View Obstructed/Limited' as the contributing factor. A six-year-old girl, riding in the rear seat, suffered severe facial lacerations from shattered glass. She was restrained in a child seat. The drivers were licensed and no other driver errors were cited. The crash shows how blocked sightlines at intersections put vulnerable passengers at risk when heavy vehicles collide.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
