Over a thousand injured.</strong> In the last year, District 31 has seen 1,015 people hurt and 8 killed in traffic crashes. The dead include the old and the young. A woman in her seventies, found unconscious in the back seat of a minivan, did not make it out alive. Three others, all seniors, were rushed to the hospital. The minivan veered off Brookville Boulevard and struck a tree. Police said, &ldquo;A woman was killed and three other people were hospitalized when a trip from a Queens senior residential home turned deadly early Friday&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/14/woman-killed-3-hurt-in-senior-residence-minivan-crash/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>On the Belt Parkway, a 27-year-old woman died in a single-car crash. Police found both occupants outside the wreck. &ldquo;Since both occupants were out of the car at the time of the crash, investigators haven&rsquo;t figured out who was driving, police said&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/08/woman-dies-queens-belt-parkway-accident/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p><strong>SUVs, sedans, trucks.</strong> The machines keep moving. The bodies pile up. In the last twelve months, three people over 75 died. One person under 25. No one is spared.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers has backed bills to clear parked cars from crosswalks, add speed humps, and expand lighting for pedestrians. She voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable for crossing the street (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>). She called out city agencies for failing to deliver on promised bike lanes and bus lanes, saying, &ldquo;DOT gives us their word every hearing and we are not getting results&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/22/council-transportation-chair-tells-dot-that-shes-sick-of-the-streets-plan-excuses>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>But the carnage continues. Bills sit in committee. Promises gather dust. The streets do not wait.</p><h3 id=the-next-fight-action-not-excuses>The Next Fight: Action, Not Excuses</h3><p><strong>Speed kills.</strong> Lowering the speed limit to 20 mph citywide is now possible. Cameras that catch speeders and red-light runners are proven to save lives, but their future is not guaranteed. Every day of delay means another family shattered.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer streets.</strong> Join groups like <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> and <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>.

Council Member Chi Ossé (District 36) was mentioned, but only six of 51 council members responded to DOT’s call for safety project suggestions. The matter centers on the DOT’s report and council inaction: 'Out of 51 City Council members, only six responded to a request from DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez for recommended locations where street safety improvements should be made in their districts.' Mayor Adams slashed DOT’s budget and weakened projects, while council leaders deflected responsibility. Advocates like Jon Orcutt and Elizabeth Adams demanded decisive action, warning that delays and excuses cost lives.

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez called the benchmarks "aggressive" but promised to keep trying. Mayor Adams has refused to be bound by the law’s targets.

The matter, titled 'Spinning wheels: Adams admin misses legal benchmarks for new bus, bike lanes for second year in a row, DOT data shows,' revealed DOT built only 31.9 miles of protected bike lanes and 5.2 miles of protected bus lanes in 2023—far short of the 50 and 30 miles required by the Streets Master Plan. Brooks-Powers stated, 'The Streets Plan is the law, and the Department of Transportation is still failing to fulfill its legal obligations.' She promised to hold DOT accountable at an upcoming budget hearing. The city also lagged on bus stop upgrades, completing just 54 out of 500 required. Cyclist fatalities soared to 30 in 2023, the highest this century.

Activists like Sara Lind back the bounty, arguing, 'More reporting, more enforcement, will lead to fewer violations.'

Cyclists like Joseph Rienti say the barriers are better than nothing, but drivers now park at both ends, forcing riders into car traffic. Rienti urges better design or enforcement, not removal. Police enforcement is almost nonexistent: less than 2 percent of 76,000 complaints led to tickets. City Council, including Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, has not advanced a bill allowing citizen reporting of blocked lanes, despite majority support. DOT spokeswoman Mona Bruno promises to work with police, but for now, the barriers fail to protect vulnerable cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Transportation Committee Chairwoman Selvena Brooks-Powers said, 'Thirty-plus miles of completed new bike lane is of course better than none, but falls far short of Streets Plan requirements.' She also criticized the DOT’s lack of transparency. Speaker Adrienne Adams joined calls for compliance but admitted the Council’s enforcement tools are limited.
