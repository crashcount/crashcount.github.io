Cyclists: 114 injured. Most deaths are speed and impact. The factor roll‑up flags “other” and vulnerable road user error across crashes; unsafe speed shows in fatal files above. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Mode split and factors</a>.</p></li><li><p>Concrete fixes here: daylighting and hardened turns at South Conduit service roads; raised crossings and LPIs at unsignalized legs; median refuges and protected paths where people already cross.

Stop the repeats.</p><ul><li>Albany handed New York City the power to set safer speeds. City Hall can lower residential streets to 20 mph. That cuts force. That saves lives. See our <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a> guide.</li><li>One small group of drivers does outsized harm. Vehicles with 16 camera tickets in a year double the risk of killing or seriously injuring someone; 30+ tickets multiplies it fifty‑fold. The Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045C/A2299C) would require speed limiters for drivers who rack up those records. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/20/the-1-5-percent-of-drivers-who-cause-21-percent-of-pedestrian-deaths>Evidence and bill details</a> in our <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</li></ul><p>This is District 31. Laurelton. Springfield Gardens. The Rockaways. JFK’s edge. The map shows the bodies. The clock shows the hours.

The fight pits open space against transit justice in Queens.</p><p class=mb3>On September 16, 2022, Mayor Adams announced the start of the QueensWay project, a $35 million plan to turn a defunct LIRR branch in Queens into a linear park. The first phase includes $5 million for environmental review and $30 million for the Metropolitan Hub. The matter summary states: 'converting a defunct LIRR branch into a Highline-style park in Queens.' Council Member Lynn Schulman supports the park, calling it 'shovel-ready.' Borough President Donovan Richards and Assembly Members Jenifer Rajkumar and David Weprin back both the park and the QueensLink transit proposal. Richards said, 'We need to do both when it comes to making sure that we can enhance our public transportation and also ensuring that our communities have access to open space.' Transit advocates warn the park blocks future rail service, cutting off faster commutes and cleaner air for southern Queens. The MTA previously cited high costs for transit reactivation. The debate continues over whether the right-of-way should serve parks, transit, or both.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, promised by the previous mayor for completion by the end of 2022, was pushed back at least a year. Won, whose district covers the bridge’s eastern approaches, led a walkthrough with DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and staff from Council Members Julie Menin and Selvena Brooks-Powers. Won said, “They kept saying they can’t give the south outer roadway to pedestrians because there would be traffic. Well, I don’t care about the congestion!” She forced the commissioner to stand in the cramped lane, showing how unsafe it is for both cyclists and pedestrians. DOT offered only minor adjustments, like repainting lines, which Won dismissed as “missing the point.” The agency promised lawmakers data to justify keeping five car lanes, but Won insisted the delay puts lives at risk and called for immediate action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, not a council bill but a city action, follows years of neglect and repeated crashes. DOT will cut traffic lanes from six to two, add a parking-protected bike lane, and expand pedestrian space. The plan also includes daylighting at intersections and improved markings. According to DOT, 'the project will improve safety for all users, providing connections to existing bike infrastructure and the reduction of a vehicle lane encouraging safer speeds.' Queens Borough President Donovan Richards praised the move, saying, 'Far too many people are killed and injured on our city’s streets, especially people of color, who are disproportionately impacted by traffic violence.' Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives added, 'DOT's move to turn car space into protected bike lanes on Seagirt Boulevard, while shortening crossings and expanding median space, will prevent speeding and make it safer to walk, bike, and take transit.'

The letter criticizes the MTA’s previous cost estimates and compares QueensLink’s need to the state-backed Interborough Express.

The matter, titled 'Transit Advocates to MTA: Queens Bus Redesign Needs Some Key Tweaks,' calls for five improvements: more frequent service, all-door boarding, better driver conditions, multilingual outreach, and equity transparency. Borough President Donovan Richards and groups like Riders Alliance, Straphangers Campaign, and Transportation Alternatives led the push. Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance said, 'We are trying to be responsible by saying the bus design simply needs some improvements.' Advocates stress that redesigns must reduce racial inequity and expand access for marginalized communities.

Streets still wait for real protection.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13, 2022, the City Council and Mayor Adams reached a budget agreement, allocating $53 million in operating funds for the Department of Transportation for the fiscal year starting July 1. This is a down payment on the mayor's promised $904 million for the Streets Master Plan, but falls short of the Council's $3.1 billion ask to double the plan's targets. The plan mandates 250 miles of protected bike lanes, 150 miles of dedicated bus lanes, and new public plazas. The official matter summary notes, 'the agreement provided far less for street safety projects than the Council originally sought.' Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and Mayor Adams announced the deal, but neither mentioned street safety in their press conference. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, chair of the Transportation Committee, did not comment. Advocates praised the funding as a significant step, but stressed the need for strong implementation to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Chairwoman Selvena Brooks-Powers urged action, saying, 'We must use all the tools at our disposal.' Council Members Joan Ariola, Vickie Paladino, and David Carr opposed, calling cameras a financial burden. Eric Dinowitz defended the program: 'If you don't want a speeding ticket, don't speed.'
