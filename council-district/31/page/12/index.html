The victim was taken to Jamaica Hospital, where he died. No arrests have been announced.</p><p>This year in Council District 31 there have been 4 deaths and about 800 injuries so far, up from 1 death and 572 injuries at this point last year (NYC Open Data).

Fatalities rise overnight, with a clear spike between about 1 a.m. and 3 a.m., indicating the need for better night lighting and enforcement (NYC Open Data).</p><p>Local data point to a few recurring causes: the largest contributing buckets are recorded as “other” and traffic‑related errors, and unsafe speed appears frequently in crash reports.

The Department of Transportation (DOT) launched the one-year, 24/7 busway pilot to speed up commutes for over 250,000 daily bus riders. Williams called her district a 'car community' and argued, 'there's only one metric of success for the bus lane and not looking comprehensively at how it's actually impacting the community.' Brooks-Powers claimed, 'People cannot access our local businesses.' Both members urged the city to end or shorten the pilot, citing business and driver complaints. DOT and transit advocates countered that bus speeds improved. The DOT plans to continue the pilot and survey businesses and riders at its end.

Borough President Donovan Richards and groups like Riders Alliance, Straphangers Campaign, and Transportation Alternatives led the push. Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance said, 'We are trying to be responsible by saying the bus design simply needs some improvements.'

This is a down payment on the mayor's promised $904 million for the Streets Master Plan, but falls short of the Council's $3.1 billion ask to double the plan's targets.

The official matter summary notes, 'the agreement provided far less for street safety projects than the Council originally sought.' Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and Mayor Adams announced the deal, but neither mentioned street safety in their press conference.

Chairwoman Selvena Brooks-Powers urged action, saying, 'We must use all the tools at our disposal.' Council Members Joan Ariola, Vickie Paladino, and David Carr opposed, calling cameras a financial burden. Eric Dinowitz defended the program: 'If you don't want a speeding ticket, don't speed.'

Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers backs home rule and cameras but questions where the money goes: 'Does DOT receive back any revenue?' Council Member Charles Barron supports cameras near schools but is noncommittal on home rule, noting, 'We have some of the highest fatalities and accidents, yet we don't see the highest amount of resources.' Speaker Adrienne Adams has voiced skepticism, calling cameras a way to 'nickel and dime' New Yorkers. Assembly Member Khaleel Anderson warns 24/7 cameras could hit Black and brown communities hardest. Assembly Member Dick Gottfried supports cameras and home rule, but many lawmakers hesitate. Advocates urge using revenue for street redesigns in underinvested areas.

NYPD Transportation Bureau Chief Kim Royster testified, stating, "So far this year, bike lane enforcement is up 148 percent." Streetsblog fact-checked this claim and found enforcement was actually down 6.4 percent from the previous year. Royster later clarified she referred only to tickets for driving in bike lanes, a small slice of total enforcement. Combined, bike lane enforcement was still down over 4 percent. Brooks-Powers questioned enforcement against illegally parked tractor-trailers. Royster cited fine amounts but gave no enforcement numbers. Data showed code 78 and code 6 violations both dropped sharply. Royster's answers were vague, lacking specifics on enforcement or safety. The hearing exposed a gap between NYPD claims and reality, leaving vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The resolution states: 'Providing instruction in bicycle and traffic safety in schools, starting at an early age and continuing throughout students' years in school, would be an effective measure to both promote cycling and prevent bicycle accidents and other safety incidents.' Bottcher criticized the Department of Education for failing to follow the law, noting only a handful of schools offer bike lessons. Bottcher said, 'We want to see that program enlarged significantly.' Advocates support the push but warn that education alone is not enough. Julie Huntington stressed, 'This announcement must come with an investment in building protected bike lanes and safe routes to school to keep our new riders safe.' Bottcher put the responsibility on drivers: 'Drivers are in the vehicle that weighs thousands of pounds... if they hit someone with their car, it’s very likely they could take their life.'

Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers, Carlina Rivera, Lincoln Restler, Sandy Nurse, Chi Ossé, Crystal Hudson, Shekar Krishnan, and Amanda Farías joined her. Traffic fatalities rose 44 percent in the first quarter of 2022, the deadliest start since Vision Zero began.

The project, under the 'Great Streets' program, is split into four phases, with construction for later phases delayed until at least 2024. The matter summary states: 'transform the currently barren median into a linear park to create a safe and easy way of traversing neighborhoods.' Queens Borough President Donovan Richards pledged $1 million to the first phase, stating, 'it really creates an unsafe scenario, especially for pedestrians and cyclists.' DOT spokesman Vin Barone said the redesign 'greatly improv[es] pedestrian safety while also drawing a huge number of new cyclists.' Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives called the delays 'unacceptable.' The plan includes upgraded bike lanes, bus stops, and bus-only lanes, but also adds curbside parking, which could increase congestion.

She demanded safe roads and good transit for every neighborhood, not just the rich. She vowed to center equity, listen to the unheard, and fix danger where it hits hardest.</p><p class=mb3>On March 8, 2022, Council Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers made a public statement on transportation equity. She declared, 'Equity in transportation means addressing the needs of neighborhoods that have suffered from long and dangerous commutes after decades of under-investment.' Brooks-Powers, representing Southeast Queens, highlighted high rates of pedestrian and motorist danger in her district. She pledged to shift the city's focus from transit-rich areas to those left behind, stressing the need for accessible streets, protection for children, and investment in minority and women-owned businesses. Brooks-Powers opposed enforcement-heavy approaches, promising instead to prioritize improvements and community input. Her leadership signals a push to measure DOT success by safety and access for all, especially the most vulnerable.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
