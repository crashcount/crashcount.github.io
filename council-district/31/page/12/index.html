Stop the repeats.</p><ul><li>Albany handed New York City the power to set safer speeds. City Hall can lower residential streets to 20 mph. That cuts force. That saves lives. See our <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a> guide.</li><li>One small group of drivers does outsized harm. Vehicles with 16 camera tickets in a year double the risk of killing or seriously injuring someone; 30+ tickets multiplies it fifty‑fold. The Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045C/A2299C) would require speed limiters for drivers who rack up those records. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/20/the-1-5-percent-of-drivers-who-cause-21-percent-of-pedestrian-deaths>Evidence and bill details</a> in our <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</li></ul><p>This is District 31.

The redesign aims to slow drivers and shield those outside cars from harm.</p><p class=mb3>On September 6, 2022, the Department of Transportation announced a major safety redesign for Seagirt Boulevard, a notorious crash corridor in Far Rockaway. The project, not a council bill but a city action, follows years of neglect and repeated crashes. DOT will cut traffic lanes from six to two, add a parking-protected bike lane, and expand pedestrian space. The plan also includes daylighting at intersections and improved markings. According to DOT, 'the project will improve safety for all users, providing connections to existing bike infrastructure and the reduction of a vehicle lane encouraging safer speeds.' Queens Borough President Donovan Richards praised the move, saying, 'Far too many people are killed and injured on our city’s streets, especially people of color, who are disproportionately impacted by traffic violence.' Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives added, 'DOT's move to turn car space into protected bike lanes on Seagirt Boulevard, while shortening crossings and expanding median space, will prevent speeding and make it safer to walk, bike, and take transit.' The redesign targets a stretch with 222 crashes and 87 injuries since 2019, aiming to end the long-standing danger for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, committee chair, emphasized, 'Transportation equity is a major issue in our city that must be confronted.' The letter criticizes the MTA’s previous cost estimates and compares QueensLink’s need to the state-backed Interborough Express. Supporters argue that if the state can spend $1 billion widening the Van Wyck Expressway, it can fund a study for transit. The EIS would include community engagement to address local concerns.

Borough President Donovan Richards and groups like Riders Alliance, Straphangers Campaign, and Transportation Alternatives led the push. Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance said, 'We are trying to be responsible by saying the bus design simply needs some improvements.'

The plan mandates 250 miles of protected bike lanes, 150 miles of dedicated bus lanes, and new public plazas. The official matter summary notes, 'the agreement provided far less for street safety projects than the Council originally sought.' Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and Mayor Adams announced the deal, but neither mentioned street safety in their press conference.

Council Member Charles Barron supports cameras near schools but is noncommittal on home rule, noting, 'We have some of the highest fatalities and accidents, yet we don't see the highest amount of resources.' Speaker Adrienne Adams has voiced skepticism, calling cameras a way to 'nickel and dime' New Yorkers. Assembly Member Khaleel Anderson warns 24/7 cameras could hit Black and brown communities hardest. Assembly Member Dick Gottfried supports cameras and home rule, but many lawmakers hesitate.

Streetsblog fact-checked this claim and found enforcement was actually down 6.4 percent from the previous year. Royster later clarified she referred only to tickets for driving in bike lanes, a small slice of total enforcement. Combined, bike lane enforcement was still down over 4 percent. Brooks-Powers questioned enforcement against illegally parked tractor-trailers. Royster cited fine amounts but gave no enforcement numbers. Data showed code 78 and code 6 violations both dropped sharply. Royster's answers were vague, lacking specifics on enforcement or safety.

The resolution states: 'Providing instruction in bicycle and traffic safety in schools, starting at an early age and continuing throughout students' years in school, would be an effective measure to both promote cycling and prevent bicycle accidents and other safety incidents.' Bottcher criticized the Department of Education for failing to follow the law, noting only a handful of schools offer bike lessons. Bottcher said, 'We want to see that program enlarged significantly.' Advocates support the push but warn that education alone is not enough. Julie Huntington stressed, 'This announcement must come with an investment in building protected bike lanes and safe routes to school to keep our new riders safe.' Bottcher put the responsibility on drivers: 'Drivers are in the vehicle that weighs thousands of pounds... if they hit someone with their car, it’s very likely they could take their life.' The council’s action highlights a gap between policy and real safety for children on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
