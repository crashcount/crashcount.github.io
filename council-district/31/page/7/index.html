The dead include a 27-year-old woman on the Belt Parkway, a 21-year-old man on Laurelton Parkway, and a woman in her seventies in a minivan on Brookville Boulevard. Each crash leaves a hole. A seatbelt left dangling. A name erased from the mailbox.</p><p>A police officer stood by the wreck on Brookville Boulevard. &ldquo;A woman was killed and three other people were hospitalized when a trip from a Queens senior residential home turned deadly early Friday,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/14/woman-killed-3-hurt-in-senior-residence-minivan-crash/>police said</a>.

Brooks-Powers has backed bills to daylight intersections, expand red light cameras, and lower speed limits on Open Streets.</strong> She voted to legalize crossing mid-block, ending jaywalking enforcement that often targeted the vulnerable. She has pressed the city to track its progress on street redesigns, saying, &ldquo;DOT gives us their word every hearing and we are not getting results&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/22/council-transportation-chair-tells-dot-that-shes-sick-of-the-streets-plan-excuses>she told the DOT</a>.</p><p>But the pace is slow.

Delay kills.</strong> Residents must demand more. Call Brooks-Powers. Call the Mayor. Demand the city use its new power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. Demand every intersection be made safe to cross. Demand cameras stay on. <strong>Every day of delay is another family changed forever.</strong></p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The resolution calls on the New York State Legislature and Governor to 'fully fund the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) in the State’s upcoming Fiscal Year 2024 Budget.' Council Member Farah N. Louis sponsored the measure, joined by over thirty co-sponsors. The committee vote was unanimous among present members. The resolution highlights the MTA’s critical role for millions of New Yorkers and warns of a 'looming fiscal cliff' as federal aid dries up. The Council insists that full funding is needed to prevent service cuts and keep transit affordable and frequent. The measure references the 'New York City in Six' plan, pushing for buses and trains every six minutes. The Council’s action centers the needs of riders—especially those with no other way to move safely through the city.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The program will allow large trucks to unload at designated hubs, shifting the final delivery leg to vans, cargo bikes, or carts. Details on locations and management are pending. After a year, DOT will review data and consider expansion, with a final report due in 2026.
