Over 3,100 injured.</strong> Twenty-nine suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same again. In the last year alone, eight people died and more than a thousand were hurt. The dead include the young and the old. A 27-year-old woman died on the Belt Parkway. Police said, &ldquo;Since both occupants were out of the car at the time of the crash, investigators haven&rsquo;t figured out who was driving&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/08/woman-dies-queens-belt-parkway-accident/>according to NY Daily News</a>.

She pushed for daylighting at intersections, better lighting, and more speed humps. She pressed the city to publish its progress on street redesigns and called out the Department of Transportation for failing to deliver. &ldquo;DOT gives us their word every hearing and we are not getting results&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/22/council-transportation-chair-tells-dot-that-shes-sick-of-the-streets-plan-excuses>she said to Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p><p>But the streets are still deadly.

The bodies pile up.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every death is preventable.</strong> Every injury is a failure. Call Council Member Brooks-Powers. Demand she fight for a 20 mph speed limit, more daylighted intersections, and protected space for people on foot and bike.

Council Member Jen Gutierrez carried the resolution; Selvena Brooks-Powers later signed on. The bill targets corridors like Bushwick Avenue, Laurelton Parkway, and East Gun Hill Road—sites of hundreds of crashes and dozens killed or maimed since 2019. The matter summary states: 'Because people are dying and being maimed on New York's most-dangerous 25-mile-per-hour streets.' Supporters, including State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, cite the science: lower speeds mean less force, fewer deaths. Research shows 20 mph zones cut crashes by 60 percent. The bill does not mandate, but allows, lower limits where carnage is highest. The council’s action centers the lives of pedestrians and cyclists, demanding the city act before more are lost.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

These actions aim to cut risk for pedestrians and seniors, especially at dangerous crossings. The council’s stance is clear: support for pedestrian safety zones, traffic calming, more crash studies, and daylighting. The vote signals a push for systemic change on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

High-crash intersections must be prioritized unless deemed infeasible. DOT must also install physical daylighting features, such as planters or bike corrals, where possible. Council Member Farah N.
