Racial bias in enforcement remains unaddressed.</p><p class=mb3>On September 12, 2024, the City Council delayed action on a bill to legalize jaywalking. The measure, sponsored by Council Member Mercedes Narcisse, passed the Transportation Committee but was withdrawn before a full Council vote. The bill’s summary stated it would 'legalize crossing outside crosswalks and require a pedestrian education campaign.' Advocates objected to last-minute changes that would force pedestrians to yield to drivers, fearing it could criminalize those struck by cars. Narcisse highlighted 'systemic bias in how these laws are enforced.' Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers said, 'There is little evidence to support the claim that criminal or civil offenses for jaywalking change pedestrian behavior or increase pedestrian safety,' and noted racial disparities in ticketing. The NYPD and DOT opposed the bill, citing safety concerns. The bill’s fate remains uncertain, with advocates demanding stronger protections for pedestrians.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

DOT can only lower limits street by street unless the City Council acts. Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers confirmed no citywide bill exists. Council Member Christopher Marte welcomed the slow zone in his district, citing rampant speeding off the bridges. Advocates and officials demand faster, broader action, saying, 'Twenty is plenty wherever you'll find people, and in New York that's everywhere.' DOT says it will prioritize areas near schools and neighborhoods with more non-white and low-income residents. The rollout is slow.
