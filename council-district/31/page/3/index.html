Stop the repeats.</p><ul><li>Albany handed New York City the power to set safer speeds. City Hall can lower residential streets to 20 mph. That cuts force. That saves lives. See our <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a> guide.</li><li>One small group of drivers does outsized harm. Vehicles with 16 camera tickets in a year double the risk of killing or seriously injuring someone; 30+ tickets multiplies it fifty‑fold. The Stop Super Speeders Act (S4045C/A2299C) would require speed limiters for drivers who rack up those records. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/10/20/the-1-5-percent-of-drivers-who-cause-21-percent-of-pedestrian-deaths>Evidence and bill details</a> in our <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</li></ul><p>This is District 31.

His blood alcohol content was .156, far above the legal limit. The crash killed Justin Diaz, 23, who was driving to work.

Intro 1105, sponsored by Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, mandates a tracker for projects that count toward safety benchmarks. Intro 1114, sponsored by Council Member Julie Won, calls for a broader capital projects tracker. The bills respond to the Adams administration's failure to meet legal targets for bus and bike lanes. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams said, 'Today’s legislation will advance greater transparency.' DOT officials pushed back, arguing project work is not linear and trackers have limited use. Won countered, 'It is [the DOT's] responsibility to take their capital plan and implement it.' Advocates and council members agree: tracking is only a first step.

Instead of demanding enforcement against illegal parking, she wants the lane ripped out, returning the street to a more dangerous state for cyclists and pedestrians. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez replied that building safe bike lanes requires support from local leaders. DOT spokesperson Will Livingston said the agency remains committed to safety and will explore hardening the lane and increasing enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

They warned, 'The limited funding and decreases in funding that have occurred over the years jeopardize the continuity and future of the program—funding pressure is already leading to downsizing and the disappearance of Open Streets programs.' The groups seek $48 million over three years, separate from the city’s $30 million contract with the Horticultural Society. Current grants max out at $20,000 per year, forcing cutbacks. Speaker Adrienne Adams and Mayor Adams are starting budget talks. Council spokesperson Julia Agos called Open Streets 'critical components of our city's public realm.' The Department of Transportation said suggestions will be reviewed. Volunteer groups handle most operations, but stalled redesigns and lack of resources threaten the program’s survival.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
