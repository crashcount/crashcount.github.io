Pena's blood-alcohol content was 0.156%, nearly double the legal limit, and he tested positive for cocaine and marijuana.

She blames illegal parking, not enforcement. Cyclists lose space. The city risks more danger. DOT says it will look at hardening the lane and boosting enforcement.</p><p class=mb3>On March 24, 2025, Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, chair of the Transportation Committee, called for the removal of the protected bike lane on Beach 20th Street in Arverne, Queens. At a community meeting, Brooks-Powers said, "We’ve been trying to get [the bike lane] removed for three years. It wasn’t supported by the community. ... In effect it’s not a bike lane quite honestly; no one uses it, they [drivers] park there. We would like to see the hard infrastructure removed." Instead of demanding enforcement against illegal parking, she wants the lane ripped out, returning the street to a more dangerous state for cyclists and pedestrians. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez replied that building safe bike lanes requires support from local leaders. DOT spokesperson Will Livingston said the agency remains committed to safety and will explore hardening the lane and increasing enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The city’s inaction puts public space and safety at risk.</p><p class=mb3>On March 14, 2025, a coalition of 16 volunteer open street groups sent a letter to City Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers. They warned, 'The limited funding and decreases in funding that have occurred over the years jeopardize the continuity and future of the program—funding pressure is already leading to downsizing and the disappearance of Open Streets programs.' The groups seek $48 million over three years, separate from the city’s $30 million contract with the Horticultural Society. Current grants max out at $20,000 per year, forcing cutbacks. Speaker Adrienne Adams and Mayor Adams are starting budget talks. Council spokesperson Julia Agos called Open Streets 'critical components of our city's public realm.' The Department of Transportation said suggestions will be reviewed. Volunteer groups handle most operations, but stalled redesigns and lack of resources threaten the program’s survival.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She pushed a bill to force public tracking. DOT made excuses. The city fell short for the third year. Vulnerable road users wait. The council wants answers, not promises.</p><p class=mb3>""DOT gives us their word every hearing and we are not getting results,"" -- Selvena N. Brooks-Powers</p><p class=mb3>On January 22, 2025, Council Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers confronted the Department of Transportation at a public hearing. She cited DOT's repeated failure to meet the 2019 Streets Master Plan benchmarks—50 miles of protected bike lanes and 30 miles of bus lanes each year. In 2024, DOT delivered only 5.3 miles of bus lanes and 25.7 miles of bike lanes. Brooks-Powers introduced Intro 1105, a bill requiring DOT to publish a tracker of its progress. She declared, "DOT gives us their word every hearing and we are not getting results." DOT First Deputy Commissioner Margaret Forgione objected, claiming the tracker would add paperwork and reduce community engagement. Brooks-Powers countered, "DOT needs to be more transparent about its project pipeline so we can identify bottlenecks." The committee signaled intent to advance the bill. The city’s failure leaves pedestrians, cyclists, and bus riders exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
