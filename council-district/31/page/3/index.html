They warned, 'The limited funding and decreases in funding that have occurred over the years jeopardize the continuity and future of the program—funding pressure is already leading to downsizing and the disappearance of Open Streets programs.' The groups seek $48 million over three years, separate from the city’s $30 million contract with the Horticultural Society. Current grants max out at $20,000 per year, forcing cutbacks. Speaker Adrienne Adams and Mayor Adams are starting budget talks. Council spokesperson Julia Agos called Open Streets 'critical components of our city's public realm.' The Department of Transportation said suggestions will be reviewed. Volunteer groups handle most operations, but stalled redesigns and lack of resources threaten the program’s survival.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

As the vehicle turned, it struck a 36-year-old woman who was crossing the intersection with the signal. The report states, 'She crossed with the light. The Toyota turned left. Metal met chest. She dropped to the pavement. Crush injuries.' The pedestrian suffered severe chest injuries and fell to the ground. The SUV sustained no damage, and the report notes silence after the impact.

In 2024, DOT delivered only 5.3 miles of bus lanes and 25.7 miles of bike lanes. Brooks-Powers introduced Intro 1105, a bill requiring DOT to publish a tracker of its progress. She declared, "DOT gives us their word every hearing and we are not getting results." DOT First Deputy Commissioner Margaret Forgione objected, claiming the tracker would add paperwork and reduce community engagement. Brooks-Powers countered, "DOT needs to be more transparent about its project pipeline so we can identify bottlenecks." The committee signaled intent to advance the bill.
