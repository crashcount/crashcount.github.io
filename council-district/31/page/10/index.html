The bill, named for Sammy Cohen Eckstein, killed by a reckless driver in 2013, has stalled in Albany despite mounting pressure. Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez introduced a resolution urging passage, co-sponsored by Shahana Hanif and Lincoln Restler. Adams, however, said, 'We’re going to let the state do what the state does in response to Sammy’s Law,' and focused on other budget priorities. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, chair of the Transportation Committee, called for pairing lower speed limits with street redesigns in neglected neighborhoods. As children and cyclists die in record numbers, the council’s inaction leaves vulnerable New Yorkers at risk.

The bill, sponsored by Oswald Feliz, Marjorie Velázquez, and Lincoln Restler, amends laws to ban selling counterfeit tags, with fines starting at $1,000 for first offenses and $2,000 for repeat violations. The measure was brought before the City Council and discussed at a City Hall press conference. The matter summary states the bill 'goes after the unscrupulous used car dealers profiting considerably off a huge black market for phony tags.' Restler, as a sponsor, joins efforts to curb the spread of ghost cars, which evade speed cameras and tolls, making streets more dangerous for everyone. Lawmakers stress that the goal is deterrence, not revenue, and call for further action from online marketplaces and federal agencies.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The program, mandated by a 2021 law, will run for three years in two phases. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'These hubs will help better organize last-mile deliveries and support small and large businesses’ economic recovery.' The hubs will be chosen for proximity to bike lanes, truck routes, and transit, with community input. Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine and Council Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers backed the plan, citing the need to reduce truck traffic and its deadly toll. Brooks-Powers noted, 'Every year roughly 1,400 lives are lost prematurely because of preventable air pollution exacerbated by the explosion of local truck traffic.'

Councilmember Brooks-Powers backs sustainable change.</p><p class=mb3>On April 6, 2023, the city announced a Department of Transportation pilot program to launch up to 20 neighborhood delivery microhubs. This initiative, required by a 2021 City Council law, aims to reduce truck traffic and organize last-mile deliveries. The matter summary states: 'The city will launch a pilot program testing neighborhood delivery microhubs across the five boroughs, aimed at reducing the surge of truck traffic.' Councilmember Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, representing District 31, emphasized the need for sustainable infrastructure to curb environmental justice impacts from truck congestion. The program will allow large trucks to unload at designated hubs, shifting the final delivery leg to vans, cargo bikes, or carts. Details on locations and management are pending. After a year, DOT will review data and consider expansion, with a final report due in 2026. Environmentalists and advocates support the move but note it does not address warehouse siting in vulnerable communities.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

City Hall resists.</p><p class=mb3>On April 4, 2023, the City Council, led by Speaker Adrienne Adams and Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, issued its budget response to the mayor’s $103-billion plan. The Council’s $2.7-billion proposal calls for a near-doubling of Fair Fares funding, $3 million for a battery swap and fire outreach program for delivery workers, and $45.1 million more for road paving. The Council also demands increased investment in street safety infrastructure, especially in communities of color facing high crash rates. Brooks-Powers said, 'New Yorkers deserve access to high-quality services and investments in infrastructure citywide.' Council Member Keith Powers called the battery swap program a 'down payment.' The Council’s push aims to restore cuts and address deadly street conditions. City Hall, citing fiscal pressures, remains cautious but open to negotiation.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Twenty-six council members signed on, but Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers did not.

The crash happened on North Channel Bridge near Cross Bay Boulevard. The driver stayed at the scene; police made no arrests or summonses. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program (DVAP) requires drivers with 15 speeding tickets in a year to take a safety course or risk vehicle seizure, but enforcement is weak. Only a few hundred out of over 20,000 eligible drivers have complied. Queens Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, chair of the transportation committee, called for re-examining street safety and road design at the corridor, echoing residents’ demands for safer infrastructure. Advocates, including Families for Safe Streets, urged passage of Sammy’s Law to let NYC set its own speed limits.

Adams administration rejected bills for traffic calming, daylighting, and crash studies. Council vowed to push forward. DOT blamed staff cuts. Advocates demanded hard fixes. Streets stay deadly. Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>On February 14, 2023, the City Council held an oversight hearing on a package of street safety bills. Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers led the debate. The Adams administration, represented by DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, opposed the bills, arguing, 'Streets are dynamic and conditions are constantly changing. We need to be nimble.' The bills would require DOT to install traffic calming near senior centers, daylight intersections, add school safety signs, study and install bollards, and increase crash reporting. Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized the mayor’s budget cuts, saying they undermine safety goals. Brooks-Powers pledged to advance the bills, stressing the need for hard infrastructure, especially in Black and Brown neighborhoods. DOT admitted it is behind on bus and bike lane targets. No formal safety analyst assessment was provided, but advocates insist better design saves lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The hearing exposed failures: missed targets for protected bike lanes, bus lanes, and safety investments. Council members called for real infrastructure, not just enforcement. Advocates demanded accountability and action for vulnerable New Yorkers.</p><p class=mb3>On January 27, 2023, the City Council’s Transportation Committee held an oversight hearing on street safety and Vision Zero implementation. The hearing, led by Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, questioned whether Mayor Adams is honoring his pledge to end road violence. The matter focused on the administration’s failure to meet Council-mandated benchmarks in the NYC Streets Plan, especially protected bike lanes and bus lanes. Brooks-Powers stated, 'No New Yorker should have to fear for their life while crossing or using our streets.' She stressed that enforcement alone is not enough, demanding equitable infrastructure in neglected neighborhoods. Advocacy leaders like Elizabeth Adams and Sara Lind echoed the call for physical changes and accountability. The hearing marked a rare moment of scrutiny, with advocates welcoming the Council’s push for real safety measures for all road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
