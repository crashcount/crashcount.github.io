The victim was taken to Jamaica Hospital, where he died. No arrests have been announced.</p><p>This year in Council District 31 there have been 4 deaths and about 800 injuries so far, up from 1 death and 572 injuries at this point last year (NYC Open Data).

Fatalities rise overnight, with a clear spike between about 1 a.m. and 3 a.m., indicating the need for better night lighting and enforcement (NYC Open Data).</p><p>Local data point to a few recurring causes: the largest contributing buckets are recorded as “other” and traffic‑related errors, and unsafe speed appears frequently in crash reports.

The letter, sent to state legislative leaders, declared, "We write as a majority of New York City Council Members to express our strong support for the passage of Sammy's Law." Twenty-six council members signed on, but Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers did not. Brooks-Powers argued, "Stricter speed limits must also be paired with investments in physical infrastructure as well that deter drivers from going too fast." Advocates, including DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and Comptroller Brad Lander, rallied in support. Despite the push, the Assembly left the measure out of its budget.

The crash happened on North Channel Bridge near Cross Bay Boulevard. The driver stayed at the scene; police made no arrests or summonses. The Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program (DVAP) requires drivers with 15 speeding tickets in a year to take a safety course or risk vehicle seizure, but enforcement is weak. Only a few hundred out of over 20,000 eligible drivers have complied. Queens Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, chair of the transportation committee, called for re-examining street safety and road design at the corridor, echoing residents’ demands for safer infrastructure. Advocates, including Families for Safe Streets, urged passage of Sammy’s Law to let NYC set its own speed limits. Brooks-Powers did not comment on the DVAP’s failures.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Restler said, 'My top priority is expanding street safety.' The bill now requires a digital training course and valid ID for complainants. Only unoccupied cars can be reported.

The city’s slow action leaves streets deadly.</p><p class=mb3>On February 24, 2023, Council Members Julie Won, Tiffany Cabán, and Selvena Brooks-Powers sent a letter to the Department of Transportation (DOT) after a driver killed Dolma Naadhun. They demanded daylighting, neckdowns, speed bumps, stop signs, and reflective markings at Newtown Road intersections. The lawmakers wrote, “Nothing can bring back Dolma Naadhun, but we can prevent further loss of life so that no family must experience the loss of a loved one.” DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez opposed a Council bill mandating 100 daylighted intersections per year, arguing for flexibility and physical infrastructure in daylit spaces. Advocates and experts agree: daylighting without barriers is flawed. They call for curb extensions to slow drivers and protect people. Residents remain frustrated by the city’s slow, limited response after repeated deaths and injuries.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, a 76-year-old man driving a Honda struck a line of stopped vehicles, setting off a chain reaction that damaged four cars. The driver suffered severe head bleeding and shock. Several passengers, including women aged 24, 32, and 66, reported back injuries and pain. Others sat stunned, still buckled in their seats. The police report lists 'Following Too Closely' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as contributing factors. No pedestrians were involved. The impact left metal twisted and lives shaken, all traced to driver error behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
