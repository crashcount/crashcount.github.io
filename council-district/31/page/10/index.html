Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and Transportation Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers did not comment. Adams claims fiscal discipline is key, despite calling Fair Fares 'transformative.' The program’s strict eligibility leaves out many struggling New Yorkers. As subway fares rise, the city’s refusal to expand Fair Fares keeps transit out of reach for thousands.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brooks-Powers led a resolution supporting commuter vans and spoke on transportation equity, but did not advance key street safety or Vision Zero legislation. The committee failed to hold the Adams administration accountable for missing protected bike and bus lane benchmarks. Advocates and council members voiced frustration at the lack of progress on urgent issues like traffic violence and the Streets Master Plan. The committee’s approach prioritized car-dependent communities and lagged behind previous leadership on safety reforms.

The move aims to connect southeast Queens, cut car trips, and open new routes. The bill signals urgency but lacks binding power. Debate continues over transit versus parkland.</p><p class=mb3>On November 28, 2022, Council Members Joann Ariola and Selvena Brooks-Powers introduced a City Council resolution urging the MTA to conduct an environmental impact study for the QueensLink rail reactivation. The bill, non-binding and currently under committee review, seeks to revive 3.5 miles of the former Rockaway Beach Branch, extending the M train from Rego Park to the Rockaways. The matter title calls for 'a deeper study of the QueensLink proposal to reactivate an old rail line.' Ariola and Brooks-Powers, both representing southeastern Queens, argue the project would benefit communities with poor subway access and reduce car dependency. Ariola stated, 'I think it’s necessary and I think that it would really benefit the communities.' Brooks-Powers emphasized the resolution as a priority for the Transportation Committee. The push comes as Mayor Adams advances the QueensWay park plan, raising concerns among transit advocates. The MTA says a new study is unnecessary, but supporters insist a thorough review is needed before converting the corridor to parkland.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter, described as 'banning the sale of toll-beating covers and requiring DOT to report cars evading red lights and speed cameras with unreadable license plates,' passed through the transportation and infrastructure committee. Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, chair of the committee and sponsor, stated, 'It’s a safety issue, it’s an issue in terms of [city] revenue, it’s an issue in terms of ensuring we have safe streets and holding people accountable.' The city has lost $19 million this year due to unreadable plates. The new laws aim to close loopholes and restore accountability, but the risk to pedestrians and cyclists from untraceable drivers remains high.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The piece argued, 'congestion pricing would be a disaster,' claiming it would harm diverse outer-borough residents and worsen air quality in The Bronx by diverting diesel trucks. The editorial cited MTA studies predicting only a 3.1% reduction in Manhattan traffic and framed the plan as an unfair tax on commerce.

The bill’s summary: it allows residents to ticket drivers who block bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or fire hydrants within 1,320 feet of a school, creating a $175 fine and a civilian complaint protocol. Restler and Brooks-Powers are refining the process to avoid the pitfalls of the city’s anti-idling law, which discourages participation. The NYPD and DOT oppose the bill, citing concerns about neighbor conflict. Advocates support it, highlighting NYPD’s failure to protect vulnerable road users.

The matter, described as a call for a moratorium on car-related development, pits housing needs against car infrastructure. Council Member Julie Won supported the board, stating, "It should be a neighborhood rezoning instead of spot rezoning... we need to make it safer and more liveable." Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas also opposed the dealership, urging the space be used for affordable housing and highlighting dangerous driving by existing dealerships. Despite Borough President Donovan Richards' support for the rezoning, citing cycling and EV promotion, the application faces strong local resistance.

Rivera said, 'All of us are here today because we believe in a future where New Yorkers of all backgrounds... can safely access active transportation.' Brooks-Powers called it 'a real opportunity... to make a profound impact.' Advocates like Jon Orcutt of Bike New York praised the move, urging the city to build 'real infrastructure for cycling.'

Brewer questioned DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez’s assertion that 750 of 1,000 intersections were redesigned, citing public data showing fewer than 400. Brewer said, “I love the idea of using her committee's investigatory power to explore whether the Adams administration has indeed redesigned 750 of the promised 1,000 intersections... or whether it done fewer than that, as the agency's own public data shows.” She confirmed her intent to use committee investigators and hold an oversight hearing. The matter, titled “City Council oversight inquiry into DOT street safety implementation and data transparency,” highlights DOT’s lack of documentation and reliance on signal retiming over physical improvements. Advocates and Brewer demand full transparency and real progress. Road deaths remain high, and the city lags on legal mandates for bus and bike lanes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Richards said, 'We need to do both when it comes to making sure that we can enhance our public transportation and also ensuring that our communities have access to open space.' Transit advocates warn the park blocks future rail service, cutting off faster commutes and cleaner air for southern Queens. The MTA previously cited high costs for transit reactivation.
