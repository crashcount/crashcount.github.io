Over 3,100 injured.</strong> Twenty-nine suffered injuries so severe they may never walk the same again. In the last year alone, eight people died and more than a thousand were hurt. The dead include the young and the old. A 27-year-old woman died on the Belt Parkway. Police said, &ldquo;Since both occupants were out of the car at the time of the crash, investigators haven&rsquo;t figured out who was driving&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/08/woman-dies-queens-belt-parkway-accident/>according to NY Daily News</a>.

She voted to end jaywalking tickets, making it legal to cross where you need to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>see the vote</a>.

She pushed for daylighting at intersections, better lighting, and more speed humps. She pressed the city to publish its progress on street redesigns and called out the Department of Transportation for failing to deliver. &ldquo;DOT gives us their word every hearing and we are not getting results&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/22/council-transportation-chair-tells-dot-that-shes-sick-of-the-streets-plan-excuses>she said to Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p><p>But the streets are still deadly. Cameras and laws help, but they are not enough. The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not. The council can demand more protected bike lanes and crossings. Progress is slow. The bodies pile up.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Every death is preventable.</strong> Every injury is a failure. Call Council Member Brooks-Powers. Demand she fight for a 20 mph speed limit, more daylighted intersections, and protected space for people on foot and bike.

Advocates call it a step, not a leap. The mayor and speaker skipped safety talk. Streets still wait for real protection.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13, 2022, the City Council and Mayor Adams reached a budget agreement, allocating $53 million in operating funds for the Department of Transportation for the fiscal year starting July 1. This is a down payment on the mayor's promised $904 million for the Streets Master Plan, but falls short of the Council's $3.1 billion ask to double the plan's targets. The plan mandates 250 miles of protected bike lanes, 150 miles of dedicated bus lanes, and new public plazas. The official matter summary notes, 'the agreement provided far less for street safety projects than the Council originally sought.' Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and Mayor Adams announced the deal, but neither mentioned street safety in their press conference. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, chair of the Transportation Committee, did not comment. Advocates praised the funding as a significant step, but stressed the need for strong implementation to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary: 'The City Council approved Albany's extension and expansion of New York's speed camera program, allowing cameras to operate 24/7, but not before several council members voiced opposition.' Chairwoman Selvena Brooks-Powers urged action, saying, 'We must use all the tools at our disposal.' Council Members Joan Ariola, Vickie Paladino, and David Carr opposed, calling cameras a financial burden. Eric Dinowitz defended the program: 'If you don't want a speeding ticket, don't speed.'

Council Member Charles Barron supports cameras near schools but is noncommittal on home rule, noting, 'We have some of the highest fatalities and accidents, yet we don't see the highest amount of resources.' Speaker Adrienne Adams has voiced skepticism, calling cameras a way to 'nickel and dime' New Yorkers. Assembly Member Khaleel Anderson warns 24/7 cameras could hit Black and brown communities hardest. Assembly Member Dick Gottfried supports cameras and home rule, but many lawmakers hesitate. Advocates urge using revenue for street redesigns in underinvested areas.

NYPD Transportation Bureau Chief Kim Royster testified, stating, "So far this year, bike lane enforcement is up 148 percent." Streetsblog fact-checked this claim and found enforcement was actually down 6.4 percent from the previous year. Royster later clarified she referred only to tickets for driving in bike lanes, a small slice of total enforcement. Combined, bike lane enforcement was still down over 4 percent. Brooks-Powers questioned enforcement against illegally parked tractor-trailers. Royster cited fine amounts but gave no enforcement numbers. Data showed code 78 and code 6 violations both dropped sharply. Royster's answers were vague, lacking specifics on enforcement or safety. The hearing exposed a gap between NYPD claims and reality, leaving vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
