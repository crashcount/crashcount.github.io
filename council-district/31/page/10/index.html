Over a thousand injured.</strong> In the last year, District 31 has seen 1,015 people hurt and 8 killed in traffic crashes. The dead include the old and the young. A woman in her seventies, found unconscious in the back seat of a minivan, did not make it out alive. Three others, all seniors, were rushed to the hospital. The minivan veered off Brookville Boulevard and struck a tree. Police said, &ldquo;A woman was killed and three other people were hospitalized when a trip from a Queens senior residential home turned deadly early Friday&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/14/woman-killed-3-hurt-in-senior-residence-minivan-crash/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>On the Belt Parkway, a 27-year-old woman died in a single-car crash. Police found both occupants outside the wreck. &ldquo;Since both occupants were out of the car at the time of the crash, investigators haven&rsquo;t figured out who was driving, police said&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/08/woman-dies-queens-belt-parkway-accident/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p><strong>SUVs, sedans, trucks.</strong> The machines keep moving. The bodies pile up. In the last twelve months, three people over 75 died. One person under 25. No one is spared.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers has backed bills to clear parked cars from crosswalks, add speed humps, and expand lighting for pedestrians. She voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable for crossing the street (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>). She called out city agencies for failing to deliver on promised bike lanes and bus lanes, saying, &ldquo;DOT gives us their word every hearing and we are not getting results&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/22/council-transportation-chair-tells-dot-that-shes-sick-of-the-streets-plan-excuses>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>But the carnage continues. Bills sit in committee. Promises gather dust. The streets do not wait.</p><h3 id=the-next-fight-action-not-excuses>The Next Fight: Action, Not Excuses</h3><p><strong>Speed kills.</strong> Lowering the speed limit to 20 mph citywide is now possible. Cameras that catch speeders and red-light runners are proven to save lives, but their future is not guaranteed. Every day of delay means another family shattered.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer streets.</strong> Join groups like <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> and <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>.

Advocates call it a step, not a leap. The mayor and speaker skipped safety talk. Streets still wait for real protection.</p><p class=mb3>On June 13, 2022, the City Council and Mayor Adams reached a budget agreement, allocating $53 million in operating funds for the Department of Transportation for the fiscal year starting July 1. This is a down payment on the mayor's promised $904 million for the Streets Master Plan, but falls short of the Council's $3.1 billion ask to double the plan's targets. The plan mandates 250 miles of protected bike lanes, 150 miles of dedicated bus lanes, and new public plazas. The official matter summary notes, 'the agreement provided far less for street safety projects than the Council originally sought.' Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and Mayor Adams announced the deal, but neither mentioned street safety in their press conference. Council Member Selvena Brooks-Powers, chair of the Transportation Committee, did not comment. Advocates praised the funding as a significant step, but stressed the need for strong implementation to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The matter summary: 'The City Council approved Albany's extension and expansion of New York's speed camera program, allowing cameras to operate 24/7, but not before several council members voiced opposition.' Chairwoman Selvena Brooks-Powers urged action, saying, 'We must use all the tools at our disposal.' Council Members Joan Ariola, Vickie Paladino, and David Carr opposed, calling cameras a financial burden. Eric Dinowitz defended the program: 'If you don't want a speeding ticket, don't speed.'

Council Member Charles Barron supports cameras near schools but is noncommittal on home rule, noting, 'We have some of the highest fatalities and accidents, yet we don't see the highest amount of resources.' Speaker Adrienne Adams has voiced skepticism, calling cameras a way to 'nickel and dime' New Yorkers. Assembly Member Khaleel Anderson warns 24/7 cameras could hit Black and brown communities hardest. Assembly Member Dick Gottfried supports cameras and home rule, but many lawmakers hesitate.

NYPD Transportation Bureau Chief Kim Royster testified, stating, "So far this year, bike lane enforcement is up 148 percent." Streetsblog fact-checked this claim and found enforcement was actually down 6.4 percent from the previous year. Royster later clarified she referred only to tickets for driving in bike lanes, a small slice of total enforcement. Combined, bike lane enforcement was still down over 4 percent. Brooks-Powers questioned enforcement against illegally parked tractor-trailers. Royster cited fine amounts but gave no enforcement numbers. Data showed code 78 and code 6 violations both dropped sharply. Royster's answers were vague, lacking specifics on enforcement or safety.

Bottcher criticized the Department of Education for failing to follow the law, noting only a handful of schools offer bike lessons. Bottcher said, 'We want to see that program enlarged significantly.' Advocates support the push but warn that education alone is not enough. Julie Huntington stressed, 'This announcement must come with an investment in building protected bike lanes and safe routes to school to keep our new riders safe.' Bottcher put the responsibility on drivers: 'Drivers are in the vehicle that weighs thousands of pounds... if they hit someone with their car, it’s very likely they could take their life.'
