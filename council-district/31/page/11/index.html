The resolution states: 'Providing instruction in bicycle and traffic safety in schools, starting at an early age and continuing throughout students' years in school, would be an effective measure to both promote cycling and prevent bicycle accidents and other safety incidents.' Bottcher criticized the Department of Education for failing to follow the law, noting only a handful of schools offer bike lessons. Bottcher said, 'We want to see that program enlarged significantly.' Advocates support the push but warn that education alone is not enough. Julie Huntington stressed, 'This announcement must come with an investment in building protected bike lanes and safe routes to school to keep our new riders safe.' Bottcher put the responsibility on drivers: 'Drivers are in the vehicle that weighs thousands of pounds... if they hit someone with their car, it’s very likely they could take their life.' The council’s action highlights a gap between policy and real safety for children on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan, passed in 2019, requires hundreds of miles of protected bike lanes, bus lanes, and safer sidewalks. Council Member Alexa Avilés led the call: "We want $3.1 billion, a little tiny fraction of the [nearly $100-billion] city budget, to make sure our streets belong to us, and to make sure New Yorkers are safe." Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers, Carlina Rivera, Lincoln Restler, Sandy Nurse, Chi Ossé, Crystal Hudson, Shekar Krishnan, and Amanda Farías joined her. Traffic fatalities rose 44 percent in the first quarter of 2022, the deadliest start since Vision Zero began.

Two hundred seventy-three people died on New York streets. Hit-and-runs soared. SUVs killed more. Brooklyn bled most. Leaders promise fixes. Streets remain deadly. Urgency fills the air. Vulnerable lives hang in the balance.</p><p class=mb3>A final analysis released January 26, 2022, revealed 2021 as the deadliest year in the eight-year history of New York City's Vision Zero initiative, with 273 road deaths—a 32 percent jump from 2018. The Transportation Committee, chaired by Selvena Brooks-Powers, faces mounting pressure. The matter summary states: 'A final analysis of 2021 crash statistics revealed that it was the deadliest year in the eight-year history of New York City's Vision Zero initiative.' Transportation Alternatives demanded urgent action: reclaiming street space from cars, redesigning intersections, upgrading bike lanes, and more. Mayor Adams and DOT Commissioner Rodriguez pledged intersection redesigns and stronger bike lanes, but no changes have rolled out. Brooks-Powers called every death 'an avoidable tragedy' and vowed to push for safer streets. The city stands at a crossroads. Vulnerable road users pay the price for delay.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Advocates watch closely.</p><p class=mb3>On January 20, 2022, Selvena Brooks-Powers became chair of the City Council’s Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. She represents District 31 in southeast Queens, an area with limited transit and high car use. The committee oversees key street safety and mobility issues. Brooks-Powers said, 'Historically in New York City in particular, the transportation system has had many barriers for communities that live in transportation deserts from reaching economic opportunity.' She supports expanding protected bike lanes, bus lanes, open streets, and ferry access, but has mixed views on dedicated bus lanes due to local bottlenecks. Brooks-Powers plans to consult with colleagues, advocates, and experts in her first 100 days to address traffic violence and congestion. Advocates are optimistic, citing her record fighting for communities and workers. No formal safety analyst assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
