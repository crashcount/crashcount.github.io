A car slammed into them as they waited for breakfast. The street was left scattered with debris and grief. The driver died too.

The driver fled. No arrests. Another name lost. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-killed-in-hit-and-run-near-jfk-airport-police-say>Gothamist counted 17 traffic deaths in Queens South this year—up from last year.</a> The numbers keep rising.</p><p>In the past 12 months, District 31 saw 8 deaths, 1,255 injuries, and 12 serious injuries from crashes.

The matter, described as a call for a moratorium on car-related development, pits housing needs against car infrastructure. Council Member Julie Won supported the board, stating, "It should be a neighborhood rezoning instead of spot rezoning... we need to make it safer and more liveable." Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas also opposed the dealership, urging the space be used for affordable housing and highlighting dangerous driving by existing dealerships. Despite Borough President Donovan Richards' support for the rezoning, citing cycling and EV promotion, the application faces strong local resistance. The City Planning Commission now reviews the case, with a City Council vote possible. The board and electeds argue more cars mean more risk for pedestrians and cyclists on a deadly stretch.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The legislation, championed by Council Member Carlina Rivera and supported by Transportation Committee Chair Selvena N. Brooks-Powers (District 31), mandates the city to study, map, and expand greenways—'highways for cyclists and pedestrians, separated from motor vehicle traffic.' The bill focuses on low-income and underserved neighborhoods, with a final plan due by December 2024 and updates every five years. Rivera said, 'All of us are here today because we believe in a future where New Yorkers of all backgrounds... can safely access active transportation.' Brooks-Powers called it 'a real opportunity... to make a profound impact.' Advocates like Jon Orcutt of Bike New York praised the move, urging the city to build 'real infrastructure for cycling.' The bill passed nearly unanimously, signaling strong council support for safer, more equitable streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brewer vows investigation.</p><p class=mb3>On October 5, 2022, Council Member Gale Brewer, chair of the Council's oversight committee, announced plans to investigate the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) street safety claims. Brewer questioned DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez’s assertion that 750 of 1,000 intersections were redesigned, citing public data showing fewer than 400. Brewer said, “I love the idea of using her committee's investigatory power to explore whether the Adams administration has indeed redesigned 750 of the promised 1,000 intersections... or whether it done fewer than that, as the agency's own public data shows.” She confirmed her intent to use committee investigators and hold an oversight hearing. The matter, titled “City Council oversight inquiry into DOT street safety implementation and data transparency,” highlights DOT’s lack of documentation and reliance on signal retiming over physical improvements. Advocates and Brewer demand full transparency and real progress. Road deaths remain high, and the city lags on legal mandates for bus and bike lanes.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The first phase includes $5 million for environmental review and $30 million for the Metropolitan Hub. The matter summary states: 'converting a defunct LIRR branch into a Highline-style park in Queens.' Council Member Lynn Schulman supports the park, calling it 'shovel-ready.' Borough President Donovan Richards and Assembly Members Jenifer Rajkumar and David Weprin back both the park and the QueensLink transit proposal. Richards said, 'We need to do both when it comes to making sure that we can enhance our public transportation and also ensuring that our communities have access to open space.' Transit advocates warn the park blocks future rail service, cutting off faster commutes and cleaner air for southern Queens. The MTA previously cited high costs for transit reactivation. The debate continues over whether the right-of-way should serve parks, transit, or both.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, promised by the previous mayor for completion by the end of 2022, was pushed back at least a year. Won, whose district covers the bridge’s eastern approaches, led a walkthrough with DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and staff from Council Members Julie Menin and Selvena Brooks-Powers. Won said, “They kept saying they can’t give the south outer roadway to pedestrians because there would be traffic. Well, I don’t care about the congestion!” She forced the commissioner to stand in the cramped lane, showing how unsafe it is for both cyclists and pedestrians. DOT offered only minor adjustments, like repainting lines, which Won dismissed as “missing the point.” The agency promised lawmakers data to justify keeping five car lanes, but Won insisted the delay puts lives at risk and called for immediate action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The project, not a council bill but a city action, follows years of neglect and repeated crashes. DOT will cut traffic lanes from six to two, add a parking-protected bike lane, and expand pedestrian space. The plan also includes daylighting at intersections and improved markings. According to DOT, 'the project will improve safety for all users, providing connections to existing bike infrastructure and the reduction of a vehicle lane encouraging safer speeds.' Queens Borough President Donovan Richards praised the move, saying, 'Far too many people are killed and injured on our city’s streets, especially people of color, who are disproportionately impacted by traffic violence.' Laura Shepard of Transportation Alternatives added, 'DOT's move to turn car space into protected bike lanes on Seagirt Boulevard, while shortening crossings and expanding median space, will prevent speeding and make it safer to walk, bike, and take transit.'

They say bus lanes hurt drivers and businesses. Riders say commutes barely improved. DOT stands firm. The fight pits car convenience against safer, faster transit for thousands.</p><p class=mb3>On July 18, 2022, Council Members Nantasha Williams and Selvena Brooks-Powers opposed the city’s pilot busways on Archer and Jamaica avenues. The Department of Transportation (DOT) launched the one-year, 24/7 busway pilot to speed up commutes for over 250,000 daily bus riders. Williams called her district a 'car community' and argued, 'there's only one metric of success for the bus lane and not looking comprehensively at how it's actually impacting the community.' Brooks-Powers claimed, 'People cannot access our local businesses.' Both members urged the city to end or shorten the pilot, citing business and driver complaints. DOT and transit advocates countered that bus speeds improved. The DOT plans to continue the pilot and survey businesses and riders at its end. No safety analyst assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
