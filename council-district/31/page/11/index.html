Over a thousand injured.</strong> In the last year, District 31 has seen 1,015 people hurt and 8 killed in traffic crashes. The dead include the old and the young. A woman in her seventies, found unconscious in the back seat of a minivan, did not make it out alive. Three others, all seniors, were rushed to the hospital. The minivan veered off Brookville Boulevard and struck a tree. Police said, &ldquo;A woman was killed and three other people were hospitalized when a trip from a Queens senior residential home turned deadly early Friday&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/14/woman-killed-3-hurt-in-senior-residence-minivan-crash/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p>On the Belt Parkway, a 27-year-old woman died in a single-car crash. Police found both occupants outside the wreck. &ldquo;Since both occupants were out of the car at the time of the crash, investigators haven&rsquo;t figured out who was driving, police said&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/08/woman-dies-queens-belt-parkway-accident/>NY Daily News</a>).</p><p><strong>SUVs, sedans, trucks.</strong> The machines keep moving. The bodies pile up. In the last twelve months, three people over 75 died. One person under 25. No one is spared.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers has backed bills to clear parked cars from crosswalks, add speed humps, and expand lighting for pedestrians. She voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that punished the vulnerable for crossing the street (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>). She called out city agencies for failing to deliver on promised bike lanes and bus lanes, saying, &ldquo;DOT gives us their word every hearing and we are not getting results&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/01/22/council-transportation-chair-tells-dot-that-shes-sick-of-the-streets-plan-excuses>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>But the carnage continues. Bills sit in committee. Promises gather dust. The streets do not wait.</p><h3 id=the-next-fight-action-not-excuses>The Next Fight: Action, Not Excuses</h3><p><strong>Speed kills.</strong> Lowering the speed limit to 20 mph citywide is now possible. Cameras that catch speeders and red-light runners are proven to save lives, but their future is not guaranteed. Every day of delay means another family shattered.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Call the mayor. Demand safer streets.</strong> Join groups like <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> and <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>.

The plan, passed in 2019, requires hundreds of miles of protected bike lanes, bus lanes, and safer sidewalks. Council Member Alexa Avilés led the call: "We want $3.1 billion, a little tiny fraction of the [nearly $100-billion] city budget, to make sure our streets belong to us, and to make sure New Yorkers are safe." Council Members Selvena Brooks-Powers, Carlina Rivera, Lincoln Restler, Sandy Nurse, Chi Ossé, Crystal Hudson, Shekar Krishnan, and Amanda Farías joined her. Traffic fatalities rose 44 percent in the first quarter of 2022, the deadliest start since Vision Zero began.

Transportation Alternatives demanded urgent action: reclaiming street space from cars, redesigning intersections, upgrading bike lanes, and more. Mayor Adams and DOT Commissioner Rodriguez pledged intersection redesigns and stronger bike lanes, but no changes have rolled out. Brooks-Powers called every death 'an avoidable tragedy' and vowed to push for safer streets. The city stands at a crossroads. Vulnerable road users pay the price for delay.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

She pledges to tackle traffic violence and congestion. Her district lacks bike lanes and Citi Bike docks. She supports more ferries, bus lanes, and open streets. Advocates watch closely.</p><p class=mb3>On January 20, 2022, Selvena Brooks-Powers became chair of the City Council’s Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. She represents District 31 in southeast Queens, an area with limited transit and high car use. The committee oversees key street safety and mobility issues. Brooks-Powers said, 'Historically in New York City in particular, the transportation system has had many barriers for communities that live in transportation deserts from reaching economic opportunity.' She supports expanding protected bike lanes, bus lanes, open streets, and ferry access, but has mixed views on dedicated bus lanes due to local bottlenecks. Brooks-Powers plans to consult with colleagues, advocates, and experts in her first 100 days to address traffic violence and congestion. Advocates are optimistic, citing her record fighting for communities and workers. No formal safety analyst assessment was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
