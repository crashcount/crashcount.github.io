The resolution states: 'establishing scramble crosswalks leading to and from school buildings during times of student arrival and dismissal.' The council cites a surge in crashes near schools and the loss of 486 crossing guards. The bill highlights that intersections are the site of most pedestrian deaths and injuries. The sponsors call for action to protect children where cars and kids meet.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Chi Ossé (District 36) was mentioned, but only six of 51 council members responded to DOT’s call for safety project suggestions. The matter centers on the DOT’s report and council inaction: 'Out of 51 City Council members, only six responded to a request from DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez for recommended locations where street safety improvements should be made in their districts.' Mayor Adams slashed DOT’s budget and weakened projects, while council leaders deflected responsibility. Advocates like Jon Orcutt and Elizabeth Adams demanded decisive action, warning that delays and excuses cost lives.

Cyclists like Joseph Rienti say the barriers are better than nothing, but drivers now park at both ends, forcing riders into car traffic. Rienti urges better design or enforcement, not removal. Police enforcement is almost nonexistent: less than 2 percent of 76,000 complaints led to tickets. City Council, including Transportation Committee Chair Selvena Brooks-Powers, has not advanced a bill allowing citizen reporting of blocked lanes, despite majority support. DOT spokeswoman Mona Bruno promises to work with police, but for now, the barriers fail to protect vulnerable cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

This was the second year of missed targets since the law’s 2019 passage. The plan, created by then-Council Speaker Corey Johnson, aimed to make streets safer and more equitable. Key projects—like McGuinness Boulevard bike lanes and Fordham Road bus lanes—were delayed or canceled. The Department of Transportation blamed staff shortages and budget cuts. Transportation Committee Chairwoman Selvena Brooks-Powers said, 'Thirty-plus miles of completed new bike lane is of course better than none, but falls far short of Streets Plan requirements.' She also criticized the DOT’s lack of transparency. Speaker Adrienne Adams joined calls for compliance but admitted the Council’s enforcement tools are limited. Without mayoral commitment, the plan’s promise for safer streets remains unfulfilled.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
