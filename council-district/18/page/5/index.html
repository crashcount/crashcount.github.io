Thirty seriously hurt.</strong> In the last year alone, two children died. A 17-year-old boy was thrown from his dirt bike at Metcalf Avenue and East 172nd Street. He never made it home. His passenger, a 14-year-old girl, survived. His mother waited for a call that never came. &ldquo;He was here yesterday morning, sitting on the bed and watching TV. I spoke to him last around 4 p.m.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/25/dirt-bike-minivan-bronx-crash-juan-alexander-quizhpi-naranjo/>said his mother</a>. The street was silent after.</p><p>A 75-year-old man was killed crossing with the signal at White Plains Road. The SUV kept going. The driver stayed at the scene. No charges. The city moved on.</p><p><strong>In the last twelve months:</strong> 9 deaths, 11 serious injuries, 542 hurt. The young, the old, the ones just trying to cross the street. The violence is steady. The pain is quiet, but it does not stop.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-and-silence>Leadership: Votes and Silence</h3><p>Council Member Amanda Farías has voted for daylighting, truck route redesign, and traffic calming near seniors. She backed the bill to legalize jaywalking, a step toward ending blame for those on foot. She co-sponsored bills for more school signs and speed humps. She voted yes on a law to warn taxi passengers to look for cyclists before opening doors. These are steps. But the blood on the street says it is not enough.</p><p>No public quotes. No bold push for a 20 mph citywide speed limit. No demand for more protected bike lanes or intersection redesigns. The council member has not led the charge. The city has the power to lower speeds. It has not used it.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> Call Amanda Farías. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for children, elders, and everyone on foot or bike. The city will not act unless you force it. The dead cannot speak. You must.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Riders wait.</p><p class=mb3>On January 27, 2023, nineteen New York City Council members, led by Tiffany Cabán, sent a letter urging Mayor Adams to support the Fix the MTA package in Albany. The package, introduced by Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani and Senator Mike Gianaris, includes eight bills: funding for six-minute off-peak subway and bus service, four years of free bus rides, and closing the MTA's fiscal gap. Council Member Amanda Farías introduced a resolution backing six-minute service. The letter states, 'Just as fund libraries and schools, we must fund transit—a public good that creates access to opportunities in life.' Cabán called the push a 'critical public safety initiative,' linking frequent, reliable transit to safer streets. The council's action signals a unified demand for robust, equitable transit funding.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Amanda Farias said, “I support it in principle. But it’s necessary for the city not to put another burden on the Bronx.” The policy statement, covered by Streetsblog NYC, urges city, state, and federal agencies to act fast. Officials want incentives for truck electrification, toll structures to cut truck diversion, and accelerated projects to cap or reimagine the Cross Bronx. Renae Reynolds added, “There are overall benefits... But we can’t ignore the challenges, and there should be assurance that there are solutions that mitigate those burdens.” The message: congestion pricing only works if it does not worsen the Bronx’s deadly air and traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
