Police say a 21‑year‑old in a Mercedes tried to pass, hit a Volkswagen, then hit two motorcycles. Both riders—Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19, and Enrique Martinez, 21—were thrown and died at hospitals. The driver was charged with vehicular manslaughter and DWI. He refused a chemical test. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Gothamist reported it</a>. At arraignment, a sister said, “Two people were killed. He was drunk.” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>The Daily News carried her words</a>.</p><p>Since 2022, Council District 18 has logged <strong>19 deaths</strong> and 2,162 injuries in 3,875 crashes. Pedestrians bear nine of those deaths. SUVs and cars are tied to most harm. Trucks and buses add more bodies. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The city’s crash data shows it</a>.</p><p>Night is cruel here. From midnight to 2 a.m., injuries stack up. Deaths spike again at 1 a.m., 2 p.m., 8 p.m., 9 p.m., 10 p.m., and 11 p.m. The late hours cut deepest. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data tallies the hours</a>.</p><h3 id=corners-that-dont-forgive>Corners that don’t forgive</h3><ul><li><a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Westchester Avenue</a> leads the injury count: 74 hurt, four serious.</li><li><a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>White Plains Road</a> shows two deaths and more than a hundred injuries.</li><li>The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Bruckner Expressway</a> claims two dead and 153 hurt.</li></ul><p>Drivers keep turning into people. In one case at White Plains Road and Wood Avenue, a 75‑year‑old man crossed with the signal. A BMW SUV turned left and killed him.
