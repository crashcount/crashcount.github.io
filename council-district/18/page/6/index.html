Police arrested a 21-year-old and charged him with vehicular manslaughter and DWI, according to Gothamist (2025-08-12). Police and reporters say the crash began when the driver attempted to pass another car and hit two motorcycles, throwing the riders onto the roadway. The victims were identified as Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19, and Enrique Martinez, 21. &ldquo;A drunken BMW driver fatally struck two motorcyclists… early Monday, police said,&rdquo; the New York Daily News reported (2025-08-11). Grief followed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s just walking freely? Two people were killed,&rdquo; said Clari Amarante Penalo (NY Daily News, 2025-08-12). A mother asked, &ldquo;How could they let him go?&rdquo;</p><p><strong>This is not a fluke.</strong> In the last year in District 18, eight people were killed and 15 were seriously hurt, with hundreds more injured. Deaths cluster at night. From midnight to 2 a.m., six people died. The clock and the crash reports tell the same story: speed, darkness, repeat harm.</p><h3 id=where-the-danger-lives>Where the Danger Lives</h3><p>White Plains Road and the Bruckner Expressway are among the worst hotspots. Westchester Avenue is a steady bleed. City crash data often lists the most deadly factor as &ldquo;other.&rdquo; Alcohol appears in the files too. The pattern is plain: fast corridors, dark hours, repeat pain.</p><p>Fixes are concrete. Daylight corners on White Plains Road and Westchester Avenue. Give pedestrians a head start with leading pedestrian intervals (LPIs). Harden centerlines and slow turning radii. Add targeted night lighting and enforcement where deaths peak.</p><h3 id=what-your-council-member-has-done>What Your Council Member Has Done</h3><p>Council Member Amanda Farías has voted for practical moves. On 2025-02-13 she voted yes on faster pavement markings (Int 1160‑2025). On 2025-06-30 she voted yes to clear derelict vehicles that block sightlines and crosswalks (Int 0857‑2024). She supported decriminalizing jaywalking in 2024 and has backed transparency on street-safety projects. Those votes matter. But paint and towed hulks will not stop a speeding car at 1 a.m.</p><h3 id=citywide-fixes-local-power>Citywide Fixes, Local Power</h3><p>District 18 needs local action and the city needs systemwide rules. Lower New York City&rsquo;s default speed on neighborhood streets to 20 mph. Require intelligent speed‑assistance devices for habitual speeders so repeat offenders cannot keep killing. Fund daylighting and LPIs at the district&rsquo;s worst corners. Make sure DOT meets the faster‑striping law (Int 1160‑2025) and that the Department of Sanitation and NYPD enforce removal of derelict cars (Int 0857‑2024).</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p>Slow the whole system. Stop repeat offenders with technology. Fund concrete street changes where the data points: White Plains Road, the Bruckner corridor, Westchester Avenue. Hold DOT to its duties. Push the Council and the Mayor to use every tool they have. Call Farías. Call until the nights get quiet.</p><p>FAQ:</p><p>[
{
&ldquo;q&rdquo;: &ldquo;Are these crashes preventable or just &lsquo;accidents&rsquo;?&rdquo;,
&ldquo;a&rdquo;: &ldquo;They follow patterns: deaths spike after midnight and cluster on corridors like White Plains Road and the Bruckner Expressway. Street redesign, lower speeds, better lighting and targeted enforcement change outcomes. Speed and darkness, not randomness, put six deaths between midnight and 2 a.m.&rdquo;
},
{
&ldquo;q&rdquo;: &ldquo;What can local politicians do right now?&rdquo;,
&ldquo;a&rdquo;: &ldquo;Lower the default speed on local streets. Back speed limiters for repeat offenders. Fund daylighting, LPIs, and turn-calming on White Plains Road and Westchester Avenue. Enforce the fast-striping law (Int 1160‑2025) and keep derelict cars off sightlines (Int 0857‑2024).&rdquo;
},
{
&ldquo;q&rdquo;: &ldquo;How has Council Member Amanda Farías acted on street safety lately?&rdquo;,
&ldquo;a&rdquo;: &ldquo;She voted yes on faster pavement markings on 2025-02-13 (Int 1160‑2025) and yes on clearing abandoned vehicles on 2025-06-30 (Int 0857‑2024). She supported decriminalizing jaywalking in 2024 and voted for transparency measures on street projects in 2025.&rdquo;
},
{
&ldquo;q&rdquo;: &ldquo;What types of vehicles caused injuries and deaths to pedestrians in District 18?&rdquo;,
&ldquo;a&rdquo;: &ldquo;Cars and SUVs caused eight pedestrian deaths and account for 359 crashes/injuries. Trucks and buses caused one pedestrian death and account for 32 crashes/injuries. Motorcycles and mopeds account for seven crashes/injuries; bikes account for ten.&rdquo;
},
{
&ldquo;q&rdquo;: &ldquo;Which areas are in District 18?&rdquo;,
&ldquo;a&rdquo;: &ldquo;It includes the Soundview‑Bruckner‑Bronx River, Soundview‑Clason Point, Castle Hill‑Unionport, Parkchester, Soundview Park, Westchester Square neighborhoods and Bronx Community Board 9. It overlaps parts of Assembly Districts 85 and 87 and State Senate Districts 29 and 34.&rdquo;
},
{
&ldquo;q&rdquo;: &ldquo;Where does District 18 sit politically?&rdquo;,
&ldquo;a&rdquo;: &ldquo;It belongs to the Bronx, Assembly District 85 and State Senate District 29. Council Member Amanda Farías represents the district.&rdquo;
},
{
&ldquo;q&rdquo;: &ldquo;What is the New York City Council and how does it work?&rdquo;,
&ldquo;a&rdquo;: &ldquo;The City Council writes and votes on local laws and conducts oversight through committees. Members introduce bills, move them through committee and the full Council, and the Mayor signs or vetoes them. Recent votes like Int 1160‑2025 and Int 0857‑2024 show that process in action.&rdquo;
},
{
&ldquo;q&rdquo;: &ldquo;What is CrashCount?&rdquo;,
&ldquo;a&rdquo;: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re a tool holding local politicians and agencies accountable for street safety. We update constantly to give you the latest crash data and local policy moves so you can act in your neighborhood.&rdquo;

According to the police report, 'Illness struck first.' The crash left a 24-year-old male driver with severe bleeding to his lower leg and a 37-year-old male driver with neck injuries. Both were conscious after the crash. The police report lists 'Illness' as the contributing factor. No pedestrians or cyclists were involved. The parked Audi was unoccupied.
