Since 2022, <strong>17 people have died</strong> and <strong>1,880 have been injured</strong> in crashes. <strong>Thirty-two</strong> suffered wounds so grave they may never walk the same. The dead include children, elders, and workers. The living carry scars.</p><p>Just days ago, a Ford Mustang tore through a Bronx intersection, striking six people. The driver and passenger ran. The sidewalk was left with blood and broken glass. &ldquo;People were yelling, were in pain, so yelling, crying, it was very upsetting,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>said Vivian Cole</a>. The youngest victim was 30. The oldest, 79. All were sent to the hospital. None were in a car.</p><p>This is not rare. In the last year alone, <strong>nine people died</strong> on these streets. <strong>526 were hurt.</strong> Two of the dead were under 18. The numbers do not slow. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the killing.</strong> Of the pedestrian injuries and deaths, 311 came from cars and SUVs, 25 from trucks and buses, 7 from motorcycles and mopeds, and 9 from bikes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The stories repeat. A 75-year-old man, crossing with the light, struck by a left-turning BMW. A 19-year-old, killed on the Bruckner Expressway. A woman, dead in the crosswalk. The drivers keep going. The city keeps counting.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Amanda Farías has voted for bills to daylight intersections, redesign truck routes, and lower speed limits on Open Streets. She co-sponsored laws for more school safety signs and speed humps near parks. She voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that blamed victims instead of drivers. She voted yes to require quick pavement markings and more transparency in street safety work. These are steps. But the blood keeps flowing.</p><p>The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so. The most dangerous drivers—those with dozens of camera tickets—still roam free. &ldquo;We thought it was a bomb or something, because we are all panicking around here,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>said Christina Sieh</a>. The panic is routine. The fear is daily.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-no-more-waiting>Call to Action: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Call Council Member Amanda Farías. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat offenders.</strong> The city has the tools. The bodies in the street are proof that talk is not enough. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Police attribute the crash to 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way.'
