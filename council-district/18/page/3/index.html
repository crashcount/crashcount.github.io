Since 2022, <strong>17 people have died</strong> and <strong>1,880 have been injured</strong> in crashes. <strong>Thirty-two</strong> suffered wounds so grave they may never walk the same. The dead include children, elders, and workers. The living carry scars.</p><p>Just days ago, a Ford Mustang tore through a Bronx intersection, striking six people. The driver and passenger ran. The sidewalk was left with blood and broken glass. &ldquo;People were yelling, were in pain, so yelling, crying, it was very upsetting,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>said Vivian Cole</a>. The youngest victim was 30. The oldest, 79. All were sent to the hospital. None were in a car.</p><p>This is not rare. In the last year alone, <strong>nine people died</strong> on these streets. <strong>526 were hurt.</strong> Two of the dead were under 18. The numbers do not slow. The pain does not fade.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>Cars and SUVs do most of the killing.</strong> Of the pedestrian injuries and deaths, 311 came from cars and SUVs, 25 from trucks and buses, 7 from motorcycles and mopeds, and 9 from bikes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The stories repeat. A 75-year-old man, crossing with the light, struck by a left-turning BMW. A 19-year-old, killed on the Bruckner Expressway. A woman, dead in the crosswalk. The drivers keep going. The city keeps counting.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Amanda Farías has voted for bills to daylight intersections, redesign truck routes, and lower speed limits on Open Streets. She co-sponsored laws for more school safety signs and speed humps near parks. She voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that blamed victims instead of drivers. She voted yes to require quick pavement markings and more transparency in street safety work. These are steps. But the blood keeps flowing.</p><p>The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so. The most dangerous drivers—those with dozens of camera tickets—still roam free. &ldquo;We thought it was a bomb or something, because we are all panicking around here,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/car-crashes-scaffolding-melrose-bronx-6-people-hurt/16935943/>said Christina Sieh</a>. The panic is routine. The fear is daily.</p><h3 id=call-to-action-no-more-waiting>Call to Action: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Call Council Member Amanda Farías. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat offenders.</strong> The city has the tools. The bodies in the street are proof that talk is not enough. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Pedestrians now cross anywhere, any time. No summons. Law strips drivers of excuses. Streets shift.

The bill, heard by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, passed on September 26, 2024, and became law on October 26, 2024. Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers. It shifts blame from people on foot to the system and those behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The point of impact was the taxi's left front bumper and the moped's center front end. The 21-year-old moped rider, unlicensed and not wearing a helmet, was ejected and sustained a severe head injury with significant bleeding. The report identifies 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Unsafe Speed' as contributing factors to the crash. The taxi driver was licensed and operating the vehicle during the turn. The moped rider's unlicensed status and lack of helmet are noted but secondary to the primary driver errors. This collision underscores the dangers posed by distracted driving and unsafe speeds, especially to vulnerable road users in the Bronx.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
