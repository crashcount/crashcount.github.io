The driver did not stop. Police are still looking. She died at St. Barnabas Hospital. Her name was not released. The car kept going. The street stayed quiet. <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/woman-killed-in-bronx-hit-and-run/>A Bronx woman is dead after a hit-and-run in Morris Heights.</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, District 18 saw <strong>10 deaths</strong> and <strong>725 injuries</strong> from crashes. <strong>Fourteen people were seriously hurt.</strong> The dead include children, elders, and workers. The numbers do not slow. The city does not slow. The cars do not slow.</p><h3 id=the-cost-of-delay>The Cost of Delay</h3><p>Speed kills here. A cab driver, Robert Godwin, died when an SUV hit him at <strong>77 mph in a 25 zone</strong>. The driver ran. The DA <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/08/08/us-news/bronx-woman-driving-77-mph-in-25-mph-zone-indicted-for-killing-cab-driver-da/>said the defendant was allegedly driving three times the speed limit when her SUV slammed into a livery cab, and she fled the scene without checking on the driver&rsquo;s condition or waiting for first responders to arrive.</a></p><p>Pedestrians are struck by SUVs, trucks, and cars. Most die at intersections. Most drivers walk away. The city blames distraction, but the dead cannot answer.</p><h3 id=council-member-farías-steps-and-silences>Council Member Farías: Steps and Silences</h3><p>Council Member Amanda Farías has voted for some safety bills. She backed laws to speed up pavement markings and remove abandoned cars that block sightlines. She voted to decriminalize jaywalking, shifting blame away from people on foot. But the carnage continues. No bill has slowed the cars. No law has brought back the dead.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every day of delay is another family broken. Call Council Member Farías. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people walking and biking. Do not wait for another body in the road. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Police cite 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way' and 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as contributing factors. The victim's behavior—'Crossing With Signal'—is noted in the report, but only after the documented driver errors.

The bus crashed into the wall, leaving it hanging over the edge. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz said, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." No injuries were reported, but the crash caused structural damage and scattered debris below. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz noted, "It speaks to the importance of enforcing our parking rules because it was going around a double-parked car." The incident highlights the danger posed by lax parking enforcement and infrastructure vulnerable to impact.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Police attribute the crash to 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Failure to Yield Right-of-Way.'

The woman’s action—'Crossing With Signal'—is noted in the report, but only after the driver’s errors are cited as contributing factors.
