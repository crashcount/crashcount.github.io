The street did not yield. He stayed conscious, his face torn open. The pavement, unmoving, marked his southbound path with blood.</p><p class=mb3>An 18-year-old male riding an e-scooter southbound on Lafayette Avenue near White Plains Road in the Bronx sustained a severe facial injury, according to the police report. The report states the rider was not wearing a helmet and was traveling straight ahead when the crash occurred. The narrative describes, 'Blood ran from his face. He stayed awake. The pavement did not move.' Police classified the contributing factors as 'Unspecified.' No other vehicles or persons were involved, and there is no indication of driver error by another party. The report notes the rider's lack of helmet use, but lists this detail only after describing the incident and does not attribute it as a contributing factor. The focus remains on the physical consequences and the environment, with no blame assigned to the injured rider.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
