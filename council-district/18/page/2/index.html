Police say a 21‑year‑old in a Mercedes tried to pass, hit a Volkswagen, then hit two motorcycles. Both riders—Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19, and Enrique Martinez, 21—were thrown and died at hospitals. The driver was charged with vehicular manslaughter and DWI. He refused a chemical test. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Gothamist reported it</a>. At arraignment, a sister said, “Two people were killed. He was drunk.” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>The Daily News carried her words</a>.</p><p>Since 2022, Council District 18 has logged <strong>19 deaths</strong> and 2,162 injuries in 3,875 crashes. Pedestrians bear nine of those deaths. SUVs and cars are tied to most harm. Trucks and buses add more bodies. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The city’s crash data shows it</a>.</p><p>Night is cruel here. From midnight to 2 a.m., injuries stack up. Deaths spike again at 1 a.m., 2 p.m., 8 p.m., 9 p.m., 10 p.m., and 11 p.m. The late hours cut deepest. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data tallies the hours</a>.</p><h3 id=corners-that-dont-forgive>Corners that don’t forgive</h3><ul><li><a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Westchester Avenue</a> leads the injury count: 74 hurt, four serious.</li><li><a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>White Plains Road</a> shows two deaths and more than a hundred injuries.</li><li>The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Bruckner Expressway</a> claims two dead and 153 hurt.</li></ul><p>Drivers keep turning into people. In one case at White Plains Road and Wood Avenue, a 75‑year‑old man crossed with the signal. A BMW SUV turned left and killed him.

Daylight corners on Westchester Avenue and White Plains Road. Harden left turns where turning kills. Add leading walk signals.

A 17-year-old, Juan Alexander Quizhpi Naranjo, drove a moped with a 14-year-old passenger when they collided with a Honda Odyssey. Both were thrown from the moped. Quizhpi Naranjo died at Jacobi Hospital; the girl survived. The minivan driver, 42, remained at the scene and faced no charges. NYPD's Collision Investigation Squad is still determining 'who had the right of way and whether a traffic violation played a role.' This marks the second traffic death this year in the 43rd Precinct, highlighting ongoing dangers for young road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bus crashed into the wall, leaving it hanging over the edge. Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz said, "We’re told by the MTA that the bus was trying to get around an illegally double-parked car, and he hit the wall and went through it." No injuries were reported, but the crash caused structural damage and scattered debris below. City Councilman Eric Dinowitz noted, "It speaks to the importance of enforcing our parking rules because it was going around a double-parked car." The incident highlights the danger posed by lax parking enforcement and infrastructure vulnerable to impact.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
