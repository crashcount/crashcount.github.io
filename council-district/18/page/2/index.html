Thirty seriously hurt.</strong> In the last year alone, two children died. A 17-year-old boy was thrown from his dirt bike at Metcalf Avenue and East 172nd Street. He never made it home. His passenger, a 14-year-old girl, survived. His mother waited for a call that never came. &ldquo;He was here yesterday morning, sitting on the bed and watching TV. I spoke to him last around 4 p.m.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/25/dirt-bike-minivan-bronx-crash-juan-alexander-quizhpi-naranjo/>said his mother</a>. The street was silent after.</p><p>A 75-year-old man was killed crossing with the signal at White Plains Road. The SUV kept going. The driver stayed at the scene. No charges. The city moved on.</p><p><strong>In the last twelve months:</strong> 9 deaths, 11 serious injuries, 542 hurt. The young, the old, the ones just trying to cross the street. The violence is steady. The pain is quiet, but it does not stop.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-and-silence>Leadership: Votes and Silence</h3><p>Council Member Amanda Farías has voted for daylighting, truck route redesign, and traffic calming near seniors. She backed the bill to legalize jaywalking, a step toward ending blame for those on foot. She co-sponsored bills for more school signs and speed humps. She voted yes on a law to warn taxi passengers to look for cyclists before opening doors. These are steps. But the blood on the street says it is not enough.</p><p>No public quotes. No bold push for a 20 mph citywide speed limit. No demand for more protected bike lanes or intersection redesigns. The council member has not led the charge. The city has the power to lower speeds. It has not used it.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> Call Amanda Farías. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for children, elders, and everyone on foot or bike. The city will not act unless you force it. The dead cannot speak. You must.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The police report states the motorbike struck the SUV's right front quarter panel, resulting in the teen being ejected and suffering fatal head injuries. The report notes the rider was not wearing a helmet at the time. Both contributing factors are listed as 'Unspecified' in the official documentation. The narrative describes the aftermath: 'He flew from the seat. His skull met the street. He died there, broken and still, as dusk closed in.'

The report states, 'He flew from the bike, landed hard. His skull hit Bronx concrete. Blood on the street. He died there, alone, in the late morning sun.' The police narrative lists 'Pedestrian/Bicyclist/Other Pedestrian Error/Confusion' as a contributing factor, but does not cite any driver-specific errors or violations. The cyclist was ejected from his bike and suffered fatal head injuries. The report does not mention helmet use or any other cyclist behavior as a contributing factor. The deadly impact underscores the vulnerability of people on bikes when confronted by heavy vehicles in city traffic.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Both vehicles struck center-front. The report states, 'Distraction guided them,' and lists 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the primary contributing factor for both operators. One rider, age 65, suffered severe facial bleeding and was partially ejected from his vehicle, though he wore a helmet. The report also notes 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' as a contributing factor for this injured rider. Both vehicles were traveling straight ahead before the crash. The data highlights the systemic danger posed by distracted operation and improper lane use, especially when riders are unlicensed. The crash left both machines and bodies marked by the consequences of inattention.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable. The law marks a shift: streets are for people, not just cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The injured woman, a right rear passenger, suffered severe lacerations to her head but remained conscious. According to the police report, the sedan was 'going straight ahead' before striking the stationary truck, which was parked at the time of impact. The report lists the contributing factors as 'Unspecified,' but the sequence of events makes clear that the moving sedan collided with a non-moving vehicle. No victim actions are cited as contributing factors. The focus remains on the sedan's impact with a parked vehicle, leaving a passenger wounded amid twisted steel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The report identifies 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' and 'Unsafe Speed' as contributing factors to the crash. The taxi driver was licensed and operating the vehicle during the turn. The moped rider's unlicensed status and lack of helmet are noted but secondary to the primary driver errors.
