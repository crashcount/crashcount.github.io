Police say a 21‑year‑old in a Mercedes tried to pass, hit a Volkswagen, then hit two motorcycles. Both riders—Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19, and Enrique Martinez, 21—were thrown and died at hospitals. The driver was charged with vehicular manslaughter and DWI. He refused a chemical test. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Gothamist reported it</a>. At arraignment, a sister said, “Two people were killed.

Pedestrians bear nine of those deaths. SUVs and cars are tied to most harm.

One moment riding, the next—broken, bleeding, still.</p><p class=mb3>According to the police report, a 39-year-old woman operating a moped westbound on Story Avenue near Metcalf Avenue in the Bronx was struck from behind. The report states, 'A moped struck from behind. The woman stayed upright. Her knee split open. Blood soaked her jeans.' The impact caused severe lacerations to her knee, though she did not fall from the vehicle. The moped sustained damage to the center back end, consistent with a rear impact. The police report lists the contributing factor as 'Unspecified,' but the collision's nature—center back end impact—points to a failure by the striking vehicle to maintain safe distance or control. No victim behavior is cited as a contributing factor. The focus remains on the danger posed to vulnerable road users by rear-end collisions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill reads: “requiring the installation of speed humps on roadways adjacent to any park equal or greater than one acre.” Lincoln Restler leads as primary sponsor, joined by eighteen co-sponsors. The Department of Transportation must install speed humps unless the commissioner finds a risk to safety or a conflict with DOT guidelines. The law would take effect 180 days after passage. The measure targets streets where parks meet traffic, aiming to slow cars and shield people outside vehicles.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
