Police say a 21‑year‑old in a Mercedes tried to pass, hit a Volkswagen, then hit two motorcycles. Both riders—Manuel Amarantepenalo, 19, and Enrique Martinez, 21—were thrown and died at hospitals. The driver was charged with vehicular manslaughter and DWI. He refused a chemical test. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/man-21-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter-dwi-in-bronx-highway-crash-that-killed-2>Gothamist reported it</a>. At arraignment, a sister said, “Two people were killed. He was drunk.” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>The Daily News carried her words</a>.</p><p>Since 2022, Council District 18 has logged <strong>19 deaths</strong> and 2,162 injuries in 3,875 crashes. Pedestrians bear nine of those deaths. SUVs and cars are tied to most harm. Trucks and buses add more bodies. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The city’s crash data shows it</a>.</p><p>Night is cruel here. From midnight to 2 a.m., injuries stack up. Deaths spike again at 1 a.m., 2 p.m., 8 p.m., 9 p.m., 10 p.m., and 11 p.m. The late hours cut deepest. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open Data tallies the hours</a>.</p><h3 id=corners-that-dont-forgive>Corners that don’t forgive</h3><ul><li><a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Westchester Avenue</a> leads the injury count: 74 hurt, four serious.</li><li><a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>White Plains Road</a> shows two deaths and more than a hundred injuries.</li><li>The <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Bruckner Expressway</a> claims two dead and 153 hurt.</li></ul><p>Drivers keep turning into people. In one case at White Plains Road and Wood Avenue, a 75‑year‑old man crossed with the signal. A BMW SUV turned left and killed him. Officers cited failure to yield and distraction. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The police report lists it</a>.</p><p>A pick‑up truck turning left on St. Raymond Avenue struck and killed a 47‑year‑old woman in the crosswalk. “Failure to yield” again. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>The dataset records it</a>.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who pays the price</h3><p>Pedestrians: nine dead, 402 injured.

How could they do that?” a mother asked outside court, as reported by the <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>Daily News</a>. The defense lawyer said, “My client is prepared to contest these charges.” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/12/victims-family-rages-at-driver-in-bronx-parkway-crash-that-killed-2-moped-riders/>Same report</a>.</p><h3 id=fix-whats-in-front-of-us>Fix what’s in front of us</h3><p>Start where people die. Daylight corners on Westchester Avenue and White Plains Road. Harden left turns where turning kills. Add leading walk signals. Tow the junk that blocks sightlines and hides people at crossings—Council passed a law to remove abandoned vehicles fast; District 18’s member voted yes. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>The vote is on Legistar</a>.</p><p>Target the late hours. Nighttime operations at repeat hotspots.

Albany passed Sammy’s Law; the city can act. <a href=../../take_action/>Our action page explains how to push it</a>.</p><p>Stop the worst repeat drivers. The Stop Super Speeders Act would force speed limiters on cars that rack up violations. Survivors have asked for this. So have the numbers. <a href=../../take_action/>Read more and call your reps</a>.</p><p>Two young men died on a parkway built for speed. The district keeps counting the dead. Slow the cars. Stop the bleeding.</p><p>—</p><p>Take one step now: ask City Hall to drop speeds and rein in repeat speeders. <a href=../../take_action/>Act here</a>.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
