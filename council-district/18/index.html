Thirty seriously hurt.</strong> In the last year alone, two children died. A 17-year-old boy was thrown from his dirt bike at Metcalf Avenue and East 172nd Street. He never made it home. His passenger, a 14-year-old girl, survived. His mother waited for a call that never came. &ldquo;He was here yesterday morning, sitting on the bed and watching TV. I spoke to him last around 4 p.m.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/25/dirt-bike-minivan-bronx-crash-juan-alexander-quizhpi-naranjo/>said his mother</a>. The street was silent after.</p><p>A 75-year-old man was killed crossing with the signal at White Plains Road. The SUV kept going. The driver stayed at the scene. No charges. The city moved on.</p><p><strong>In the last twelve months:</strong> 9 deaths, 11 serious injuries, 542 hurt. The young, the old, the ones just trying to cross the street. The violence is steady. The pain is quiet, but it does not stop.</p><h3 id=leadership-votes-and-silence>Leadership: Votes and Silence</h3><p>Council Member Amanda Farías has voted for daylighting, truck route redesign, and traffic calming near seniors. She backed the bill to legalize jaywalking, a step toward ending blame for those on foot. She co-sponsored bills for more school signs and speed humps. She voted yes on a law to warn taxi passengers to look for cyclists before opening doors. These are steps. But the blood on the street says it is not enough.</p><p>No public quotes. No bold push for a 20 mph citywide speed limit. No demand for more protected bike lanes or intersection redesigns. The council member has not led the charge. The city has the power to lower speeds. It has not used it.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay is another risk.</strong> Call Amanda Farías. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for children, elders, and everyone on foot or bike. The city will not act unless you force it. The dead cannot speak. You must.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Sunlight on every mile.</p><p class=mb3>Bill Int 1105-2024, now on the Mayor's desk, came through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. It was introduced November 13, 2024, and passed committee and full Council votes on April 10, 2025. The law, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to tracking progress made towards the requirements of the streets master plan,' demands the Department of Transportation post annual and monthly updates on all benchmark projects—protected bike lanes, bus lanes, signals, and upgrades. Council Member Julie Won led as primary sponsor, joined by Brooks-Powers, Hanif, Ayala, and others. The law requires public reporting on project status, funding, delays, and overruns. This measure brings hard oversight and transparency to the city’s street safety promises.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
