Four were over 65. In the same time, 2,225 neighbors were hurt. Twenty-one suffered wounds so grave they may never walk the same. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about hope or habit. They only rise.</p><p><strong>Just this January, a 95-year-old woman was killed by an SUV turning left at Cropsey and 24th Avenue.</strong> She died at the intersection, one more name in a long list. In September, a cyclist was struck and killed on the Belt Parkway. Last summer, a 17-year-old on a motorcycle died on the same road. The old, the young, the ones on foot or on two wheels—none are spared.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p><strong>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating.

He co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, but it sits in committee, not law. He voted yes on warning decals for taxis, but a sticker does not stop a speeding car. He has praised police after tragedy, but words do not build safe streets.</p><p><strong>The bills are slow. The deaths are fast.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call Council Member Brannan. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand action, not condolence. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Advocates sued, arguing Adams bypassed environmental review. The judge ruled the change was not a major project.

The court found the city may have acted "arbitrarily, capriciously, and illegally" by ordering the removal without proper legal notice. City law requires the Department of Transportation to notify local officials and allow time for public discussion, but, as the court papers state, "DOT did not provide the required notice." Plaintiffs argued that removing the lane would "irreparably" harm cyclists, especially children. The city claimed it would only shift the lane, not remove it, but advocates countered that any removal increases danger. The case highlights the need for transparent processes and the risks when safety infrastructure is hastily altered.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Adams said the redesign aims to 'better reflect community feedback.'

The plan uses 'hardened daylighting'—physical barriers, granite blocks, and planters—to stop cars from parking near corners. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' Nearly half of city traffic deaths happen at intersections, often due to blocked sightlines and turning vehicles.

The project aims to connect neighborhoods and calm traffic. DOT Assistant Director Dustin Khuu said the goal is a 'high performing transit priority street.' The plan includes concrete bus boarding islands and may reduce car lanes, giving more space to pedestrians and buses. However, the article notes gaps: 'DOT didn't share a block-by-block breakdown,' and curbside parking may remain, risking bus lane obstruction by double-parked vehicles. The city may physically protect the lane, but details are pending. The B41 bus, serving 28,000 daily trips, crawls at 4 mph during rush hour. The proposal highlights the need for clear enforcement and design to keep cars out of bus lanes and protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
