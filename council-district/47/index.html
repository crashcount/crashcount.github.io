Over 750 injured.</strong> In the last year alone, District 47 has seen carnage that leaves families empty and streets stained. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, elders, children. On January 24, a 95-year-old woman was struck and killed by an SUV turning left at Cropsey and 24th Avenue. She died at the intersection, her life ended by a machine that did not stop.</p><p>Just days ago, two men were killed crossing Third Avenue. The driver left them in the street and drove home. When police found him, he said, &ldquo;I had a six pack of Modelos and two drinks. I was driving the car by myself last night. It&rsquo;s my fault. After I hit them, I came home.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/12/hit-and-run-bmw-driver-who-killed-2-in-brooklyn-had-downed-beers-body-matter-found-on-car-da/>said the driver</a>. The blood alcohol was under the legal limit. The law did not save them. The street did not save them.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the damage.</strong> In the past three years, cars and SUVs killed four pedestrians and caused over 330 injuries. Trucks and buses killed one, bikes injured sixteen. Motorcycles and mopeds left ten more hurt. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not. Every crash is a family broken, a life cut short. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Justin Brannan has signed on to bills that clear abandoned cars from crosswalks, speed up pavement markings, and demand better plate enforcement. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council Legistar</a> He voted yes on laws to warn taxi passengers about cyclists and to remove derelict vehicles. These are steps, but they are not enough. The dead keep coming. The streets do not forgive delay.</p><p>At a vigil for Norman Fruchter, killed by a reversing driver, Brannan said, &ldquo;Confronting traffic violence also means taking personal responsibility [and] safe driving habits. It will take all of us.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/norman-fruchter-vigil-bay-ridge-traffic/>Brannan at vigil</a> But the laws remain weak. The most vulnerable still pay the price.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Brannan. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people on foot and bike. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The street remembers. The city must act.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The city had planned to start demolition after complaints from local leaders, but the court’s order blocks any changes until further review. Streetsblog quotes Ben Furnas: 'The Adams administration is going to have to spend their night preparing their legal case, not ripping out a critical safety project.'

She wrote, 'Modification of the bike lane is not a major transportation project.'

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'before this bike lane from 2018 to 2022 this is the area that had the second largest numbers of pedestrian fatalities and crashes in the city.' The lane faced opposition from some Hasidic leaders, citing children running into the lane from illegally parked cars and buses. Despite tweaks—school bus zones, daylighted corners, no standing areas—drivers kept parking illegally, blocking sightlines and endangering children. The city rarely removes protected lanes, but Adams acted after political pressure. Moving the lane to Classon Avenue, as some demand, would force cyclists onto a chaotic BQE ramp. The decision highlights persistent driver violations and policy gaps that leave vulnerable road users exposed.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The plan uses 'hardened daylighting'—physical barriers, granite blocks, and planters—to stop cars from parking near corners. DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, 'Using barriers to clear space at the intersection will help ensure pedestrians, cyclists and turning vehicles can see each other and enhance safety.' Nearly half of city traffic deaths happen at intersections, often due to blocked sightlines and turning vehicles. The redesign targets high-crash Brooklyn intersections first, including Ocean Avenue at Church Avenue. The move highlights the city's shift from painted lines to physical infrastructure, aiming to reduce systemic risk for vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
