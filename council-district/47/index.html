In the last year, <strong>five people died</strong> and <strong>689 were injured</strong> in traffic crashes. One was a 22-year-old moped rider, Joel Mota, killed at 67th Street and Third Avenue. He lived half a mile from the crash. His passenger left with broken bones. The driver who hit them was drunk and unlicensed. Police said, &ldquo;Moreno was driving west on 67th Street while Mota was driving south on Third Avenue, and he hit her passenger-side door&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/woman-charged-with-driving-while-intoxicated-without-license-in-fatal-brooklyn-crash>Gothamist</a>.</p><p>A family lost a son. A brother <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>remembered him</a>: &ldquo;He was a hardworking man. He had a lot of love for his family. He was always passionate about the things that he did.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=patterns-in-blood-and-steel>Patterns in Blood and Steel</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> In three years, they killed four people and injured over 300 pedestrians. Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds left a trail of injuries. The old, the young, the working—no one is spared. A 95-year-old woman died crossing 24th Avenue. A 17-year-old was killed on the Belt Parkway. The numbers do not lie. The bodies pile up.</p><h2 id=what-has-brannan-done>What Has Brannan Done?</h2><p>Council Member Justin Brannan has backed laws to curb repeat speeders, ban parking near crosswalks, and legalize jaywalking to end victim-blaming. He co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act and pushed for more school zone safety. He called the school zone law a &ldquo;no-brainer,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/03/16/new-law-may-make-school-zones-safer-but-why-does-dot-act-so-slowly-pols-ask/>saying</a>, &ldquo;Some of our biggest victories have been getting a traffic signal installed near a busy intersection near a school – that shouldn&rsquo;t be some huge colossal victory.&rdquo;</p><p>But the pace is slow. Promises stack up. The dead do not wait.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Brannan. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand action on repeat speeders. Join <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> and <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Do not let another family grieve alone. The street will not change itself. <strong>Act now.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The event, covered by Streetsblog NYC, saw candidates who championed 'the importance of bike lanes, public transit, and open streets' win across the city. Council members Lincoln Restler, Shahana Hanif, Shekar Krishnan, Chi Oss, Crystal Hudson, and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams all prevailed on platforms supporting safer streets. Mark Levine, who called for bold highway changes, won the Comptroller race. The safety analyst notes: 'The event text is a vague statement of support for livable streets but does not describe a specific policy action or legislative change, so its direct safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists cannot be determined.' The victories signal a mandate for people-first streets, but concrete safety gains depend on future action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary sponsor), Lynn C. Schulman, Carlina Rivera, and Justin L. Brannan back the measure. The PAWS Act would raise fines for drivers who hit pets and leave, and would recognize companion animals as protected victims under traffic law. The move targets a gap in current law, where penalties for striking animals are minor—on par with an illegal U-turn. The Council’s action signals a push for stronger accountability when vehicles harm the city’s most vulnerable, including its animals.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

No timeline yet.</p><p class=mb3>On November 25, 2024, City Council Member Justin Brannan and Community Board 10 announced approval and funding for major upgrades to the Bay Ridge Promenade and Leif Ericson Park. The Parks Committee and full board both voted unanimously for the $30 million overhaul, which includes $20.97 million for the Shore Road Promenade and $9.25 million for Leif Ericson Park. The project, described as 'Destination: Greenways!', will expand green space, separate bike and pedestrian lanes, add lighting, and install new amenities. Brannan, a key funder and supporter, said, 'Our local parks are the lungs of our city.' The overhaul aims to improve recreational cycling, repair pothole-ridden paths, and increase accessibility. Board members raised concerns about safety and sanitation, which the Parks Department pledged to address in final designs. No construction timeline has been set.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, a 2004 Lexus sedan was traveling west at an unsafe speed when the collision occurred. The 24-year-old male driver, the car's sole occupant, was not wearing a seatbelt and was ejected from the vehicle. The police report lists 'Unsafe Speed' as the primary contributing factor. The driver suffered severe crush injuries to his entire body and was found unconscious at the scene. The report details the vehicle's center front end as the point of impact and damage. No other vehicles or persons were involved. The data underscores the lethal consequences of excessive speed and lack of restraint, as documented by responding officers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The resolution calls for 'amend[ing] the Vehicle and Traffic Law, in relation to registration fees for certain vehicles.' Council Members Justin L. Brannan (primary sponsor, District 47) and Lincoln Restler (co-sponsor, District 33) lead the charge. The bill would raise registration fees for larger, heavier vehicles, with a break for electric car batteries. The resolution cites grim numbers: 103 pedestrians killed in New York City in 2023, and research showing heavy vehicles are deadlier. The Council says this law could deter the spread of oversized cars, protect people on foot and bike, and cut emissions. The measure is still in committee.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable. The law marks a shift: streets are for people, not just cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The police report notes the cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this detail appears after the description of the collision and is not listed as a contributing factor.
