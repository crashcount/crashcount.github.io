Over 750 injured.</strong> In the last year alone, District 47 has seen carnage that leaves families empty and streets stained. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, elders, children. On January 24, a 95-year-old woman was struck and killed by an SUV turning left at Cropsey and 24th Avenue. She died at the intersection, her life ended by a machine that did not stop.</p><p>Just days ago, two men were killed crossing Third Avenue. The driver left them in the street and drove home. When police found him, he said, &ldquo;I had a six pack of Modelos and two drinks. I was driving the car by myself last night. It&rsquo;s my fault. After I hit them, I came home.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/12/hit-and-run-bmw-driver-who-killed-2-in-brooklyn-had-downed-beers-body-matter-found-on-car-da/>said the driver</a>. The blood alcohol was under the legal limit. The law did not save them. The street did not save them.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the damage.</strong> In the past three years, cars and SUVs killed four pedestrians and caused over 330 injuries. Trucks and buses killed one, bikes injured sixteen. Motorcycles and mopeds left ten more hurt. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not. Every crash is a family broken, a life cut short. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Justin Brannan has signed on to bills that clear abandoned cars from crosswalks, speed up pavement markings, and demand better plate enforcement. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council Legistar</a> He voted yes on laws to warn taxi passengers about cyclists and to remove derelict vehicles. These are steps, but they are not enough. The dead keep coming. The streets do not forgive delay.</p><p>At a vigil for Norman Fruchter, killed by a reversing driver, Brannan said, &ldquo;Confronting traffic violence also means taking personal responsibility [and] safe driving habits. It will take all of us.&rdquo; <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/norman-fruchter-vigil-bay-ridge-traffic/>Brannan at vigil</a> But the laws remain weak. The most vulnerable still pay the price.</p><h3 id=what-now>What Now</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Call Brannan. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people on foot and bike. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list. The street remembers. The city must act.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Last week, a speeding driver ran a red light, killing two pedestrians. The article quotes Adams, who once called Third Avenue 'extremely intimidating' and said it 'must be at the top of our list.' Despite this, his administration 'put the brakes on a potentially life-saving road redesign,' favoring business interests. Attorney Peter Beadle notes, 'they had a plan ready to go and then it was pulled back.' The city could face legal action for failing to act despite knowing the risks, echoing a 2017 state court ruling on municipal liability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Cyclists described the decision as political, with one saying, "There’s a very important voting bloc that’s using their leverage over the mayor to remove the bike lane." The mayor’s refusal to sacrifice parking for safety left vulnerable road users exposed.
