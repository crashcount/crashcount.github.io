Four people killed in the last year. Six hundred eighty-one injured. One was a child. One was seventy-five. One was crossing the street. One was riding home. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><p>On June 22, Joel Mota, age 22, died at Third Avenue and 67th Street. He was riding a moped. The driver who killed him was drunk and unlicensed.

He voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths. He co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, pushing for lower speed limits and more rights for crash victims. He called the school zone traffic law a &ldquo;no-brainer&rdquo; and said, &ldquo;Some of our biggest victories have been getting a traffic signal installed near a busy intersection near a school – that shouldn&rsquo;t be some huge colossal victory.&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/03/16/new-law-may-make-school-zones-safer-but-why-does-dot-act-so-slowly-pols-ask/>Streetsblog NYC</a>.</p><p>But the streets do not wait for laws.

Promises do not stop cars.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next-action-not-excuses>What Comes Next: Action, Not Excuses</h2><p>Speed kills. SUVs and sedans took most of the lives here. Cameras and laws help, but only if enforced. The city has the power to lower speed limits. It has the power to redesign streets. It has the power to keep children from dying on the way to school. It must use it.</p><p>Call your council member. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand protected bike lanes. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand that every death is the last.</p><p>Do not wait for another name on the list. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The endorsement, reported by Streetsblog NYC and covered by Gersh Kuntzman, followed a review of candidate plans. StreetsPAC called Lander’s proposal 'by far the most comprehensive blueprint ... we've ever seen from a candidate for any office.' Lander promised more protected bike lanes, a citywide Bus Rapid Transit network, and using congestion pricing revenue for busways and bikeways. He pledged six-minute service on subways and buses and action on street homelessness. StreetsPAC’s endorsement signals strong support for policies that prioritize vulnerable road users. Their safety analyst noted: 'A comprehensive plan for safer streets and better public transit typically prioritizes vulnerable road users, supports mode shift, and aligns with best practices for population-level safety improvements.'</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The resolution states: 'add the term companion animals to the list of possible victim classes should a driver fail to exercise due care to avoid striking pedestrians and to increase the fine for striking a pet with a vehicle and leaving the scene without reporting the incident.' Council Members Farah N. Louis (primary sponsor), Lynn C. Schulman, Carlina Rivera, and Justin L. Brannan back the measure. The PAWS Act would raise fines for drivers who hit pets and leave, and would recognize companion animals as protected victims under traffic law. The move targets a gap in current law, where penalties for striking animals are minor—on par with an illegal U-turn. The Council’s action signals a push for stronger accountability when vehicles harm the city’s most vulnerable, including its animals.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

According to the police report, a 2004 Lexus sedan was traveling west at an unsafe speed when the collision occurred. The 24-year-old male driver, the car's sole occupant, was not wearing a seatbelt and was ejected from the vehicle. The police report lists 'Unsafe Speed' as the primary contributing factor. The driver suffered severe crush injuries to his entire body and was found unconscious at the scene. The report details the vehicle's center front end as the point of impact and damage. No other vehicles or persons were involved. The data underscores the lethal consequences of excessive speed and lack of restraint, as documented by responding officers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The Council says this law could deter the spread of oversized cars, protect people on foot and bike, and cut emissions.

Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable.
