Since January 2022, <strong>12 people have died</strong> in traffic crashes across District 47. <strong>Over 2,200 have been injured</strong>. The dead include children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians. In the last year alone, four lives were lost. A 95-year-old woman was struck and killed by an SUV turning left at Cropsey Avenue and 24th Avenue. A 74-year-old man died in a crosswalk on Bay Ridge Avenue, hit by an SUV. The numbers do not flinch. They do not mourn. They only rise.</p><p>Just days ago, two men were killed at 52nd Street and Third Avenue. A BMW ran a red light and sped away, leaving bodies in the crosswalk. Police said the driver was charged with manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, and reckless driving. &ldquo;EMS pronounced both men dead at the scene. Their identities are being withheld pending family notification,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.amny.com/new-york/brooklyn/pedestrians-hit-and-run-brooklyn/>reported amNY</a>. The crash site has seen 59 collisions and 80 injuries in five years. The blood dries, but the danger remains.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h3><p>Council Member Justin Brannan has backed bills to clear abandoned vehicles, speed up pavement markings, and require warning decals on taxis. He co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, aiming to keep sightlines clear for people on foot and bike. But he also pushed a bill to keep SUV parking costs low, a move that critics say subsidizes bigger, deadlier vehicles on city streets. &ldquo;We shouldn’t be bending over backwards to further subsidize someone’s choice to drive an SUV or pickup truck in New York City,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/02/14/brooklyn-pols-bill-would-prohibit-higher-parking-costs-for-suvs>said StreetsPAC&rsquo;s Eric McClure</a>.</p><p>After Norman Fruchter was killed by a reversing driver in Bay Ridge, Brannan attended the vigil and said, &ldquo;Confronting traffic violence also means taking personal responsibility [and] safe driving habits. It will take all of us,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/norman-fruchter-vigil-bay-ridge-traffic/>as reported by Brooklyn Paper</a>. But the laws remain weak. The most vulnerable still pay the price.</p><h3 id=the-next-fight-demand-action-not-excuses>The Next Fight: Demand Action, Not Excuses</h3><p><strong>Every death is preventable.</strong> The city has the power to lower speed limits, redesign streets, and crack down on repeat offenders. <strong>Call Council Member Brannan. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes and daylighted intersections. Demand action, not words.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
