Ninety-five years old. Struck by an SUV making a left turn. He died at the intersection, blood pooling on cold pavement. In the last twelve months, <strong>five people have died</strong> in District 47. <strong>689 more were injured</strong>. Two suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. One was a child. One was old enough to remember the war. The numbers do not stop. <strong>Over 1,100 crashes</strong> in a single year. Each one a life changed, a family broken. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=the-record-of-leadership>The Record of Leadership</h3><p>Council Member Justin Brannan has stood for some safety bills. He voted to end jaywalking enforcement, letting people cross where they need to without fear of tickets. He co-sponsored laws for safer crossings, greenways, and school zones. He called the school zone safety law a &ldquo;no-brainer,&rdquo; saying, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/03/16/new-law-may-make-school-zones-safer-but-why-does-dot-act-so-slowly-pols-ask/>&ldquo;Some of our biggest victories have been getting a traffic signal installed near a busy intersection near a school – that shouldn&rsquo;t be some huge colossal victory.&rdquo;</a> But the victories are too few. The deaths keep coming. On Fourth Avenue, activists <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/02/26/activists-renew-push-for-redesign-of-fourth-ave-in-bay-ridge>begged for a safer street</a>. Brannan was once a supporter. Now, as his term ends, he is silent. The redesign stalls. The danger remains.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and sedans</strong> do most of the damage. In three years, SUVs killed four pedestrians here. Trucks and buses killed one. Bikes, mopeds, and motorcycles left bodies too, but the steel and speed of cars do most of the work. The city installs cameras and lowers speed limits, but the blood does not dry. The city passes laws. The city waits.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is preventable. Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call Brannan. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand the Fourth Avenue redesign. Demand action before another name becomes a number. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The official summary reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to conducting a study of the impact that truck and delivery traffic generated by last mile facilities have on local communities and infrastructure.' The bill required the Department of Transportation to report on delivery vehicle volumes, parking, congestion, collisions, and pedestrian injuries near these hubs. It called for identifying the most affected streets and estimating the costs and possible fixes. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without passage.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Injuries forced action.</p><p class=mb3>Councilmember Justin Brannan (District 47) secured $24 million for a full rehabilitation of New Utrecht Avenue, announced February 9, 2023. The Department of Transportation is designing a capital project for the stretch from 65th to 77th streets, after years of resident complaints about potholes, cracked pavement, and faded crosswalks. The project, described as bringing 'a full suite of safety upgrades and fully repair[ing] the roadbed,' will include concrete curb extensions, pedestrian islands, raised crosswalks, new crosswalks, and traffic signals. Brannan, who advocated for the funding, said, 'Why is the city allowing this to happen on New Utrecht Avenue?' and pushed for an earlier construction start. The area saw 69 crashes and 80 injuries in five years, underscoring the urgent need for safer streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
