In the last year, <strong>five people died</strong> and <strong>689 were injured</strong> in traffic crashes. One was a 22-year-old moped rider, Joel Mota, killed at 67th Street and Third Avenue. He lived half a mile from the crash. His passenger left with broken bones. The driver who hit them was drunk and unlicensed. Police said, &ldquo;Moreno was driving west on 67th Street while Mota was driving south on Third Avenue, and he hit her passenger-side door&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/woman-charged-with-driving-while-intoxicated-without-license-in-fatal-brooklyn-crash>Gothamist</a>.</p><p>A family lost a son. A brother <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>remembered him</a>: &ldquo;He was a hardworking man. He had a lot of love for his family. He was always passionate about the things that he did.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=patterns-in-blood-and-steel>Patterns in Blood and Steel</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> In three years, they killed four people and injured over 300 pedestrians. Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds left a trail of injuries. The old, the young, the working—no one is spared. A 95-year-old woman died crossing 24th Avenue. A 17-year-old was killed on the Belt Parkway. The numbers do not lie. The bodies pile up.</p><h2 id=what-has-brannan-done>What Has Brannan Done?</h2><p>Council Member Justin Brannan has backed laws to curb repeat speeders, ban parking near crosswalks, and legalize jaywalking to end victim-blaming. He co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act and pushed for more school zone safety. He called the school zone law a &ldquo;no-brainer,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/03/16/new-law-may-make-school-zones-safer-but-why-does-dot-act-so-slowly-pols-ask/>saying</a>, &ldquo;Some of our biggest victories have been getting a traffic signal installed near a busy intersection near a school – that shouldn&rsquo;t be some huge colossal victory.&rdquo;</p><p>But the pace is slow. Promises stack up. The dead do not wait.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Brannan. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand action on repeat speeders. Join <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> and <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Do not let another family grieve alone. The street will not change itself. <strong>Act now.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The driver, age 72, swerved around a car stopped at a red light and made an illegal turn, hitting Chen, who became trapped under the truck.

Council Member Justin Brannan responded, saying, 'The answer will not bring our neighbor back, but they absolutely matter, especially after learning this driver has [so many] school zone speed camera violations!' City records show speed camera tickets do not count against a driver’s record, so licenses are not suspended or revoked. All tickets were paid, preventing booting or towing.

The deal keeps the system afloat but relies on private money, not public funds. The matter, described as a debate on public funding for bike-share expansion, highlights the city’s outlier status among major bike-share cities. Council Member Erik Bottcher and others voiced concerns over poor service and limited reach. Elizabeth Adams of Transportation Alternatives called for city funding to expand access and lower prices. Justin Brannan criticized the system’s neglect of outer boroughs. Mayor Adams’s 2021 pledge to fund expansion remains unfulfilled. Advocates and labor leaders say public funding is vital for equity, affordability, and reliability.

The matter, titled "Citigroup Renews NYC Bike-Share Sponsorship — Is It Time For Public Funding?", highlighted the gap in service for low-income and outer-borough neighborhoods. Council Member Justin Brannan (District 47) criticized Citi Bike’s limited reach, saying, "Ya gotta love @CitiBikeNYC systematically icing out the 'outer' borough transit deserts." Advocates and labor leaders echoed calls for public funding, arguing the for-profit model fails vulnerable New Yorkers. Mayor Adams’s campaign promise to expand Citi Bike with city funding remains unfulfilled. The debate underscores a systemic failure: without public investment, bike-share stays out of reach for those who need it most. No formal safety analysis was provided, but advocates stress that lack of access keeps vulnerable road users at risk.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
