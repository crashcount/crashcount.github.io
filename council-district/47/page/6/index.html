Since 2022, <strong>12 people have died</strong> and <strong>over 2,200 have been injured</strong> in traffic crashes. In the past year alone, there were <strong>4 deaths</strong> and <strong>766 injuries</strong>. These are not just numbers—they are neighbors, elders, children. On July 11, two men—Kex Un Chen and Faqiu Lin—were killed crossing Third Avenue in Sunset Park while walking to a food pantry. The BMW did not brake. The driver ran. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/11/hit-and-run-driver-kills-two-men-crossing-brooklyn-street/>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re very heartbroken. He was a good person,&rdquo; said Qin Xiao Chen, a relative.</a></p><p><strong>Speed and size kill.</strong> SUVs and sedans are the main weapons: in this district, they caused <strong>4 deaths</strong> and <strong>over 320 injuries</strong> to pedestrians since 2022. Trucks, bikes, and mopeds add to the toll. No one is spared—the old, the young, the ones just trying to get by.</p><h3 id=the-policy-response-promises-and-pressure>The Policy Response: Promises and Pressure</h3><p>Council Member Justin Brannan has signed on to bills that matter. He backed the SAFE Streets Act, which targets reckless drivers and demands safer design. He voted to legalize jaywalking, a move that stops blaming the dead for their own deaths. He co-sponsored a ban on parking near crosswalks to keep sightlines clear for people on foot. But the blood keeps flowing. <strong>Every week brings new names.</strong></p><p>After the latest crash, the anger is raw. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/11/hit-and-run-driver-kills-two-pedestrians-on-third-ave-corridor-eric-adams-refuses-to-make-safer>&ldquo;These two deaths are as horrifying as they were preventable,&rdquo; said Ben Furnas.</a> The city knows which streets are deadly. The fixes are known. Still, projects stall. The cost is paid in funerals and empty chairs.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-no-more-waiting>What Comes Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>This is not fate.</strong> These deaths are not accidents. They are the result of policy, delay, and neglect. The council can lower speed limits. It can demand protected crossings and bike lanes. It can push for enforcement that targets the real danger—drivers, not the people on foot or bike.</p><p><strong>Call Council Member Brannan. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand the city finish every stalled safety project.</strong> Every day of delay is another family broken. The time for patience is over. The street belongs to the living. Make them prove it.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The Department of Transportation would also be barred from authorizing sightseeing bus stops in bus lanes during those hours.

Critics, like StreetsPAC's Eric McClure, argue the bill subsidizes SUV use and endangers city streets, stating, 'We shouldn’t be bending over backwards to further subsidize someone’s choice to drive an SUV or pickup truck in New York City.' Brannan admits the bill needs revision. The bill’s status and committee assignment remain unclear.
