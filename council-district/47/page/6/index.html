In the last twelve months alone, five people lost their lives on these streets. One was a child. One was over seventy-five. One was under eighteen.</p><p>The dead do not speak. But the living remember. A witness to a crash tried to stop the bleeding, wrapping a towel around a child&rsquo;s head, tapping, tapping, as blood poured out. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/28/boy-fatally-struck-honda-suv-driver-crown-heights-brooklyn/>&ldquo;I just saw a lot of blood gushing out of his ears, his mouth.&rdquo;</a> The driver stood in shock.

Trucks and buses killed one. Bikes and mopeds injured, but did not kill. The old and the young are hit hardest. The numbers do not change. The story repeats.</p><h3 id=what-has-brannan-done>What Has Brannan Done?</h3><p>Council Member Justin Brannan has signed on to bills that could help. He co-sponsored laws to ban parking near crosswalks, to daylight intersections, to install solar crosswalks, to demand safer school zones, and to push for lower speed limits. He voted to legalize jaywalking, shifting blame away from people on foot. He called the school zone law a <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/03/16/new-law-may-make-school-zones-safer-but-why-does-dot-act-so-slowly-pols-ask/>&ldquo;no-brainer&rdquo;</a>. But the pace is slow. Promises stack up. Streets stay the same.</p><h3 id=the-next-step>The Next Step</h3><p><strong>Every death is preventable.</strong> The city can lower speed limits now. It can redesign Fourth Avenue. It can clear corners and build real protection. But it will not happen unless you demand it. Call Brannan. Call the Mayor. Do not wait for another towel, another child, another name in the data.</p><p><strong>Act now.

The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure reviewed it, but the bill was filed without passage at the end of session on December 31, 2023.

Critics warn it props up dangerous vehicles. The bill covers all light-duty cars under 8,500 pounds. Debate rages as advocates call for clarity and safety.</p><p class=mb3>On February 14, 2022, Council Member Justin Brannan introduced a bill to the New York City Council. The bill would require commercial parking garages to charge the same rate for all light-duty vehicles under 8,500 pounds, including sedans, vans, SUVs, and pickups. Brannan claims the measure fights arbitrary price-gouging, saying, 'The idea is to make it fair for people who choose to drive.' Critics, like StreetsPAC's Eric McClure, argue the bill subsidizes SUV use and endangers city streets, stating, 'We shouldn’t be bending over backwards to further subsidize someone’s choice to drive an SUV or pickup truck in New York City.' Brannan admits the bill needs revision. The bill’s status and committee assignment remain unclear. No formal safety analysis was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Only a fraction of stations have elevators. Lawmakers want no more half-measures. The resolution was filed at session’s end. Riders with disabilities remain stranded underground.</p><p class=mb3>Resolution 0009-2022 was introduced on February 10, 2022, in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. It called on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to ensure any subway station undergoing enhancement or renovation becomes fully accessible to people with disabilities. The matter title reads: 'Resolution calling upon the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to make any subway stations undergoing enhancement or renovation fully accessible to people with disabilities.' Council Member Darlene Mealy sponsored the resolution, joined by Brannan, Menin, Louis, Yeger, Hanif, Hudson, Marte, Joseph, Riley, and Brooks-Powers. The resolution was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023. Only 117 out of 493 subway stations are accessible. The Council’s action highlights the city’s failure to guarantee safe, equal passage for all riders. Elevators and upgrades are overdue. The bill’s filing leaves vulnerable New Yorkers waiting.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
