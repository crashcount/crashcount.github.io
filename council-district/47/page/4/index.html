Nearly 700 injured.</strong> That’s just the last twelve months in District 47. The numbers do not bleed, but people do. The old, the young, the ones who walk and ride. They are struck down in crosswalks, on corners, in the places they should be safe.</p><p>Last week, a 90-year-old man tried to cross Avenue U. A blue moped hit him. The rider stopped, looked, then left him dying in the street. “He was laid out on the floor. His head was wide open,” <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/08/brooklyn-90-year-old-man-hit-run-rider/>said a witness</a>. The man died at the hospital. The rider is still gone. The family waits for answers that do not come.</p><h3 id=patterns-of-harm>Patterns of Harm</h3><p><strong>The violence is not random.</strong> In the past year, District 47 saw 1,130 crashes. Four people died. One was a child. One was over 75. Nearly 80 children were hurt. Cars and SUVs did most of the damage—over 320 pedestrian injuries, four deaths. Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds left bodies and broken bones. Bikes hurt people too, but they did not kill.</p><p>The streets do not forgive. “We want to make sure what happened doesn&rsquo;t happen again,” <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/90-year-old-killed-brooklyn-moped-nypd/>said a neighbor</a>. But it does. Again and again.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—and What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Justin Brannan has signed on to bills that matter. He voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that blamed the dead for their own deaths. He co-sponsored the <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>SAFE Streets Act</a>, pushing for lower speed limits and more rights for crash victims. He backed a <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban on parking near crosswalks</a>, to clear sightlines for people on foot. These are steps. But the blood on the asphalt says it is not enough.</p><p><strong>The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not done so.</strong> The cameras catch speeders, but the worst repeat offenders keep driving. The old man on Avenue U is dead. The city waits.</p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p><strong>Call Brannan. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action against repeat speeders.</strong> The dead cannot wait. The living should not have to.</p><p><a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill's title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to increasing civil penalties for operating a bicycle, bicycle with electric assist, or electric scooter on the sidewalk.' Council Members Althea V. Stevens (primary sponsor), James F. Gennaro, Justin L. Brannan, Gale A. Brewer, and Sandra Ung back the measure. The bill would raise fines for anyone caught riding a bike, e-bike, or scooter on sidewalks. Supporters say higher penalties will curb sidewalk riding and protect pedestrians. The bill awaits further action in committee.
