Four were over 65. In the same time, 2,225 neighbors were hurt. Twenty-one suffered wounds so grave they may never walk the same. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about hope or habit. They only rise.</p><p><strong>Just this January, a 95-year-old woman was killed by an SUV turning left at Cropsey and 24th Avenue.</strong> She died at the intersection, one more name in a long list. In September, a cyclist was struck and killed on the Belt Parkway. Last summer, a 17-year-old on a motorcycle died on the same road. The old, the young, the ones on foot or on two wheels—none are spared.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p><strong>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating.

They were just trying to eat.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Justin Brannan has backed bills to clear abandoned cars, speed up pavement markings, and require NYPD to check plates on temp tags. He co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, but it sits in committee, not law. He voted yes on warning decals for taxis, but a sticker does not stop a speeding car. He has praised police after tragedy, but words do not build safe streets.</p><p><strong>The bills are slow. The deaths are fast.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call Council Member Brannan. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand action, not condolence. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The narrative details, 'Metal struck flesh. His head hit hard. Blood pooled. The bike folded at the doors. The bumper cracked.' The police report lists 'Traffic Control Disregarded' and 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' as contributing factors, both attributed to driver error. The cyclist was not wearing a helmet, as noted in the report, but this is mentioned only after the clear failures by the SUV driver.

Pedestrians and cyclists get a break from double-deckers.</p><p class=mb3>Bill Int 0543-2024 sits with the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure after introduction on March 7, 2024. The measure, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to restricting the use of bus lanes by sight-seeing buses,' blocks sightseeing buses from bus lanes on weekdays, 7–10 a.m. and 4–7 p.m. Sponsors Lincoln Restler (District 33, primary) and Justin L. Brannan (District 47, co-sponsor) push to keep bus lanes clear for transit. No sightseeing bus stops allowed in bus lanes during these hours. The bill responds to congestion and crowding, giving vulnerable road users more space and fewer blind spots.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
