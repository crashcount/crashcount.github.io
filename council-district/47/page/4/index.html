Six hundred eighty-four injured.</strong> That is the toll in District 47 over the last year. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about excuses. In these streets, the most vulnerable pay the price. Children, elders, cyclists, and pedestrians—struck down by cars, SUVs, trucks, and mopeds.</p><p>Just this year, a 17-year-old moped rider died after a collision with a turning car in Midwood. Police said, <em>&ldquo;Jhoan Puga was riding a gas moped with a passenger on the back, traveling north on East Eighth St. in Midwood when it slammed into a Genesis G80 car operated by a 71-year-old man making a left turn off East Eighth St.&rdquo;</em> (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/teen-boy-dead-man-critically-injured-in-moped-crash-in-brooklyn/>NY Daily News</a>). No arrest. Another family left with a hole that will not heal.</p><h2 id=patterns-of-harm>Patterns of Harm</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most damage.</strong> In the last three years, they killed four people and injured over 300 more on these streets. Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds left dozens more injured or dead. The city calls them accidents. The victims call them life-changing.</p><h2 id=what-has-brannan-done>What Has Brannan Done?</h2><p>Council Member Justin Brannan has backed bills to make streets safer. He co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, pushed for daylighting at crosswalks, and voted to legalize jaywalking—ending a law that punished the vulnerable instead of the reckless. He called a school zone traffic law a <em>&ldquo;no-brainer,&rdquo;</em> saying, <em>&ldquo;Some of our biggest victories have been getting a traffic signal installed near a busy intersection near a school – that shouldn&rsquo;t be some huge colossal victory.&rdquo;</em> (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/03/16/new-law-may-make-school-zones-safer-but-why-does-dot-act-so-slowly-pols-ask/>Streetsblog NYC</a>).</p><p>But the pace is slow. Promises pile up. The dead do not wait.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>Every day without action is another day of blood on the street.</strong> Call Council Member Brannan. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand protected bike lanes and daylighted crosswalks. Demand that every child, every elder, every neighbor can cross the street and live.</p><p><strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong> <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Introduced March 7, 2024, it urges the MTA to make any subway station undergoing enhancement or renovation fully accessible to people with disabilities. The matter title is clear: 'Resolution calling upon the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to make any subway stations undergoing enhancement or renovation fully accessible to people with disabilities.' Council Members Shahana K. Hanif (primary sponsor), Crystal Hudson, and Justin L. Brannan back the measure. The resolution responds to a system where only 117 of 493 stations are accessible. It follows a federal court ruling that found the MTA violated the ADA by skipping elevator installation during renovations. The sponsors demand the MTA use every renovation as a chance to fix this injustice. The bill remains in committee.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Justin Brannan, who represents Bay Ridge, has a mixed record—once supportive, now silent as his term ends. State Senator Andrew Gounardes supports the redesign, citing risks to pedestrians and cyclists: 'the design of the street puts your safety at risk.' The DOT has not proposed changes south of Sunset Park, leaving Bay Ridge exposed.
