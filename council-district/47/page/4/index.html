Five people killed, 682 injured in the last year alone (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The dead include a 22-year-old moped rider, a 17-year-old on a motorcycle, a 74-year-old man crossing the street, and a 95-year-old woman struck at an intersection. The living carry scars that do not heal. A passenger thrown from a moped, bones broken. A cyclist ejected onto the Belt Parkway, helmet or not, dead all the same.</p><p>Cars and SUVs did most of the killing. They struck, they crushed, they left families with empty chairs at the table. Trucks, motorcycles, and bikes played their part, but the weight of the harm is steel and speed (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h2 id=faces-and-voices>Faces and Voices</h2><p>Joel Mota was 22. He died before sunrise, his moped smashed by a drunk, unlicensed driver in Bay Ridge. His brother <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>remembered him simply</a>: “He never stopped working.” The driver was arrested, then released without bail. The street stayed the same.</p><p>A 17-year-old boy died on a moped in Midwood. The car turned left. The boy and his passenger were thrown. The police <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/23/teen-boy-dead-man-critically-injured-in-moped-crash-in-brooklyn/>said</a>, “There have been no arrests. The NYPD highway district collision squad is investigating.” The words are cold. The loss is not.</p><h2 id=leadership-steps-and-stalls>Leadership: Steps and Stalls</h2><p>Council Member Justin Brannan has backed bills to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>ban parking near crosswalks</a>, to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>raise penalties for blocked plates</a>, and to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>—a move that stops blaming the dead for crossing the street. He co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, pushing for lower speed limits and more rights for crash victims (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>SAFE Streets Act</a>).</p><p>But on the ground, the danger lingers. Advocates <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/02/26/activists-renew-push-for-redesign-of-fourth-ave-in-bay-ridge>called for a redesign of Fourth Avenue</a> in Bay Ridge. Brannan, once supportive, has gone quiet. The city <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/03/16/new-law-may-make-school-zones-safer-but-why-does-dot-act-so-slowly-pols-ask/>passed a law to add traffic signals near schools</a>. Brannan called it a “no-brainer,” but the signals are slow to come.</p><h2 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h2><p>This is not fate. These are not accidents. Every crash is a policy failure, a choice to let the street stay deadly. Call Council Member Brannan. Demand action. Demand daylight at every crosswalk, protected lanes, slower speeds, and streets built for people, not for cars. Do not wait for another name on the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring the department of transportation to consider placement of traffic enforcement agents in developing an interagency roadway safety plan," requires DOT to consider where traffic enforcement agents are stationed when drafting the city’s five-year safety plan. Sponsors include Council Member Justin L. Brannan (primary), Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, Farah N. Louis, Lincoln Restler, and the Queens Borough President (by request). The bill responds to Local Law 12 of 2011, which already mandates a safety plan, but this measure sharpens the focus: DOT must show where agents will be placed to protect the most dangerous corridors. The bill awaits further action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states the SUV driver disregarded traffic control, directly contributing to the crash. The cyclist suffered severe head lacerations and remained conscious at the scene. The narrative details, 'Metal struck flesh. His head hit hard. Blood pooled. The bike folded at the doors. The bumper cracked.' The police report lists 'Traffic Control Disregarded' and 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' as contributing factors, both attributed to driver error. The cyclist was not wearing a helmet, as noted in the report, but this is mentioned only after the clear failures by the SUV driver. The crash unfolded near Council District 47, underscoring the persistent danger vulnerable road users face from drivers who ignore basic rules.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The SAFE Streets Act targets reckless driving, demands safer street design, and gives crash victims more rights.

The campaign, led by Bike South Brooklyn, the Bay Ridge Environmental Group, and Transportation Alternatives, demands a 'better, safer Fourth Avenue' with a road diet and protected bike lanes. Council Member Justin Brannan, who represents Bay Ridge, has a mixed record—once supportive, now silent as his term ends. State Senator Andrew Gounardes supports the redesign, citing risks to pedestrians and cyclists: 'the design of the street puts your safety at risk.' The DOT has not proposed changes south of Sunset Park, leaving Bay Ridge exposed.
