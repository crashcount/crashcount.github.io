In the last year, <strong>five people died</strong> and <strong>689 were injured</strong> in traffic crashes. One was a 22-year-old moped rider, Joel Mota, killed at 67th Street and Third Avenue. He lived half a mile from the crash. His passenger left with broken bones. The driver who hit them was drunk and unlicensed. Police said, &ldquo;Moreno was driving west on 67th Street while Mota was driving south on Third Avenue, and he hit her passenger-side door&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/woman-charged-with-driving-while-intoxicated-without-license-in-fatal-brooklyn-crash>Gothamist</a>.</p><p>A family lost a son. A brother <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>remembered him</a>: &ldquo;He was a hardworking man. He had a lot of love for his family. He was always passionate about the things that he did.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=patterns-in-blood-and-steel>Patterns in Blood and Steel</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> In three years, they killed four people and injured over 300 pedestrians. Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds left a trail of injuries. The old, the young, the working—no one is spared. A 95-year-old woman died crossing 24th Avenue. A 17-year-old was killed on the Belt Parkway. The numbers do not lie. The bodies pile up.</p><h2 id=what-has-brannan-done>What Has Brannan Done?</h2><p>Council Member Justin Brannan has backed laws to curb repeat speeders, ban parking near crosswalks, and legalize jaywalking to end victim-blaming. He co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act and pushed for more school zone safety. He called the school zone law a &ldquo;no-brainer,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/03/16/new-law-may-make-school-zones-safer-but-why-does-dot-act-so-slowly-pols-ask/>saying</a>, &ldquo;Some of our biggest victories have been getting a traffic signal installed near a busy intersection near a school – that shouldn&rsquo;t be some huge colossal victory.&rdquo;</p><p>But the pace is slow. Promises stack up. The dead do not wait.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Brannan. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand action on repeat speeders. Join <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> and <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Do not let another family grieve alone. The street will not change itself. <strong>Act now.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring the department of transportation to consider placement of traffic enforcement agents in developing an interagency roadway safety plan," requires DOT to consider where traffic enforcement agents are stationed when drafting the city’s five-year safety plan. Sponsors include Council Member Justin L. Brannan (primary), Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, Farah N. Louis, Lincoln Restler, and the Queens Borough President (by request). The bill responds to Local Law 12 of 2011, which already mandates a safety plan, but this measure sharpens the focus: DOT must show where agents will be placed to protect the most dangerous corridors.

The narrative details, 'Metal struck flesh. His head hit hard. Blood pooled. The bike folded at the doors. The bumper cracked.' The police report lists 'Traffic Control Disregarded' and 'Passing or Lane Usage Improper' as contributing factors, both attributed to driver error. The cyclist was not wearing a helmet, as noted in the report, but this is mentioned only after the clear failures by the SUV driver.

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to hazardous obstruction by vehicles and civilian complaints to the department of transportation for hazardous obstruction violations," creates a new civil penalty for vehicles blocking bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or hydrants within 2,640 feet of a school. The penalty is $175 per violation. The Department of Transportation must launch a civilian reporting program. If DOT prosecutes a case using civilian evidence, the complainant gets 25% of the proceeds. Council Member Carlina Rivera leads as primary sponsor, joined by Restler, Joseph, Menin, Nurse, Hudson, Brannan, Farías, Brewer, Salaam, Hanif, Avilés, Won, Bottcher, Krishnan, Gutiérrez, Marte, and the Brooklyn Borough President. The bill aims to keep streets clear for vulnerable road users, especially near schools.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The driver, age 72, swerved around a car stopped at a red light and made an illegal turn, hitting Chen, who became trapped under the truck. Despite the driver’s long record of school zone speed camera violations, police did not arrest or charge him. Council Member Justin Brannan responded, saying, 'The answer will not bring our neighbor back, but they absolutely matter, especially after learning this driver has [so many] school zone speed camera violations!' City records show speed camera tickets do not count against a driver’s record, so licenses are not suspended or revoked. All tickets were paid, preventing booting or towing. The city’s enforcement system left a dangerous driver on the road.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
