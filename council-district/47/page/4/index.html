Ninety-five years old. Struck by an SUV making a left turn. He died at the intersection, blood pooling on cold pavement. In the last twelve months, <strong>five people have died</strong> in District 47. <strong>689 more were injured</strong>. Two suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. One was a child. One was old enough to remember the war. The numbers do not stop. <strong>Over 1,100 crashes</strong> in a single year. Each one a life changed, a family broken. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=the-record-of-leadership>The Record of Leadership</h3><p>Council Member Justin Brannan has stood for some safety bills. He voted to end jaywalking enforcement, letting people cross where they need to without fear of tickets. He co-sponsored laws for safer crossings, greenways, and school zones. He called the school zone safety law a &ldquo;no-brainer,&rdquo; saying, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/03/16/new-law-may-make-school-zones-safer-but-why-does-dot-act-so-slowly-pols-ask/>&ldquo;Some of our biggest victories have been getting a traffic signal installed near a busy intersection near a school – that shouldn&rsquo;t be some huge colossal victory.&rdquo;</a> But the victories are too few. The deaths keep coming. On Fourth Avenue, activists <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/02/26/activists-renew-push-for-redesign-of-fourth-ave-in-bay-ridge>begged for a safer street</a>. Brannan was once a supporter. Now, as his term ends, he is silent. The redesign stalls. The danger remains.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and sedans</strong> do most of the damage. In three years, SUVs killed four pedestrians here. Trucks and buses killed one. Bikes, mopeds, and motorcycles left bodies too, but the steel and speed of cars do most of the work. The city installs cameras and lowers speed limits, but the blood does not dry. The city passes laws. The city waits.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is preventable. Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call Brannan. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand the Fourth Avenue redesign. Demand action before another name becomes a number. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The car had received at least 12 school-zone speeding tickets since June 21, but authorities failed to intervene until this incident. Council Member Justin Brannan reported the arrest, saying, "It seems the various systems currently in place to deter this type of behavior have failed here." Brannan and Queens DA Melinda Katz both criticized the current penalties, calling them too weak to deter dangerous drivers. Katz said, "There is a strong need for tougher penalties for those who choose to use our city streets as raceways." The article notes that only after 15 camera-issued speeding tickets in a year must drivers take a safety course, and few cars are seized under the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program. Community complaints led to the arrest, but most reckless drivers still evade real consequences.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill sought to amend city law to 'restrict the use of bus lanes by sight-seeing buses.' It would have prohibited sightseeing buses from using bus lanes between 7–10 a.m. and 4–7 p.m. on weekdays. The Department of Transportation would also be barred from authorizing sightseeing bus stops in bus lanes during those hours.

The measure was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023, without a vote or enactment. The bill aimed to keep bus lanes clear for transit, reducing congestion and potential conflict with pedestrians and cyclists.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
