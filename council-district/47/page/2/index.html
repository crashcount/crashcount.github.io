Four were over 65. In the same time, 2,225 neighbors were hurt. Twenty-one suffered wounds so grave they may never walk the same. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about hope or habit. They only rise.</p><p><strong>Just this January, a 95-year-old woman was killed by an SUV turning left at Cropsey and 24th Avenue.</strong> She died at the intersection, one more name in a long list. In September, a cyclist was struck and killed on the Belt Parkway. Last summer, a 17-year-old on a motorcycle died on the same road. The old, the young, the ones on foot or on two wheels—none are spared.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p><strong>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating.

He co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, but it sits in committee, not law. He voted yes on warning decals for taxis, but a sticker does not stop a speeding car. He has praised police after tragedy, but words do not build safe streets.</p><p><strong>The bills are slow. The deaths are fast.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call Council Member Brannan. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand action, not condolence. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
