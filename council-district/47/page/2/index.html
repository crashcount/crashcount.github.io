Four were over 65. In the same time, 2,225 neighbors were hurt. Twenty-one suffered wounds so grave they may never walk the same. The numbers do not flinch. They do not care about hope or habit. They only rise.</p><p><strong>Just this January, a 95-year-old woman was killed by an SUV turning left at Cropsey and 24th Avenue.</strong> She died at the intersection, one more name in a long list. In September, a cyclist was struck and killed on the Belt Parkway. Last summer, a 17-year-old on a motorcycle died on the same road. The old, the young, the ones on foot or on two wheels—none are spared.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p><strong>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating.

They were just trying to eat.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member Justin Brannan has backed bills to clear abandoned cars, speed up pavement markings, and require NYPD to check plates on temp tags. He co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks, but it sits in committee, not law. He voted yes on warning decals for taxis, but a sticker does not stop a speeding car. He has praised police after tragedy, but words do not build safe streets.</p><p><strong>The bills are slow. The deaths are fast.</strong></p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>Every crash is preventable.</strong> Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call Council Member Brannan. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand action, not condolence. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Officers, following new NYPD pursuit rules, did not chase but instead set a roadblock. According to NYPD Chief John Chell, 'We didn't pursue the vehicle, we strategically radioed ahead to shut down traffic.' The driver, Jumaane Wright, swerved toward officers, nearly striking a lieutenant, who fired a single shot. Wright crashed a mile later and died at the hospital.

The article quotes prosecutors: Yarimi told police, 'the devil is in my eyes' and 'people are out to get me.' Police say Yarimi was speeding, struck a for-hire car, then hit the family as they crossed the street. Yarimi faces charges including manslaughter, assault, and reckless driving. Judge Jevet Johnson ordered her held without bail and kept her license suspended.

Police say Yarimi had over 99 traffic violations, including 21 for speeding and five for red-light running. Her license was suspended, yet she continued to drive. Advocates point to the lack of speed-limiting devices on vehicles with repeated violations, a measure pending in Albany. Ben Furnas of Transportation Alternatives said, "If Albany had passed this bill when it was first introduced, this vehicle would already have been speed limited and this crash would never have happened." The crash has renewed calls for urgent policy action to protect vulnerable road users.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
