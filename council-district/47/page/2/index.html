Ninety-five years old. Struck by an SUV making a left turn. He died at the intersection, blood pooling on cold pavement. In the last twelve months, <strong>five people have died</strong> in District 47. <strong>689 more were injured</strong>. Two suffered injuries so grave they may never walk the same. One was a child. One was old enough to remember the war. The numbers do not stop. <strong>Over 1,100 crashes</strong> in a single year. Each one a life changed, a family broken. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=the-record-of-leadership>The Record of Leadership</h3><p>Council Member Justin Brannan has stood for some safety bills. He voted to end jaywalking enforcement, letting people cross where they need to without fear of tickets. He co-sponsored laws for safer crossings, greenways, and school zones. He called the school zone safety law a &ldquo;no-brainer,&rdquo; saying, <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/03/16/new-law-may-make-school-zones-safer-but-why-does-dot-act-so-slowly-pols-ask/>&ldquo;Some of our biggest victories have been getting a traffic signal installed near a busy intersection near a school – that shouldn&rsquo;t be some huge colossal victory.&rdquo;</a> But the victories are too few. The deaths keep coming. On Fourth Avenue, activists <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/02/26/activists-renew-push-for-redesign-of-fourth-ave-in-bay-ridge>begged for a safer street</a>. Brannan was once a supporter. Now, as his term ends, he is silent. The redesign stalls. The danger remains.</p><h3 id=the-machines-that-kill>The Machines That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and sedans</strong> do most of the damage. In three years, SUVs killed four pedestrians here. Trucks and buses killed one. Bikes, mopeds, and motorcycles left bodies too, but the steel and speed of cars do most of the work. The city installs cameras and lowers speed limits, but the blood does not dry. The city passes laws. The city waits.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every crash is preventable. Every death is a choice made by those in power. Call Brannan. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand daylight at every crosswalk. Demand the Fourth Avenue redesign. Demand action before another name becomes a number. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The goal is simple: safer steps.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0875-2024 sits in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Introduced May 16, 2024, it commands the Department of Transportation to install pedestrian lighting on at least 25 step streets each year. The bill’s matter title reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring the installation of pedestrian lighting on step streets.' Prime sponsor Joann Ariola leads, joined by Council Members Hanks, Ayala, Salaam, Brooks-Powers, Banks, Restler, Brannan, Ung, Gutiérrez, Louis, Hudson, Schulman, Ossé, Krishnan, Nurse, Moya, and Marmorato. Step streets are public staircases linking streets at different heights. The bill aims to ensure these stairs are well-lit, reducing risk for walkers. Once all step streets are lit, the mandate ends. The measure targets a clear hazard: darkness on city stairs.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report states the sedan 'slammed into the back of a parked Toyota.' The front end of the sedan folded in, trapping the driver inside. The driver was not wearing a seatbelt, as noted in the narrative. The crash resulted in the apparent death of the driver, who 'never got out.' The police report lists the contributing factor as 'Unspecified,' and no driver errors are explicitly cited in the available data. The parked Toyota was unoccupied at the time of the collision. The report does not mention any actions by other road users or any additional contributing factors.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to hazardous obstruction by vehicles and civilian complaints to the department of transportation for hazardous obstruction violations," creates a new civil penalty for vehicles blocking bike lanes, bus lanes, sidewalks, crosswalks, or hydrants within 2,640 feet of a school. The penalty is $175 per violation. The Department of Transportation must launch a civilian reporting program. If DOT prosecutes a case using civilian evidence, the complainant gets 25% of the proceeds. Council Member Carlina Rivera leads as primary sponsor, joined by Restler, Joseph, Menin, Nurse, Hudson, Brannan, Farías, Brewer, Salaam, Hanif, Avilés, Won, Bottcher, Krishnan, Gutiérrez, Marte, and the Brooklyn Borough President. The bill aims to keep streets clear for vulnerable road users, especially near schools.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Members Althea V. Stevens (primary sponsor), James F. Gennaro, Justin L. Brannan, Gale A. Brewer, and Sandra Ung back the measure. The bill would raise fines for anyone caught riding a bike, e-bike, or scooter on sidewalks. Supporters say higher penalties will curb sidewalk riding and protect pedestrians. The bill awaits further action in committee.

The driver, age 72, swerved around a car stopped at a red light and made an illegal turn, hitting Chen, who became trapped under the truck. Despite the driver’s long record of school zone speed camera violations, police did not arrest or charge him. Council Member Justin Brannan responded, saying, 'The answer will not bring our neighbor back, but they absolutely matter, especially after learning this driver has [so many] school zone speed camera violations!' City records show speed camera tickets do not count against a driver’s record, so licenses are not suspended or revoked. All tickets were paid, preventing booting or towing. The city’s enforcement system left a dangerous driver on the road.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
