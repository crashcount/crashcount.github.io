He voted to legalize jaywalking, shifting the burden off pedestrians (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>). He called a school zone traffic law a &ldquo;no-brainer,&rdquo; saying, &ldquo;Some of our biggest victories have been getting a traffic signal installed near a busy intersection near a school – that shouldn&rsquo;t be some huge colossal victory&rdquo; (<a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/03/16/new-law-may-make-school-zones-safer-but-why-does-dot-act-so-slowly-pols-ask/>said Brannan</a>).</p><p>But the pace is slow.

Brooklyn leads the city in pedestrian fatalities, with 34% of deaths citywide. The crash site has seen multiple injuries since 2018.

Brewer emphasized, 'I don't hear people calling me up, saying, I need a charging station for my electric car.' Advocates Jackson Chabot and Samir Lavingia argued that curbside EV chargers for cars would 'lock in' car use and block future bike lanes or outdoor dining. Eric McClure of StreetsPAC warned against re-privatizing the curb for car owners. Both Chabot and Lavingia backed Council Member Justin Brannan's bill to require EV-ready parking in garages. Despite city plans, no e-bike charging stations have been installed yet. The hearing spotlighted the urgent need to prioritize vulnerable road users over private cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The driver stayed. No charges. A vigil drew family, officials, and anger. Fruchter’s wife was killed by a reckless driver in 1997. Grief, outrage, no justice.</p><p class=mb3>On January 4, 2023, Norman Fruchter was struck and killed by a reversing driver at 68th Street and Bliss Terrace in Council District 47. The intersection lacked a pedestrian crosswalk. Council Member Justin Brannan attended the vigil and tweeted, 'Confronting traffic violence also means taking personal responsibility [and] safe driving habits. It will take all of us.' The driver remained at the scene but faced no charges. Fruchter’s son Lev condemned the New York Automobile Insurance Plan for letting dangerous drivers stay insured. Community leaders, including NYC Comptroller Brad Lander and State Senator Andrew Gounardes, joined in mourning and frustration. Fruchter’s wife Rachel was also killed by a reckless driver in 1997, a tragedy that helped spark Vision Zero. Nearly three decades later, traffic laws remain weak. No systemic change. Vulnerable road users still pay the price.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The mayor returned it unsigned.</p><p class=mb3>Int 0291-2022, now Local Law 115 of 2022, was enacted by the City Council on November 27, 2022. The bill came through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, first introduced April 28, 2022. The law's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to a citywide greenway plan.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors including Rivera, Hudson, and others. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor on October 27, 2022. The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law. The measure compels the city to plan and maintain safe routes for non-drivers, with regular public reporting and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
