In the last year, <strong>five people died</strong> and <strong>689 were injured</strong> in traffic crashes. One was a 22-year-old moped rider, Joel Mota, killed at 67th Street and Third Avenue. He lived half a mile from the crash. His passenger left with broken bones. The driver who hit them was drunk and unlicensed. Police said, &ldquo;Moreno was driving west on 67th Street while Mota was driving south on Third Avenue, and he hit her passenger-side door&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/woman-charged-with-driving-while-intoxicated-without-license-in-fatal-brooklyn-crash>Gothamist</a>.</p><p>A family lost a son. A brother <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/06/22/moped-rider-dies-in-crash-with-drunk-unlicensed-driver-in-brooklyn/>remembered him</a>: &ldquo;He was a hardworking man. He had a lot of love for his family. He was always passionate about the things that he did.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=patterns-in-blood-and-steel>Patterns in Blood and Steel</h2><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> In three years, they killed four people and injured over 300 pedestrians. Trucks and buses killed one. Motorcycles and mopeds left a trail of injuries. The old, the young, the working—no one is spared. A 95-year-old woman died crossing 24th Avenue. A 17-year-old was killed on the Belt Parkway. The numbers do not lie. The bodies pile up.</p><h2 id=what-has-brannan-done>What Has Brannan Done?</h2><p>Council Member Justin Brannan has backed laws to curb repeat speeders, ban parking near crosswalks, and legalize jaywalking to end victim-blaming. He co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act and pushed for more school zone safety. He called the school zone law a &ldquo;no-brainer,&rdquo; <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/03/16/new-law-may-make-school-zones-safer-but-why-does-dot-act-so-slowly-pols-ask/>saying</a>, &ldquo;Some of our biggest victories have been getting a traffic signal installed near a busy intersection near a school – that shouldn&rsquo;t be some huge colossal victory.&rdquo;</p><p>But the pace is slow. Promises stack up. The dead do not wait.</p><h2 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Brannan. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand action on repeat speeders. Join <a href=https://www.transalt.org>Transportation Alternatives</a> and <a href=https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org>Families for Safe Streets</a>. Do not let another family grieve alone. The street will not change itself. <strong>Act now.</strong></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The session, led by Council Member Gale Brewer, focused on the matter: 'Charging Ahead? The City Needs Plugs for E-Bikes, Not Cars.' Brewer emphasized, 'I don't hear people calling me up, saying, I need a charging station for my electric car.' Advocates Jackson Chabot and Samir Lavingia argued that curbside EV chargers for cars would 'lock in' car use and block future bike lanes or outdoor dining. Eric McClure of StreetsPAC warned against re-privatizing the curb for car owners. Both Chabot and Lavingia backed Council Member Justin Brannan's bill to require EV-ready parking in garages. Despite city plans, no e-bike charging stations have been installed yet. The hearing spotlighted the urgent need to prioritize vulnerable road users over private cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation is designing a capital project for the stretch from 65th to 77th streets, after years of resident complaints about potholes, cracked pavement, and faded crosswalks. The project, described as bringing 'a full suite of safety upgrades and fully repair[ing] the roadbed,' will include concrete curb extensions, pedestrian islands, raised crosswalks, new crosswalks, and traffic signals. Brannan, who advocated for the funding, said, 'Why is the city allowing this to happen on New Utrecht Avenue?' and pushed for an earlier construction start. The area saw 69 crashes and 80 injuries in five years, underscoring the urgent need for safer streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law.

The car had received at least 12 school-zone speeding tickets since June 21, but authorities failed to intervene until this incident. Council Member Justin Brannan reported the arrest, saying, "It seems the various systems currently in place to deter this type of behavior have failed here." Brannan and Queens DA Melinda Katz both criticized the current penalties, calling them too weak to deter dangerous drivers. Katz said, "There is a strong need for tougher penalties for those who choose to use our city streets as raceways." The article notes that only after 15 camera-issued speeding tickets in a year must drivers take a safety course, and few cars are seized under the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program. Community complaints led to the arrest, but most reckless drivers still evade real consequences.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
