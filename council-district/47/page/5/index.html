Nearly 700 injured.</strong> That is the cost of traffic violence in District 47 in the last year alone (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). More than 1 in 10 of those hurt were under 18. The dead include a 95-year-old woman, a 74-year-old man, and a teenager. Each one had a name. Each one had a place to be. None of them made it home.</p><p>Just last week, a van slammed into a tree in Bath Beach. Fourteen people were hurt, most of them adults with special needs, on their way to an adult daycare. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sad because they definitely need a lot of attention more than anyone else. I hope that they&rsquo;re all OK at the end of the day,&rdquo; said a neighbor, watching the aftermath (<a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/transport-van-crashes-tree-bath-beach-brooklyn-injuring-14-people/16903098/>ABC7</a>).</p><h3 id=the-vehicles-that-kill>The Vehicles That Kill</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do most of the damage.</strong> In the last three years, they killed four people and injured over 300 on foot. Trucks and buses killed one, bikes hurt sixteen. Motorcycles and mopeds left ten more injured. The numbers are cold, but the pain is not. A sedan turns left, a body falls. A truck makes a wide swing, a life ends. The street does not care who you are.</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-hasnt>What Has Been Done—And What Hasn’t</h3><p>Council Member Justin Brannan has backed bills to daylight intersections, curb repeat speeders, and boost penalties for blocked plates. He voted to legalize jaywalking, shifting blame off pedestrians and onto drivers where it belongs (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>). He co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, pushing for lower speed limits and more rights for crash victims. But on the ground, the carnage continues. Advocates called for a redesign of Fourth Avenue in Bay Ridge. Brannan once supported it, now he is <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/02/26/activists-renew-push-for-redesign-of-fourth-ave-in-bay-ridge>silent</a>. The avenue remains a speedway.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay means another family shattered.</strong> Call Council Member Brannan. Demand a Fourth Avenue redesign. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand action before another child’s name is added to the list. The dead cannot speak. You can. <a href=/take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
