Nearly 700 injured in the last year.</strong> Children, elders, riders, walkers. The dead are not nameless. A 74-year-old man, crushed at Bay Ridge Avenue and Ridge Boulevard. A 95-year-old woman, struck at Cropsey and 24th. A teenager, ejected from his motorcycle on the Belt Parkway. Each one a life ended, a family broken. The street stays hungry.</p><p><strong>Just this week, fourteen people were hurt when a transport van slammed into a tree in Bath Beach.</strong> The van carried adults with special needs. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sad because they definitely need a lot of attention more than anyone else. I hope that they&rsquo;re all OK at the end of the day,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/transport-van-crashes-tree-bath-beach-brooklyn-injuring-14-people/16903098/>said a witness</a>. The city moves on. The scars remain.</p><h3 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price</h3><p><strong>SUVs and cars do the most harm.</strong> In three years, they killed four and injured over 300 people on foot. Trucks and buses killed one, injured dozens. Motorcycles and mopeds, too, leave bodies in their wake. The most vulnerable—children, elders, people with disabilities—pay the highest price. The numbers are not just numbers. They are the cost of inaction.</p><h3 id=what-has-brannan-done>What Has Brannan Done?</h3><p>Council Member Justin Brannan has signed on to bills that matter. He co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, which targets reckless driving and demands safer design. He voted to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>legalize jaywalking</a>, ending a law that punished the vulnerable and let drivers off easy. He backed a <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/03/16/new-law-may-make-school-zones-safer-but-why-does-dot-act-so-slowly-pols-ask/>school zone safety law</a> and called it a &ldquo;no-brainer,&rdquo; saying, &ldquo;Some of our biggest victories have been getting a traffic signal installed near a busy intersection near a school – that shouldn&rsquo;t be some huge colossal victory.&rdquo; But the pace is slow. Promises stack up. The street keeps taking.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Every day of delay means more blood on the road.</strong> Call Brannan. Call the Mayor. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand the city redesigns Fourth Avenue and every deadly crossing. Do not wait for another name on the list. <strong>Act now.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The session, led by Council Member Gale Brewer, focused on the matter: 'Charging Ahead? The City Needs Plugs for E-Bikes, Not Cars.' Brewer emphasized, 'I don't hear people calling me up, saying, I need a charging station for my electric car.' Advocates Jackson Chabot and Samir Lavingia argued that curbside EV chargers for cars would 'lock in' car use and block future bike lanes or outdoor dining. Eric McClure of StreetsPAC warned against re-privatizing the curb for car owners. Both Chabot and Lavingia backed Council Member Justin Brannan's bill to require EV-ready parking in garages. Despite city plans, no e-bike charging stations have been installed yet. The hearing spotlighted the urgent need to prioritize vulnerable road users over private cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The Department of Transportation is designing a capital project for the stretch from 65th to 77th streets, after years of resident complaints about potholes, cracked pavement, and faded crosswalks. The project, described as bringing 'a full suite of safety upgrades and fully repair[ing] the roadbed,' will include concrete curb extensions, pedestrian islands, raised crosswalks, new crosswalks, and traffic signals. Brannan, who advocated for the funding, said, 'Why is the city allowing this to happen on New Utrecht Avenue?' and pushed for an earlier construction start. The area saw 69 crashes and 80 injuries in five years, underscoring the urgent need for safer streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors including Rivera, Hudson, and others. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor on October 27, 2022. The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law.

The car had received at least 12 school-zone speeding tickets since June 21, but authorities failed to intervene until this incident. Council Member Justin Brannan reported the arrest, saying, "It seems the various systems currently in place to deter this type of behavior have failed here." Brannan and Queens DA Melinda Katz both criticized the current penalties, calling them too weak to deter dangerous drivers. Katz said, "There is a strong need for tougher penalties for those who choose to use our city streets as raceways." The article notes that only after 15 camera-issued speeding tickets in a year must drivers take a safety course, and few cars are seized under the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program. Community complaints led to the arrest, but most reckless drivers still evade real consequences.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
