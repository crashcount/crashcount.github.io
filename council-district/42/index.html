Four thousand one hundred eleven are hurt. In the last twelve months alone, District 42 saw seven deaths and 1,261 injuries from crashes. Eleven were left with injuries so grave they may never walk the same. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. The numbers do not bleed, but the streets do.</p><p>Imani Vance, 26, died in the front seat of a Mercedes. The driver, unlicensed, ran a stop sign and crashed into a school bus. He left her behind and fled. The District Attorney called it &ldquo;a shocking disregard for human life and safety, made worse by his attempt to flee the scene instead of helping the victim&rdquo; (<a href=https://gothamist.com/news/brooklyn-driver-indicted-accused-of-deadly-hit-and-run-school-bus-crash>Gothamist</a>).</p><p>A 57-year-old woman was killed crossing with the signal. A 30-year-old man died at an intersection. A 58-year-old woman was struck and killed on Pennsylvania Avenue. The pattern is the same: speed, inattention, failure to yield. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><p>A Jeep, chased by police, crashed through a fence and landed on the L train tracks. The driver walked away in cuffs. The train did not run that night (<a href=https://www.amny.com/news/driver-fleeing-cops-brooklyn-subway-station/>The Brooklyn Paper</a>).</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h3><p>Council Member Chris Banks has voted for some safety bills. He backed the <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>end of jaywalking enforcement</a>, a move that stops blaming pedestrians for their own deaths. He co-sponsored bills for more school signs, speed humps, and tactile paving. He joined a push to <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>require speed-limiting tech for repeat offenders</a>.</p><p>But when the Council debated banning parking at corners to save lives, Banks stood with the cars. He <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/22/dot-still-opposes-push-to-ban-corner-parking>opposed the daylighting bill</a>, siding with parking over clear sightlines for children and elders at the curb. The city’s own data shows that most deaths come from drivers who do not see, or do not care.</p><h3 id=what-next-the-fight-is-not-over>What Next: The Fight Is Not Over</h3><p>Speed kills. Most deaths in District 42 are caused by cars and SUVs. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has the power to daylight every corner. It has the power to put people before parking. But power means nothing if it is not used.</p><p>Call Chris Banks. Call the Mayor. Demand safer speeds, daylighted corners, and streets for people, not cars. Every day of delay is another day of loss. The dead do not get to call back.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Officers from the 75th Precinct gave chase. The driver lost control near East 105th Street and Farragut Road, smashing through a fence and landing the vehicle on the Manhattan-bound L train tracks. Eyewitnesses described the chaos: 'Next thing I know, he was into the fence. Absolutely crazy.' The crash left the Jeep mangled and caused overnight subway delays. Police took the uninjured driver into custody at the scene. Charges are pending. The incident highlights the risks of high-speed chases and the vulnerability of transit infrastructure to reckless driving.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The SUV was described as 'demolished' at the point of impact. The driver was not wearing a seatbelt, but the police report attributes the crash primarily to excessive speed and hazardous road conditions. No other vehicles or road users were involved. The narrative underscores the violence of the crash and the systemic danger posed by high speeds, especially under adverse conditions.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

It was introduced January 8, 2025, passed March 15, and became Local Law 28 of 2025. The bill's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to installing pavement markings.' Council Member Farah N. Louis led as primary sponsor, joined by Brannan, Schulman, Banks, Farías, Carr, and Ariola. The law orders DOT to install pavement or temporary markings within five business days after any street resurfacing. If DOT misses the deadline, it must post notices explaining the delay and set a new timeline. DOT must also report yearly on compliance. The law responds to a simple fact: missing markings mean danger for people on foot and bike. With this law, the city moves to close that deadly gap.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The vehicle's pre-crash action is listed as 'Backing,' and the point of impact was the 'Center Back End.'
