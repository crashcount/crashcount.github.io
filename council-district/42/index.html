Injured: 4,728. Crashes: 7,477. Pedestrians bear the worst of it: 11 deaths, 685 hurt. SUVs and cars drive most of the harm, with 11 pedestrian deaths tied to them. Heavy vehicles add more weight to the toll. These are the numbers for Council District 42.</p><h3 id=where-the-street-breaks-you>Where the street breaks you</h3><p>Belt Parkway shows two deaths and 303 injuries. Drivers hit hard there. So does <a href=#>Pennsylvania Avenue</a> with two deaths and 158 injuries, and <a href=#>Linden Boulevard</a> with 375 injuries. One corner at 1000 Sutter Ave logged eight serious injuries. These are the repeat sites listed in city data.</p><p>The worst hours run late and after dark. Death spikes at 4 AM, 6–8 PM, and 9 PM–11 PM. The injuries never stop.</p><p>Contributing factors the city records most often: “other,” then inattention, unsafe speed, and failure to yield. The blanks and the knowns point the same way.</p><h3 id=names-turned-into-case-numbers>Names turned into case numbers</h3><p>Jan 25, 2025, Church Ave at Kings Hwy. A 30‑year‑old man, a pedestrian, was struck by a Honda sedan. Unsafe speed cited. He died. The city logged him as “Crossing Against Signal.” Only one person was dead, and it was not the driver. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open data</a> records the case as CrashID 4788144.</p><p>Jul 13, 2025, about 12:30 AM, near 395 Gateway Dr. A 21‑year‑old woman, walking off‑intersection. The car was a 2023 Genesis sedan. Police coded distraction and unsafe speed. She died there. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open data</a> lists CrashID 4827641.</p><p>Feb 16, 2025, before dawn on the Belt. A 41‑year‑old driver in a 2024 BMW SUV. Unsafe speed and a slick road. He was ejected. He died. The parkway kept moving. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4793436</a>.</p><p>Feb 27, 2025, Van Sinderen at Blake. A 26‑year‑old front passenger died after impact among a sedan, a bus, and a box truck. The sedan driver was unlicensed. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4795300</a>.</p><h3 id=the-clock-doesnt-stop>The clock doesn’t stop</h3><p>Hour by hour the harm piles up. The 4 PM hour shows nine serious injuries, the day’s peak. Deaths stack at 1 AM, 4 AM, 6–8 PM, and 9 PM–11 PM. Night and rush both bleed.</p><p>Pedestrians here are most often hit by sedans and SUVs. The city’s roll‑up ties 632 pedestrian cases to cars and SUVs, and 38 to trucks and buses. Weight meets speed. Bone loses.</p><h3 id=officials-move-but-slow>Officials move, but slow</h3><p>The Council Member for this district voted yes on a bill to tow abandoned cars within 72 hours. The law aims to clear blind spots and blocked crosswalks. It passed on Jun 30, 2025. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Council file Int 0857-2024</a>.</p><p>The same member co‑sponsored faster pavement markings in January and voted it through in February. Fresh paint can mark crossings and lanes sooner. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1160-2025</a>.</p><p>He also backed tougher plate enforcement to catch ghost cars. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1252-2025</a>.</p><p>But the crashes keep coming.</p><h3 id=fix-the-street-in-front-of-you>Fix the street in front of you</h3><p>Start at the repeat sites: Belt Parkway and Pennsylvania Ave. Harden turns and raise crossings at Linden Blvd. Daylight 1000 Sutter Ave and paint it bright. Install LPIs and give walkers the first step. Use curbs and posts, not paint alone. Target speed and distraction in the fatal hours.</p><h3 id=citywide-brakes-now>Citywide brakes, now</h3><p>Speed kills more surely than anything else. A 20 MPH city default would cut bodies from the road. New York now has the power to drop speeds. The city hasn’t used it. Advocates are asking you to push. See our call: <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</p><p>The repeat offenders are a small group with an outsize toll. The state’s proposed Stop Super Speeders Act would force known speeders to use in‑car speed limiters. The data show repeat tickets link to higher risk. The bill sits in Albany. Call anyway.

The fight over safety on this deadly stretch continues in court.</p><p class=mb3>Gothamist reported on July 15, 2025, that a state appellate judge blocked Mayor Adams from removing the protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue. The lane, installed after high crash rates and pedestrian deaths, was set for removal until the court's emergency order. The Department of Transportation admitted, "The City risks legal liability for knowingly reducing safety on a Vision Zero priority corridor." Advocates and families appealed, citing the lane’s role in protecting vulnerable road users. The legal battle highlights the tension between city policy, resident concerns, and the need for proven safety infrastructure.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill, titled 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code...exempting ambulettes from certain bus lane restrictions and allowing them to double park to assist passengers,' would let ambulettes drive, stop, and double-park in bus lanes to help passengers. Council Member Julie Menin sponsors, joined by Linda Lee, Frank Morano, Eric Dinowitz, Lynn C. Schulman, Kamillah Hanks, Carlina Rivera, and Chris Banks. Allowing more vehicles to double-park and block bus lanes increases risk for pedestrians and cyclists at the curb.
