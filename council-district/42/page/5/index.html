Injured: 4,728. Crashes: 7,477. Pedestrians bear the worst of it: 11 deaths, 685 hurt. SUVs and cars drive most of the harm, with 11 pedestrian deaths tied to them. Heavy vehicles add more weight to the toll. These are the numbers for Council District 42.</p><h3 id=where-the-street-breaks-you>Where the street breaks you</h3><p>Belt Parkway shows two deaths and 303 injuries. Drivers hit hard there. So does <a href=#>Pennsylvania Avenue</a> with two deaths and 158 injuries, and <a href=#>Linden Boulevard</a> with 375 injuries. One corner at 1000 Sutter Ave logged eight serious injuries. These are the repeat sites listed in city data.</p><p>The worst hours run late and after dark. Death spikes at 4 AM, 6–8 PM, and 9 PM–11 PM. The injuries never stop.</p><p>Contributing factors the city records most often: “other,” then inattention, unsafe speed, and failure to yield. The blanks and the knowns point the same way.</p><h3 id=names-turned-into-case-numbers>Names turned into case numbers</h3><p>Jan 25, 2025, Church Ave at Kings Hwy. A 30‑year‑old man, a pedestrian, was struck by a Honda sedan. Unsafe speed cited. He died. The city logged him as “Crossing Against Signal.” Only one person was dead, and it was not the driver. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open data</a> records the case as CrashID 4788144.</p><p>Jul 13, 2025, about 12:30 AM, near 395 Gateway Dr. A 21‑year‑old woman, walking off‑intersection. The car was a 2023 Genesis sedan. Police coded distraction and unsafe speed. She died there. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open data</a> lists CrashID 4827641.</p><p>Feb 16, 2025, before dawn on the Belt. A 41‑year‑old driver in a 2024 BMW SUV. Unsafe speed and a slick road. He was ejected. He died. The parkway kept moving. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4793436</a>.</p><p>Feb 27, 2025, Van Sinderen at Blake. A 26‑year‑old front passenger died after impact among a sedan, a bus, and a box truck.

The 4 PM hour shows nine serious injuries, the day’s peak. Deaths stack at 1 AM, 4 AM, 6–8 PM, and 9 PM–11 PM. Night and rush both bleed.</p><p>Pedestrians here are most often hit by sedans and SUVs. The city’s roll‑up ties 632 pedestrian cases to cars and SUVs, and 38 to trucks and buses. Weight meets speed. Bone loses.</p><h3 id=officials-move-but-slow>Officials move, but slow</h3><p>The Council Member for this district voted yes on a bill to tow abandoned cars within 72 hours. The law aims to clear blind spots and blocked crosswalks. It passed on Jun 30, 2025. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Council file Int 0857-2024</a>.</p><p>The same member co‑sponsored faster pavement markings in January and voted it through in February. Fresh paint can mark crossings and lanes sooner. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1160-2025</a>.</p><p>He also backed tougher plate enforcement to catch ghost cars. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1252-2025</a>.</p><p>But the crashes keep coming.</p><h3 id=fix-the-street-in-front-of-you>Fix the street in front of you</h3><p>Start at the repeat sites: Belt Parkway and Pennsylvania Ave. Harden turns and raise crossings at Linden Blvd. Daylight 1000 Sutter Ave and paint it bright. Install LPIs and give walkers the first step. Use curbs and posts, not paint alone. Target speed and distraction in the fatal hours.</p><h3 id=citywide-brakes-now>Citywide brakes, now</h3><p>Speed kills more surely than anything else. A 20 MPH city default would cut bodies from the road. New York now has the power to drop speeds. The city hasn’t used it. Advocates are asking you to push.

The crash occurred at 21:31, leaving the 40-year-old Jeep driver with severe back injuries and 'crush injuries,' though he remained conscious and was held by his seatbelt. The police report explicitly lists 'Turning Improperly' as the contributing factor, highlighting a critical driver error. The Tesla was unoccupied and parked at the time of impact, according to the data. No evidence in the police report suggests any victim behavior contributed to the crash. The scene was described as quiet, but the consequences for the driver were grave.

The matter title reads: 'Annual study to identify non-operational schools and the subsequent removal of speed cameras from eliminated school speed zones.' If passed, the law would strip cameras from streets where schools once stood, erasing a layer of protection for people on foot and bike.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill reads: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring the installation of pedestrian lighting on step streets.' Prime sponsor Joann Ariola, joined by sixteen co-sponsors, pushes for at least 25 step streets to be lit each year until all are covered. Step streets are open-air staircases linking streets at different heights. The bill aims to strip darkness from these paths, making them safer for people on foot. No safety analyst note was provided.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Introduced May 16, 2024, by Council Members Ariola (primary), Hanks, Hudson, Louis, Mealy, and Banks, the bill orders DOT to launch a pilot abatement program for unsafe pedal-assist bicycle operators. The bill summary states: 'Pedal-assist bicycle operators who accrue 3 or more moving violations under city law would be required to take a safe pedal-assist bicycle operation course offered by DOT.' Noncompliance means bike impoundment. DOT must report on course completions, impounds, and program effectiveness. The pilot sunsets after three years. The bill aims to curb reckless riding through strict enforcement.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>
