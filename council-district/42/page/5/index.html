Fourteen left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same.</strong> In the last twelve months, 1,338 people have been hurt in 1,950 crashes. Children, elders, workers—no one is spared. The dead do not get to speak. The living are left to count the cost.</p><p>Just this winter, a woman crossing Pennsylvania Avenue with the light was struck and killed by an SUV. The crash report lists the cause: <strong>&ldquo;Failure to Yield Right-of-Way&rdquo; and &ldquo;Driver Inattention/Distraction&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The driver kept their license. The woman lost her life.</p><p>A few weeks later, a 26-year-old woman died as a passenger when a sedan slammed into a bus and a parked truck on Blake Avenue. The crash report is blunt: &ldquo;Apparent Death.&rdquo; No warning. No time to say goodbye.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>The pain does not end at the curb. It spreads through families and neighborhoods. <strong>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating. It&rsquo;s affecting everyone in our family, especially (Ruiz&rsquo;s) mom. Maddy was her only daughter,&rdquo;</strong> <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>said a relative</a> after a reckless driver killed a young woman in a parking lot, her nephews injured beside her.</p><p>The city calls these &ldquo;accidents.&rdquo; But the pattern is clear. <strong>Cars and SUVs are the main killers.</strong> Out of all pedestrian injuries and deaths, sedans and SUVs are responsible for the vast majority. Trucks, buses, and motorcycles add to the toll. Bikes are a fraction, but the deadliest threat rolls on four wheels.</p><h3 id=what-has-chris-banks-done>What Has Chris Banks Done?</h3><p>Council Member Chris Banks has voted for and co-sponsored bills to clear abandoned vehicles from streets, speed up pavement markings, and require discounted bike share for seniors. He backed laws to boost transparency and accountability for street safety projects (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>). He co-sponsored a bill to require speed humps near parks. These are steps. But the blood on the street says it is not enough.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p><strong>Every day, another crash. Every week, another family broken.</strong> Call Council Member Chris Banks. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people walking and biking. <strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, heard by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, passed on September 26, 2024, and became law on October 26, 2024. Its title: “A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way.” Sponsored by Council Member Tiffany Cabán and co-sponsored by Narcisse, Won, Hanif, Hudson, and Restler, the law lets pedestrians cross streets anywhere, even against signals. No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities. The law removes a tool police used to target walkers. It shifts blame from people on foot to the system and those behind the wheel.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The report details that the e-bike’s front end crumpled on impact, and the pedestrian suffered severe lacerations to her lower leg, remaining conscious at the scene. The police cite 'Reaction to Uninvolved Vehicle' and 'Driver Inexperience' as contributing factors. The e-bike operator was unlicensed and failed to avoid the pedestrian, swerving too late. The report notes the pedestrian was crossing outside the crosswalk, but this is listed after the driver’s errors. The crash left blood on the pavement and a young woman injured, underscoring the dangers posed by unlicensed and inexperienced vehicle operators.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

No evidence in the report suggests any contributing behavior by the victim. The impact occurred away from an intersection, with the SUV's center front end colliding with the pedestrian.
