EMS pronounced the victim dead at the scene. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/10/two-people-killed-by-mta-trains-one-hour-apart-in-brooklyn-and-manhattan/>NY Daily News</a>.</p><h3 id=last-month-a-young-woman-on-gateway-drive>Last month: A young woman on Gateway Drive</h3><p>On 2025-07-13, a 21-year-old woman was struck and killed near 395 Gateway Drive after midnight. NYC Open Data lists driver inattention/distraction and unsafe speed as contributing factors. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data crash record</a>.</p><h3 id=the-pattern-is-the-point>The pattern is the point</h3><p>These are not isolated events. Crashes concentrate on wide, fast roads and during nighttime hours. Top local hotspots include Belt Parkway and Pennsylvania Avenue, with Linden Boulevard also showing heavy injury counts. Small-area data repeatedly names inattention/distraction and unsafe speed as leading contributing factors. Cars and SUVs account for the majority of pedestrian harms in the district.</p><p>The remedies are straightforward and local: install leading pedestrian intervals (LPIs) and daylighting at dangerous intersections on Linden Boulevard and Pennsylvania Avenue; harden turning radii and add raised crossings on approaches to Belt Parkway; improve lighting and increase targeted night enforcement where crash rates peak; and prioritize speed-camera enforcement and other automated tools in repeat-hotspot corridors.</p><h3 id=what-chris-banks-has-done>What Chris Banks has done</h3><p>Council Member Chris Banks voted in favor of Int 0857-2024, the local law to speed removal of abandoned vehicles, which passed the Council on 2025-06-30. That law aims to clear sightline hazards that can endanger pedestrians and cyclists. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 0857-2024</a>.</p><p>He is also a co-sponsor of Int 1347-2025, a bill in committee focused on enforcing violations against unlicensed commuter vans. The measure remains under review. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Int 1347-2025</a>.</p><p>Enforcement matters, but design and speed management prevent crashes before they happen.</p><h3 id=citywide-fixes-that-matter-here>Citywide fixes that matter here</h3><p>Local data in District 42 points to two citywide policy priorities: lower NYC’s default speed limit on city streets, and require intelligent speed‑assistance devices (speed limiters) for habitual speeders. These steps reduce kinetic violence on residential and arterial streets and give DOT the policy tools to calm faster corridors across neighborhoods.</p><h3 id=what-must-happen-now>What must happen now</h3><p>This district needs targeted street redesigns and stronger speed management now: LPIs and daylighting on Linden and Pennsylvania; hardened turns and raised crossings on Belt Parkway approaches; better night lighting and targeted enforcement; and continued investment in automated speed enforcement at repeat‑hotspot locations.</p><p>Call Council Member Chris Banks at 718-649-9495 or email <a href=mailto:District42@council.nyc.gov>District42@council.nyc.gov</a>.

The report states the sedan's front passenger, a 26-year-old woman, suffered fatal head injuries and died at the scene. The sedan's driver was unlicensed, as documented in the official vehicle records. The police report attributes the primary contributing factor to 'Unsafe Speed.' The narrative describes the sedan as 'slammed into a bus, then a parked box truck,' underscoring the violent sequence. No contributing factors related to the victim's behavior are cited in the report. The focus remains on the unlicensed driver’s excessive speed and the systemic danger posed by unqualified motorists operating vehicles on city streets.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
