Thirty-six left with serious injuries.</strong> In District 42, the numbers do not lie. From East New York to Starrett City, the streets have become a gauntlet. In the last twelve months alone, seven people died. Over 1,200 were hurt. The youngest victim was a child. The oldest, a grandmother. Most never saw it coming.</p><p>A 26-year-old woman, Imani Vance, was killed when an unlicensed driver ran a stop sign and slammed into a school bus. The driver fled, leaving her to die in the front seat. The District Attorney called it &ldquo;a shocking disregard for human life and safety, made worse by his attempt to flee the scene instead of helping the victim&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/brooklyn-driver-indicted-accused-of-deadly-hit-and-run-school-bus-crash>said Brooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez</a>.</p><p>A pedestrian crossing with the light was struck and killed by an SUV at Pennsylvania and Blake. The driver failed to yield. The street was quiet after, except for the sirens.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h3><p><strong>Council Member Chris Banks has voted for some safety measures.</strong> He backed the law that ended jaywalking enforcement, shifting blame away from pedestrians and toward drivers <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>see vote record</a>. He co-sponsored bills for more speed humps and better lighting near parks and schools. He voted to lower speed limits on Open Streets.</p><p>But when it mattered most, Banks stood in the way. He opposed a bill to ban parking at corners—daylighting—that would have made children and elders more visible at crossings. He cited parking concerns <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/22/dot-still-opposes-push-to-ban-corner-parking>according to Streetsblog NYC</a>. The debate was not about cars. It was about lives. &ldquo;The tragic loss of Imani Vance was allegedly caused by the defendant&rsquo;s reckless decision to ignore a stop sign and drive at excessive speeds,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/brooklyn-driver-indicted-accused-of-deadly-hit-and-run-school-bus-crash>said the DA</a>. The corners remain blind.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Speed and inattention kill.</strong> Cars and SUVs are the main weapons. The city has the tools—lower speed limits, more cameras, safer crossings. But tools unused are as useless as promises unkept.</p><p><strong>Call Chris Banks. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand 20 mph limits on every street. Demand action, not words.</strong></p><p>The dead cannot speak. The living must.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill orders the Commissioner of Transportation, with the Chancellor of New York City Public Schools, to conduct yearly studies to find non-operational schools. The matter title reads: 'Annual study to identify non-operational schools and the subsequent removal of speed cameras from eliminated school speed zones.' Council Members Chris Banks (District 42, primary sponsor) and Kamillah Hanks (District 49, co-sponsor) back the measure. If passed, speed cameras must be removed from zones tied to closed schools. The bill’s plain language summary confirms cameras will be pulled from these areas. No safety analyst has weighed in, but the removal of cameras means less oversight where children and families once crossed. The bill awaits further action.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights.
