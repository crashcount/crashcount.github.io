Police data record severe bleeding and serious injury; the driver was unlicensed and speeding (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=the-count-does-not-stop>The count does not stop</h3><p>Since 2022, this council district has seen <strong>24 people killed</strong> and <strong>6,069 injured</strong> in <strong>9,526 crashes</strong> (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Pedestrians bear much of it: <strong>11 people walking killed</strong> and <strong>896 injured</strong> here in that span (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The danger stacks up late in the day. From 4 PM to 9 PM, this district logged <strong>12 deaths</strong> across those hours (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). Police cite drivers’ failure to yield and unsafe speed among the recurring factors tied to injuries here (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=pennsylvania-avenue-keeps-showing-up>Pennsylvania Avenue keeps showing up</h3><p>Pennsylvania Avenue is a fixture in the crash rolls, with deaths and hundreds of injuries attached to that corridor in this district review. So is Linden Boulevard (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). At Pennsylvania and Blake, a driver failed to yield and killed a 57-year-old woman crossing with the signal on Jan 24, 2025 (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>On Sep 14, 2025 at Pennsylvania and Hegeman, outlets reported the driver was 15; police data list the driver as unlicensed and speeding (<a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/15-year-old-driver-accused-of-striking-pedestrian-in-brooklyn/>CBS New York</a>; <a href=https://www.amny.com/news/brooklyn-police-pursuit-pedestrian-struck-09142025/>amNY</a>; <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). The corner is not an outlier. It is the rule.</p><h3 id=what-the-record-says-needs-fixing>What the record says needs fixing</h3><p>Concrete fixes are known and local. Daylight the corners along Pennsylvania and Linden. Add leading pedestrian intervals and hardened turns at the worst junctions. Target speeding with camera enforcement on the high‑injury stretches and at the evening hours when deaths pile up (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>Citywide tools exist, and repeat speeders drive the harm. Lowering default speeds and stopping habitual speeders are the levers. A citywide 20 MPH limit is on the table, and the proposed Stop Super Speeders Act would force repeat offenders to use in‑car speed limiters (<a href=/take_action/>CrashCount: Take Action</a>).</p><h3 id=who-is-responsible-to-act>Who is responsible to act</h3><p>This is Council District 42, represented by Council Member Chris Banks. In recent votes, he backed faster pavement markings and the rapid removal of derelict vehicles, both tied to safer sightlines and crossings (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>). He also co‑sponsored a crackdown on unlicensed commuter vans (Int 1347‑2025) now in committee (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>).</p><p>At the state level, this district overlaps Assembly District 58 (Monique Chandler‑Waterman) and Senate District 19 (Roxanne Persaud). The next step is clear: pass the repeat‑speeder bill and use the city’s new speed‑setting power, so the person on the corner does not pay with blood (<a href=/take_action/>CrashCount: Take Action</a>).</p><p><strong>Act:</strong> Tell City Hall to set 20 MPH on local streets and Albany to rein in repeat speeders.
