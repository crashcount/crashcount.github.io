In the last twelve months, eight people died in crashes here. Fourteen more suffered serious injuries. The toll is not numbers. It is families torn, bodies broken, futures erased.</p><p>Just days ago, a young woman was killed in a parking lot at Gateway Center. She was sitting on a curb. Her boyfriend lost control while doing donuts. Police charged him with criminally negligent homicide. The court record states he <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>&ldquo;lost control when he was doing donuts with the vehicle&rdquo;</a>. Her family is left with silence and questions. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating. It&rsquo;s affecting everyone in our family, especially (Ruiz&rsquo;s) mom. Maddy was her only daughter,&rdquo;</a> said her sister-in-law.</p><p>Speed kills here, too. In the past year, unsafe speed was a factor in deadly crashes on Pennsylvania Avenue, Church Avenue, and the Belt Parkway. Pedestrians, cyclists, and children are the first to pay. The numbers are blunt: 1,341 injured, 8 dead, 14 seriously hurt in just the last year.</p><h3 id=what-has-council-member-chris-banks-done>What Has Council Member Chris Banks Done?</h3><p>Council Member Chris Banks has voted for and co-sponsored bills to clear abandoned vehicles, speed up pavement markings, and expand bike share discounts for seniors and students. He backed new laws to remove derelict cars within 72 hours and require faster repainting of crosswalks—measures that help, but do not stop the blood. He also co-sponsored a bill to boost plate enforcement, targeting ghost cars and untraceable drivers. These are steps, not solutions.</p><p>But the carnage continues. No bill has yet forced drivers to slow down. No law has made Pennsylvania Avenue safe for a child to cross. The city has the power to lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not used it.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next-demand-more>What Comes Next: Demand More</h3><p>This is not fate. It is policy. Every delay means another family grieves. Call Council Member Banks. Call the Mayor. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for the most vulnerable. Do not wait for another name to be added to the list.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
