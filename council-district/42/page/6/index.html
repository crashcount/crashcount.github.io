Injured: 4,728. Crashes: 7,477. Pedestrians bear the worst of it: 11 deaths, 685 hurt. SUVs and cars drive most of the harm, with 11 pedestrian deaths tied to them. Heavy vehicles add more weight to the toll. These are the numbers for Council District 42.</p><h3 id=where-the-street-breaks-you>Where the street breaks you</h3><p>Belt Parkway shows two deaths and 303 injuries. Drivers hit hard there. So does <a href=#>Pennsylvania Avenue</a> with two deaths and 158 injuries, and <a href=#>Linden Boulevard</a> with 375 injuries. One corner at 1000 Sutter Ave logged eight serious injuries. These are the repeat sites listed in city data.</p><p>The worst hours run late and after dark. Death spikes at 4 AM, 6–8 PM, and 9 PM–11 PM. The injuries never stop.</p><p>Contributing factors the city records most often: “other,” then inattention, unsafe speed, and failure to yield. The blanks and the knowns point the same way.</p><h3 id=names-turned-into-case-numbers>Names turned into case numbers</h3><p>Jan 25, 2025, Church Ave at Kings Hwy. A 30‑year‑old man, a pedestrian, was struck by a Honda sedan. Unsafe speed cited. He died. The city logged him as “Crossing Against Signal.” Only one person was dead, and it was not the driver. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open data</a> records the case as CrashID 4788144.</p><p>Jul 13, 2025, about 12:30 AM, near 395 Gateway Dr. A 21‑year‑old woman, walking off‑intersection. The car was a 2023 Genesis sedan. Police coded distraction and unsafe speed. She died there. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open data</a> lists CrashID 4827641.</p><p>Feb 16, 2025, before dawn on the Belt. A 41‑year‑old driver in a 2024 BMW SUV. Unsafe speed and a slick road. He was ejected. He died. The parkway kept moving. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4793436</a>.</p><p>Feb 27, 2025, Van Sinderen at Blake.

Bone loses.</p><h3 id=officials-move-but-slow>Officials move, but slow</h3><p>The Council Member for this district voted yes on a bill to tow abandoned cars within 72 hours. The law aims to clear blind spots and blocked crosswalks. It passed on Jun 30, 2025. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Council file Int 0857-2024</a>.</p><p>The same member co‑sponsored faster pavement markings in January and voted it through in February.

Install LPIs and give walkers the first step. Use curbs and posts, not paint alone. Target speed and distraction in the fatal hours.</p><h3 id=citywide-brakes-now>Citywide brakes, now</h3><p>Speed kills more surely than anything else. A 20 MPH city default would cut bodies from the road. New York now has the power to drop speeds. The city hasn’t used it. Advocates are asking you to push. See our call: <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</p><p>The repeat offenders are a small group with an outsize toll. The state’s proposed Stop Super Speeders Act would force known speeders to use in‑car speed limiters. The data show repeat tickets link to higher risk. The bill sits in Albany. Call anyway.

Introduced May 16, 2024, by Council Members Ariola (primary), Hanks, Hudson, Louis, Mealy, and Banks, the bill orders DOT to launch a pilot abatement program for unsafe pedal-assist bicycle operators. The bill summary states: 'Pedal-assist bicycle operators who accrue 3 or more moving violations under city law would be required to take a safe pedal-assist bicycle operation course offered by DOT.' Noncompliance means bike impoundment. DOT must report on course completions, impounds, and program effectiveness. The pilot sunsets after three years.
