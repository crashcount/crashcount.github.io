Thirty-six left with serious injuries.</strong> In District 42, the numbers do not lie. From East New York to Starrett City, the streets have become a gauntlet. In the last twelve months alone, seven people died. Over 1,200 were hurt. The youngest victim was a child. The oldest, a grandmother. Most never saw it coming.</p><p>A 26-year-old woman, Imani Vance, was killed when an unlicensed driver ran a stop sign and slammed into a school bus. The driver fled, leaving her to die in the front seat. The District Attorney called it &ldquo;a shocking disregard for human life and safety, made worse by his attempt to flee the scene instead of helping the victim&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/brooklyn-driver-indicted-accused-of-deadly-hit-and-run-school-bus-crash>said Brooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez</a>.</p><p>A pedestrian crossing with the light was struck and killed by an SUV at Pennsylvania and Blake. The driver failed to yield. The street was quiet after, except for the sirens.</p><h3 id=leadership-steps-forward-steps-back>Leadership: Steps Forward, Steps Back</h3><p><strong>Council Member Chris Banks has voted for some safety measures.</strong> He backed the law that ended jaywalking enforcement, shifting blame away from pedestrians and toward drivers <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>see vote record</a>. He co-sponsored bills for more speed humps and better lighting near parks and schools. He voted to lower speed limits on Open Streets.</p><p>But when it mattered most, Banks stood in the way. He opposed a bill to ban parking at corners—daylighting—that would have made children and elders more visible at crossings. He cited parking concerns <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/22/dot-still-opposes-push-to-ban-corner-parking>according to Streetsblog NYC</a>. The debate was not about cars. It was about lives. &ldquo;The tragic loss of Imani Vance was allegedly caused by the defendant&rsquo;s reckless decision to ignore a stop sign and drive at excessive speeds,&rdquo; <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/brooklyn-driver-indicted-accused-of-deadly-hit-and-run-school-bus-crash>said the DA</a>. The corners remain blind.</p><h3 id=what-next-no-more-waiting>What Next: No More Waiting</h3><p><strong>Speed and inattention kill.</strong> Cars and SUVs are the main weapons. The city has the tools—lower speed limits, more cameras, safer crossings. But tools unused are as useless as promises unkept.</p><p><strong>Call Chris Banks. Demand daylight at every corner. Demand 20 mph limits on every street. Demand action, not words.</strong></p><p>The dead cannot speak. The living must.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
