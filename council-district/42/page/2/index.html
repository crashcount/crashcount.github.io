The impact downed the pole, which triggered another crash on the opposite side of the expressway. As the article notes, 'A truck had downed a pole, triggering another crash on the opposite side of the expressway.' One person was injured and taken to Woodhull Hospital. The sequence of collisions highlights the dangers of high-speed, multi-lane expressways and the risks posed by large vehicles losing control. Emergency crews responded quickly, but the incident left debris and disruption in its wake.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Officers, following new NYPD pursuit rules, did not chase but instead set a roadblock. According to NYPD Chief John Chell, 'We didn't pursue the vehicle, we strategically radioed ahead to shut down traffic.' The driver, Jumaane Wright, swerved toward officers, nearly striking a lieutenant, who fired a single shot. Wright crashed a mile later and died at the hospital. The Attorney General's investigation is standard for such incidents.
