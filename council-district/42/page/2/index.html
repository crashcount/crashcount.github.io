Injured: 4,728. Crashes: 7,477. Pedestrians bear the worst of it: 11 deaths, 685 hurt. SUVs and cars drive most of the harm, with 11 pedestrian deaths tied to them. Heavy vehicles add more weight to the toll. These are the numbers for Council District 42.</p><h3 id=where-the-street-breaks-you>Where the street breaks you</h3><p>Belt Parkway shows two deaths and 303 injuries. Drivers hit hard there. So does <a href=#>Pennsylvania Avenue</a> with two deaths and 158 injuries, and <a href=#>Linden Boulevard</a> with 375 injuries. One corner at 1000 Sutter Ave logged eight serious injuries. These are the repeat sites listed in city data.</p><p>The worst hours run late and after dark. Death spikes at 4 AM, 6–8 PM, and 9 PM–11 PM. The injuries never stop.</p><p>Contributing factors the city records most often: “other,” then inattention, unsafe speed, and failure to yield. The blanks and the knowns point the same way.</p><h3 id=names-turned-into-case-numbers>Names turned into case numbers</h3><p>Jan 25, 2025, Church Ave at Kings Hwy. A 30‑year‑old man, a pedestrian, was struck by a Honda sedan. Unsafe speed cited. He died. The city logged him as “Crossing Against Signal.” Only one person was dead, and it was not the driver. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open data</a> records the case as CrashID 4788144.</p><p>Jul 13, 2025, about 12:30 AM, near 395 Gateway Dr. A 21‑year‑old woman, walking off‑intersection. The car was a 2023 Genesis sedan. Police coded distraction and unsafe speed. She died there. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>Open data</a> lists CrashID 4827641.</p><p>Feb 16, 2025, before dawn on the Belt. A 41‑year‑old driver in a 2024 BMW SUV. Unsafe speed and a slick road. He was ejected. He died. The parkway kept moving. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>CrashID 4793436</a>.</p><p>Feb 27, 2025, Van Sinderen at Blake.

The city’s roll‑up ties 632 pedestrian cases to cars and SUVs, and 38 to trucks and buses. Weight meets speed. Bone loses.</p><h3 id=officials-move-but-slow>Officials move, but slow</h3><p>The Council Member for this district voted yes on a bill to tow abandoned cars within 72 hours. The law aims to clear blind spots and blocked crosswalks. It passed on Jun 30, 2025. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>Council file Int 0857-2024</a>.</p><p>The same member co‑sponsored faster pavement markings in January and voted it through in February.

Install LPIs and give walkers the first step. Use curbs and posts, not paint alone. Target speed and distraction in the fatal hours.</p><h3 id=citywide-brakes-now>Citywide brakes, now</h3><p>Speed kills more surely than anything else. A 20 MPH city default would cut bodies from the road. New York now has the power to drop speeds. The city hasn’t used it. Advocates are asking you to push. See our call: <a href=/take_action/>Take Action</a>.</p><p>The repeat offenders are a small group with an outsize toll. The state’s proposed Stop Super Speeders Act would force known speeders to use in‑car speed limiters. The data show repeat tickets link to higher risk. The bill sits in Albany. Call anyway.

A cyclist strikes. Bedford Avenue’s protected bike lane will vanish. City listens to complaints, not data. Streets stay dangerous. Cyclists and children caught in the crossfire. Policy shifts, safety left behind.</p><p class=mb3>CBS New York reported on June 14, 2025, that Mayor Eric Adams will remove three blocks of the protected bike lane on Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn after several crashes, including one involving a child exiting a school bus. The mayor cited 'community concerns' and stated, 'After several incidents—including some involving children...we decided to adjust the current design.' City Council Member Lincoln Restler criticized the move, calling it 'pure politics' and warning, 'He is going to make this area less safe for pedestrians, for cyclists.' The article highlights tension between local complaints and street safety policy. No driver error is cited; the crash involved a cyclist and a child. The decision raises questions about how New York responds to vulnerable road users and whether removing infrastructure addresses underlying dangers.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Their plan would turn Monitor Street into a cul-de-sac with a pedestrian plaza, add mid-block crossings, and close a slip lane to block cut-through traffic from the BQE. The push follows a fatal crash at Monitor and Driggs, where a driver killed 73-year-old cyclist Teddy Orzechowski. Streetsblog notes, 'Streets outside schools have higher crash and injury rates than the city average.' Most PS 110 families walk or bike, but the city has not responded to the proposal.
