Thirty-eight left with serious injuries.</strong> Over 4,300 hurt since 2022. The streets run through <a href=/neighborhood/bk0502/>East New York</a>, <a href=/neighborhood/bk0503/>New Lots</a>, <a href=/neighborhood/bk0504/>Spring Creek</a>, and more. The dead are not just numbers. They are neighbors, children, elders. <strong>Cars and SUVs did most of the killing.</strong></p><p>On January 24, a woman crossing with the signal at Pennsylvania and Blake was struck and killed by an SUV. She had the right of way. She did not make it home. The driver kept going. The crash report lists &ldquo;failure to yield right-of-way&rdquo; and &ldquo;driver inattention&rdquo; as causes (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash report</a>).</p><p>On February 27, a 26-year-old woman died as a passenger in a sedan that slammed into a parked truck on Blake Avenue. She was not the driver. She never got a second chance.</p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p><strong>Every crash leaves a hole.</strong> A mother, a daughter, a friend. The pain does not fade. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s devastating. It&rsquo;s affecting everyone in our family, especially (Ruiz&rsquo;s) mom. Maddy was her only daughter,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/15/woman-killed-car-doing-donuts-brooklyn-parking-lot-was-drivers-girlfriend/>said Ruiz&rsquo;s sister-in-law</a>. The grief is not just private. It is public. It is the cost of inaction.</p><p>On July 13, a driver doing donuts in a Gateway Plaza parking lot lost control and killed Madisyn Ruiz, 21. Her nephews were hurt. The driver told police he &ldquo;lost control when he was doing donuts with the vehicle&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/14/woman-fatally-struck-by-genesis-g80-driver-doing-donuts-in-brooklyn-plaza-parking-lot/>driver statement</a>).</p><h3 id=what-has-been-doneand-what-has-not>What Has Been Done—And What Has Not</h3><p>Council Member <strong>Chris Banks has voted for bills to clear abandoned vehicles, speed up pavement markings, and improve crash investigations</strong>. He co-sponsored bills for discounted bike share for students and seniors. He backed more speed humps near parks. These are steps. But the blood on the street says it is not enough.</p><p><strong>The most vulnerable—pedestrians, cyclists, children—are still dying.</strong> The law moves slow. The cars move fast. The dead do not get a second chance.</p><h3 id=what-comes-next>What Comes Next</h3><p><strong>This is not fate. This is policy.</strong> Every delay, every watered-down bill, every excuse, means another family grieves. <strong>Call Council Member Chris Banks. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people, not just paint and promises.</strong></p><p><strong>Do not wait for the next name to be carved into stone.
