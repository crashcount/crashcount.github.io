Fourteen people are dead. Eleven more are left with serious injuries. In just the last twelve months, seven people died and 936 were injured on these streets. The dead include a 29-year-old man, crushed by a turning box truck while crossing Hillside Avenue with the signal. A 19-year-old, thrown from his motorcycle, died on 90th Avenue. A 65-year-old man, struck by a flatbed truck on the Long Island Expressway, never made it home. These are not numbers. These are lives, ended or broken in the space of a breath.</p><h3 id=the-crashes-keep-coming>The Crashes Keep Coming</h3><p>The violence does not stop. Just last month, a sedan reversed and struck an elderly pedestrian. In December, a distracted driver killed a man crossing 263rd Street. The pattern is clear: most deaths come at the hands of cars, SUVs, and trucks. The stories repeat. A bus jumps the curb in Flushing, sending passengers flying. &ldquo;I was all the way in the back and all of a sudden the bus hit the curb, I guess, jumped the curb, I went this way and that way and banged into the side of the bus,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>said one rider</a>. Eight people were hurt. The driver had fallen asleep at the wheel. The MTA pulled him from service. The investigation continues.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-pitfalls>Leadership: Progress and Pitfalls</h3><p>Council Member Linda Lee has voted for some measures that help. She backed laws to remove abandoned vehicles, clear sightlines, and warn taxi passengers about dooring. She co-sponsored bills for discounted bike share for seniors and students. But she also supports bills that let ambulettes double-park in bus lanes, squeezing the most vulnerable at the curb and putting pedestrians and cyclists in harm’s way. No safety review was provided. The bill sits in committee. &ldquo;It must be very devastating for the people that were on the bus,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>said a witness</a>. Devastation is the rule, not the exception.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every crash is a choice made upstream. Call Council Member Linda Lee. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people outside cars. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The suit claims the redesign would "jeopardize" safety and hinder emergency access, despite DOT data showing 190 injuries and two deaths in the area since 2020. DOT says the project targets "unpredictable vehicle movements" and double parking, with design elements "found on streets across the city."
