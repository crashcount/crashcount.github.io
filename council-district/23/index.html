He does not make it to the other side. Five months later, police charge the driver who struck him. The charge is a misdemeanor. The man, 78, died in the hospital a week after the crash. His name was Jose Jimenez. The intersection is busy. The law is slow. The street is unchanged. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/21/driver-arrested-5-months-after-fatally-striking-78-year-old-man-in-queens/>Police charged him with failure to yield to a pedestrian and failure to exercise due care, both misdemeanors.</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>seven people died</strong> in District 23. <strong>Nearly a thousand were hurt</strong>. Fourteen have died since 2022. The old, the young, the ones just passing through. The numbers do not rest. They do not heal.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> Trucks and SUVs crush bodies at the curb. Sedans speed through the night. In the last three years, cars and trucks killed four pedestrians here. Two more died under the wheels of trucks and buses. One cyclist was left bleeding by a car. The numbers are not abstract. They are names erased from the block.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-pitfalls>Leadership: Promises and Pitfalls</h2><p>Council Member Linda Lee has voted for truck route redesigns, daylighting, and traffic calming near seniors—steps that clear corners and slow trucks. She voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law used to blame the dead. She co-sponsored bills for safer greenways and to move trucks off side streets. But she also backs bills that cap e-bike speeds for new riders and raise fines for sidewalk cycling—measures that burden the vulnerable and do nothing to slow the cars that kill.</p><p><strong>The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not.</strong> Cameras that catch speeders face expiration. The law moves slow. The street moves fast.</p><h2 id=what-now>What Now?</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Linda Lee. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras, not fewer. Demand streets where the old man makes it home. Do not wait for another name to be lost. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The bill, titled "A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to pedestrian crossing guidelines and right of way," lets pedestrians cross roadways at any point, even against traffic signals. It erases penalties for so-called jaywalking. Sponsors include Tiffany Cabán (primary), Lincoln Restler, Crystal Hudson, Shahana K. Hanif, Julie Won, Mercedes Narcisse, Darlene Mealy, Erik D. Bottcher, and Farah N. Louis. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor. The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable. The law marks a shift: streets are for people, not just cars.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

Council Member Tiffany Cabán led as primary sponsor, joined by dozens of co-sponsors. The law mandates daylighting—removing parking near intersections—to clear sight lines for drivers and protect people crossing. DOT must consult with safety groups, residents, and businesses, and replace truck route signage for better clarity. The law sets deadlines: initial report by November 2023, implementation by June 2024, and new signage by July 2024.
