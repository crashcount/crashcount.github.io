Fourteen people dead. Eleven left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same. In the last twelve months alone, seven lives ended on these roads. Nine hundred thirty-six people hurt. The dead include the old and the young. The living carry scars you cannot see.</p><p>Just this year, a 29-year-old man was crossing Hillside Avenue. He had the signal. A box truck turned left and crushed him. He died in the crosswalk. The cause: driver inattention and a truck too big for the street. No one can say he should have moved faster. No one can say he should have worn brighter clothes. He is dead, and the truck kept moving. <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a></p><h3 id=the-human-cost>The Human Cost</h3><p>A bus jumped the curb in Flushing. Eight people hurt. The driver said he misjudged the curb. Later, investigators believed he fell asleep at the wheel. The MTA pulled the driver from service. The pole is bent. The sidewalk is stained. The fear lingers. <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>ABC7</a></p><p>A robbery suspect on an e-bike fled police. A Lexus hit him at an intersection. He died in the street. &ldquo;He was pronounced dead at the scene, cops <a href=https://nypost.com/2025/07/12/us-news/knife-wielding-robbery-suspect-on-e-bike-hit-and-killed-by-car-during-nyc-police-chase/>said</a>.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-peril>Leadership: Progress and Peril</h3><p>Council Member Linda Lee has voted for some safety bills. She backed removing abandoned vehicles and warning decals for taxis. She co-sponsored discounted bike share for seniors and students. But she also co-sponsored bills to cap e-bike speeds and require registration—measures that shift blame and burden onto the most vulnerable, not the drivers who kill. She sponsored a bill to let ambulettes double-park in bus lanes, blocking sightlines and squeezing pedestrians. No safety review was provided. The risk grows at the curb.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every day, another family waits for a call that never should come. Call Council Member Linda Lee. Demand she fight for a 20 mph speed limit, protected bike lanes, and enforcement that targets the real danger—drivers who speed, turn blind, and never look back. Do not wait for another name on the list. Act now.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The crash happened at Northern Boulevard and East 107th Street as Diaz drove to work. Prosecutors cited Peña’s firing from the FDNY and prior legal issues to argue for remand, but the appellate court released him with minimal bail conditions.
