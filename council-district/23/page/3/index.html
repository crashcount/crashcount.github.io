In the last twelve months, <strong>eight people died</strong> and <strong>seven more were left with serious injuries</strong> on the streets of District 23. <strong>Nearly a thousand were hurt</strong>. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, parents, sons, daughters. A 29-year-old man was crushed crossing Hillside Avenue. A 78-year-old was struck at Jericho Turnpike and 91st Ave. He died a week later. The driver stayed. The man did not. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/21/driver-arrested-5-months-after-fatally-striking-78-year-old-man-in-queens/>Jimenez suffered a massive head injury and was rushed to North Shore University Hospital, cops said. He died of his injuries a week after the crash.</a></p><p><strong>Most victims are on foot. Most vehicles are cars, SUVs, or trucks.</strong> The numbers do not lie. In this district, the street is a gauntlet.</p><h3 id=what-linda-lee-has-done>What Linda Lee Has Done</h3><p>Council Member Linda Lee has voted for some safety bills. She backed the redesign of truck routes to clear sight lines and protect people crossing. She voted to end jaywalking enforcement, a law that too often blamed the dead instead of the driver. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable.</a></p><p>But Lee also sponsored a bill to cap e-bike speeds for new riders and raise fines for sidewalk riding. These laws target the vulnerable, not the reckless. They slow the cyclist, not the car. They do not stop the truck turning left. They do not daylight the corner or harden the crosswalk.</p><h3 id=the-work-left-to-do>The Work Left to Do</h3><p><strong>Crashes are not fate. They are the result of choices.</strong> The city can lower speed limits. It can redesign streets. It can keep speed cameras running. It can daylight every intersection. It can hold drivers to account. But it will not act unless pushed.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand safer streets.</strong> Demand that every bill protect the person on foot, not just the person behind the wheel. The dead cannot speak. You must.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Council Member Farah N. Louis sponsored the bill, joined by 21 co-sponsors including Williams, Hanif, and Yeger. The bill was filed at the end of session on December 31, 2023.

The law requires the Department of Transportation to 'implement daylighting at a minimum of 100 intersections a year,' meaning no parking within 15 feet of corners. High-crash intersections must be prioritized unless deemed infeasible. DOT must also install physical daylighting features, such as planters or bike corrals, where possible. Council Member Farah N. Louis sponsored the bill, joined by Brooks-Powers, Hudson, Ossé, and others. The law took effect 90 days after enactment. DOT must report annually on locations and reasons for any exceptions. This measure targets the blind spots that kill and injure pedestrians and cyclists at intersections.
