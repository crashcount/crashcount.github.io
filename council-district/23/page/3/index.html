Fourteen people are dead. Eleven more are left with serious injuries. In just the last twelve months, seven people died and 936 were injured on these streets. The dead include a 29-year-old man, crushed by a turning box truck while crossing Hillside Avenue with the signal. A 19-year-old, thrown from his motorcycle, died on 90th Avenue. A 65-year-old man, struck by a flatbed truck on the Long Island Expressway, never made it home. These are not numbers. These are lives, ended or broken in the space of a breath.</p><h3 id=the-crashes-keep-coming>The Crashes Keep Coming</h3><p>The violence does not stop. Just last month, a sedan reversed and struck an elderly pedestrian. In December, a distracted driver killed a man crossing 263rd Street. The pattern is clear: most deaths come at the hands of cars, SUVs, and trucks. The stories repeat. A bus jumps the curb in Flushing, sending passengers flying. &ldquo;I was all the way in the back and all of a sudden the bus hit the curb, I guess, jumped the curb, I went this way and that way and banged into the side of the bus,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>said one rider</a>. Eight people were hurt. The driver had fallen asleep at the wheel. The MTA pulled him from service. The investigation continues.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-pitfalls>Leadership: Progress and Pitfalls</h3><p>Council Member Linda Lee has voted for some measures that help. She backed laws to remove abandoned vehicles, clear sightlines, and warn taxi passengers about dooring. She co-sponsored bills for discounted bike share for seniors and students. But she also supports bills that let ambulettes double-park in bus lanes, squeezing the most vulnerable at the curb and putting pedestrians and cyclists in harm’s way. No safety review was provided. The bill sits in committee. &ldquo;It must be very devastating for the people that were on the bus,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>said a witness</a>. Devastation is the rule, not the exception.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every crash is a choice made upstream. Call Council Member Linda Lee. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people outside cars. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
