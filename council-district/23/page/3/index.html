Fourteen people are dead. Eleven more are left with serious injuries. In just the last twelve months, seven people died and 936 were injured on these streets. The dead include a 29-year-old man, crushed by a turning box truck while crossing Hillside Avenue with the signal. A 19-year-old, thrown from his motorcycle, died on 90th Avenue. A 65-year-old man, struck by a flatbed truck on the Long Island Expressway, never made it home. These are not numbers. These are lives, ended or broken in the space of a breath.</p><h3 id=the-crashes-keep-coming>The Crashes Keep Coming</h3><p>The violence does not stop. Just last month, a sedan reversed and struck an elderly pedestrian. In December, a distracted driver killed a man crossing 263rd Street. The pattern is clear: most deaths come at the hands of cars, SUVs, and trucks. The stories repeat. A bus jumps the curb in Flushing, sending passengers flying. &ldquo;I was all the way in the back and all of a sudden the bus hit the curb, I guess, jumped the curb, I went this way and that way and banged into the side of the bus,&rdquo; <a href=https://abc7ny.com/post/8-hurt-mta-bus-car-collide-flushing-queens/17067489/>said one rider</a>. Eight people were hurt. The driver had fallen asleep at the wheel. The MTA pulled him from service. The investigation continues.</p><h3 id=leadership-progress-and-pitfalls>Leadership: Progress and Pitfalls</h3><p>Council Member Linda Lee has voted for some measures that help. She backed laws to remove abandoned vehicles, clear sightlines, and warn taxi passengers about dooring. She co-sponsored bills for discounted bike share for seniors and students. But she also supports bills that let ambulettes double-park in bus lanes, squeezing the most vulnerable at the curb and putting pedestrians and cyclists in harm’s way. No safety review was provided. The bill sits in committee. &ldquo;It must be very devastating for the people that were on the bus,&rdquo; <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flushing-queens-mta-bus-crash/>said a witness</a>. Devastation is the rule, not the exception.</p><h3 id=the-next-step-is-yours>The Next Step Is Yours</h3><p>This is not fate. This is policy. Every crash is a choice made upstream. Call Council Member Linda Lee. Demand a citywide 20 mph speed limit. Demand real protection for people outside cars. Do not wait for another name to become a number.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The crash occurred in the dark, with no crosswalk or signal present at the location. The report states the driver was distracted, citing 'Driver Inattention/Distraction' as the primary contributing factor. The woman suffered severe bleeding from her leg but remained conscious at the scene. The driver did not stop after the collision. The pedestrian was not at an intersection and was crossing where there was no signal or crosswalk, but the police report lists driver distraction as the key factor in the crash. The focus remains on the driver's inattention and the systemic dangers faced by those crossing city streets outside of marked crossings.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

Her vehicle collided with a parked Jeep, striking the left rear bumper and damaging the Jeep’s left rear quarter panel. The report lists 'Fell Asleep' as the contributing factor. The force of the crash triggered the airbag, and the driver suffered a head injury with severe bleeding but remained conscious at the scene. No other occupants or bystanders were involved. The parked Jeep was unoccupied. The police report does not cite any victim behavior as a contributing factor.

The report states, 'A man lay in the road. Three cars struck. His chest crushed. He died there.' Another 56-year-old man, driving one of the vehicles, was injured and pinned, suffering chest injuries described as 'crush injuries.' The police report lists 'Following Too Closely' and 'Reaction to Uninvolved Vehicle' as contributing factors, along with 'Pavement Slippery.' These driver errors—specifically following too closely—are cited as direct contributors to the crash. The narrative highlights the systemic danger posed by multiple vehicles traveling straight ahead on a slick roadway, with no mention of pedestrian error as a contributing factor. The deadly sequence unfolded on a rain-slicked expressway, where human error and hazardous conditions combined with fatal results.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>

No more tickets for crossing outside crosswalks. The Department of Transportation must educate all street users on new rights and responsibilities.

A 27-year-old woman, front seat, legs crushed beneath the dash. She stayed awake. Could feel it all. Speed too fast. No one walked away unchanged.' The crash left the 27-year-old front passenger trapped with severe crush injuries to her lower legs. A 41-year-old driver reported pain across his body. Multiple others were involved, including a child, but their injuries were unspecified. The police report lists 'Unsafe Speed' as the contributing factor. The data shows all drivers were licensed and traveling straight ahead. The violence of speed left lasting harm.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
