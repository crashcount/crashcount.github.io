He does not make it to the other side. Five months later, police charge the driver who struck him. The charge is a misdemeanor. The man, 78, died in the hospital a week after the crash. His name was Jose Jimenez. The intersection is busy. The law is slow. The street is unchanged. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/21/driver-arrested-5-months-after-fatally-striking-78-year-old-man-in-queens/>Police charged him with failure to yield to a pedestrian and failure to exercise due care, both misdemeanors.</a></p><p>In the last twelve months, <strong>seven people died</strong> in District 23. <strong>Nearly a thousand were hurt</strong>. Fourteen have died since 2022. The old, the young, the ones just passing through. The numbers do not rest. They do not heal.</p><h2 id=who-pays-the-price>Who Pays the Price?</h2><p><strong>Pedestrians and cyclists take the brunt.</strong> Trucks and SUVs crush bodies at the curb. Sedans speed through the night. In the last three years, cars and trucks killed four pedestrians here. Two more died under the wheels of trucks and buses. One cyclist was left bleeding by a car. The numbers are not abstract. They are names erased from the block.</p><h2 id=leadership-promises-and-pitfalls>Leadership: Promises and Pitfalls</h2><p>Council Member Linda Lee has voted for truck route redesigns, daylighting, and traffic calming near seniors—steps that clear corners and slow trucks. She voted to legalize jaywalking, ending a law used to blame the dead. She co-sponsored bills for safer greenways and to move trucks off side streets. But she also backs bills that cap e-bike speeds for new riders and raise fines for sidewalk cycling—measures that burden the vulnerable and do nothing to slow the cars that kill.</p><p><strong>The city can lower speed limits to 20 mph. It has not.</strong> Cameras that catch speeders face expiration. The law moves slow. The street moves fast.</p><h2 id=what-now>What Now?</h2><p><strong>This is not fate. It is policy.</strong> Call Council Member Linda Lee. Demand a 20 mph speed limit. Demand more cameras, not fewer. Demand streets where the old man makes it home. Do not wait for another name to be lost. <a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The law, sponsored by Gale A. Brewer with co-sponsors including Erik D. Bottcher, Lincoln Restler, and others, amends the city code to require the Department of Transportation to report on vehicles with license plates unreadable by photo violation monitoring systems. The law’s title states it is 'in relation to reporting on motor vehicles with license plates that are unreadable by photo violation monitoring systems.' DOT must post quarterly reports showing the time, location, and reasons plates evade cameras—whether by concealment, distortion, or missing tags. The law aims to expose drivers who dodge automated enforcement, shining light on a loophole that puts pedestrians and cyclists at risk. The reports must be public and sent to the Mayor and Council Speaker.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill moved through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, passing on October 19, 2023, and became law on November 19, 2023. The law states: 'The department shall prioritize and promote...the safety of all street users...and improving equity in infrastructure investment.' Sponsored by Kevin C. Riley (primary), with Brooks-Powers, Narcisse, Hanif, Brewer, Restler, and Rivera as co-sponsors, the bill demands DOT report, by neighborhood, on safety infrastructure investment, crash rates, and demographics. It shines a light on which districts get safety upgrades and which are left exposed. The roadmap aims to close the gap for underserved areas, forcing transparency and accountability for every dollar spent on street safety.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The bill came through the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, first introduced April 28, 2022. The law's title: 'A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to a citywide greenway plan.' Council Member Selvena N. Brooks-Powers sponsored the bill, joined by dozens of co-sponsors including Rivera, Hudson, and others. The Council voted overwhelmingly in favor on October 27, 2022. The law orders the Department of Transportation and Parks to identify, map, and report on greenways, and to consult with community boards. Proposals for new greenway segments or repairs must be presented to affected communities within 60 days. The mayor returned the bill unsigned, but it became law. The measure compels the city to plan and maintain safe routes for non-drivers, with regular public reporting and accountability.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The measure, handled by the Transportation Committee, allows speed cameras to operate 24/7. The matter summary: 'The City Council approved Albany's extension and expansion of New York's speed camera program, allowing cameras to operate 24/7, but not before several council members voiced opposition.' Chairwoman Selvena Brooks-Powers urged action, saying, 'We must use all the tools at our disposal.' Council Members Joan Ariola, Vickie Paladino, and David Carr opposed, calling cameras a financial burden. Eric Dinowitz defended the program: 'If you don't want a speeding ticket, don't speed.'
