In the last twelve months, <strong>eight people died</strong> and <strong>seven more were left with serious injuries</strong> on the streets of District 23. <strong>Nearly a thousand were hurt</strong>. The dead are not numbers. They are neighbors, parents, sons, daughters. A 29-year-old man was crushed crossing Hillside Avenue. A 78-year-old was struck at Jericho Turnpike and 91st Ave. He died a week later. The driver stayed. The man did not. <a href=https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/21/driver-arrested-5-months-after-fatally-striking-78-year-old-man-in-queens/>Jimenez suffered a massive head injury and was rushed to North Shore University Hospital, cops said. He died of his injuries a week after the crash.</a></p><p><strong>Most victims are on foot. Most vehicles are cars, SUVs, or trucks.</strong> The numbers do not lie. In this district, the street is a gauntlet.</p><h3 id=what-linda-lee-has-done>What Linda Lee Has Done</h3><p>Council Member Linda Lee has voted for some safety bills. She backed the redesign of truck routes to clear sight lines and protect people crossing. She voted to end jaywalking enforcement, a law that too often blamed the dead instead of the driver. <a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>The law requires the Department of Transportation to educate all road users about these new rights. By ending jaywalking enforcement, the city removes a tool often used to blame victims and target the vulnerable.</a></p><p>But Lee also sponsored a bill to cap e-bike speeds for new riders and raise fines for sidewalk riding. These laws target the vulnerable, not the reckless. They slow the cyclist, not the car. They do not stop the truck turning left. They do not daylight the corner or harden the crosswalk.</p><h3 id=the-work-left-to-do>The Work Left to Do</h3><p><strong>Crashes are not fate. They are the result of choices.</strong> The city can lower speed limits. It can redesign streets. It can keep speed cameras running. It can daylight every intersection. It can hold drivers to account. But it will not act unless pushed.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand safer streets.</strong> Demand that every bill protect the person on foot, not just the person behind the wheel. The dead cannot speak. You must.</p><p><a href=../../take_action/>Take action now.</a></p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

The incident occurred off the roadway, with the pedestrian described as 'not in roadway' and 'not at intersection.' The police report states, 'Two flatbeds passed. One did not see. The right front bumper struck his head.' The victim suffered fatal head injuries and died at the scene. The primary contributing factor cited in the police report is 'Driver Inattention/Distraction.' No driver errors beyond inattention are listed. The report does not cite any pedestrian behavior as a contributing factor. The focus remains on the truck driver's failure to notice the man lying off the road, resulting in a fatal collision.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-database mr2"></i>
