On December 24, 2024, a 56‑year‑old man listed as a pedestrian was killed in a multi‑vehicle crash on the Clearview; another driver was injured. The record cites “reaction to uninvolved vehicle” and “pavement slippery” as factors, and lists a Chevy and Mercedes SUVs and a Hyundai sedan among the vehicles, all going northbound (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>dataset</a>).</p><p>A Bayside man also drove the wrong way on the Clearview Expressway in 2023, hitting multiple cars. At sentencing, Queens DA Melinda Katz said, “Joseph Lee terrorized other drivers as he purposefully drove the wrong way on a busy Queens highway and crashed into multiple cars.” She added, “Two motorists were badly hurt and still have not fully recovered.” Lee told police, “I entered the Clearview Expressway in the wrong direction because I wanted to hurt people and I felt ‘liberated’ by what I had done,” and to a victim, “You want to fight?” He was convicted and got eight years, <a href=https://qns.com/2025/08/bayside-man-sentenced-injuring-drivers-clearview-expressway/>amNY reported</a>.</p><h3 id=nights-take-people>Nights take people</h3><p>The hours tell on us. Injuries pile up after dark. From midnight to 3 a.m., there were 223 injuries and four deaths. At 5 a.m., two more deaths. At the evening rush, 5–6 p.m., two more deaths. The fatal strike on Union Turnpike hit at 8:26 p.m., a time band with another recorded death in this district’s <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>hourly distribution</a>.</p><p>Trucks do outsized harm to people on foot here. Of pedestrian cases where the striking vehicle is known, sedans and SUVs account for most injuries and deaths, but trucks are tied to <strong>2 pedestrian deaths</strong> out of just 10 recorded truck‑pedestrian cases. The open data rollup shows trucks and buses behind a smaller share of crashes, but a heavier share of the body count (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><h3 id=corners-that-dont-forgive>Corners that don’t forgive</h3><p>Hillside Avenue has one death and 77 injuries. Union Turnpike has two deaths and 59 injuries. The <strong>Long Island Expressway</strong> frontage and ramps show one death and 435 injuries. These are the district’s repeat sites, per <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>top intersections</a>.</p><p>On January 31, at Hillside Avenue and 212th Street, a 29‑year‑old man crossing with the signal was killed by a left‑turning box truck. The record lists “driver inattention/distraction” and “oversized vehicle” as contributing factors (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>crash file</a>).</p><h3 id=what-this-district-can-do-tomorrow>What this district can do tomorrow</h3><ul><li>Daylight the corners on Hillside and Union Turnpike. Clear the sightlines. Harden left turns where trucks sweep across the crosswalks.</li><li>Add leading pedestrian intervals at Hillside/212th and other high‑injury signals. Give walkers the head start.</li><li>Target the night hours. Enforce at the Clearview access points and Union Turnpike from dusk to 3 a.m. The data shows when people die.</li></ul><h3 id=what-the-city-must-do-next>What the city must do next</h3><p>Speed is the common thread. Two citywide steps can cut it now:</p><ul><li>Lower the default speed limit on residential streets. The city has the power; advocates are already pushing for it. Our own call to action lays out the path and the numbers behind it. Read it and act: <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>.</li><li>Stop the worst repeat offenders with intelligent speed assistance. The policy would require limiters for drivers who rack up violations; it targets the small share doing outsized harm. The case is made here: <a href=../../take_action/>Take Action</a>.</li></ul><p>The names are not in the spreadsheets. The loss is. Use the tools we have. Slow the cars. Protect the crosswalk. Go home alive.</p></div><h3 class="fw6 db-l dn mt4 mb2">Citations</h3><details class="mt4 citation-details"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center dn-l"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>
