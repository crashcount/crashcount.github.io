A dump truck turns. He is dead before sunrise. The driver leaves. No arrest. No answers. <a href=https://gothamist.com/news/dump-truck-driver-fatally-strikes-pedestrian-in-williamsburg-brooklyn-nypd-says>Police said the driver, a 49-year-old man, left the scene. No arrests have been announced.</a></p><p>In the last year, <strong>four people died</strong> on District 34 streets. <strong>Nine more suffered serious injuries.</strong> Nearly 700 were hurt. The numbers do not bleed, but the people do. Pedestrians, cyclists, children. Trucks and SUVs crush, sedans strike, bikes collide. The city counts the bodies. The street stays the same.</p><h2 id=leadership-bills-votes-and-the-slow-march>Leadership: Bills, Votes, and the Slow March</h2><p>Council Member <strong>Jennifer Gutiérrez</strong> has signed her name to safety. She co-sponsored the SAFE Streets Act, pushed for protected bike lanes, and backed the bill to ban parking near crosswalks—daylighting corners so drivers can see children before it is too late. She voted to end jaywalking tickets, shifting blame off the dead and onto the street itself. She stood with neighbors for a 20 mph speed limit in Greenpoint and Williamsburg, after years of carnage. But the pace is slow. The danger is not.</p><p>When the city closed a deadly Bushwick intersection, Gutiérrez supported the redesign. The plan bans cars from a crash hotspot, removes parking at corners, and builds concrete for feet, not wheels. DOT says it could cut deaths by up to 45% for pedestrians. But the street was only fixed after a man died. <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/04/28/city-to-fix-dangerous-bushwick-intersection-where-driver-killed-motorcyclist>The intersection, described as a &lsquo;crash hotspot&rsquo; with 39 incidents since 2020, will see expanded pedestrian space and improved safety.</a></p><h2 id=the-next-fight-speed-cameras-and-relentless-pressure>The Next Fight: Speed, Cameras, and Relentless Pressure</h2><p><strong>Speed kills.</strong> The city has the power to lower limits. It has the tools—speed cameras, daylighted corners, protected lanes. What it lacks is urgency. Every day of delay is another family broken. The numbers are not fate. They are choices.</p><p><strong>Call your council member. Demand 20 mph limits. Demand cameras that never sleep. Demand streets for people, not trucks.</strong></p><p>Do not wait for the next siren.</p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Change comes after a fatality.</p><p class=mb3>On April 28, 2025, the Department of Transportation (DOT) announced a street redesign for Scott Avenue in Bushwick, Brooklyn, following a fatal crash that killed motorcyclist Philippe Haussmann last August. The plan, supported by Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez and Transportation Alternatives, bans cars on a short stretch between Flushing and Johnson Avenues and removes parking at several corners for better visibility—a process known as daylighting. DOT will also narrow Scott Avenue further south and build a concrete pedestrian peninsula at Troutman Street, banning right turns onto Scott. The intersection, described as a 'crash hotspot' with 39 incidents since 2020, will see expanded pedestrian space and improved safety. Gutierrez noted increased foot traffic and little negative feedback. DOT claims the redesign can reduce deaths and serious injuries by up to 45 percent for pedestrians. Advocates say the changes will save lives.</p><hr class=mv3><ul class="list pl0 ma0 w-100"><li class="flex items-start mb2"><i class="bi bi-newspaper mr2"></i>

The resolution, introduced April 24, 2025, calls for 'requiring the installation of intelligent speed assistance devices for repeated violation of maximum speed limits.' Council Member Lincoln Restler leads, joined by Salaam, Hanif, Gutiérrez, Banks, and Brannan. The bill would force drivers with eleven or more points in eighteen months, or six speed/red light camera tickets in a year, to install speed-limiting tech. The Council cites data: 265 killed, 52,949 injured on city streets in 2023. The measure aims to put a brake on reckless driving. The committee has not yet advanced the resolution.

The police report notes the cyclist was not wearing a helmet, but this is mentioned only after the driver errors that led to the crash.

The measure, supported by 40 groups and nearly all local elected officials, marks the first neighborhood-wide slow zone request since the passage of Sammy's Law. The board's action follows letters from Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, Council Member Jennifer Gutierrez, and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velazquez to DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. They cited CB1's high fatality rate—3.27 deaths per 10,000 residents, above the city average. The board's vote was contentious, with pro-driving members opposing the change. DOT spokesperson Mona Bruno acknowledged the support and promised more information on slow zones for outer boroughs. Council Member Lincoln Restler later joined the call for lower speeds.
