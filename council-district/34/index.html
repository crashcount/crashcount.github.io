These are not just numbers—they are bodies on the pavement and families left with empty chairs. In the last twelve months alone, six more people died. Twelve were left with injuries so severe they may never walk the same again.</p><p>Just this spring, a 42-year-old man was killed crossing Withers Street with the signal. A dump truck turned left and crushed him (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>). He was doing everything right. The truck kept going. The city kept moving.</p><h3 id=the-usual-suspects>The Usual Suspects</h3><p><strong>Cars and trucks do most of the killing.</strong> Out of all pedestrian injuries and deaths, sedans and SUVs are responsible for the largest share—<strong>369 incidents</strong>. Trucks and buses follow, with <strong>40 more</strong>. Motorcycles, mopeds, and bikes add to the toll, but the real danger comes on four wheels or more (<a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95>NYC Open Data</a>).</p><p>The pattern is old. The pain is fresh. A cyclist was struck by a turning driver on McGuinness Boulevard just days ago. The bike lane was only paint. The city had promised more. &ldquo;The fact is that this wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem if Mayor Adams had just done what he had promised to do, which was, make all of McGuinness safe. The road diet works where it&rsquo;s been installed and it&rsquo;s needed for the entire corridor before this happens again,&rdquo; said <a href=https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/07/20/cyclist-badly-hurt-on-segment-of-mcguinness-blvd-that-mayor-adams-refused-to-make-safe>Kevin LaCherra</a>.</p><h3 id=leadership-promises-and-pressure>Leadership: Promises and Pressure</h3><p><strong>Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez has co-sponsored a bill to ban parking near crosswalks</strong>—a move to daylight intersections and save lives (<a href=https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/Legislation.aspx>NYC Council – Legistar</a>). The bill would force the city to clear at least 1,000 crosswalks a year. It sits in committee. The city waits. The dead do not.</p><p><strong>The work is not done.</strong> Every delay is another risk. Every watered-down promise is another family shattered. The city can move faster. The council can demand more. The mayor can act. But only if you make them.</p><h3 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h3><p><strong>Do not wait for another name on the list.</strong> Call Council Member Gutiérrez. Demand the passage and funding of the daylighting bill. Demand protected bike lanes, not just paint. Demand a city where crossing the street is not a gamble with your life.</p><p><strong>If you do nothing, nothing will change.</strong></p></div><section id=faq class=mt3><h2 class="f3 fw7 mb3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="mb3 faq-item"><summary class="pointer fw6 flex items-center"><span class="arrow-toggle f4 mr2">▸</span>

Their plan would turn Monitor Street into a cul-de-sac with a pedestrian plaza, add mid-block crossings, and close a slip lane to block cut-through traffic from the BQE. The push follows a fatal crash at Monitor and Driggs, where a driver killed 73-year-old cyclist Teddy Orzechowski. Streetsblog notes, 'Streets outside schools have higher crash and injury rates than the city average.' Most PS 110 families walk or bike, but the city has not responded to the proposal.

DOT’s Chris Brunson said, “The narrower street width for vehicles will de-incentivize double parking on the corridor.” The redesign removes a travel lane, adds a protected bike lane, and aims to curb driver behavior that leads to crashes. Between 2022 and 2024, 165 crashes on this mile-long stretch caused one death and injured 15 cyclists and 23 pedestrians. Most pedestrian injuries happened while crossing with the light, showing drivers failed to yield.

DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said, "Brooklyn and Queens deserve a Conduit Boulevard that improves daily life, not a roadway that puts pedestrians and drivers at risk and physically divides entire neighborhoods."
